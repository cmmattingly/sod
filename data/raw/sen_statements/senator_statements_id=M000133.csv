Markey (D-Mass.) and members of the Massachusetts delegation led by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter asking the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to use their administrative authorities to ensure that the Emergency Food and Shelter Program (EFSP) is awarding funds as quickly as possible, and with as little bureaucratic delay as possible, to Massachusetts entities that are providing humanitarian aid to migrants flown to Martha’s Vineyard and to others who have recently arrived in the Boston area.“We would like to request that you use your administrative authorities to ensure that FEMA’s EFSP is awarding funds as quickly as possible, and with as little bureaucratic delay as possible, to Massachusetts entities providing important assistance to migrants,” wrote the lawmakers.Joining Senator Markey in signing the letter were Representatives Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), Katherine Clark (D-Mass.), Stephen F. Lynch (D-Mass.), James P. McGovern (D-Mass.), Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.), Lori Trahan (D-Mass.), and William Keating (D-Mass.).On September 14, nearly 50 Venezuelan migrants were flown to Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts. With no advance notice of the arrivals, the community scrambled to provide assistance. Although Massachusetts has proved itself fully capable of providing aid to these families in need, the lawmakers have received multiple inquiries from organizations requesting financial assistance from the federal government. This follows a recent uptick in predominantly Haitian migrants who have arrived in Boston in recent months.The lawmakers are asking FEMA and DHS to use their administrative authorities to ensure that EFSP is awarding funds as quickly as possible, and with as little bureaucratic delay as possible, to Massachusetts entities that are providing humanitarian aid to migrants. “Moreover, we ask that if Massachusetts entities seek for their humanitarian work other sources of funding that are within your purview, you work to ensure that this assistance is unlocked and disbursed as expeditiously as possible,” concluded the lawmakers.###"

Markey (D-Mass.) joined Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Chairwoman of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee with oversight over federal elections, in introducing two pieces of legislation to make it easier for Americans to register to vote and to know their registration status. The Same Day Voter Registration Act would require states to offer same day registration at polling locations on Election Day and during early voting. The Stop Automatically Voiding Eligible Voters Off Their Enlisted Rolls in States (SAVE VOTERS) Act would prohibit states from removing people from their voting rolls unless the state has obtained objective, reliable evidence that a voter is ineligible to vote and establishes notification requirements once a voter is removed. The Same Day Voter Registration Act would: Joining Senator Markey in cosponsoring the Same Day Voter Registration Act are Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Angus King (I-ME), and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)The SAVE VOTERS Act would:In addition to Senator Markey, the Save Voters Act is cosponsored by Senators Wyden, Merkley, Warren, Casey, Smith, Van Hollen, Blumenthal, Gillibrand, Sanders, Hirono, Booker, Murphy, Kaine, Menendez, and King.Both bills are endorsed by Democracy 21, Transparency International U.S., End Citizens United/Let America Vote Action Fund, Common Cause, Public Citizen, People for the American Way, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, 20/20 Vision DC, Voices for Progress, and League of Women Voters.###"

Markey (D-Mass.) joined five of his colleagues led by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in sending a letter to Heartbeat International, an anti-abortion organization that supports thousands of crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) across the country, calling on the organization to answer a series of questions about its collection and use  of women’s personal data, including sensitive health care information. “Heartbeat International – which is explicitly opposed to abortion rights – appears to be in a position to collect a significant amount of personal information from women about their pregnancies and potential plans for managing their care, but it is not under any legal obligation to maintain the confidentiality of this information, or keep it out of the hands of abortion bounty hunters,” wrote the lawmakers.Heartbeat International’s vision “is to make abortion unwanted today and unthinkable for future generations.” To accomplish that goal, the organization has invested in a data collection system to keep track of personal information, including individuals’ names, addresses, phone numbers, and reproductive health information. CPCs and similar organizations are not legitimate medical facilities and therefore are not subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), raising significant privacy concerns.“We fear that, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision that stripped women of their right to an abortion, this information may be used to put women’s health and freedom to choose in jeopardy, and to put them and their health care providers at risk of criminal penalties,” wrote the lawmakers.Following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and Senator Graham’s (R-S.C.) introduction of a national abortion ban, the lawmakers expressed concern about the sensitive health information Heartbeat International and its affiliate CPCs collect from women who believe they can seek legitimate abortion and reproductive health care services at these facilities. They are calling on Heartbeat International to answer a number of questions about the data and information they collect by October 3, 2022.In addition to Senator Markey, the letter was also signed by Senators Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).###"

Markey (D-Mass.) today joined his colleagues led by Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) in a letter to President Biden, urging him to nominate a Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner to serve at the Social Security Administration. The Social Security Administration has been without permanent leadership for over a year, making it difficult to address longstanding challenges that the agency faces in providing service to Americans who rely on these benefits.“Today Social Security covers over 179 million workers, and over 70 million people receive monthly Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits.  More than one out of every six U.S. residents collects Social Security benefits and older Americans make up about four out of every five beneficiaries,"" the Senators wrote. ""Recent U.S. Census Bureau reports show that Social Security provides over half of the income for older adults, and nearly all of their income for one in four older adults.  Social Security continues to be one of the largest anti-poverty programs in the country, lifting over 22 million Americans out of poverty.”“The Social Security Commissioner is directly responsible for all programs administered by the agency, including state-administered programs directed by SSA. Nominating and confirming a permanent Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner would provide accountable leadership to the agency and reassure the public of SSA’s commitment to supporting the vulnerable populations that rely on its programs,” they continued. “The Social Security Administration’s longstanding labor-management problems worsened under the prior Administration. Under prior leadership, SSA was among the most hostile agencies in the federal government in the way it chose to implement the since-repealed anti-union executive orders from 2018,"" the Senators noted.

https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-and-blumenthal-statement-on-new-dot-airline-fee-transparency-rule,"Washington (September 27, 2022) — Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), members of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, issued the following joint statement after the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a new proposed rule to require airlines to disclose fees upfront:“By requiring airlines to disclose fees upfront, DOT has taken an important step for consumer transparency. The traveling public has been nickel-and-dimed by airlines at every step by an often obscured and seemingly ever-growing list of fees, and this new proposed rule will help bring much-needed clarity to what airlines are charging. Still, more work is needed to ensure that consumers stop being charged exorbitant fees for everyday needs like sitting next to their children, changing or canceling their flight, or checked or carry-on baggage. Congress must pass the Forbidding Airlines from Imposing Ridiculous (FAIR) Fees Act and the Airline Passengers’ Bill of Rights to prohibit these predatory fees altogether and restore sanity to the skies.”  ###"
https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-blumenthal-colleagues-demand-mandt-bank-compensate-customers-affected-by-conversion-failures,"Washington (September 23, 2022) — Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) today joined his colleagues led by Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) in sending a letter to M&T Bank urging the company to financially compensate customers who were affected by conversion failures during the transition of People’s United Bank accounts to M&T accounts.“We write to request that M&T Bank commit to financially compensate all customers who incurred fees as a result of missed credit card, utility, or other payments, due to M&T Bank’s mishandling of the acquisition of People’s United Bank,” the Senators wrote. “Additionally, all customers who were unable to access their funds during the conversion should receive some appropriate financial remuneration for the inconvenience, as well as an apology.”Since the conversion at the beginning of September, new M&T customers have complained that they are not able to access their accounts, have endured long wait times and delays in payment processing, and did not receive adequate customer support. The Senators’ express deep concern about these issues and urge M&T to quickly resolve the complications.“It is imperative that M&T act swiftly to comply with all laws, regulations, and regulatory expectations relied on during the acquisition approval process and that all customers be fairly compensated if they were negatively impacted as a result of M&T’s mishandling of the merger with People’s United Bank,” the Senators write.The Federal Reserve approved M&T Bank’s acquisition of Bridgeport-based People’s United Financial, Inc. and People’s United Bank in May of 2022. Under the terms of the acquisition, M&T committed to having 1,000 employees in Bridgeport. Last week, the failed management of the conversion and lack of access to customer support for individuals and businesses has led Blumenthal to call on the Federal Reserve and CFBP to investigate this issue.Joining Sentor Markey in signing the letter led by Senator Blumenthal are Senators Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).  M&T has bank locations in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont.A full copy of the letter can be found below.Dear Mr. Jones,We write to request that M&T Bank commit to financially compensate all customers who incurred fees as a result of missed credit card, utility, or other payments, due to M&T Bank’s mishandling of the acquisition of People’s United Bank. Additionally, all customers who were unable to access their funds during the conversion should receive some appropriate financial remuneration for the inconvenience, as well as an apology. We are profoundly troubled that this acquisition lacked sufficient coordination and resulted in complications for many individuals and businesses accessing their accounts and their funds.These M&T and People’s United conversion failures may have violated consumer and financial compliance laws and regulations and further investigation into the matter will bring further clarity to the situation to help ensure future and continued compliance. Regardless, the execution of the acquisition was not in accordance with regulatory expectations when approvals were granted by the Federal Reserve and the Connecticut Department of Banking. Through the mismanagement of the conversion of People’s United Bank accounts to M&T accounts, existing customers, individuals and businesses, endured hours long wait times and delays in payment processing, were denied access to their accounts and funds, and did not receive adequate customer support. This demonstrates a severe lack of due diligence in the planning and a lack of resources devoted to the implementation of the acquisition. While the execution of this merger began nearly two weeks ago, customers continue to be faced with complications that have arisen as a direct result of the problems encountered during the conversion process. It is imperative that M&T act swiftly to comply with all laws, regulations, and regulatory expectations relied on during the acquisition approval process and that all customers be fairly compensated if they were negatively impacted as a result of M&T’s mishandling of the merger with People’s United Bank.###"

Markey (D-Mass.) today joined his colleagues led by Senator Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) in sending a letter to Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressing concerns regarding the impact that the recently released proposal to change the federal permitting process for fossil fuel projects will have on communities of color, frontline communities and other disadvantaged communities. The letter was also signed by Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.).“For many years, siting decisions for big infrastructure projects have essentially prioritized the perceived societal benefits of fossil energy over the very real costs disproportionately borne by communities of color, low-income communities, and others who have traditionally been marginalized,” wrote the Senators. “The result has been the destruction of homes and neighborhoods, lost wealth in those communities, long-lasting health consequences, and premature deaths. Environmental justice advocates are pushing policymakers to remedy our nation’s failure to take the input of environmental justice communities more seriously, but there is far more work for us to do.”The Senators’ letter notes the environmental justice community’s concerns over the proposed reforms and the implications of these permits:“We also share the environmental justice community’s concerns that the proposed reforms could reduce the ability of affected stakeholders and state, federal, and tribal governments from thoroughly analyzing proposed projects and undermine judicial review,” they continued. “Given our country’s history of environmental inequity, any changes to the permitting processes should strengthen—not steamroll over—public participation and add protections for frontline communities.”The Senators concluded by highlighting that such important issues deserve robust debate and consideration separate from the urgent need to pass legislation keeping the government open before September 30th.“The environmental justice community is warranted in their belief that altering policies that shape how energy projects are considered will have profound implications for their health, prosperity, well-being, and overall quality of life. We agree, and believe such important issues should be examined through detailed committee consideration and a robust floor debate separate from the urgent need to see that the government stays open,” they conclude.Full text of the letter can be found here and follows below:Dear Leader Schumer,We have heard extensive concerns from the environmental justice community regarding the proposed permitting reforms and are writing to convey the importance of those concerns, and to let you know that we share them.For many years, siting decisions for big infrastructure projects have essentially prioritized the perceived societal benefits of fossil energy over the very real costs disproportionately borne by communities of color, low-income communities, and others who have traditionally been marginalized. The result has been the destruction of homes and neighborhoods, lost wealth in those communities, long-lasting health consequences, and premature deaths. Environmental justice advocates are pushing policymakers to remedy our nation’s failure to take the input of environmental justice communities more seriously, but there is far more work for us to do. We share the concerns of frontline communities and communities of color that the proposed permitting reforms take us in the wrong direction.Congressional approval of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, weakening of the National Environmental Policy Act, and weakening of state’s ability to protect water quality under the Clean Water Act will limit public input and lead to additional pollution, disproportionately impacting people who are already facing direct harm. We also share the environmental justice community’s concerns that the proposed reforms could reduce the ability of affected stakeholders and state, federal, and tribal governments from thoroughly analyzing proposed projects and undermine judicial review. Given our country’s history of environmental inequity, any changes to the permitting processes should strengthen—not steamroll over—public participation and add protections for frontline communities.In this Congress, we have made important investments to elevate environmental justice communities, including significantly increasing funding to remediate past harms and resources to ensure that environmental justice communities can share in the benefits from a Just Transition to renewable energy.  In addition to funding, however, transparency and the ability for potentially impacted communities to have prior, informed and meaningful participation and consideration are foundational to providing environmental justice. A number of the proposed permitting reforms would do the exact opposite.  The environmental justice community is warranted in their belief that altering policies that shape how energy projects are considered will have profound implications for their health, prosperity, well-being, and overall quality of life. We agree, and believe such important issues should be examined through detailed committee consideration and a robust floor debate separate from the urgent need to see that the government stays open.We believe our caucus broadly shares the goal of advancing climate justice by remedying past damage done to frontline and low-income communities, and making sure we don’t inflict such damage in the future. We look forward to working with leadership and committees of jurisdiction, and the environmental justice community on these important civil rights priorities.###"

Markey (D-Mass.) today joined Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration with oversight over federal elections, and Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Chair of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, in introducing comprehensive legislation to address the rise in threats targeting election workers. The Election Worker Protection Act would provide states with the resources to recruit and train election workers and ensure these workers’ safety, while also instituting federal safeguards to shield election workers from intimidation and threats. The bill includes provisions that were developed with input from election officials, as well as provisions from the Freedom to Vote Act, voting rights legislation led by Senator Klobuchar and supported by all Democratic Senators.The Election Worker Protection Act has received the support of a bipartisan group of current and former election officials, including former Republican Philadelphia City Commissioner Al Schmidt, who testified before the Rules Committee last year about the threats he and his family received.“As a Philadelphia City Commissioner during the 2020 elections, my family and I received death threats simply for fulfilling my duty to certify legitimate election results,” said Schmidt. “I know that election workers across our country are facing similar harassment and intimidation on a daily basis from bad faith actors seeking to delegitimize our elections. That’s why it’s critical that Congress pass this commonsense legislation to protect election officials and safeguard our democratic processes.”A group of 15 Secretaries of State, led by Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, joined a letter supporting the Election Worker Protection Act and calling on Congress to take action to protect election workers.“Additional action is needed at the federal level to ensure that all election workers have the necessary support and protection to do their jobs. The Election Worker Protection Act makes clear that these attacks on election workers will not be tolerated,” wrote the Secretaries. “We know what tools are needed to protect election workers, and we look forward to working with Congress to advance this legislation.”The Election Worker Protection Act would: Joining Senator Markey in cosponsoring the Election Worker Protection Act are Senators Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Ct.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Angus King (I-Maine), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Tina Smith (D-M.N.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), and Mark Warner (D-Va.).

Markey (D-Mass.) joined Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) in introducing the Non-Recognition of Russian Annexation of Ukrainian Territory Act. The bill would require U.S. policy to not recognize any Russian claim of sovereignty over any portion of the internationally recognized territory of Ukraine and prohibit any federal department or agency from taking any action or extending any assistance that implies recognition of Russian claims over Ukraine.On Tuesday, President Vladimir Putin announced plans to hold referendums in four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine with the goal of annexing these regions into the Russian Federation. Announcing annexation is intended to paint Ukrainian efforts to restore its territorial integrity as aggressive actions against the Russian Federation so as to depress the West’s assistance to Ukraine.Joining Senator Markey in cosponsoring the Non-Recognition of Russian Annexation of Ukrainian Territory Act are Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Angus King (I-Maine), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), and John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.).###"

Markey (D-Mass.) today joined his colleagues led by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in sending a letter to President Biden asking to waive any local cost-share for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) aid to Puerto Rico. On September 18, 2022, Hurricane Fiona made landfall in Puerto Rico, cutting off power to the entire island and leaving many areas under water. That same day, President Biden approved an emergency declaration to authorize the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and FEMA to work in coordination on disaster relief efforts. Public Assistance grants issued by FEMA come with a requirement that states and territories shoulder a share of the cost of recovery.  While these cost-share requirements can be adjusted to lighten the state or territory’s burden, this has not yet been done for Puerto Rico. “In light of the continued concerning news about the devastation the hurricane has wrought on the island, which has prompted Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi to announce his request for a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto Rico’s municipalities, as well as the ongoing economic challenges faced by the island, we write to urge you to waive the local cost-sharing requirements by setting the federal cost-share at 100% for Public Assistance grants issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to Puerto Rico,” wrote the lawmakers.Joining Senator Markey in signing the letter led by Senator Warren are Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Edward J.

In their letter, the Senators raise strong concerns that despite statutory limitations on U.S. security assistance to the country, Azerbaijan is benefitting from security assistance as it continues to attack Armenia and ethnic Armenians.“In light of Azerbaijan’s recent and repeated acts of aggression toward Armenia, the United States should cease providing any security assistance to Azerbaijan until Armenia and Azerbaijan reach a permanent and lasting resolution that respects the will of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh,” the Senators wrote to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III. “This requires swift U.S. action to ensure we do not aid and abet Azerbaijan in sparking another large-scale conflagration. Azerbaijan must face the reality that there will never be a military solution that leads to peace and stability in Nagorno-Karabakh.”In their letter, the Senators asked if the Departments of State and Defense intend to continue providing security assistance to Azerbaijan and whether they conducted a recent assessment to verify that the ongoing assistance will not undermine or hamper ongoing efforts to negotiate a peaceful settlement between Armenia and Azerbaijan, or be used for offensive purposes against Armenia. The Senators also asked if either Department assessed whether any units that have received U.S. security assistance have engaged in the recent fighting. ###"

This year’s anniversary comes as Category 1 Hurricane Fiona made landfall in the Caribbean, devastating Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic where widespread flooding and infrastructure damage has been already reported. There are currently hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans without power and water service, in addition to residents who have lost their homes as a result of the storm.Hurricane Maria is the second deadliest storm in United States history, with the official death toll standing at 2,975 victims, while some academic experts estimate the toll to be as high as 4,645. It is also the third most costly tropical cyclone in our country’s history, with damages estimated to have cost more than $98 billion. This storm resulted in the complete collapse of Puerto Rico’s electrical grid and triggered physical and mental health, migration, housing and infrastructure crises that the island has continued to face in the years since the storm. The impact of this unprecedented natural tragedy was further exacerbated by the human-made tragedy of the Trump’s Administration response following Hurricane Maria.In the Senate, joining Senator Markey in cosponsoring the resolution led by Senator Menendez are Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), and Sens.

According to the Florida statute at issue, the ‘relocation program’ was founded using interest earnings associated with COVID-19 relief funding.On Wednesday, 50 immigrants and asylum seekers that first arrived in Texas were flown on planes charted by the State of Florida to Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts without any notice provided to local, state, or federal officials to ensure basic needs were secured for those who arrived. Reports suggest the men, women, and children who were flown Wednesday to Martha’s Vineyard were told they would arrive in Boston.“According to reports, Florida has used federal funds intended to help communities recover from the coronavirus pandemic for an inhumane program to transport newly arrived immigrants,” the lawmakers wrote. “We believe this program misuses federal COVID-19 relief funds and violates federal law.”“We request that you investigate Florida and take all necessary action — including potentially rescinding any misused funds — to stop this abuse of coronavirus relief programs,” the lawmakers continued. “States should not be permitted to use COVID-19 relief funds for any parochial interest unrelated to the pandemic, particularly for naked political conduct that imposes severe and unjust harms on disadvantaged groups of individuals.”The office of Senator Markey has been in contact with federal officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Departments of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Health and Human Services (HHS); state and local officials on Martha’s Vineyard and Cape Cod, including State Representative Dylan Fernandes, State Senator Julian Cyr, and Dukes County Sheriff Bob Ogden; state officials with the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency and the Executive Office of Health and Human Services; and local non-profit organizations, such as the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition and the Venezuelan Association of Massachusetts, to ensure that the immigrants and asylum seekers who most recently arrived at Joint Base Cape Cod this afternoon are met with the continued care and offer of services they received on Martha’s Vineyard.Senator Markey has long been an advocate for comprehensive immigration reform, despite repeated obstruction from Republicans in Congress, who have refused legislative efforts that would improve immigration and refugee admissions processes. In April 2021, Senator Markey and Representatives Zoe Lofgren (CA-19) and Joe Neguse (CO-02) re-introduced their Guaranteed Refugee Admission Ceiling Enhancement (GRACE) Act. The GRACE Act would strengthen existing federal law to prevent any President from setting an annual Presidential Determination on Refugee Admissions at a level below 125,000. In February 2021, Senators Markey and Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Representatives Grace Meng (NY-06), Jesús Chuy García (IL-04), and Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) re-introduced the New Deal for New Americans Act, legislation that improves upon the coordination of federal, state, and local governments to support the social, economic, and civic integration of immigrants and refugees.###"
https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-statement-onpermitting-overhaul,"Washington (September 16, 2022) – Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), author of the Green New Deal and Chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate, and Nuclear Safety, issued the following statement in response to ongoing discussions regarding energy projects permitting reform:“I understand the importance of the commitments that resulted in the historic Inflation Reduction Act and recognize the ongoing conversation on how to fix our permitting system in this country. I have heard from colleagues and allies, and share their concerns about permitting provisions that could negatively impact communities. I will be talking with my colleagues about whether this package can reflect the values of environmental justice. As a way forward is discussed, and especially as new anti-environment proposals are being brought to the permitting discussions, we should not attach the permitting overhaul package to the must-pass government funding legislation.”###"
https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-calls-on-biden-admin-to-lift-barriers-to-testosterone-expand-access-to-gender-affirming-hormone-therapy,"Washington (September 16, 2022) ­– Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) led a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) urging the Biden administration to consider rescheduling or descheduling testosterone in order to make this gender-affirming hormone therapy more accessible to transgender people, including transgender men and transmasculine nonbinary people. Testosterone, a masculinizing hormone therapy, is prescribed to raise testosterone and suppress estrogen levels, causing physical changes such as suppressed menstruation, decreased estrogen production, deepened voices, and increased facial hair growth. The letter was also signed by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).In 1990, Congress added testosterone to the Controlled Substances Act as a Schedule III substance – the class of substances which “may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence” – amid concerns that amateur and professional athletes were using it and other steroids. But Congress’s response more than 30 years ago to testosterone’s non-medical use by athletes has inadvertently created health and criminal justice barriers to gender-affirming care today. Currently, testosterone’s status as a Schedule III controlled substance prevents prescriptions for testosterone from being filled or refilled six months after issuance, or being refilled more than five times. On top of these requirements, states and private health insurers may impose further restrictions, such as 30-day limitations on controlled substances or limitations on mail delivery of prescriptions. Furthermore, testosterone’s Schedule III status can limit the number of trans-friendly providers available due to DEA licensing requirements for controlled substances, limit access via telemedicine, and drive illicit use of unregulated hormones. Finally, its status has played a role in the criminalization, discrimination, and harassment of transgender people through Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs), state-level electronic databases that monitor a wide range of controlled substances including opioids and testosterone. These programs may “out” transgender people to their medical providers, pharmacists, family members, and other people and agencies with access to these databases.Rescheduling testosterone from a Schedule III to a Schedule V substance would put testosterone in the class of substances with low potential for abuse. Alternatively, descheduling testosterone would remove it from the Controlled Substances Act entirely. Estrogen, the feminizing hormone therapy, is not a controlled substance.“Testosterone’s Schedule III status adds barriers to medically necessary, gender-affirming care while leaving transgender people vulnerable to harassment, discrimination, and surveillance,” wrote the Senators in their letter. “Rescheduling or descheduling testosterone would further the goals and policies already announced by the White House and HHS. We applaud the Administration’s ongoing efforts to support the transgender community’s access to health, including strengthening Section 1557 non-discrimination rule-making and working with states on expanding access to gender-affirming care.”“We believe that descheduling or rescheduling testosterone is an important and necessary step to expand access to gender-affirming, life-saving care,” the letter concluded.In addition to urging the officials to deschedule testosterone or reschedule the hormone as a Schedule V controlled substance, the Senators requested answers to the following questions by October 7th:###"
https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-joins-lujan-matsui-colleagues-in-introducing-legislation-to-increase-digital-equity-inclusion-and-literacy,"Washington (September 15, 2022) —  Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) today joined four of his colleagues led by Senator Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and U.S. Representative Doris Matsui (D-Calif.) in introducing the Digital Equity Foundation Act, legislation to establish a nonprofit foundation to leverage public and private investments to make progress closing the divide on digital equity, digital inclusion, and digital literacy. The Foundation will supplement the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and the Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC) work to award grants, support research, provide training and education, engage with stakeholders, collect data, and promote policies to improve digital equity outcomes. The Foundation will be run by a Board of experts specializing in the fields of digital equity, technology, and telecommunications, and will represent diverse communities throughout the U.S. Congressionally-established nonprofit foundations have had great success in supporting the missions of various government agencies, including NIH, FDA, and NPS, and provide a mechanism to leverage public-private partnerships and support innovation. As the NTIA works to implement the broadband programs in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and connect our country, the Digital Equity Foundation will be vital to ensuring the most vulnerable communities have the knowledge and skills to take full advantage of these new connections. In addition to Senator Markey, the Digital Equity Foundation Act is co-sponsored by Senators Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).“The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that access to devices and internet connectivity is the cost of entry to participate in the modern economy and keep in touch with family and friends,” said Senator Markey. “Millions of people, however, still lack those essential tools. The Digital Equity Foundation Act is a critical step towards bridging this digital divide and ensuring that everyone has access to affordable information and communication technologies. I am proud to support this legislation.”“As our world rapidly shifts online, Americans must be equipped with the knowledge and skills to use technology properly and successfully,” said Senator Luján, Chair of the Subcommittee on Communications, Media, and Broadband. “That’s why I’m introducing legislation that creates a long-term solution to close the divide on digital equity by launching a nonprofit foundation to award funding, support research, and provide technology training and education to communities in need. Critically, this legislation also ensures the decision makers will consist of experts that reflect the diverse communities that are in need of these investments, who will work closely with federal agencies to support and uplift digital equity-focused programs.”“Regardless of age, zip code, or income level, Americans need to be able to get online. Yet for too long the digital divide has left millions of American families without a path to succeed in the 21st century economy,” said Congresswoman Matsui. “Closing the digital divide will require a comprehensive approach that addresses the many factors leaving families without internet access. By introducing the Digital Equity Foundation Act, we’re establishing a powerful new tool grounded in equity and laser focused on promoting economic mobility for communities in need. This legislation will jumpstart us down the road to lasting digital equity and inclusion nationwide.”“I have been a longtime supporter of digital equity and ensuring all individuals, families, and businesses have access to affordable and reliable internet and broadband services wherever they live,” said Senator Merkley. “The ongoing pandemic highlights just how important equitable access to internet and digital services are for all of our communities. This bill would mean better access to broadband and internet-enabled devices, and that means better, stronger, more connected communities.”“New Mexico students deserve a future that is as bright as they are. We can achieve that goal by creating equal access to broadband opportunities,” said Senator Heinrich. “Access to high-speed internet is also key to bringing telehealth services and economic development opportunities to rural communities. I’m proud that we secured major investments in the Infrastructure Law to help build out broadband infrastructure all across New Mexico, but we don’t have to stop there. That’s why I’m proud to cosponsor this legislation that would put together a Foundation for Digital Equity to continue seeking ways to make broadband access more equitable and affordable for every single American.”“This measure will help communities across the country bridge the digital divide and close the homework gap. Access to dependable, affordable broadband and online services is essential to ensuring students, businesses, and families have the tools to succeed. Our legislation is an important step in addressing our nation’s disparities in broadband access and countering the connectivity gaps exacerbated by the pandemic,” said Senator Blumenthal.“We commend Senator Luján and Representative Matsui for recognizing that without sustained investments in digital adoption and inclusion efforts at the community level, the huge new investments in broadband infrastructure and affordability won’t close the digital divide. A Digital Equity Foundation dedicated to this work and, if possible, funded by future spectrum auctions, will provide a sustainable way to tackle this part of the digital divide,” said Michael Calabrese, Director, Wireless Future Project at New America, Open Technology Institute at New America.“Digital literacy, digital skills training, and access to devices -- these are some of the barriers to broadband adoption that Sen. Luján and Rep. Matsui’s Digital Equity Foundation Act of 2022 would address. This bill would use a portion of funds raised through spectrum auctions to fund resources at the local level to support schoolchildren, older adults, and others who need devices and training so that all generations have the essential tools to fully participate in our society. We thank Sen. Luján and Rep. Matsui for their leadership on this effort and look forward to working to get the Digital Equity Foundation Act of 2022 enacted this year,” said Greg Guice, Director of Government Affairs, Public Knowledge.This legislation is supported by The Schools, Health & Libraries Broadband (SHLB) Coalition; National Digital Inclusion Alliance; American Library Association; Public Knowledge; Open Technology Institute at New America; United Church of Christ Media Justice Ministry, Common Cause, and National Consumer Law Center; Center for Rural Strategies; Common Sense; and the National Hispanic Media Coalition.Full text of the bill is available HERE.

https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-statement-oncommittee-passage-oftaiwan-policy-act,"Washington (September 14, 2022) – Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy, released the following statement upon passage by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee of the Taiwan Policy Act of 2022:“We must support our partners in Taiwan in preserving the status quo that has maintained peace for more than four decades. We can most effectively do this by strengthening Taiwan’s ability to defend itself, bolstering deterrence, and reassuring our partners and allies in the region. We cannot, however, safeguard the status quo by responding in kind to the People’s Republic of China’s latest acts of aggression and brinksmanship.""“I support important provisions within the Taiwan Policy Act to strengthen the long-term self-defense and stability of Taiwan by improving the island’s defensive capabilities and strengthening cooperation. However, I have serious concerns about provisions that, in my view, upend strategic ambiguity, undermine the U.S. One China Policy, and threaten to destabilize the region. It is the people living on Taiwan who are facing the daily realities of increased Chinese aggression and will be the ones targeted in reaction to changes in U.S. policies. We should not take actions that put Taiwan at increased risk, with little reward. For that reason I voted no on Committee passage of the Taiwan Policy Act.“I appreciate Chairman Menendez’s willingness to work with me to address many of my concerns about the bill and I’m glad the bill includes measures I championed including:“We have a moral responsibility to both stand up to authoritarianism and military aggression, as well as to do everything we can to avoid a situation that could draw two nuclear-armed countries into a conflict. Diplomacy must remain central to our Taiwan policy. I cannot support the Taiwan Policy Act of 2022 in its current form, but I will continue to work alongside the Chairman and my colleagues in the Senate to address my concerns.”###"

Markey (D-Mass.) joined Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), as she led 28 of their colleagues in calling on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to take immediate action to safeguard women’s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially get the health care they need. Specifically, the Senators urged the Biden Administration to strengthen federal privacy protections under the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to broadly restrict providers from sharing patients’ reproductive health information without their explicit consent—particularly with law enforcement or in legal proceedings over accessing abortion care. The push from the Senators comes as legislators and prosecutors across the country have sought to enforce Republicans’ abortion bans by investigating women and doctors for seeking and providing abortion care.“Our nation faces a crisis in access to reproductive health services, and some states have already begun to investigate and punish women seeking abortion care. It is critical that HHS take all available action to fully protect women’s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially seek medical care,” wrote the Senators.In their letter to Secretary Xavier Becerra, the Senators urge HHS to take immediate action to strengthen federal privacy protections under HIPAA, bolster enforcement of the protections, educate providers about their obligations, and ensure patients understand their rights. In June, in the wake of the Dobbs decision, Becerra pledged to work to protect patient and provider privacy.“To safeguard the privacy of women’s personal health care decisions and ensure patients feel safe seeking medical care, including reproductive health care, we urge you to quickly initiate the rulemaking process to strengthen privacy protections for reproductive health information,” urged the Senators. “In particular, HHS should update the HIPAA Privacy Rule to broadly restrict regulated entities  from sharing individuals’ reproductive health information without explicit consent, particularly for law enforcement, civil, or criminal proceedings premised on the provision of abortion care.”Since the Dobbs decision, the new patchwork of state abortion bans has caused widespread confusion among health care providers over whether they are required to turn over patients’ health information to state and local law enforcement. This confusion fundamentally threatens women’s health, as patients may delay or avoid seeking the care they need out of fear their sensitive health information could be weaponized against them. In recent weeks, states have investigated and sought to punish patients and providers for seeking and providing abortion care.In addition to Senator Markey, the letter led by Chair Murray was also signed by Senators Baldwin (D-Wis.), Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Booker (D-N.J.), Brown (D-Ohio), Cantwell (D-Wash.), Casey (D-Pa.), Duckworth (D-Ill.), Durbin (D-Ill.), Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Heinrich (D-N.M.), Hickenlooper (D-Colo), Hirono (D-Hawaii), Kaine (D-Va.), Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Luján (D-N.M.), Menendez (D-N.J.), Merkley (D-Ore.), Padilla (D-Calif.), Reed (D-R.I.), Rosen (D-Nev.), Sanders (I-Vt.), Shaheen (D-N.H.), Smith (D-Minn.), Stabenow (D-Mich.), Van Hollen (D-Md.), Warner (D-Va.), Warren (D-Mass.), and Wyden (D-Ore.).Read the text of the letter HERE.###"

Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) sent a letter to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Acting Director Tae D. Johnson urging the agency to end its use of invasive technologies, purchases of private commercial data and invasive surveillance tactics that threaten the privacy rights of individuals all across the United States. The letter points to a recent report by the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy & Technology, which revealed that ICE has used facial recognition technology on the driver’s license photographs of almost one-third (32%) of all U.S. adults, and has access to the driver’s license data of almost three-fourths (74%) of them — in most cases without obtaining a search warrant.“According to a recent report, ICE has used facial recognition and other technologies, and purchased information from data brokers, to construct a ‘dragnet surveillance system’ that helps ICE carry out deportation proceedings. Much of this effort, which has enabled ICE to obtain detailed information about the vast majority of people living in the United States, has been shrouded in secrecy,” the Senators wrote. “This surveillance network has exploited privacy-protection gaps and has enormous civil rights implications,” the Senators continued. “ICE should immediately shut down its Orwellian data-gathering efforts that indiscriminately collect far too much data on far too many individuals.”In their letter, Senators Markey and Wyden requested that ICE respond in writing to the following questions by October 3, 2022:Read the full text of the letter HERE.In June 2021, Senators Markey, Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), along with Representatives Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) and Rashida Tlaib (MI-13) re-introduced their Facial Recognition and Biometric Technology Moratorium Act. The legislation would prohibit use of biometric technology by federal agencies and condition federal grant funding to state and local entities on moratoria on the use of biometric technology. Markey, Wyden and 20 bipartisan senators introduced the Fourth Amendment is Not For Sale Act last year to ban the government from buying Americans’ personal commercial data instead of obtaining a warrant.###"
https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-padilla-introduce-bill-to-ensure-truckers-are-fairly-paid-forovertime-work,"Washington (September 12, 2022) — As the country continues its economic recovery from pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) today introduced legislation to ensure that truckers are compensated fairly for the hours that they are on the clock, including overtime. The Guaranteeing Overtime for Truckers Act would repeal the motor carrier provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which excludes many truckers from overtime protections enjoyed by other workers. The bill was introduced in the House by Representative Andy Levin (D-Mich.).In response to an Executive Order by President Biden, the U.S. Department of Transportation issued a Freight and Logistics Supply Chain Assessment in February 2022, which highlights high turnover rates and compensation issues in the trucking industry. Among its recommendations, the Department called on Congress to repeal the motor carrier provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.“Truck drivers are the engines of our economy, ensuring that everything from consumer goods to commodities reach their destination on time,” said Senator Edward J. Markey. “Outdated labor regulations have denied these vital workers overtime, leading to high turnover and supply chain disruptions. Don’t be fooled by the trucking companies’ crocodile tears. There is a simple way to recruit and retain drivers: increase their pay. The Guaranteeing Overtime for Truckers Act does exactly that by eliminating the overtime exemption. I am proud to work alongside Senator Padilla on this legislation and am committed to ensuring that truck drivers receive the respect and rightful pay that they’ve earned.”“America’s truck drivers are on the frontlines of keeping goods and our economy moving. In fact, more than 70 percent of goods across the United States are shipped by truck,” said Senator Alex Padilla. “Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting supply chain crisis aggravated persistent hardships for truckers, including long hours spent waiting—often unpaid—to load and unload goods. As our nation makes historic investments in our port and supply chain infrastructure, I’ve introduced this legislation to improve wages and working conditions for these essential workers and build the foundation for good-paying, stable trucking jobs.”In addition to Senators Markey and Padilla, the legislation is also cosponsored by Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).The legislation is supported by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, OOIDA, the Truck Safety Coalition, the Institute for Safer Trucking, Parents Against Tired Truckers, and CRASH.Full text of the bill is available here.###"
https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-call-for-ftc-investigation-of-firearms-industrys-unfair-and-deceptive-advertising,"Today’s letter follows increased scrutiny of the marketing tactics employed by the manufacturer of the gun used to kill nineteen schoolchildren and two teachers in Uvalde, TexasWashington (September 12, 2022) – Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) led a group of twelve senators in calling on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to “to undertake an investigation and consider regulation of the unfair and deceptive advertising practices used by the firearms industry.” In a letter today to FTC Chair Khan, the senators highlighted the firearms industry’s efforts to mislead consumers about the safety of guns and the employment of advertising tactics that target children and teenagers – including using video games, popular musicians and television shows, and even Santa Claus to market its deadly products.  “The industry regularly and routinely makes false and misleading representations about firearm safety and unfairly exploits children and teenagers through unfair and deceptive marketing practices, including targeting teenagers, particularly young men, with advertising for military-style weapons,” the senators wrote. “Time and again, these practices have had deadly consequences.”The gun industry’s advertising and marketing practices have received increased attention following the massacre at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, where the mass shooter used an assault rifle manufactured by Daniel Defense. Daniel Defense’s marketing materials highlight the company’s military contracts and reference popular first-person shooter video games to target children and teenagers.Earlier this year, the families of nine victims of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut secured a settlement of their claims against Remington Arms based on the company’s advertising practices.Today’s letter was also signed by U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Jack Reed (D-R.I.).The full text of the letter can be found here and below.Dear Chair Khan:We write to urge the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to undertake an investigation and consider regulation of the unfair and deceptive advertising practices used by the firearms industry. Following the horrific massacre at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas on May 24, 2022, Daniel Defense—the manufacturer of the assault rifle used in the attack—has come under increased and warranted scrutiny for its advertising practices. Daniel Defense touts military contracts and ties in order to market weapons of war to the general public, and specifically targets and tailors its advertisements to children and teenagers with invocations of and references to popular first-person shooter video games like Call of Duty—a game reportedly played by the 18-year-old shooter in Uvalde. Daniel Defense is not the only firearms manufacturer that has, appropriately, come under mounting scrutiny for its advertising practices. For example, in February 2022, the families of nine victims murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School secured a settlement against Remington Arms—the manufacturer of the firearm used to kill 20 children and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut almost 10 years ago—for its own marketing tactics. Daniel Defense and Remington, however, are far from outliers in the firearms industry. The industry regularly and routinely makes false and misleading representations about firearm safety and unfairly exploits children and teenagers through unfair and deceptive marketing practices, including targeting teenagers, particularly young men, with advertising for military-style weapons. Time and again, these practices have had deadly consequences.The FTC has the power to address these deceptive marketing practices that threaten consumers and public safety. Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act empowers the FTC to investigate and regulate “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce,” including in the advertising of products.  The FTC has previously investigated and taken strong action against other industries for similar false and misleading safety-related claims, particularly when such claims target and endanger children. The tobacco and e-cigarette industries are perhaps the paradigmatic example. Since the 1940s, the FTC has brought enforcement actions against tobacco companies for unfair and deceptive claims over the health and safety of cigarettes—most prominently with its lawsuit against R.J. Reynolds over the use of the Joe Camel cartoon to market to children.The same should be done here with respect to the firearms industry and the unsubstantiated claims it has made—and continues to make—in its advertisements. For decades, the firearms industry has marketed firearms to consumers as a safe and proven product to protect themselves and their homes. Consumers should be informed of all the substantial and unavoidable risks that come with firearm ownership, possession, and use, and the FTC is in the best position to make sure that the firearms industry tells them—and tells them accurately.The first petition calling for the FTC to investigate the firearms industry was filed in 1996 —more than 25 years ago—and numerous petitions have been filed in the intervening years. A petition for an investigation filed in April by the Firearms Accountability Counsel Taskforce (FACT) documents in chilling detail how the firearms industry has knowingly engaged in a long pattern of unfair and deceptive advertising to mislead the American public into erroneously believing that gun ownership makes them safer, when the available evidence overwhelmingly proves the opposite.  The petition also highlights the violent results of the industry’s efforts to “target and radicalize” consumers by “convincing them that they need expensive, military-grade weaponry for everyday use.”  The petition includes examples of efforts that targeted young men in particular with connections to video games and claims that owning military-grade weapons was the only path to manhood. Everytown for Gun Safety, Brady, and Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jamie was killed in the 2018 Parkland shooting, filed a petition in May 2020, and followed up with a letter last year reiterating their request for an investigation of Smith & Wesson’s marketing practices.  And, in July, Everytown for Gun Safety filed a petition specifically focused on the highly violent and militarized marketing practices of Daniel Defense, to which teens and young men are particularly susceptible.  The FTC, however, has never taken public action in response to the petitions that have exposed these practices.These petitions show that the available evidence strongly demonstrates that firearm possession, ownership, and use render consumers substantially less safe and substantially more at risk of injury and death with limited, if any, protective benefit.  The rare instances in which a gun owner successfully uses a firearm for self-defense are far outweighed by the vastly higher number of injuries and deaths for the owners, family members, and other cohabitants. In fact, research indicates that for each instance in which a firearm in the home is used successfully in self-defense, there are 11 attempted or completed firearm suicides, seven criminal assaults or homicides involving a firearm, and four unintentional shootings. That fact comports with broader gun violence research and data. More than half of the near 46,000 suicides reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2020 involved firearms.  64 Americans die by firearm suicide every day, and 700 children die by firearm suicide each year.  Firearm suicides are almost always deadly: 9 out of 10 firearm suicide attempts result in death.  In addition, unintentional and accidental shootings are also a serious problem specific to firearm possession, ownership, and use—particularly for children. Well over four million children live in households with at least one unlocked and loaded firearm.  Although 70 percent of parents reported that adolescents could not access firearms in their household, more than one-third of children in those households reported being able to access the firearm in less than five minutes.  Every day, eight children are unintentionally injured or killed due to an unlocked or unsupervised gun in the home.  In 2022, so far, there have been at least 181 unintentional shootings by children, resulting in 77 deaths and 115 injuries.  In 2021, there were almost 400—including 163 deaths and 248 injuries. None of this evidence is new. We and, more importantly, the firearms industry, have known for decades that firearm possession, ownership, and use can have serious—often deadly—irreversible consequences. But that has never stopped the firearms industry from advertising guns as indispensable to protect oneself in and outside the home. If anything, the firearms industry has doubled-down on its unfair and deceptive advertising with a specific emphasis on military and law enforcement grade firearms and a particular focus on children and teenagers, using video games, popular musicians and television shows, and even Santa Claus to market its products.  This scheme has worked—to the benefit of the firearms industry and the detriment of consumers. Evidence shows that decades of deceptive advertising has deceived Americans into believing, inaccurately, that having a gun in the home decreases the risk of violence when the opposite is true. This mistaken belief has led to a historic surge in gun sales and industry profits tragically in tandem with the number of gun-related deaths in the United States.  Data from the CDC shows that gun deaths in 2020 in the United States reached the highest level ever recorded—45,000.  In 2020, firearms were also, for the first time, the leading cause of death among children and teenagers—a 29-percent increase from 2019.  Firearms are now among the leading causes of death nationwide, as more than 120 Americans are killed each day with a gun.  If the firearms industry’s commercial representations were based on fact and evidence instead of profit motives, the gun violence trendline would be trending downward. Reality reflects otherwise. The FTC must act to ensure that the firearms industry, which has operated without oversight and with impunity for far too long, is held accountable for misleading consumers about the harms guns can cause to themselves, their children, and their communities. To that end, we encourage the FTC to make full use of all its tools and authorities to investigate and regulate the firearms industry’s unfair and deceptive advertising practices.###"

Markey (D-Mass.) joined New England colleagues led by Senator Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) in a bipartisan call for the Biden Administration to take action to lower energy costs for New Englanders as the winter season approaches and Americans continue to face high energy costs. In the letter, the Senators write, “As winter approaches, we are calling for federal action to help bring down heating costs for households in our region, including releasing stockpiles from the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve.” They continue, “With lower inventories of crude oil, propane, and natural gas and the continued global disruption caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine contributing to a sharp rise in residential energy costs, we urge the administration to closely monitor the energy needs of the Northeast and release stock from the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve.”In addition to Senator Markey, the letter was also signed by Senators Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Angus King (I-Maine), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).Read a copy of the letter HERE.Dear President Biden:As winter approaches, we are calling for federal action to help bring down heating costs for households in our region, including releasing stockpiles from the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve. Given the current state of energy markets, particularly in New England, we urge you to consider additional targeted actions in preparation for the cold weather season.To help combat the increased cost of heating oil, we believe that now is an appropriate time to release inventory from the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve, similar to the action you took earlier this year with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at our urging. Doing so can help address constrained regional energy supplies and recent residential energy price increases.The U.S. Energy Information Administration, in its August Short-Term Energy Outlook, forecasts a significant increase in energy prices, particularly in the Northeast. These increased costs will have an outsized impact on households that heat with natural gas, propane, and heating oil – which includes many of our constituents. These costs can have a very real effect on the ability of many New England families to keep their homes at a safe temperature this winter. No family should have to make the decision between paying their bill to keep their children warm, putting food on the table, and keeping the lights on. As New Englanders purchase heating oil and propane for the winter season, it is vital that the administration use all tools available to bring down fuel prices and ensure that there is adequate supply to meet demand.With lower inventories of crude oil, propane, and natural gas and the continued global disruption caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine contributing to a sharp rise in residential energy costs, we urge the administration to closely monitor the energy needs of the Northeast and release stock from the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve. This action is consistent with the discretion granted to the President under 42 U.S.C. § 6250b, in order to directly and significantly reduce the adverse impact of a significant regional shortage of home heating oil.This is a critical economic issue facing millions of Americans, and we appreciate your attention to this important matter.###"

https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-merkley-smith-colleagues-sound-alarm-on-unlawful-charges-for-prep-patients,"AHIP members reported to unlawfully charge patients for necessary medications and ancillary services that are critical to preventing HIV infectionWashington (September 8, 2022) — Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) today joined Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) in a letter led by Senators Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Tina Smith (D-Minn.) to AHIP, the trade association representing health insurance companies. The letter expresses concerns about the continued practice of unlawfully charging individuals for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medication and related care.The Senators' letter follows a Wednesday court ruling that further threatens affordable access to PrEP. As the legal process moves forward, the Senators pressed the health insurance industry to abide by current law to provide medication and ancillary services without charge.“It has been brought to our attention that enrollees in your members’ health plans continue to be charged for necessary medications and ancillary services—including provider consultations and laboratory services—contrary to law and additional federal guidance issued by the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Treasury,” wrote the Senators. “We write to express our deep concern with these erroneous and unlawful charges, and to request additional information on steps that AHIP is taking to ensure that its members adhere to federal law and ensure the PrEP drugs and the full scope of PrEP ancillary services are offered without charge to enrollees.”A 2019 ruling by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) gave PrEP an “A” rating as prevention intervention for people at risk of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This ruling brought PrEP under section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, which requires insurance coverage for services or interventions that have been given an ““A” or “B” rating from the USPSTF.Subsequent guidance, published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in July 2021, further clarified their ruling. Noting that “plans and issuers must cover PrEP consistent with the USPSTF recommendation without cost sharing,” the ruling goes on to clarify that PrEP is not just the medication, but also all of its necessary related services including testing, screening, and provider visits. Despite this ruling and subsequent clarification, individuals are still being wrongly charged out-of-pocket expenses relating to their PrEP care.“In light of this clear guidance from CMS, we are alarmed by continual reports that patients are routinely billed, either for payment-in-full or for cost-sharing practices, related to medically-appropriate medications and essential services,” they continued. “These costs can be daunting. HIV advocates and clinical workers across the county have reported that many patients are unaware that they do not have to pay out-of-pocket for PrEP and ancillary services, assuming that many of these costs are simply necessary for being on PrEP medication.”The Senators’ letter highlights the inequities in PrEP uptake across communities at higher risk for HIV—including Black and Hispanic communities and transgender women—due to limited access to financial resources needed to cover costs of PrEP and associated medical visits and laboratory tests, among other factors.In light of these concerns, the lawmakers ask the following questions and request a response from AHIP within 30 days:The letter is supported by PrEP4ALL, the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, the Center for Health and Democracy, and NMAC.“Unfortunately we have documented dozens of cases of insurers still charging patients out-of-pocket fees for PrEP-related care, a year after CMS and the Department of Labor issued their guidance,” said Kenyon Farrow, Managing Director of Advocacy & Organizing with PrEP4ALL. “Ending the HIV epidemic will require us to ensure everyone with insurance be able to get PrEP services with no cost-sharing, as the rule intended. We applaud Sen. Merkley and Sen. Smith’s tireless advocacy on behalf of patients.”“We appreciate Senators Merkley and Smith’s leadership and all their colleagues desire to ensure that the preventative service provisions of the Affordable Care Act are properly implemented. Private insurers must provide PrEP drugs and associated services without patient cost-sharing. We are receiving too many complaints from PrEP users that this is not always happening. We trust with this letter insurers will ensure full compliance,” said Carl Schmid, Executive Director of the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute.“While appalling, it’s sadly not shocking to see Big Health Insurance wrongfully billing enrollees for medications and ancillary services as part of a PrEP regimen to prevent HIV, despite crystal clear guidance from the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury not to do so,” said Wendell Potter, President of the Center for Health and Democracy. “We’re grateful for the leadership of Senators Merkley and Smith for sending this letter, underscoring their understanding of the effectiveness of PrEP and their compassion for those at risk and their families.”Read the full text of the letter HERE and below:Dear Mr. Eyles:We write today regarding recent reports of patients across the country receiving bills and charges from AHIP members for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drugs that prevent HIV, along with necessary ancillary services, as part of the PrEP regimen[1]. It has been brought to our attention that enrollees in your members’ health plans continue to be charged for necessary medications and ancillary services—including provider consultations and laboratory services—contrary to law and additional federal guidance issued by the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Treasury. We write to express our deep concern with these erroneous and unlawful charges, and to request additional information on steps that AHIP is taking to ensure that its members adhere to federal law and ensure the PrEP drugs and the full scope of PrEP ancillary services are offered without charge to enrollees.As you know, a 2019 ruling by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) gave PrEP an “A” rating as a prevention intervention for people at risk of HIV infection[2]. The Public Health Services Act (PHS Act) section 2713 states that non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered group or individual health insurance coverage must provide coverage for, and must not impose any cost-sharing requirements, for services or interventions that have been given an “A” or “B” rating by the USPSTF[3].While this statutory requirement for payers remains the law of the land, the requirement has been further clarified in additional federal guidance, including in those issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) [4]. Indeed, in a July 2021 document published by CMS, the agency noted that “plans and issuers must cover PrEP consistent with the USPSTF recommendation without cost-sharing…” In its recommendation, the USPTF cites guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), stating that PrEP is a comprehensive intervention comprised of antiretroviral medication in addition to essential support services.Indeed, CMS continued on to clarify that PrEP is not just the medication, but includes the full scope of essential medical services associated with the PrEP regimen, explicitly citing initial clinical assessments and ongoing monitoring of patients including HIV testing; hepatitis B and C testing; creatinine testing; sexually-transmitted infection (STI) testing and counseling, and other services essential to the efficacy of the PrEP regimen as outlined by the CDC guidelines for PrEP.In light of this clear guidance from CMS, we are alarmed by continual reports that patients are routinely billed, either for payment-in-full or for cost-sharing practices, related to medically-appropriate medications and essential services. These costs can be daunting. HIV advocates and clinical workers across the county have reported that many patients are unaware that they do not have to pay out-of-pocket for PrEP and ancillary services, assuming that many of these costs are simply necessary for being on PrEP medication. In some cases, these patients can pay over $1,000 per year when federal law states that they should pay nothing. Consumers who attempt to challenge these illegal cost sharing charges with their plans routinely find that claims are turned over to collections, causing anxiety and stress, and in many cases, prompting individuals to discontinue PrEP.The impact of these costs on patient access and public health more generally cannot be understated. Multiple academic studies have indicated that associated costs—including the costs of ancillary services—present a barrier to PrEP access in the United States[5], despite its incredible effectiveness of reducing the risk of HIV acquisition[6]. Inequities in PrEP uptake persist across communities at higher risk for HIV—including Black and Hispanic communities and transgender women—because of limited access to financial resources to cover costs of PrEP and associated medical visits and laboratory tests, among other factors[7].While we recognize that partnerships with laboratories and health care providers, including accurate billing and coding, may present challenges, the statutory language of the PHSA section 2713  is clear in indicating that issuers, and issuers alone, are legally required to be compliant with providing coverage for PrEP, including the full scope of necessary related services, without cost-sharing. In light of these concerns, and the role we request responses to the following questions within 30 days of receipt of this letter:Thank you again for your attention to this pressing matter impacting public health in our country.###"
https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-joins-senator-warren-representative-sherman-in-reintroducing-the-nationwide-right-to-unionize-act-call-for-passage-of-the-pro-act,"Washington (September 8, 2022) — Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) joined Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Representative Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) as the two lawmakers today reintroduced the Nationwide Right to Unionize Act, legislation that would support the right to unionize by prohibiting states from banning union security agreements through “right-to-work” laws. Twenty-seven states have enacted “right-to-work” laws that prevent unions from collecting dues from non-union members who are covered under a union-negotiated contract. These laws make it more difficult for workers to form unions and fight for higher wages and better working conditions in the states that adopt them, resulting in a 5% decrease in unionization rates and a decrease in average wages for all full-time workers of 3.1%, according to a study by the Economic Policy Institute, or about $11,000 a year, according to a report released by Rep. Sherman’s office. A similar proposal is included in the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which the lawmakers support and would protect American workers’ right to organize and negotiate for better wages and working conditions.In addition to Senator Markey, the legislation is co-sponsored by Senators Duckworth (D-Ill.), Wyden (D-Ore.), Luján (D-N.M.), Padilla (D-Calif.), Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Booker (D-N.J.), Merkley (D-Ore.), Hassan (D-N.H.), Sanders (I-Vt.), Smith (D-Minn.), Stabenow (D-Mich.), Cardin (D-Md.), Brown (D-Ohio), Hirono (D-Hawai’i), Baldwin (D-Wis.), and Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Representatives Lynch (D-Mass.), Norton (D-DC), Garamendi (D-Calif.), Cárdenas (D-Calif.), Swalwell (D-Calif.), Moulton (D-Mass.), Speier (D-Calif.), Raskin (D-Md.), Brownley (D-Calif.), Kildee (D-Mich.), Nadler (D-N.Y.), and Jayapal (D-Wash.).Read a copy of the legislative text HERE.It has received support from the following advocacy and expert organizations: The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), AFL-CIO, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), International Brotherhood of Teamsters, United Steelworkers, Transport Workers Union of America, International Union of Operating Engineers, Communications Workers of America Union, Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union, International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, International Association of Machinists, United Food & Commercial Workers Union, and Aerospace Workers, Economic Policy Institute, Worker Power Coalition, and National Employment Law Project.“Senator Warren’s Nationwide Right To Unionize Act would finally start prioritizing the interests of workers in our nation’s labor laws, which have always been stacked in the favor of employers,” said Marc Perrone, President of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. “The brave, essential workers who make up the UFCW can attest to the fact that the best way to improve a workplace has always been for workers to organize, form a union, and fight for their rights together. Right now, thousands upon thousands of Americans are doing exactly that, and, despite all the unfair hurdles they must overcome, workers are successfully organizing in new industries and new workplaces. Passing this bill and rolling back decades upon decades of anti-worker legislation would be one of the single most important steps we can possibly take to empower the American workers that keep this country running.”“So called “right-to-work” laws have their roots in some of the ugliest parts of our country’s history,” said Rebecca Dixon, Executive Director, National Employment Law Project. “Like so many other workplace laws, “right-to-work” is a policy that was designed to make sure that white people did not have to join unions and join their fates and interests to those of Black workers in the South. Today, these laws operate exactly as intended, and drive down wages and conditions of work in far too many states where large proportions of the working class are people of color. NELP commends Senator Warren for introducing the Nationwide Right to Unionize Act to put an end to this policy and to ensure that all workers, regardless of the state in which they live, can join together with their co-workers and build power to help determine their terms and conditions of work.” ""So-called ‘right-to-work’ laws have nothing to do with guaranteeing anyone a job – these state laws are driven by anti-worker and anti-union forces seeking to undermine the bargaining power, wages, and the rights of working people,” said Matthew Biggs, President of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE) and IFPTE Secretary-Treasurer Gay Henson. “Our union applauds Senator Warren for reintroducing the Nationwide Right to Unionize Act which restores a core labor standard across the U.S. so that all workers have the right to come together, bargain collectively, and build union power in labor unions that have resources to represent all members."" “We are living through an incredible moment in history where more and more workers are increasingly interested in bringing the power of a union to their workplaces,” said CWA President Chris Shelton. “We have an opportunity to transform the labor movement but only if we do what is required of us in this moment and eliminate the barriers workers face to exercise their power. It is way past time to eliminate the right to work for less laws that corporations have used to systematically chip away at the power of labor unions and the ability of workers to come together and collectively fight to better their lives and the lives of their families. We are encouraged by the leadership of Senator Warren and all the supporters of this legislation and committed to see it through the finish line.” ""AFGE supports the Nationwide Right to Unionize Act,” said AFGE. “AFGE strongly supports the right of all workers to unionize in the workplace to ensure safety, health, and equity on the job.  AFGE applauds Senator Warren for introducing this bill which will bring us one step closer to granting union rights to all workers.""“Across the country, working people are demanding the freedom to band together and claim a seat at the table – in fact, the latest Gallup Poll shows a 71% approval rating for unions,” AFSCME President Lee Saunders. “To unrig the system and make it easier to organize, we need to repeal so-called ‘right-to-work’ laws, which are rooted in white supremacy and allow employers to silence the voices of working people. We applaud Senator Warren for pushing back with the Nationwide Right to Unionize Act, which would get these unjust laws off the books and help level the playing field for private-sector workers.” “A recent Gallup poll showed that 71% of Americans support workers' right to unionize - and tens of millions of Americans would join a union today if they had the chance,” Chip Shannon, Executive Director, Worker Power Coalition. “Right now, a wave of organizing is sweeping the nation as workers at stores like Starbucks, Amazon, Trader Joes and Apple are standing up and demanding their rights to collectively bargain at the workplace. For far too long, so-called Right to Work laws have restricted workers from fully realizing their abilities to come together in union to fight for better pay, benefits and working conditions. The Worker Power Coalition, which represents 24 million workers from more than 40 labor and social justice organizations is committed to updating our labor laws to better protect workers. We enthusiastically support the Nationwide Right to Unionize Act.”###"

However, we are concerned with the lack of investment that should accompany the acknowledgement. Leaving it up to states to shape these investments means that we are following the same paths that have historically debilitated our upward mobility in the South. The Administration should do everything in its power to make sure states and communities on the ground get resources they need, and that means strong Justice40 rules and enforcement . Tracking benefits to communities is not enough, we need direct investments and 100% of justice."" - Reverend Michael Malcolm, People’s Justice Council Alabama“For Justice40 to be the transformative legacy-establishing program we all wish to see, we need all levels of government fully engaged. We feel our government at the community level, we are most likely to know who our mayors and city council folks are. The federal government should be asking states and municipalities directly how they can be a part of the changes Justice40 can bring. Justice40 needs to be the talk around town so that every community member helps us hold accountable agencies, states and municipal governments. This is the way to a real ‘all of government’ approach.” - Maria Lopez-Nunez, Ironbound Community Corporation“California’s legislature recently killed AB 2419, the California Justice40 Act, a bill that would have committed the state to President Biden’s Justice40 Initiative by ensuring targeted investment of federal funds from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to frontline and disadvantaged communities. Without that bill, and with added concerns that the IRA contains elements that will cause harm to those communities, our hope now is for the Biden Administration to keep its word and strengthen rules to its J40 Initiative in order to address those harms while ensuring investments land in the hands of disadvantaged communities.” - Zach Lou, California Green New Deal Coalition""President Biden's Justice40 Initiative is an opportunity to correct the legacy of pollution in Black, Brown, Indigenous, and poor communities in Michigan and around the country. But, the federal government must also ensure that no new harms come our way from projects such as fossil fuel infrastructure, carbon capture technology, hydrogen, and nuclear energy. Those projects are incompatible with the principles of Environmental Justice, and they will not deliver any benefits to our people or the planet. The Justice40 Initiative should not count them as beneficial in any way. Instead, it must prevent and keep track of any harms from false solutions funded in the Infrastructure, Investments and Jobs Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act."" - Juan Jhong Chung, Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition.“Communities of color were critical to getting President Biden elected. With the Justice40 Initiative Biden made a commitment to ensure federal investments materially benefit frontline communities, and we are looking to him to deliver on his promise. His administration must not delay any further its final guidance to agencies on Justice40. The initiative has the potential to direct historic levels of critically-needed investments to communities at the frontlines of pollution and climate crisis who need them the most. The administration should listen to leaders in Congress echoing grassroots demands to implement Justice40 comprehensively, with deep engagement of impacted communities at every level of implementation, and to ensure no federal investments do harm to any communities.” - Adrien Salazar, Grassroots Global Justice Alliance“President Biden was listening to frontline communities who have long been organizing around targeted investments to impacted communities. Now, as the Administration is preparing its final guidance on J40 it is critical the White House follow the leadership of frontline organizations and strengthen the initiative by sending funds directly to frontline communities, creating good local jobs, centering justice, and ensuring the guidance is incorporated quickly. We thank the Congressional champions who worked to uplift these voices and this fight, and know it is due to the hard work of organizers and communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis that the boldest possible guidance will be won.” - Ann Clancy, Indivisible""Members of Congress should be commended for this bold set of recommendations and reform ideas to advance Justice40 and fulfill its promise as a whole-of-government vision of ensuring justice for frontline communities in the climate transition. With the Inflation Reduction Act, there is a mix of positive and harmful investments, which means that fully applying Justice40 is all the more important. Roosevelt Institute is eager to see Justice40 flourish as part of a better climate future, and we are grateful to partner with the United Frontline Table and other grassroots leaders in developing the strongest possible policies and rules toward advancing that goal. It is essential that the Administration follow through in implementing Justice40 by protecting communities from continuing harm and ensuring that federal resources for what they truly need are reaching the most impacted communities."" - Lew Daly, Roosevelt Institute“Clean Energy Group fully endorses the immediate adoption of these recommendations governing the implementation of the Justice40 Initiative. It is imperative that strong guidelines are put into place to ensure that Justice40 results in transparent, clearly beneficial, direct investment in communities most harmed by legacy fossil fuel infrastructure, systemic racism, and chronic underinvestment and strengthens those most vulnerable to hardships exacerbated by the climate crisis.” - Seth Mullendore, Clean Energy Group###"

If current conflict trends continue, the 21st century will be defined by an ever-rising population of people forced to flee their homes and by increasingly limited options for them to turn to.”Washington (August 31, 2022) — Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) today joined nine of his colleagues led by Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.) in sending a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas asking for clarity on plans for rebuilding the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). “At this critical moment for refugees around the world, the U.S.’s moral and legal obligation to our longstanding, bipartisan refugee resettlement program has never been more important,” the senators wrote. “We welcomed Executive Order (EO14013) on rebuilding and enhancing programs to resettle refugees in February 2021, which was desperately needed to address the harm inflicted on the program by the previous administration. This Administration has faced significant challenges in this work, including the numerous discriminatory policies enacted by the previous administration, the implications of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the need to evacuate over 70,000 Afghans through Operation Allies Welcome.”“Through your leadership of this interagency effort, we urge you to rapidly adjudicate refugee cases, in particular family reunification cases; to prioritize the implementation of reforms outlined in Executive Order 14013; and to collaborate substantively with Congress and with the refugee resettlement agencies to increase the pace of this work.” The senators include more than a dozen questions seeking more details on processing capacity of the USRAP, as the consultation process for the FY23 Presidential Determination begins.In addition to Markey, the letter was also signed by Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Pat Leahy (D-Vt.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).Read a copy of the letter HERE.“The current Administration has taken important steps to rebuild the USRAP. But thousands of refugees have been waiting their turn for years, and for some time is running out. They’ve lost years that they could have spent rebuilding their lives and enriching our communities. Instead, they wait, they struggle, and try not to lose hope. As the world only gets more dangerous for religious minorities, political activists, women leaders, and others who face persecution, we call on the Administration to aim high with an FY23 admissions goal of 200,000. We look to our champions in Congress to provide resources to achieve this target. Now is the moment for the U.S. to reclaim its position as a leader in refugee resettlement,” said Melanie Nezer, Senior Vice President of Global Public Affairs, HIAS.""The need to rebuild and strengthen the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program has never been greater. As we face the worst refugee crisis in history, the United States has a moral obligation to invest in our capacity to welcome and make the necessary improvements to increase refugee arrivals,"" said Meredith Owen, Director of Policy and Advocacy at Church World Service. ""CWS calls on the administration to meaningfully consult with Congress and set the FY 2023 refugee admissions goal of 200,000, in line with global need. before September 30th. An admissions goal of 200,000 will signal to the world that the United States is serious about restoring moral leadership and will show allies that we’re committed to doing our part.""###"

Markey (D-Mass.), Chair of the Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate, and Nuclear Safety in the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW), and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) urging the Commission to prioritize public safety and increase community engagement in the process for decommissioning nuclear power facilities, like those in Plymouth, Massachusetts and across the country.  In response to its public comment period for the proposed decommissioning rule, “Regulatory Improvements for Production and Utilization Facilities Transitioning to Decommissioning,” the senators sent a letter this week urging the NRC to make meaningful changes to the proposed rule to ensure that the final rule requires formal NRC approval of a licensee’s post-shutdown decommissioning activities report (PSDAR)—an action that would require an up-to-date environmental review and meaningful public hearing rights—and the maintenance of emergency planning requirements until all spent fuel is moved out of spent fuel pools and into safer dry cask storage. Currently, the proposed rule issued by the NRC would not require that the Commission approve these complex decommissioning plans, and would not provide affected state and local stakeholders with any rights to participate in an adjudicatory process nor receive any response to their comments or concerns. The NRC’s current rule would also unacceptably risk shifting costs onto local communities that seek to follow the best-practice guidelines laid out by the Federal Emergency Management Agency for radioactive hazard response planning.“This rulemaking presents a critical opportunity to restore the public’s trust in the Commission’s ability to prioritize community safety over efficiency,” wrote the senators. “By requiring formal NRC approval of PSDARs and maintaining emergency planning requirements until all spent fuel is moved into spent fuel pools, the Commission can take a meaningful step in that direction, promote transparency, and protect public safety.”A copy of the letter can be found HERE.Senators Markey and Warren have consistently urged the NRC to prioritize safety and public participation in the nuclear decommissioning process. This past May, Senator Markey hosted an EPW subcommittee field hearing in Plymouth, Massachusetts with Congressman William R. Keating (MA-09), titled Issues Facing Communities with Decommissioning Nuclear Plants. During the hearing, Senator Markey highlighted deficiencies with the current decommissioning rule and secured environmental and financial protections for the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station from Holtec International, the company charged with the decommissioning of the plant.Additionally, this past January, Senators Markey and Warren, alongside Representatives William Keating (MA-09) and Seth Moulton (MA-06), wrote to Holtec to express their opposition to the proposed discharge of radioactive water from Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station into Cape Cod Bay.Senator Markey has repeatedly urged the NRC to improve previous iterations of the decommissioning rule. In June 2021, he sent a letter to the Commission urging the agency to address safety and security concerns before approving the draft rule.As the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station commenced its decommissioning process, the senators continued to fight to ensure that the NRC prioritized safety and public participation. In August 2019, Senators Markey and Warren and Representative William Keating (MA-09) wrote to the NRC to urge it to delay ruling on the proposed license transfer for Pilgrim from Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. to Holtec until after the Commission considered and ruled on extant petitions and motions. In October 2018, Senator Markey and Representative Keating demanded clear details from Holtec and Entergy about the safety and security issues involved in the ownership, transfer, and eventual decommissioning of the power plant.###"
https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-warren-demand-stronger-leadership-increased-investment-in-mbta-in-response-to-fta-findings,"Washington (August 31, 2022) – Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), member of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) released the following statement in response to the Federal Transit Administration report on the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA): “The Federal Transit Administration’s report underscores what we already know: the MBTA’s current crises are the unprecedented consequences of systemic negligence, underinvestment, and mismanagement of Greater Boston’s public transit system. It is shameful for the first public transportation system in our country to have reached this entirely preventable point, where deep service cuts and wholesale shutdowns of subway lines are deemed necessary to get the T back on track. It is unacceptable that the MBTA has forced riders to carry the burden of the Baker Administration’s failures.“The FTA’s investigation and the Orange and Green Line shutdowns demonstrate our deep need for a transit system that is truly a public good and effectively serves the needs of the residents of Massachusetts, especially the Black, brown, disabled, low-income, and other marginalized communities who disproportionately ride the T. Building a safer, more accessible, and more reliable T will require partnership from federal, state, and municipal government offices, as well as advocates and riders who know better than anyone how public transit shapes our lives.“While the FTA should remain an active player in helping fix the T, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts must take seriously its role in conducting robust safety oversight of the MBTA by using the tools the Department of Public Utilities already has as an oversight agency and incorporating the key perspectives of local and municipal leaders. In Congress, we will keep fighting for bold federal investments to make the T safe, sustainable, accessible, reliable, and free. We are proud to have secured over $580 million in federal funding for the MBTA this year, in addition to billions of dollars in federal formula funding that will come to the state over the next five years, and we will continue to ensure that Massachusetts sees the immense benefits of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.” ### "

Markey (D-Mass.) joined ten of his colleagues led by Senator Cory Booker (D-N.J.) in urging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to track and address racial disparities in the nation’s public health response to the monkeypox virus (MPV).“Similar to the COVID-19 outbreak, the U.S. monkeypox outbreak is disproportionately affecting Black and Latino Americans,” wrote the Senators in a letter to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. “At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, limited data/reporting on cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and tests disaggregated by race or ethnicity made it difficult to assess its implications across communities….Over time, federal, state and local data showed that the majority of COVID-19 cases and fatalities affected people of color, with most illnesses and deaths occurring in regions with higher percentages of Black and Latino populations.” “The devastating racial and ethnic disparities during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic underscored the underlying social, economic, and health inequality that has long existed within our health care system due to racial and discriminatory systemic and structural barriers, and the disparities began to narrow with targeted education, outreach, and resource distribution,” continued the Senators. The Senators highlighted that existing racial disparities and inequities in health outcomes and health care continue to be seen with the spread of MPV across the country. As of the end of July, Black and Latino people accounted for 26% and 32% of MPV cases with known race and ethnicity information, respectively. Public health experts have expressed concern over the fact that white men appear to be receiving a disproportionately higher share of the MPV vaccine nationally which is undermining efforts to safeguard communities that are more susceptible and have less access to medical resources. “Lack of racially and ethnically disaggregated data on both diagnosis and treatment of MPV will exacerbate existing health disparities and result in the loss of lives in vulnerable communities,” highlighted the Senators. The Senators noted that “Limited state data that is available shows that we are headed towards a concerning trend.” A report issued by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services shows that although 70% of MPV cases are in Black men, Black North Carolinians have received less than a quarter of the vaccinations so far. Similar trends are cited in the letter for New Jersey, Atlanta metro area, and Chicago. “Vaccine access must be equitable, even in the face of high demand,” urged the Senators. “Any federal targeted response and aid must not inadvertently stigmatize the ongoing public health crisis, but there should be intentional outreach to get resources to impacted communities. The implementation of a rapid and efficient vaccination program is essential to containing and eradicating MPV in communities across the United States. Collecting quality data is crucial to direct our vaccination and testing in the proper directions.”The letter was cosigned by Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Dr. Rev. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.).Full text of the letter can be found here.###"

McGovern (MA-02), Bill Keating (MA-09), Lori Trahan (MA-03), and Jake Auchincloss (MA-04) today announced that Massachusetts towns will receive over $2 million in FY2021 funding from FEMA as a part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grants.“Massachusetts firefighters are our frontline defense against climate disasters,” said Senator Ed Markey. “This critical funding will ensure that fire departments across our Commonwealth have the support they need to acquire life-saving equipment, train the next generation of first responders, and fight back against fires and accidents that too often put Massachusetts families in harm’s way.”“Firefighters in the Commonwealth and across the country put their lives on the line every day in order to keep our families safe, and we need to make sure they have our full support,"" said Senator Elizabeth Warren. ""Federal grants like these will help keep our brave first responders safe and ensure that our local fire departments have the training, equipment, and resources they need to continue protecting our communities.""“Assistance to Firefighters Grants fund critically needed investments in fire stations across our country,” said Congressman Richard E. Neal, Chair of the House Committee on Ways and Means. “The awards in this round will benefit North Adams, Wilbraham, and Ludlow as well as the communities they serve with more funding for training and lifesaving equipment. I continue to support these programs through FEMA because we all benefit from their investment.”“Firefighters across the Commonwealth put themselves at risk every day to protect us, and it’s our responsibility to ensure they have the resources they need to do their job in the safest way possible,” said Chairman James P. McGovern. “I’m grateful that this grant will help the Northborough Fire Department make critical equipment updates that will have a lasting impact on the safety of our community, and I will keep fighting in Congress to make sure we support our firefighters in every way we can.”“This federal funding for firefighters continues to be a lifeline for our communities,” said Congressman Bill Keating. “From new equipment to additional training, it’s imperative ensure those who protect us are protected themselves.”“I couldn’t be more thrilled to see the fire departments in Ayer and Stow receive this critical federal investment,” said Congresswoman Lori Trahan. “Not only will this funding support the brave firefighters who work around the clock to keep their communities safe, but the new vehicle extrication and training equipment will also help save lives. I’m proud of the work we’ve done to increase federal investments that support our brave firefighters, and I look forward to continuing our work with local departments to make sure they get the funding they need.”“This grant will enable Newton’s Fire Department to recruit and train more firefighters, as well as fund mental wellness support for our front-line responders as they work to keep our city safe,” said Congressman Jake Auchincloss.The grants will help provide various towns in Massachusetts with funding for firefighter training, CPR devices, and firefighter extrication equipment. This aid was awarded to towns across the Commonwealth as part of the FY2021 Assistance to Firefighters Grants funding from FEMA.###"

Markey (D-Mass.) issued the following statement after President Biden announced the cancellation of $10,000 in federal student loans for qualified borrowers, the cancellation of $20,000 in student loans for Pell Grant recipients, and the continued extension of student loan repayments through the end of 2022:“For many Americans, the promise of higher education is dragged down by the burden of overwhelming student debt. Today, tens of millions of Americans with student loan debt are breathing a sigh of relief thanks to President Biden’s decision to cancel $10,000 in debt for borrowers across the country, cancel $20,000 in debt for Pell Grant recipients, and extend the student loan repayment pause for all borrowers through the end of the year as families get back on their feet from the economic strain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.“Today’s action by the President relieves a significant burden saddling the household budgets of working- and middle-class Americans, and one that disproportionately affects borrowers of color who face an uphill and unequal challenge in debt repayment. As our economy regains steam as we emerge from the darkest days of the COVID-19 crisis, canceling billions of dollars in student debt will have a positive effect that will reverberate throughout our economy.  “As we celebrate this important step toward economic equity for working families and communities of color, we look ahead to additional steps Congress and the Administration can take to buoy families who face the burden of debt. We must also lower the cost of higher education, so that no young person who seeks to grow their mind and their horizons through higher education is encumbered by daunting debt for years – and even decades – after their graduation.” ###"
https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/markey-booker-gillibrand-sanders-warren-urge-epa-and-usda-to-limit-new-incentives-for-factory-farm-biodigesters,"In two separate letters, Senators caution that new incentives for methane biodigesters on industrial livestock operations will worsen environmental justice impacts from factory farmsWashington (August 24, 2022) — Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) warned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) against providing new electrification pathways under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for methane biogas from factory farms, and separately expressed concern about plans at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to rely heavily on methane digesters to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector.The Senators are specifically concerned that efforts at both agencies will increase the number of methane digesters used in industrial livestock operations, which will have unintended negative consequences for agriculture industry consolidation and for environmental justice.In a letter to EPA Administrator Regan, the Senators raise concerns about a forthcoming decision at the EPA regarding implementation of certain electrification pathways under the RFS. “One of the potential RFS electrification pathways could allow methane biogas from Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) to serve as a qualified feedstock and generate electric renewable identification numbers (e-RINs) under the RFS’ cellulosic mandate,” the Senators wrote. “While we appreciate this administration’s support for electric vehicles (EVs) and transportation electrification, we also urge EPA to ensure that this federal support does not come at the expense of environmental justice communities that are already overburdened with pollution.”In a separate letter to USDA Secretary Vilsack, the Senators requested additional information about the agency’s Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan for livestock emissions, which relies heavily on expanding the use of methane digesters on factory farms. “To our knowledge, USDA has not yet produced evidence that subsidizing manure digesters will reduce absolute emissions from the agriculture sector, which is the top source of U.S. methane emissions,” the Senators wrote. “Additionally, we remain concerned that USDA has not fully explored or produced evidence of the impacts of manure methane digesters on other key issues. These issues include co-pollutants of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), food system concentration, public health, and heightened community risks for rural, low-income, agricultural-dependent, and Black and Brown communities.”The letter to EPA can be viewed here and the USDA letter can be viewed here.###"
https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/markey-colleagues-call-on-biden-administration-to-extend-pslf-waiver-deadline,"Washington (August 23, 2022) — Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) joined his colleagues led by Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Chair of the Senate HELP Committee, Tim Kaine (D-Va.), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), alongside U.S. Representatives John Sarbanes (D-Md.-03), Joe Courtney (D-Conn.-02), Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.-05), and Kathy Manning (D-N.C.-06), in urging Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona to extend the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) waiver deadline until at least July 1, 2023, when the Department’s proposed rules to improve and expand federal student debt relief programs, including PSLF, are currently on track to take effect. Extending the waiver would help ensure more public servants are able to benefit from the historic waiver that has already resulted in over $9 billion in forgiveness for more than 146,000 public servants and more than 1 million borrowers receiving, on average, one additional year of credit toward PSLF. The extension would also help the agency minimize confusion among borrowers while it conducts a one-time account adjustment later this year and finalizes its proposed PSLF rule.“The PSLF waiver announced by the Department last October was designed to ‘overhaul’ the PSLF program and ‘make it live up to its promise’ by allowing ‘all payments by student borrowers to count toward PSLF, regardless of loan program or payment plan,’” wrote the lawmakers to Secretary Cardona. “To date, the waiver has been overwhelmingly successful in reducing barriers for borrowers to receive PSLF relief—accounting for almost all (89%) of the borrowers who have received forgiveness through the PSLF program through June 30, 2022.”The lawmakers pointed out that data makes it clear that only a fraction of the public servants who are eligible for PSLF have utilized the current waiver. As of the end of June, the Department only has information from 1.3 million PSLF borrowers with eligible employment and positive loan balances, compared to the 9 million public service workers that the Student Borrower Protection Center identified earlier this year who could potentially be eligible for PSLF.“For many borrowers, the Department’s one-time review to fix forbearance and deferment failures, scheduled for later this year—potentially afterOctober 31, 2022—may be the first time that they learn that certain periods of deferment and forbearance could count toward both income-driven repayment (IDR) and PSLF programs,” added the lawmakers. “…For many public servants, losing access to the PSLF waiver before they are able to benefit from the IDR payment adjustment could prevent them from being able to pursue forgiveness under PSLF.”The lawmakers highlighted how extending the PSLF waiver will also allow more military service members and federal employees to make progress towards achieving loan forgiveness through the PSLF program. Reporting shows that military service members face troubling administrative hurdles in certifying their employment for the PSLF program. By extending the PSLF waiver, more military service members and federal employees can benefit – maximizing the promise of the PSLF waiver.“[W]e also ask that the Department increase its outreach to public servants and borrowers to ensure that they are aware of the waiver and understand eligibility requirements, and correct any misinformation about the waiver being communicated by student loan servicers,” concluded the lawmakers.In addition to Senator Markey, Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.)

But it is just that—temporary—and it leaves borrowers in limbo as we wait for new regulations to take effect next year,” said Randi Weingarten, President of American Federation of Teachers. “Let’s be clear, everyone who received the debt relief was promised it. This waiver was a critical step toward healing a broken student loan system that has pauperized a generation. We need to take it one step further and extend it. The people who are benefiting from this moment of relief are the same people who carried us through a pandemic—we need to honor their commitment and extend the deadline for the PSLF waiver.” “No matter what we look like, where we live, or what’s in our bank accounts, all of us should be able to pursue our dreams at an affordable college or university. But for too long, the cost of college has forced many students and families to forego their education goals or be trapped in a lifetime of debt. When educators are unable to repay their student debt, it means fewer educators in the profession, and more disruptions for their students,” said Becky Pringle, President of the National Education Association. “We are overwhelmingly grateful for the waiver that has allowed thousands of educators to receive the promise of PSLF, but there are simply too many educators who have been left out to end the waiver now. We implore the Biden Administration to keep the promise of PSLF and extend the waiver deadline.”“Public service workers make incredible sacrifices every day to strengthen their communities – and never more so than during the last two and a half years of this pandemic. The least we can do is ease their overwhelming student debt burden, much of which they have incurred while getting the skills and education they need to be better at their essential jobs,” said President Lee Saunders, President of AFSCME. “So many AFSCME members have benefitted from the Biden administration’s temporary waiver that expanded eligibility for loan forgiveness. But we are only scratching the surface of the need. It is time to extend the deadline and give more public service workers the time to learn about the program, apply for loan forgiveness and get the relief they need.”“The Administration's overhaul of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is just hitting its stride--delivering debt relief to educators and healthcare workers who are still reeling from the pandemic and its aftermath,” said Mike Pierce, Executive Director of the Student Borrower Protection Center. “We strongly urge President Biden to listen to Senators Menendez, Murray, Kaine, and Gillibrand, Representatives Sarbanes, Courtney, Hayes, Manning, and more than 100 of their colleagues: keep your promise to cancel student debt for every public service worker who is eligible, no matter how long it takes.” This effort is supported by 74 outside organizations, including: The School Superintendents Association (AASA), AccessLex Institute, Accountable.us, Alaska Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), American Alliance of Museums, American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare (AASWSW), American Association of University Women (AAUW), American Association of Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC), American Council on Education (ACE), American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees (AFSCME), American Federation of Teachers (AFT), American Psychological Association (APA), Americans for Financial Reform (AFR), Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance , Association of Young Americans (AYA), Association of Oncology Social Work (AOSW), Center for American Progress (CAP), Center for Economic Integrity, Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP), Chicago Foundation for Women (CFW), Civil Service Bar Association, Coalition of Black Trade Unionists (CBTU), Communication Workers of America Union (CWA), Community Service Society of New York, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America (CFA), Council of Graduate Schools (CGS), Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), Equal Justice Works (EJW), Fosterus, Hispanic Federation, Housing and Economic Rights Advocates (HERA), International Association of Firefighters, International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), Jewish Federations of North America, Labor Council for Latin American Advancement (LCLAA), Legal Aid at Work, Loan Assistance Repayment Program of Minnesota, Maine Center for Economic Policy, Maryland Center for Collegiate Financial Wellness, National Action Network Washington Bureau, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), National Association of Social Workers, National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA), National Association of Consumer Advocates, National Association of Deans and Directors of Social Work, National Council of Nonprofits, National Education Association (NEA), National Employment Law Project (NELP), National Military Family Association, National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), National Women's Law Center (NWLC), Network of Jewish Human Service Agencies, New America, New Jersey Citizen Action, New Leaders, New York Legal Assistance Group (NYLAG), Nonprofit Professional Employees Union (NPEU)—IFPTE Local 70, OCA – Asian Pacific American Advocates, ParentsTogether, People's Parity Party, Physician Assistant Education Association (PAEA), Public Law Center, Social Current, Student Borrower Protection Center (SBPC), Student Debt Crisis Center, The Arc of the United States, The Debt Collective, The Education Trust, The Institute for College Access & Success (TICAS), UnidosUS, Virginia Poverty Law Center, Voices for National Service, and Zero Debt Massachusetts.Read a copy of the letter HERE. ###"

Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, sent letters to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) urging them to act in response to whistleblower allegations that Twitter has misled investors, users, and federal regulators regarding the social media platform’s serious and unresolved security risks. According to new reporting from the Washington Post, the platform’s former head of security Peiter Zatko alleges the company failed to implement adequate security practices and left users’ data vulnerable.“According to Peiter Zatko, Twitter’s former head of security, Twitter has systematically and repeatedly failed to take basic security measures to protect its user data and has misled investors, regulators, and the public about the strength of its security systems,” said Senator Markey. “These alarming allegations suggest that Twitter has again flagrantly violated its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission.”These allegations come just months after Twitter agreed in May to pay $150 million to settle allegations by DOJ and FTC that the company violated the 2011 FTC settlement by utilizing its users’ telephone numbers and email addresses for marketing, after telling users that Twitter would only use that personal information for security purposes.“Unsurprisingly, then, Twitter has continued to suffer embarrassing security incidents and face ongoing scrutiny for misleading users and regulators,” Senator Markey continued. “This blithe disregard for user data and FTC settlements cannot stand. I strongly urge the federal government to investigate Zatko’s claims and, if necessary, take strong and swift action against Twitter to ensure Twitter user data is properly protected.”Read a copy of the letter HERE.###"

This bill authorizes funding for data collection on the disproportionate environmental and climate harms as well as the cumulative impacts of pollution and rising temperatures. It also requires that funding be used to help ensure tracking and mapping tools will be accessible to those in the community. This data will assist the Biden administration and Congress in directing at least 40 percent of investments for a clean and climate-safe future into communities that have been harmed by racist and unjust environmental practices. “When taking action on the climate crisis, it is critical that we prioritize our frontline communities – disproportionately Black, brown, and Indigenous communities – who continue to face the brunt of the effects of climate change. This is why we worked hard to ensure that funding for our Environmental Justice Mapping and Data Collection Act was included in the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Biden last week. Our bill will take ground-breaking steps toward identifying the location, effects, and makeup of these frontline communities. Knowledge is power, and understanding the full scope of the climate crisis’s impact is necessary for connecting people with tangible policy solutions and the investments needed to fully address environmental racism.“Even though the Inflation Reduction Act isn’t the legislation we would have written ourselves and doesn’t deliver all that we believe it could have, we see the inclusion of our bill as important progress toward achieving environmental justice and equity.  Environmental justice communities, organizers, and advocates must have a seat at the table in determining the solutions that will benefit their families, and we will continue to work together with grassroots leaders to ensure that our work does not stop here. This is only the beginning of our efforts at the federal level to prioritize equitable investments in environmental justice.”###"

Markey (D-Mass.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations East Asia, Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Subcommittee, and Representatives John Garamendi (CA-03), Don Beyer (VA-08), Alan Lowenthal (CA-47), and Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen (AS) concluded their Congressional delegation travel to Asia in the Philippines. The visit to the Philippines was Senator Markey’s first since he was banned from visiting by the previous government for his vocal stance condemning the human rights offenses of former President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte.During their visit, the delegation met with the U.S. Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Heather Variava and other U.S. Embassy personnel to discuss U.S.-Philippines relations. The group also met with U.S. Director of the Asian Development Bank Chantale Wong to discuss the bank’s work in the region. On Thursday, the delegation became the first U.S. Congressional delegation to meet with President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. since his inauguration on June 30 of this year. During the meeting, the delegation reaffirmed the important alliance relationship between the two countries, and discussed regional security challenges. Members also discussed ways to support the Philippines transition to renewable energy and address the climate crisis. The delegation raised concerns regarding the human rights record under the previous Government of the Philippines and expressed their hope that President Marcos, Jr. would set a new tone for the importance of human rights and freedom of the press. “The United States remains a steadfast treaty ally of the Philippines and our people-to-people ties are unmatched,” said Senator Markey. “I am pleased to lead the first U.S. Congressional delegation to meet with President Marcos, Jr. and look forward to the promise of a renewed partnership with the newly elected government. I expressed to President Marcos my hope that he will turn the page on the human rights abuses of the previous government.” Senator Markey and his colleagues later met with participants in the Aling Tindera network, which receives funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Clean Cities, Blue Ocean initiative. Aling Tindera provides a funding stream for local women-owned stores to serve as collection points for post-consumer plastic waste, thereby diverting it from the environment.The delegation also met with the Secretary of Foreign Affairs Enrique Manalo and Secretary of Justice Jesus Crispin Remulla. During these meetings, the delegation discussed a range of issues including cooperation on renewable energy, U.S. support for human rights, press freedom, and LGBTQIA+ rights, and regional security issues, including the South China Sea.The delegation met with members of the press from Rappler, the news organization founded by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Ressa, to hear about the Philippine government’s campaign to close down Rappler and discuss press freedom and human rights. The Philippines remains one of the most dangerous countries in the world to be a journalist.“The courage we have seen from the members of the Philippine press in speaking truth to power is inspiring. A free and independent press is the bedrock of any democracy,” said Senator Markey.On Friday, the delegation concluded their travel by visiting with former Senator Leila de Lima, who remains imprisoned on politically motivated charges.Senator Markey continued, “For too long, Senator Leila de Lima has been held on politically motivated charges. Despite this, her spirit remains undiminished. I call on the new government to release her and drop all charges without delay.”###"

Markey (D-Mass.) and Representatives Lori Trahan (MA-03) and Seth Moulton (MA-06) announced today that the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) will receive $7.6 million in additional federal funding to support a proposed project to replace the century-old South Elm Street Bridge with a modern two-track rail bridge in Haverhill. The bridge is used by Amtrak’s Downeaster service and the MBTA’s commuter rail service between Boston and Haverhill. The funding will be received through the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Federal-State Partnership Grant.“The Orange Line shutdown has made clear that delaying repairs and renovation today means depriving riders of reliable and safe service in the future,” said Senator Markey. “As officials work tirelessly to improve service on the T and address safety concerns, I am proud to join my colleagues in announcing additional federal funding to support the T in its ongoing effort to modernize. I will continue working to secure the funding and resources necessary to improve Massachusetts public transit and put riders first.”“Like so many bridges in Haverhill, the century-old South Elm Street Bridge is in serious need of repair. And much like the Basiliere Bridge just up the street, we’re delivering the federal funding to get it done,” said Congresswoman Lori Trahan. “I’m proud to deliver this investment to renovate this critical transit artery in the city, and I’m grateful to our partners at MassDOT who will see the project through to completion.”“It’s no secret that the MBTA is in a state of crisis. With the orange line shutdown imminent, we need to take every step possible to make our public transit safer and more reliable for riders across our region,” said Congressman Seth Moulton. “This funding for a new two-track rail bridge in Haverhill is the type of smart investment we need right now. I look forward to working with my colleagues to secure additional resources for more of these critical improvements in the future.”In March, the lawmakers were joined by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Representative Stephen Lynch (MA-08), and Assistant Speaker of the House Katherine Clark (MA-05) in writing to the Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration expressing support for the MBTA’s Federal-State Partnership Grant application.On Tuesday, DOT’s Federal Transit Administration announced the MBTA received a $116 million grant from its Low or No Emissions Vehicle Program to support the authority’s transition to a battery-electric bus fleet. The announcement leaves the MBTA and New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority tied as the largest recipients of program funding. Massachusetts also received more than $537 million in April from the Federal Transit Administration to support public transit across the region.###"

Markey (D-Mass.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations East Asia, Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Subcommittee, and Representatives John Garamendi (CA-03), Don Beyer (VA-08), Alan Lowenthal (CA-47), and Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen (AS) visited Cambodia as part of their ongoing visit to Asia. During their visit, the delegation met with the U.S. Embassy to Cambodia’s Chargé d’affaires Benjamin Wohlauer to discuss U.S.-Cambodia relations.On Tuesday, the delegation met with more than a dozen government officials and legislators including Minister of Public Works and Transportation Sun Chanthol and National Assembly Member Sous Yara. During the meeting, Senator Markeyurged the Cambodian government to protect human rights, political freedoms, and free speech. He implored the government to release political prisoners including Cambodian-American activist Theary Seng, and to allow for free participation in elections. The delegation also discussed ways that the United States can support Cambodia’s international climate change commitments and transition to renewable energy. The two governments discussed the Chinese military presence within Cambodia and the delegation raised concerns in particular about reports that the People’s Liberation Army is building a base for Chinese use at the Ream Naval Base. “As evidenced by the large and prosperous Cambodian-American community in Massachusetts, the Cambodian people have an incredible will and spirit that has helped them overcome the tragedy of Cambodia’s civil war,” said Senator Markey. “The Government of Cambodia must live up to the promise of the 1991 Paris Peace Agreements and embrace the freedoms of expression, civil and political rights that were so hard fought. Cambodians overcame decades of war and chaos that cost the country millions of lives, and deserve to enjoy the democratic freedoms they were promised. The government must release political prisoners, end the crackdown against opposition parties, and allow for freedom of expression and a free press. They should be skeptical of Chinese military ambitions in Cambodia and prevent any base for use by the PLA, which is prohibited by the Cambodian constitution.”The delegation also met with members of civil society to discuss climate change, press freedom, labor and land right issues, and political participation.Senator Markey continued, “Cambodia is ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change. Young Cambodians understand that their land is their future. Without robust action, climate change could shrink Cambodia’s economy by nearly 10 percent by 2050. We look forward to working with Cambodia to support investments in clean energy, climate resilience, and assistance for adaptation and mitigation to strengthen its economy and build upon our nations’ relationship.” The delegation also had a meeting with Cambodian opposition leader Kem Sokha, who has been charged by the government with politically motivated accusations of treason. Despite five years of harassment and charges, he continues to speak out in support of freedom for all Cambodians. “I thank Mr. Kem Sokha for his bravery and willingness to continue to stand up for the rights of all Cambodians despite ongoing harassment by the government,” said Senator Markey. “All charges against him should be dropped immediately, and he and the Cambodia National Rescue Party should be free to participate in elections.”On Wednesday, the delegation visited UNESCO World Heritage site Angkor Wat.In July, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously passed Senator Markey’s bipartisan Cambodia Democracy and Human Rights Act.The legislation targets officials engaged in abuses and corruption that undermine democracy and human rights in Cambodia. Under Prime Minister Hun Sen’s leadership, the ruling Cambodian People’s Party has maintained one-party control of the government – in violation of the Cambodian constitution – through corruption, banning political opposition, political persecutions, repressive laws, and cracking down on free speech and independent media."
https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/massachusetts-delegationintroduces-resolution-honoring-the-life-and-legacy-of-bill-russell,"Washington (August 17, 2022) – Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) led the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation in introducing a resolution honoring Boston Celtics legend William “Bill” Felton Russell. Russell was the number two pick in the 1956 NBA draft. A decade later, he became a player-coach for the Celtics and the first Black head coach of a major U.S. professional sports team. In his 13-year career with the Celtics, he led the team to 11 NBA championships, won the NBA’s most valuable player award five times, and was a 12-time All Star. The introduction follows an announcement from the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) that Russell’s uniform No. 6 will be permanently retired across the NBA.Russell matched his achievements on the basketball court with an enduring commitment to advancing civil rights and racial justice in America. In 1963, Russell marched with the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in Washington. That same year, Russell encouraged demonstrations against the segregation of Boston public schools. And in 1967, he took part in the Cleveland Summit to join Black athletes supporting Muhammad Ali’s refusal to enter the military after he was drafted to fight in the Vietnam War. For these efforts and more, in 2011 President Barack Obama awarded Bill Russell the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in America.“Bill Russell was a hero, a disruptor, a leader, a giant,” said Senator Markey. “He was brilliance, fairness, and justice personified. The greatest winner in the history of all sports and the conscience of our city and country. We honor Bill Russell’s legacy as a Celtic, a champion, and a crusader. With a heavy heart, we express our deepest condolences to his friends and family and his fans for this loss.”“Bill Russell was a legend on and off the court,” said Senator Warren. “Not only did he help lead the Celtics to an astounding 11 NBA championships, but he was also committed to courageous and righteous fights—marching alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., speaking out against segregation in Boston public schools during the prime of his career, and regularly championing civil rights and racial justice. I’m thankful to partner with Senator Markey and Representative Pressley to honor his legacy.”“Bill Russell was an undisputed champion both on the court and off, and he was an unapologetic advocate for a more just and equitable world. But most importantly, he was a man with a family and beloved community,” said Congresswoman Pressley. “Congressional intent is powerful, and a resolution is a statement of Congress’ appreciation for Bill Russell’s endless contributions throughout his lifetime. I give my heartfelt condolences to his loved ones. May he rest in peace & power.”“Bill Russell stands alone as the greatest champion in the history of team sports. He was a remarkable 21-0 in winner take all games, and my personal favorite athlete of all time. But what sets him apart from everyone else was his lifetime of activism for civil rights,” said Congressman Bill Keating. “Bill Russell never cowered from speaking up for what was right and just, and his legacy is so much more than that of a Celtics’ legend – his legacy is that of a giant who never cowered from risking it all to make our world a better place.”“Bill Russell stood taller than anyone on the basketball court, and he had the courage to risk his celebrity to stand up for justice in Boston and across the United States,” Congressman Seth Moulton said.  “Yes, we are grateful that the greatest champion in sports is a Celtic, but we are also thankful he was an unparalleled champion for the rights and dignity of all of us. May he rest in power.”“For so many here in Massachusetts and across our nation, Bill Russell is an inspiration. Those of us who have followed Bill’s career for decades know that both on and off the court, he always worked to improve the people around him,” said Congresswoman Lori Trahan. “There’s no question that our Commonwealth and our country are better off today because of his tenacity, his advocacy, and his leadership. I’m honored to join with my colleagues to introduce this resolution to honor Bill’s life and legacy.”Read the full text of the resolution HERE.###"

Markey (D-Mass.) led members of the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation today in celebrating the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) announcement that it will award $189 million in federal transportation grants to finance capital projects and support the transition of Massachusetts transit authorities’ fleets to the lowest polluting and most energy efficient buses.“These federal investments will help ensure that Massachusetts families have accessible, affordable, and efficient public transit fit for the 21st century,” said Senator Markey. “As transportation remains the top polluting sector in our Commonwealth, transitioning to a more efficient bus fleet is a critical step toward achieving the emissions reductions we need for a healthier, more livable future.”“Congratulations to the five recipients for receiving these federal transportation grants and to Massachusetts for the second highest amount of funding in the country! These grants will help build the next generation of green public transit across our state by investing in electric and low-emissions buses that will make commutes more reliable and our air cleaner,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren.“Reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to clean energy is critical to our fight against climate change,” said Assistant Speaker Katherine Clark. “By electrifying our public transportation system, we are improving the quality of our air, improving the health of our communities, and putting us on a path toward a greener future. I’m thrilled to see this funding come to Massachusetts.”“The Pioneer Valley Transit Authority and the Berkshire Regional Transit Authority are committed to reducing pollution and ensuring greener fleets,” said Congressman Richard E. Neal, Chair of the House Committee on Ways and Means. “This funding will go a long way in assuring that they are able to fulfill their missions while ensuring that riders have safe, affordable, and reliable transportation.”“Climate change remains one of the most existential threats to the future of our planet,” said Congressman James P. McGovern, Chair of the House Rules Committee. “By investing in zero- and low-emission bus fleets, Massachusetts affirms itself as a national leader in taking the bold and aggressive action necessary to address the damage caused by human action on our environment. By increasing transit energy efficiency, this funding reduces America’s dependency on Big Oil, contributing to the more sustainable and cleaner future our children deserve.”“Now is the time for Massachusetts to make bold investments into cleaner, more sustainable transportation options. This funding for zero- and low-emission buses will help to improve air quality while giving riders more reliability,” said Congressman Seth Moulton. “This is an important step on the way to rebuilding the modern infrastructure that our state deserves.”“I’m thrilled to see this transformative investment in the Commonwealth’s transition to low- and zero-emission transportation options,” said Congresswoman Lori Trahan. “Thanks to this federal funding, Massachusetts will continue our leadership in clean, modern, and affordable transit that every resident can afford.”“Climate change is an existential threat and it’s imperative that we advance policies and investments to confront it head on,” said Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley. “With communities of color bearing the disparate brunt of both environmental and transit injustice, electrifying our bus fleets in the Massachusetts 7th will be a necessary step towards making our transit systems more sustainable and accessible. I’m glad to see this money come to Massachusetts and I am grateful to Senator Markey and our delegation colleagues for their partnership.”The Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA) will receive a grant from FTA’s Buses and Bus Facilities Competitive Program to finance buses and bus facilities capital projects. The Berkshire Regional Transit Authority (BRTA), the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), the Southeastern Regional Transit Authority (SRTA), and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) will each receive a grant from FTA’s Low or No Emissions Vehicle Program to support their efforts in purchasing and leasing zero-emission and low-emission transit buses.Specifically, these grants would provide: In June, Senator Markey joined his colleagues Assistant Speaker Katherine Clark (MA-05), Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) in sending a letter to FTA Administrator Nuria Fernandez in support of the MBTA’s application to the Low or No Emissions Vehicle Program and Bus and Bus Facilities Program.###"

Markey (D-Mass.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations East Asia, Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Subcommittee, kicked off his Congressional delegation trip to Asia in South Korea this week, where he reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to the U.S.-South Korea alliance and explored ways to mutually address some of the most challenging global issues: the climate crisis, security on the Korean peninsula, and resilient supply chains. As a co-chair of the bicameral Congressional Nuclear Weapons and Arms Control Working Group, the Senator visited the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea where he received a security briefing from senior military officials and toured the Joint Security Area.During his trip to South Korea, Senator Markey met with President of South Korea Yoon Suk-yeol to discuss shared efforts to strengthen the U.S.-South Korea alliance, including investment and trade between the two countries, as well as the threat posed by North Korea. The Senator also met with South Korea’s Minister of Unification Kwon Young-se to discuss the dire humanitarian situation in North Korea and with South Korean legislator Representative Tae Yong-ho to hear first-hand his experiences as a North Korean defector and his views on North Korea’s continued nuclear weapons program.   Senator Markey met with the U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Philip Goldberg to discuss U.S.-South Korea relations, and received a briefing from U.S. Forces Korea Commander General Paul LaCamera on security threats in the region. Senator Markey spoke with executives from LG Chem and Hanwha Qcells to discuss U.S.-South Korea collaboration on clean energy technologies.The Senator also met with directors of the Green Climate Fund, a fund established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to discuss the continued importance of global cooperation on finance for climate adaptation and mitigation, as well as the possibilities for the private sector in climate-smart investments.“The U.S.-South Korea alliance is based on shared values and interests – from nuclear disarmament to the fight against climate change, and our commitment to this important relationship is stronger than ever,” said Senator Markey. “Through my meetings with President Yoon and other senior government officials, it was evident that our two countries are prepared to meet existential and pressing global challenges head-on. The size, diversity, and lethality of North Korea’s weapons continues to grow, as does its threat to our allies in the region. In my meetings and my visit to the DMZ, we discussed how to continue multilateral pressure and diplomatic efforts to reach a solution that ensures the American people and our allies are safe from a nuclear Kim regime.”Senator Markey continued, “Our alliance is also rooted in our economic partnership and mutual commitment to advancing a clean-energy 21st century. The historic Inflation Reduction Act will invest $369 billion in climate justice and clean energy technology, create millions of jobs, and reduce our emissions. Together, U.S. and South Korean companies are powering a green revolution – from getting more electric vehicles on the road and into the hands of American consumers, to South Korean companies building solar modules in the United States to help us harness the power of the sun.”In April 2021, Senator Markey and Congressman Levin reintroduced the Enhancing North Korea Humanitarian Assistance Act to require sanctions modifications at the Treasury Department, the State Department, and the United Nations Sanctions Committee on North Korea to ensure that assistance can reach those in need. Next, Senator Markey will travel to Taiwan, where he will be joined by the remainder of the bipartisan Congressional delegation, including co-leaders of the congressional Nuclear Weapons and Arms Control Working Group Congressmen John Garamendi (CA-03) and Don Beyer (VA-08), as well as Congressman Alan Lowenthal (CA-47) and Congresswoman Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen (AS).

Markey (D-Mass.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) sent a letter to Dr. Robert Califf, Commissioner of Food and Drugs at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), asking FDA to initiate a post market study of pulse oximeters and seeking information about the agency’s clearance process for pulse oximeters to ensure they are effective across racially diverse patients and consumers. Recent studies have shown that inaccurate results from pulse oximeters are more likely when used to monitor people of color, particularly patients with darker skin. The device’s inconsistency could have life threatening consequences for patients, and this may have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. One particular study found that patients of color received less supplemental oxygen than their white counterparts due to pulse oximeters’ inaccurate measurements.“There are decades of research showing inaccurate results when pulse oximeters are used to monitor people of color, particularly patients with darker skin,” wrote the lawmakers. “Therefore, we are seeking information from the FDA on your clearance of pulse oximeters and urge the FDA to initiate a post market study for these devices to understand what improvements to the technology will make the devices effective on the full range of human skin pigmentation.”The lawmakers commended FDA’s new safety communication about pulse oximeter accuracy and welcomed the recent news that FDA is planning to convene a public meeting of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee later this year. However, FDA has yet to respond to Senator Warren’s earlier letter, sent in January 2021, which expressed the same concern about the medical risks  people of color face due to the inaccuracy of pulse oximeters. In addition to a post market study, the lawmakers request that the FDA respond fully to a series of  inquiries no later than August 26, 2022.###"

Markey (D-Mass.) joined colleagues from the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation led by Representatives Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) and Seth Moulton (MA-06) in urging Governor Charlie Baker to declare the monkeypox virus (MPV) outbreak a public health emergency in Massachusetts.  Massachusetts currently has one of the nation’s highest counts of confirmed cases.“By declaring a public health emergency, you will have greater flexibility and more tools to enact a whole-of-government response,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter. “There are more than 26,000 vaccines allocated to the Commonwealth, and it is important that you act quickly to prevent the MPV outbreak from escalating, including augmenting health care staff, expediting testing and vaccinations, and informing people on how to reduce their risk of infection.”According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are 26,864 confirmed cases of MPV across the globe and more than 7,100 confirmed cases in the United States. Public health experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, caution that these numbers are very likely an undercount and only represent the tip of the iceberg.The lawmakers urged the governor to work in collaboration with experts and local leaders to ensure a holistic and timely statewide response that will address the needs of all community members.“As a Commonwealth, we need to develop and execute a statewide plan, in partnership with experts and local leaders, that is comprehensive, equitable, and transparent,” the lawmakers continued. “The response to the coronavirus pandemic proved that delayed decision making will only exacerbate the outbreak and threaten the health of the public.”In addition to Senator Markey, the letter was also signed by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Assistant Speaker of the House Katherine Clark (MA-05), and Representatives James P. McGovern (MA-02), Lori Trahan (MA-03), Jake Auchincloss (MA-04), Stephen F. Lynch (MA-08), Richard E. Neal (MA-01) and William R. Keating (MA-09).Read a copy of the letter HERE.###"

It’s time for Congress to meet the moment and act with the urgency that these issues demand by passing my bipartisan legislation, the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act.”The Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act, co-sponsored by Senators Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Commerce Committee members Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), would prohibit internet companies from collecting personal information from anyone 13- to 16-years old without the user’s consent; ban targeted marketing to children; create an online “Eraser Button” by requiring companies to permit users to eliminate personal information from a child or teen; implement a “Digital Marketing Bill of Rights for Minors” that limits the collection of personal information from young users; and establish a first-of-its-kind Youth Privacy and Marketing Division at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which will be responsible for addressing the privacy of children and minors, as well as marketing directed at children and minors.In September 2021, Senator Markey joined Senator Blumenthal in sending a letter to the FTC, calling upon the Commission to advance rulemaking on consumer privacy, bolster civil rights, and establish guardrails on the collection and use of consumer’s personal data.In June 2022, Senator Markey reignited the call for privacy rulemaking in a letter he led to the FTC, urging the Commission to use the full scope of its authority to protect marginalized communities online. In the letter, Senator Markey and his colleagues highlighted how communities of color are particularly vulnerable to discriminatory and harmful online data practices, and urged the FTC to use its rulemaking authority to stop these practices. In the same letter, Senator Markey called on the FTC to use its full authority to combat invasive and discriminatory biometric surveillance tools.###"

Markey (D-Mass.) joined a group of his colleagues led by Senator Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) in sending a letter to Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) urging the Senators to include critical funding to address the monkeypox (MPV)/orthopoxvirus Public Health Emergency (PHE) in any forthcoming legislative package in the 117th Congress. “As of August 9, 2022, there have been over 9,492 confirmed MPV/orthopoxvirus cases in the United States from when the first case in the current outbreak was identified on May 18, 2022,” wrote the Senators. “The current outbreak in the United States is the largest in the world by case count in the current global outbreak—which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization—and the largest in the nation’s history.” In their letter, the Senators spotlight that the United States public health system remains on the frontlines in identifying MPV cases, informing Americans about access to vaccines and therapeutics, and connecting constituents to necessary medical care and resources. Yet this system continues to be strained by the COVID-19 pandemic and underfunded. “MPV testing efforts are currently encountering processing and collection barriers that have led to underreporting of cases and poor data to aid the federal government in directing necessary resources in an appropriate manner,” they continued. “Additionally, as both a prophylaxis and treatment, acquiring and administering vaccines swiftly is crucial to stemming the spread of MPV and protecting all communities across the United States. Finally, clinics and providers are facing additional barriers in clinical services supplies, education for providers to properly identify MPV, vaccines, testing supplies, contact tracing, and community outreach to bolster our public health response to MPV, and ensure that accurate and adequate information is reaching our constituents.” This letter comes less than a month after Merkley led 22 colleagues on a separate letter sounding the alarm on MPV vaccine access inequities.  Senators Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) also joined the letter led by Senator Merkley. In reaction to the Senators’ letter, David C. Harvey, Executive Director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, said: “The nation’s sexual health clinics have been managing frontline testing, treatment, and vaccination for monkeypox without adequate resources, staffing, or supplies, blunting the impact of federal efforts to address the outbreak. The success of the national response hinges on whether these clinics get the resources they need to help patients access expanded testing, treatment, and vaccines.”  Full text of the letter can be found here and follows below: Dear Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell: We write today to express concern over the rising number of monkeypox virus (hereon referred to as MPV) cases in the United States, and to urge you to include funding to address this Public Health Emergency (PHE) in any forthcoming legislative package in the 117th Congress. As of August 9, 2022, there have been over 9,492 confirmed MPV/orthopoxvirus cases in the United States from when the first case in the current outbreak was identified on May 18, 2022. The current outbreak in the United States is the largest in the world by case count in the current global outbreak—which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization—and the largest in the nation’s history. As such, the outbreak was declared a national PHE by the Department of Health and Human Services on August 4, 2022. Nevertheless, we recognize that many experts have stated that the current number of cases is likely an undercount due to a gap in provider knowledge, limited access to information and testing, as well as social stigma that may increase reluctance to seek medical care. As the country continues to navigate the MPV PHE, the United States public health system remains on the frontlines in identifying MPV cases, informing Americans about access to vaccines and therapeutics, and connecting our constituents to necessary medical care and resources. A recent survey conducted by the National Coalition of STD Directors of more than 100 clinics nationwide—including Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), reproductive and sexual health clinics, and primary care providers—demonstrates that our country’s health professionals have the willingness and expertise to play a central role in the MPV response, and are already being called upon to do so. However, these care providers are in dire need of additional resources to scale an appropriate response and prevent the spread of the virus.MPV testing efforts are currently encountering processing and collection barriers that have led to underreporting of cases and poor data to aid the federal government in directing necessary resources in an appropriate manner. Additionally, as both a prophylaxis and treatment, acquiring and administering vaccines swiftly is crucial to stemming the spread of MPV and protecting all communities across the United States. Finally, clinics and providers are facing additional barriers in clinical services supplies, education for providers to properly identify MPV, vaccines, testing supplies, contact tracing, and community outreach to bolster our public health response to MPV, and ensure that accurate and adequate information is reaching our constituents. We appreciate the work that Senators Leahy, Murray, and Coons have undertaken to develop and introduce an emergency supplemental funding bill to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other emerging disease that pose a significant threat to public health, and we ask you to include additional funding in any forthcoming legislative package to address the MPV PHE in our communities. Thank you for your attention and partnership in addressing this public health concern. ###"

Markey (D-Mass.), Senate sponsor of the Judiciary Act of 2021, released the following statement after the Senate failed to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the Women’s Health Protection Act in order to begin debate. “Today, the Senate failed to protect the rights of millions of Americans and respect the will of two-thirds of our constituents across the country who believe Roe v. Wade should remain the law of the land, because a radical Republican minority once again succeeded in wedging their extremist views into our broken political machinery. As the Supreme Court stands poised to overturn Roe and cast aside decades of precedent, the Women’s Health Protection Act is all that’s standing between the America we’ve known for decades – in which safe and legal abortions are a right – and one that plunges millions of people back in time into despair, pain, poverty, and forced parenthood.  “We have come to this crossroads because our system is fundamentally broken. Our anti-majoritarian and anti-democratic national electoral system allowed two Presidents, each of whom lost the popular vote, to nominate five of our nine sitting U.S. Supreme Court justices. Corrupted congressional procedure allowed those justices to be confirmed by Senators representing a minority of our nation’s population. And now, the arcane filibuster has prevented the majority of Senators who stand in favor of upholding basic rights to privacy, self-determination, and abortion care from acting on the will of the American people.   “There is no other recourse. We must abolish the filibuster in order to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act, and we must expand the Supreme Court in order to reclaim the stolen seats, restore balance, and begin to repair the faith of the American people in the Court. Expanding the Court is constitutional. Congress has done it before, and Congress must do it again.” ###"

Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, released the following statement after the U.S. Senate voted to confirm Alvaro Bedoya’s nomination to serve as Commissioner to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  “The Federal Trade Commission plays a critical role in protecting American consumers,” said Senator Markey. “I am proud to have voted to confirm Alvaro Bedoya to help lead this effort and continue the Commission’s essential work. Mr. Bedoya has a deep commitment to the public interest and he will bring a sterling background of service and scholarship to this position. Americans face increasing threats in the digital ecosystem, and the FTC must be laser-focused on protecting the public from manipulation and privacy invasions online. With a full slate of commissioners, the FTC must now act swiftly and boldly to use the full scope of its authority to protect consumers, particularly in communities of color and other marginalized communities, who disproportionately experience harm both online and offline. Mr. Bedoya is ready to take on those challenges, and I look forward to working with him and the entire Commission.”   ###"

Markey (D-Mass.), Chair of the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate, and Nuclear Safety, today hosted a subcommittee field hearing in Plymouth, Massachusetts with Congressman William R. Keating (MA-09), titled Issues Facing Communities with Decommissioning Nuclear Plants. During the hearing, Senator Markey secured commitments from Holtec, the company charged with decommissioning the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Plant, that it would not discharge any radioactive, contaminated water into Cape Cod Bay from the plant without the consent of stakeholders. He also secured a commitment from Holtec that it would work with an independent body with marine experience to test the water, that it would provide a financial backstop to ensure full decommission and clean-up of the plant site, and it would meet with union representatives from the Laborers, Ironworkers, Carpenters, IBEW, and Operating Engineers regarding an ongoing labor dispute.  “We will hold Holtec accountable for these commitments to the communities that surround Pilgrim, and we will work to ensure the NRC upholds its responsibility to be a watchdog on the decommissioning process,” said Senator Markey. “Over the years, communities with decommissioning nuclear power plants have repeatedly called on the Commission to be a good partner and for nuclear companies to be good neighbors. Today’s hearing is a notice to both that we will not allow these responsibilities to go unmet any longer.”  “Today’s hearing cemented what we already knew: that the NRC has given too much leeway to licensees. The government is entrusted with the regulation of nuclear energy as well as the environmental impacts that energy has on our communities. It’s clear, however, that the community has been left out of this process; yet they are the ones that will feel the impacts for generations from this plant being here and the ones who are paying for decommissioning. The NRC confirmed today that trucking away the waste is a viable alternative to dumping water in Cape Cod Bay. Frankly, it is not an alternative, but the only proper course of action,” said Congressman Keating. Testifying at the hearing were: A copy of witness testimonies can be found HERE. Senator Markey and Congressman Keating have worked together to ensure that the NRC and Holtec prioritize safety and public participation throughout Pilgrim’s decommissioning process.

Markey (D-Mass.) released the following statement upon the United States reaching the tragic toll of one million lives lost to COVID-19. “There are no words to fully capture the loss of one million friends, loved ones, partners, family members, and those we did not know to COVID-19,” said Senator Markey. “How do we grieve the uncelebrated anniversaries, birthdays, holidays, and other cherished moments that make life the tapestry of shared experience and memories? Tragically, this pandemic is not yet over, not for the United States nor for the globe. We must acknowledge and continue to address the disproportionate impact this pandemic is having on Black, Brown, Indigenous, immigrant, and low-income communities. Our goal must be to confront the reckoning of injustice – racial, economic, educational, health – that this pandemic has made undeniable. And we must treat the lasting effects of long-COVID for those living with it, including with research, disability benefits, and quality health care. For the elderly and immunocompromised, the COVID-19 threat remains a daily specter, and we must center those communities in our response, planning, and messaging to ensure the death toll doesn’t match the rates of the past two years. I will fight to pass legislation that supports those most impacted by this pandemic.” Since the start of the pandemic, Senator Markey has been a leader in calling for legislative action to fight the coronavirus, including on research, data collection and equity, mask mandates, financial relief for small businesses, and federal government oversight. In August 2021, Senators Markey, Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) introduced a resolution to memorialize those lost to the COVID–19 virus and recognize the suffering of COVID–19 survivors. This resolution would designate the first Monday in March as “COVID–19 Victims and Survivors Memorial Day.” ###"
https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-introduces-legislation-on-electrification-and-american-manufacturing-for-sustainable-affordable-and-reliable-home-energy-usage,"The ICEE HOT Act would reduce residential building greenhouse gas emissions and increase energy security Washington (May 4, 2022) – Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass), Chair of the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate and Nuclear Safety, today introduced the Installing Clean Efficient Energy Hastens Our Transition (ICEE HOT) Act, comprehensive legislation that would reduce residential building greenhouse gas emissions and increase energy security by expanding the State Energy-Efficient Appliance Rebate Program with incentives for manufacturers and distributors that produce and distribute American-made building electrification products, like heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC) equipment and water heating appliances. Currently, seven percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States come from residential buildings using fossil fuels for space heating, water heating, and space cooling, contributing to the 35 percent of overall residential emissions. This legislation will not only transform the heat pump market, encourage home electrification, and improve grid reliability, but it will also lower equipment costs for consumers. Additionally, this legislation will support the Justice40 initiative by requiring that 40 percent of funds be used to provide rebates to disadvantaged businesses or entities that employ disadvantaged individuals. The bill will also support unionized labor by directing 40 percent of rebate funds to manufacturers and distributors that meet strict labor standards and employ unionized workers. Federal support is paramount to ensuring that our transition to green energy remains affordable to the residents of Massachusetts and across the country.  Additional co-sponsors of the ICEE HOT Act include Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Tina Smith (D-Minn.). “American consumers are paying too much for dirty energy that pollutes their communities and undermines the health of their families. It’s time that we power our homes with clean, affordable and reliable American-made energy,” said Senator Markey. “The ICEE HOT Act would transition homes across America away from costly, dirty fossil fuels towards cheaper, cleaner renewable energy. With this legislation, we can put Americans to work manufacturing the clean energy revolution.” “We need to tackle the climate crisis head on. And that’s why I'm glad to introduce this legislation with Senator Markey and my colleagues that helps reduce our reliance of fossil fuels, move towards home electrification, and lower costs for families. Let's get this done,” said Senator Warren. “For too long, corporate greed has resulted in American consumers paying overly high prices for energy,” said Senator Sanders. “To make matters worse, the pollution from dirty fossil fuels has only worsened the climate crisis. The time is long overdue to transition American homes away from costly fossil fuels towards energy efficiency and affordable, renewable energy. This legislation will reduce energy costs, create jobs as we retrofit our buildings, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” “Our nation must transition away from fossil fuels to avoid the worst impacts of climate change and to strengthen our energy independence, and electrifying our homes is essential to this transition,” said Senator Booker. “This legislation will offer businesses much-needed incentives to support more domestic production and distribution of zero emission home appliances like heat pumps and induction stoves, with a targeted investment to disadvantaged businesses. These critical incentives will also help consumers save money by reducing costs on new home heating and cooling equipment and other essential appliances.” “The transition to clean energy is happening, the question is whether our country leads or follows. I want us to lead,” said Senator Smith. “If we do nothing, climate change will be an economic, environmental and public health disaster. The good news is that taking action on climate also presents an enormous economic opportunity. This legislation will incentivize adoption of heat pumps, which will help us use American-made clean electricity that increases our energy independence, lowers energy costs for families, reduces pollution, and protects the planet.” A copy of the legislation can be found HERE. A copy of the one-pager can be found HERE. The ICEE HOT Act would appropriate $10 billion for the issuance of manufacturer and distributor rebates from fiscal year 2023 to 2030. The legislation would offer benefits to stakeholders across the supply chain, including: The ICEE HOT Act is endorsed by Earthjustice, Rocky Mountain Institute, Natural Resources Defense Council, The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, and Rewiring America.  “Outdated furnaces powered by oil, propane, and gas pollute our homes, contaminate our air, and disproportionately harm underrepresented communities,” said Earthjustice Associate Legislative Representative Jake Kornack. “Heat pumps are a gamechanger and provide a more affordable and cleaner alternative to heat and cool our homes. We thank Senator Markey for putting forward this innovative solution to make heat pumps more affordable for American families that will result in lower energy bills for consumers while paving the way for a clean energy future.” “Providing incentives to increase the manufacturing of efficient electric appliances – like heat pumps and induction cooktops – will make homes healthier for American families, create good paying jobs, and boost our economic and energy security. These clean energy technologies will not only reduce our dependence on foreign oil and gas, they will provide a myriad of health and environmental benefits to make our communities more resilient into the future,” said Rocky Mountain Institute Federal Policy Manager Alisa Petersen. ###"

That she has lost five years in jail due to these spurious charges is a travesty. She should be released immediately and any remaining charges should be dropped without further delay.”   In 2020, Senators Markey, Rubio, Durbin, Blackburn, and Coons led the successful passage of a resolution condemning the ongoing human rights abuses in the Philippines. Due to their advocacy on behalf of Senator De Lima and other human rights activists in the country, Senators Markey, Durbin, and Leahy have been banned by the Duterte government from entering the Philippines. In 2019, the Senate Appropriations Committee passed an amendment barring Philippine officials from the United States who were involved in the jailing of Senator De Lima.  ###"

Markey (D-Mass.), Chairwoman Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), and Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), members of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, today called on the Department of Transportation (DOT) to strengthen consumer protections for travelers who are eligible for airline ticket refunds. DOT previously stated that it would issue new consumer protections regarding airline refunds, in the wake of major disruptions for air travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In a report to the White House Competition Council, DOT reported “[m]any airlines were also initially reluctant to provide the required refunds,” causing consumers to send the DOT “a flood of complaints” regarding airlines’ failures to compensate their customers for flight cancellations. In 2020, DOT received 29,687 refund complaints against U.S. airlines, a 4,634 percent increase from 2019. “As part of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation’s ongoing oversight of the U.S. airline industry, we are writing to request that the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) take further action to make the process for obtaining refunds more transparent and efficient for U.S. airline passengers, in response to the increase in passenger refund complaints during the COVID-19 pandemic,” wrote the lawmakers in their letter to Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg ahead of Tuesday’s hearing in the Commerce Committee on the President’s budget priorities. A copy of the Senators’ letter can be found HERE. In their letter, the Senators urge the Transportation Department to take specific actions to protect air travel consumers, including clarifying and codifying policies requiring carriers and ticket agents to provide prompt refunds after a flight is cancelled or significantly delayed, as well as clarifying the rights for consumers who are unable to travel and cancel their own tickets due to government restrictions or the declaration of a public health emergency. The Senators also called on DOT to require airlines to conspicuously disclose and publicize to passengers that consumers have to submit a written request to trigger the refund requirement, to set up user-friendly and easy-to-find refund portals, and to report to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics the value of the refunds and vouchers provided to consumers each month. ###"

Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Representative Lori Trahan (MA-03) and Kathy Castor (FL-14), today demanded answers from Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, regarding a new study on the proliferation of pro-eating disorder content on Instagram. The report provides new evidence that Meta targets children and teens based on their activity on Instagram and uses that information to algorithmically push content that can encourage dangerous eating behavior. Researchers found that, due to Instagram’s algorithmic practices, pro-eating-disorder accounts gained young followers and spread unhealthy content, even when those pro-eating-disorder accounts were inactive. This research identified children as young as 9 and 10 potentially trapped in bubbles of eating disorder content. These accounts posted disturbing visual content that celebrated “thinspiration” or “bonespiration,” terms used to promote eating disorders, including imagery of extremely underweight people as a dangerous body type to follow. “Meta has an obligation to prioritize the wellbeing of its young users, and company representatives have stated before Congress that Meta is committed to the health and safety of the children and teens who use its platforms. Unfortunately, new research indicates that Meta is amplifying dangerous and unhealthy eating disorder content to users ages 9 to 18,” write the lawmakers in their letter to Zuckerberg. “This report is particularly concerning given Meta’s record of failure to protect young people. Independent reports have previously documented Meta’s failure to stop ads for tobacco, alcohol, and eating disorders from targeting teens.” A copy of the letter can be found HERE. In their letter, the lawmakers request responses to the following questions:  The lawmakers previously demanded answers from Mark Zuckerberg regarding Facebook’s announcement that the company is “exploring” plans to develop a version of Instagram for children. In May, after the company failed to make meaningful commitments to protect kids online, the lawmakers released a statement calling on Facebook to abandon its plans for the children’s platform.  Additionally, last June, Senator Markey and Senator Bill Cassidy (R-La.) introduced the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, legislation that would update online data privacy rules – including the prohibition of collecting personal information from 13- to 15-years olds without the user’s consent - for the 21st century and ensure both children and teenagers are protected online. ###[1] Fairplay, Designing for Disorder Report at 13."

FDA should work through the rulemaking process expeditiously to ensure that these menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars are off the shelves in order to help protect public health and help save lives.” Senator Markey has been a leader in addressing the dangers of tobacco-use, particularly for youth. Last year, Senator Markey led a group of colleagues in calling on the FDA to ban menthol cigarettes and cigars, which followed up on a previous effort in 2018 to push FDA to ban these products. Senator Markey also led efforts to hold technology companies accountable for tobacco advertising aimed at young people on online platforms.  ###"

Markey (D-Mass.) joined Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i) and a group of nine senators today in introducing a resolution to support the designation of April 2022 as “Preserving Local News Month.” The resolution recognizes local news as a public good that serves an essential function in the democracy of the United States. “People across the country rely on local news to stay informed, fight disinformation, and strengthen their communities. As the industry faces newsroom closures and budget cuts, it’s critical that we all support and recognize the irreplaceable public service local news provides,” said Senator Schatz. According to recent research, the overall employment in newspaper, television, radio, and digital newsrooms in the United States fell by 26 percent, or 30,000 jobs, from 2008-2020. More than 100 local newsrooms were forced to close during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 30 percent of local television stations reporting budget cuts and staff reductions. The resolution affirms the significance of local news in increasing civic engagement and strengthening democratic norms and practices, and acknowledges the valuable contributions of local journalism towards the maintenance of healthy and vibrant communities.  The resolution is co-sponsored by Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), and Bob Casey (D-Pa.).

Hirono (D-Hawaii), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) led 10 of their Senate colleagues in submitting comments in support of the Biden Administration’s proposal to better support immigrants by updating the “public charge” regulation. The Biden Administration’s proposed regulation would replace the public charge rule enacted by the Trump Administration in 2019, which made it significantly more difficult for many immigrants to become lawful permanent residents by lowering the threshold for a person becoming a “public charge.” In a letter sent to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of the and Ur Mendoza Jaddou, Director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Senators also called on the Administration to take three additional steps to better support immigrants seeking permanent status in this country.  “In 2019, the Department of Homeland Security under the Trump Administration proposed a new definition and implementation of the public charge rule, which was used to advance an anti-immigrant agenda and intimidate immigrant communities,” write the lawmakers. “While the 2019 public charge regulation took effect just as the COVID-19 pandemic escalated, the rule undermined the United States’ overall pandemic response by deterring immigrant families from participating in public health measures and community support programs, thereby amplifying COVID-19’s disparate impact on the health and well-being of families of color.  The updates in the current proposed rule are essential to prevent a recurrence of such devastating events, both in the current pandemic, as well as in future national emergencies.” Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), an individual seeking permanent residency in the United States can be inadmissible if they are a determined to be a “public charge.” The INA does not define public charge and prior to the Trump Administration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) only looked at whether an immigrant received cash assistance and government-funded institutionalized care to determine whether they were likely to become dependent on public assistance in the future.  In 2019, the Trump administration lowered the threshold for becoming a public charge, making it more difficult for many immigrants, including many with U.S. citizen children, to become lawful permanent residents. The Trump rule counted assistance from many more programs, including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), housing and transportation benefits, most medical care and more. The Biden Administration’s updated regulation would roll back the Trump-era standards and exclude benefits related to public emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to expressing their support for the overall proposed regulation, the Senators provided three additional key recommendations to help ensure the updated rule does not further contribute to chilling or discriminatory effects on immigrants and their families. The Senators stated that the rule should, “Finalizing a responsible public charge policy is critical to ensuring that our country has a humane immigration system,” the lawmakers continue. “We urge you to speedily approve this rule to minimize the ongoing chilling effect of public charge on our constituents and families. As you work to finalize the rule, we also urge DHS to coordinate with other federal agencies to ensure a consistent and accurate dissemination of information to affected agencies and families.” In addition to Senators Markey, Hirono, Booker, and Menendez, the letter is also signed by Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). The full text of the letter can be found here. ###"
https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-joins-senator-warren-in-pushing-pentagon-on-accountability-for-civilian-harm,"""It is imperative that the United States Armed Forces uphold the highest standards of conduct, including consistent standards for protecting the lives of civilians and requiring accountability when harm does occur."" Washington (April 25, 2021) – United States Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) joins Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), and Senators Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), Jeffrey A. Merkley (D-Ore.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) sent a letter to Secretary Lloyd J. Austin, III, urging the Department of Defense (DoD) to consider certain issues in its ongoing efforts to address systemic weaknesses regarding instances of civilian harm. After Senator Warren and bicameral colleagues called on the Biden administration to overhaul its counterterrorism policy to prevent civilian harm, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III released a directive on January 27, 2022, instructing the United States military to strengthen its efforts to prevent civilian deaths. In the letter, the lawmakers highlight several priorities and issues that should be addressed in the DoD's review to improve the way it protects civilians in war zones. In March, nearly 50 members of the House of Representatives sent a similar letter calling on Secretary Austin to implement these much-needed changes.  ""We appreciate and welcome this commitment to address the harm caused by U.S. counterterrorism operations and welcome this long-overdue step. However, we remain concerned that twenty years of Pentagon pledges to hold itself accountable and correct fundamental flaws that lead to civilian harm have gone unfulfilled. As such, we request that you brief Congress on your progress on repairing systemic flaws related to civilian harm,"" the lawmakers wrote. U.S. military operations have resulted in alarmingly high numbers of civilian casualties. It is estimated that since 2001, up to 48,000 civilians have been killed by U.S. air and drone strikes in seven countries. Earlier this year, a number of reports detailed DoD's failures to prevent, respond to, and hold itself accountable for civilian casualties. Following these reports and pressure from Congress that Senator Warren helped spearhead, Secretary Austin announced that he would be directing the Department to submit to him a Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan (CHMRAP). The directive required DoD to, within 90 days, implement a plan to establish a Center of Excellence for civilian harm, develop standardized civilian harm reporting, and develop and incorporate improved guidance for avoiding harm. The letter requests DoD brief Congress on its progress in preventing civilian harm and highlights a series of issues and priorities that the DoD should focus on in the CHMRAP, including:  Adequate resources and staffing, including staff dedicated to civilian harm prevention and response;  Senator Warren has long led the call for accountability for U.S. military operations that kill innocent civilians. In February, during a SASC hearing, the Senator secured a commitment from Michael ""Erik"" Kurilla, General and Commander of United States Central Command, to prioritize reforms to mitigate civilian harm. Senator Warren and Representative Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) introduced the Protection of Civilians in Military Operations Act, bicameral legislation that would enhance reporting on civilian casualties resulting from U.S. military operations, improve investigations into civilian casualties, and strengthen resources for the Department's policies and practices relating to civilian casualty prevention and responses. ###"
https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-concludes-trip-in-brussels-where-he-met-with-eu-and-nato-leadership,"Washington (April 21, 2022) – Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, traveled from Poland to Brussels Tuesday evening for meetings with U.S. diplomats and EU and NATO leadership to discuss the allied response to Putin’s unjust war of aggression in Ukraine. Upon his return, Senator Markey will hold a media availability on Saturday in Boston. “I came away from my meetings in Brussels with the conviction that the transatlantic alliance is stronger than ever, and that we will continue to work closely with our NATO and EU partners to support Ukraine and protect NATO territory,” said Senator Markey. “Vladimir Putin fundamentally miscalculated when he believed that the United States and Europe would simply look on as he invades Ukraine and commits war crimes against the Ukrainian people. He was wrong. We will continue to do everything we can to support the Ukrainian people in their effort to defeat Putin and his corrupt cronies. We will also work together to wean the United States and Europe off of our addiction to corrupt oil and gas so that no more dollars and Euros are lining Putin’s pockets. We will support good-faith diplomacy, on Ukraine’s terms, that ends Russia’s illegal war.  On Wednesday, Senator Markey met with Deputy Secretary General of NATO Mercea Geoana at NATO Headquarters to discuss US-NATO security efforts in the face of increasing Russian aggression.  The Senator also met with U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julie Smith and members of the U.S. mission to NATO, as well as U.S. Ambassador to the EU Mark Gitenstein to discuss ways to increase cooperation and coordination amongst allies to ensure the Ukrainian people receive the assistance they need and to protect the security of all our NATO and EU partners.   He convened a meeting with representatives of the governments of Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia to discuss ongoing humanitarian and security needs of the countries closest to Ukraine.  Senator Markey met with the Stefano Grassi, Head of Cabinet to European Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson and Commission Member, to discuss shared U.S.-European priorities on energy independence and ways to build Europe’s clean energy future, free from its reliance on Russian fossil fuels.   Senator Markey also met Wednesday with European Parliamentarian Miapetra Kumpala-Natri. The pair convened on the continuing importance of EU-U.S. relations and unity.  ### "

https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-us-army-corps-baker-administration-ma-dot-and-local-officials-meet-to-discuss-cape-cod-bridge-replacement," Boston (April 16, 2022) – This Wednesday, April 13th, Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) held a meeting to discuss the Cape Cod Bridges Replacement Project with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MA DOT) and other local, county and state officials. During the meeting, the Federal Delegation reviewed billions of dollars available through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) that can be pursued to fund the project. This includes the U.S. Department of Transportation’s $2.9 billion Multimodal Project Discretionary Grant program which can be applied for through May 23, 2022, and the new $12.5 billion Bridge Investment Program which was created by the IIJA and is expected to open for applications in May 2022. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and MA DOT discussed their continued partnership for pursuing federal funding opportunities, designing and constructing the bridges, and engaging Cape communities. The Cape’s state legislative delegation and community leaders highlighted key priorities, including improved pedestrian and traffic safety, highway improvements on Route 3, and the importance of having an iconic bridge design that reflects the beauty of Cape Cod. “Today, we renewed our vows to replace the Cape Cod Bridges, in sickness and in health, for richer or poorer. With a richer path forward provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, this meeting is just another step in delivering on an urgent infrastructure priority for Massachusetts – replacing the Bourne and Sagamore Bridges. We thank MassDOT, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, the Army Corps, and Federal Highways for their continued collaboration. This is our moment, and we’re confident that, together, we can reach our ultimate goal in building two new bridges for the people of Cape Cod,” said Senator Markey. “I'm glad to be working alongside Senator Markey, the Massachusetts delegation, and local leaders to advance the Cape Cod Bridges Replacement Project. I fought hard to secure federal funding for this project in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and look forward to our continued collaboration to build these critical new bridges,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). “I am happy to see that the federal government continues to work closely with our state and local partners on this important project. As progress towards the construction of the Cape Cod Canal Bridges is made, we must ensure that we continue this close communication so that the needs of the community are met. There is a long road ahead of us before the first passengers cross over the new bridges, but I am proud of the work we have already done in laying a solid foundation for this project and look forward to the day when we see the new bridges completed,” said Representative Bill Keating (MA-09). “The Baker-Polito Administration appreciates the efforts of Senator Markey and Massachusetts’ federal delegation in convening local, state and federal stakeholders to continue to advance plans for the replacement of the Bourne and Sagamore Bridges,” said Transportation Secretary and CEO Jamey Tesler. “The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides new resources to draw from for many of the Commonwealth’s infrastructure needs and the Administration looks forward to continued engagement on the various project components, including working with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to compete for and secure federal funding for the replacement and ultimate divestment to the state of these federally-owned assets,” said Secretary Jamey Tessler. “We are grateful for the continued collaboration and dialogue among our federal, state and elected officials to ensure this project provides a safe and reliable solution for the region,” said Col. John A. Atilano II, Commander, USACE New England District. “This project is another example of the strong partnership we have with the Commonwealth, and especially the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, and we look forward to continued dialogue and cooperation in the months ahead.” Built in 1935, the Sagamore and Bourne bridges span the Cape Cod Canal and connect the nearly 250,000 residents on the Cape and Islands to the rest of Massachusetts, serving as essential routes for general transportation, tourism, and evacuations in case of an emergency. These structures are the only routes to and from Cape Cod for vehicular traffic. The Cape Cod Canal Bridges are owned and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In April 2020, the Army Corps released a Major Rehabilitation Evaluation Report (MRER) where it recommended replacing the Cape Cod bridges with two entirely new structures at a total estimated cost of $1.6 billion over 50 years. Subsequent to this report – in July 2020 – the Army Corps signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT), which formalized a federal-state partnership to replace the two Cape Cod Bridges. “I am pleased to partner with Senator Markey, Senator Warren and Congressman Keating as well as the state delegations on both sides of the canal to move forward on the long overdue modernization of our iconic Bourne and Sagamore bridges, both of which are crucial evacuation routes for the community,” said Massachusetts State Senator Susan L. Moran. “Grateful to Senator Markey for keeping us abreast of Army Corp. and Mass DOT’s efforts to pursue funding soon to be available for Cape Cod Bridges and for being receptive to our request for needed improvements at exit 3 in Plymouth,” said Plymouth State Rep. Mathew Muratore. “Exit three in the Cedarville portion of Plymouth is used as a shortcut to these bridges and improvements to accommodate local and tourist traffic will be necessary.”  “These two bridges are approaching almost 100 years old and will need a lot more preventative maintenance moving forward.  They are the lifeline to Cape Cod and the Islands.  It is the responsibility of the Federal government to provide adequate transportation of persons and necessaries of life for all of Cape Cod. For these reasons we need to support Senator Markey, Senator Warren and Congressmen Keating in advocating for funding to replace the two canal area bridges,” said Peter J. Meier, Chairman, Bourne Board of Selectmen. “Bourne and its villages are at ground zero with both ends of both bridges in our town affecting our daily life. We embrace our town and we are honored to host the canal and bridges in our midst. We have been working around the repairs and detours for some time. It's amazing that the safe replacements are within our reach, for real,” said Judith Froman, Vice Chair of the Bourne Select Board. “Our greatest appreciation for Senator Markey for his bipartisan leadership to seize an opportunity that is once in a lifetime and has engagement and preparation at all levels; federal to state to region to local municipality. Respect for preparation poising our successful funding to the businesses which will be disrupted to the property owners who will be displaced; each every one will be and are treated with the respect of having a voice. Thank you.”  “As an elected representative of the people of Bourne, I appreciate Senator Markey’s update on the project to replace the bridges, which are so important to Bourne’s identity.  I thank him for allowing local officials to weigh in on this project.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to improve Bourne’s surface roads near the bridges, but we know that such an opportunity brings numerous concerns to our residents, particularly those who face inevitable issues like eminent domain and traffic patterns that may or may not be improved.  Meetings such as this one help us help residents whose homes and lives will be directly affected by the project. Improved traffic flow around the bridges will benefit Bourne residents, visitors, and passers-through. It is essential that the competing interests of these segments of the population be recognized,” said George Slade, Bourne Board of Selectmen. “Replacement of the Bourne and Sagamore Bridges is a once-in-a-century investment in the Cape Cod region.  The Cape Cod Commission commends Senator Markey and our federal delegation for their dedicated efforts to bring attention and resources to one of the region’s greatest infrastructure needs, essential for the long-term viability of our economy and vitality of our communities,” said Kristy Senatori, Executive Director, Cape Cod Commission. “The bridges physically connect Cape Cod to the rest of the world. Replacing these structural icons has been a capstone policy issue for the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce and we are grateful for the leadership of our elected officials on Cape Cod, in Boston and Washington who are making this infrastructure investment possible,” said Paul Niedzwiecki, CEO, Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce. ###  "
https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-demands-iso-new-england-rescind-proposal-that-boosts-fossil-fuel-consumption-electricity-costs-for-new-englanders,"Proposal from New England’s grid operator could disadvantage new clean energy sources, prop up fossil fuel generators, delay climate solutions, and increase electricity bills for households Boston (April 14, 2022) – In front of the offices of Independent System Operator of New England (ISO-NE), Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) today called on federal regulators to reject and require reform of the recent proposal sent by New England’s grid operator to unjustifiably disadvantage clean energy in favor of dirty fossil fuels and unnecessarily drive up energy bills for New England households and prevent renewable energy and energy storage from qualifying for wholesale electricity auctions. In a letter sent today to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), Senator Markey outlined the harmful consequences the proposal – also called the Minimum Offer Price Rule (MOPR) - could have for New England ratepayers and for the state’s climate and clean energy goals, including giving fossil fuels preferential treatment over clean energy, increasing the overall costs for consumers, creating rules that unfairly limit competition, and preventing renewable energy and storage projects from scaling up as quickly as possible. FERC commissioners have already signaled a preference for ISO-NE to eliminate the proposal and do so expeditiously. “It should come as no surprise that three New England natural gas plant operators developed what became the ISO-NE proposal,” the Senators write in their letter to FERC Chairman Richard Glick. “By requiring the immediate reform of the MOPR, FERC can ensure that all of New England is able to realize the climate and cost benefits of a renewable energy transition as soon as possible. In doing so, FERC will signal that renewable energy should be allowed to fully and freely compete in wholesale markets. This will ultimately lead to lower prices for household customers and facilitate our overdue and necessary transition to a decarbonized electricity grid.” A copy of the letter can be found HERE. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have also signed onto the letter. In February 2019, Senators Markey and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I) led their colleagues in a letter to FERC to finalize guidance on a rule to grow a more flexible and resilient grid by allowing Americans to connect their rooftop solar, wind, and energy storage devices to the electrical grid.  ###"

Markey (D-Mass.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) celebrated the more than $537 million investment in Massachusetts transit announced by the Department of Transportation last week. The funding, authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will provide Massachusetts with critical resources to upgrade the MBTA and regional transit systems, modernize our fleets, cars, and buses, and improve the resiliency of our transit infrastructure.  “These funds are an overdue investment in Massachusetts’ public transportation that will allow us to expand access to affordable public transit, invest in environmentally-sustainable modes of transportation, and reinforce our transit infrastructure against severe storms and other extreme weather events caused by climate change,” said Senator Markey. “I am proud to have worked with the delegation and President Biden to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and secure these funds for the Commonwealth.” “Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Massachusetts delegation will receive $537 million this year for our transit systems. These funds mean improved reliability for commuters, more good union jobs, and are essential to help us tackle climate change. I’m glad I was able to help secure this funding, and I will keep fighting for these investments,” said Senator Warren. Under this transit funding announcement, Massachusetts will receive $537, 081, 507 in guaranteed formula funding to modernize and expand public transportation services. This funding is part of a $20 billion national investment in public transit and reflects a 35 percent increase compared to fiscal year 2021. Overall, total funding for the announced transit programs will increase by 58% this year as part of theBipartisan Infrastructure Law. These funding allocations include: ###"

Albright. In addition to commending Secretary Albright’s patriotism and public service in the pursuit of more peaceful, prosperous, and cooperative world order, the bipartisan resolution extends the Senate’s sincere condolences and sympathies to Secretary Albright’s family and friends in the wake of her passing. “With this bipartisan resolution, we honor Secretary Albright’s extraordinary contributions to our global community and her unparalleled dedication to serving others both as the first woman Secretary of State and throughout her tenure in public service,” Chairman Menendez said. “As a child, she fled fascism as a refugee, later becoming a leading voice for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. As in her life, Secretary Albright’s legacy will continue to shape American statecraft and to inspire foreign policy leaders and public servants for generations to come. She was a dear friend and mentor to me and to many, and she will be deeply missed.” “Madeleine Albright, a giant in the field of foreign policy, was a fierce defender of democracy and internationally-recognized human rights across the globe,” said Ranking Member Risch. “This resolution honors the indispensable work she did on behalf of the United States and extends sincere condolences to Secretary Albright’s family and loved ones.”  Joining Chairman Menendez and Ranking Member Risch in introducing the resolution were Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).  “Madeleine Albright embodied the ideals of America. She was a constant light in the struggle between freedom and oppression, relentlessly advocating for people to have rights she knew didn’t exist under authoritarian regimes. She broke the highest glass ceiling in her field, then spent the rest of her life fighting for opportunities for women. We’ll remember her as a diplomat and a trail blazer,” said Senator Schatz. “Secretary Albright was a friend, a dedicated public servant, and a true champion for democracy around the globe,” said Sen. Sullivan. “I was honored to work with her in our respective roles as Chairs of the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute. Secretary Albright will be greatly missed, but her life and legacy—which began when she and her family fled Soviet communism as a young girl, and led her to the highest branches of government—will help ensure the light of freedom and liberty continues shining brightly for many years to come.” “Madeleine Albright will be remembered as a giant of American diplomacy,” said Senator Coons. “I had the blessing of knowing Secretary Albright’s humor, brilliance, talent, and remarkable insights into world affairs over many years, and I am pleased the Senate has taken a moment today to honor her immense contributions to our country and to our world. As a stateswoman and a fierce advocate for democracy and human rights, Madeleine Albright truly made a lifetime of difference.” “A refugee who went on to become the first woman to serve as U.S. Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright’s life story is one of resoluteness and a reflection of the bright promises of democracy,” said Senator Romney. “Her service to our country and mark on U.S. foreign policy will be felt for generations to come.” “Madeleine Albright was a Virginian, a tireless champion for democracy, and a dear friend. She represented the very best of America—an immigrant from Czechoslovakia who rose to the highest position in American diplomacy, paving the way for women around the world,” said Senator Kaine. “I’m glad the Senate passed a resolution today in her honor. I will miss her wise counsel.” “Madeleine Albright came to the United States as a child refugee from war-torn Europe, fleeing Nazi and Soviet persecution. She grew up to become the first female Secretary of State – our nation’s top diplomat – breaking down barriers for generations of women to follow in her footsteps and stand on her shoulders. I’m proud to be one of those women and I’m honored to join members of the Senate to honor Secretary Albright for her service to our nation and for forging a path in government service that created space and leadership for women,” said Senator Shaheen. “As we mourn her loss, we don’t look back, but forward, on the opportunities she created for women around the world to realize their full potential. I urge Senate leadership to swiftly pass this resolution.” “Secretary Madeleine Albright was a trailblazer, a leader, a seasoned diplomat, and a champion for all humankind. After arriving in the United States as a refugee, she always fought to give a voice to the voiceless. And she was a force to be reckoned with,” said Senator Van Hollen. “Her legacy will never be forgotten. This resolution is a fitting way to highlight her courage and leadership which will continue to serve as an example for generations to come.” “The United States and the free world lost a giant with the passing of former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,” said Senator Cardin. “She was a champion for democratic values and institutions, as well as diplomat extraordinaire, best-selling author, long-time leader of the National Democratic Institute, trailblazing Ambassador to the United Nations and glass-ceiling breaking Secretary of State. Secretary Albright also was the mother of three remarkably successful daughters and a mentor and friend to countless other women. Her contributions to strengthening American diplomacy and standing up for democracy cannot be overstated. She was an incredible leader and a presence the world will not soon forget.” “Madeleine Albright was an accomplished diplomat, human rights champion, and trailblazer,” Senator Merkley said. “As the first woman to hold the position of Secretary of State, she broke barriers and has left a long lasting legacy of effective global diplomacy which will continue for years to come and serve as a model for future generations of diplomats.”   Find a copy of the resolution HERE.                                                                          ###"

Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today voted to end imports of Russian oil to the United States. On March 1, Senator Markey introduced the Severing Putin’s Immense Gains from Oil Transfers (SPIGOT) Act, legislation to prohibit the importation of Russian oil and petroleum products into the United States and to impose targeted sanctions on corrupt Russian individuals found to have committed human rights violations. In March, May, June, and August of 2021, the Russian Federation became the second-largest exporter of crude oil and petroleum products to the United States. “Ending Russian oil imports to the United States is our moral, economic, and global security responsibility,” said Senator Markey. “Vladimir Putin has been using those revenues from oil sales to crush dissent at home, fund war against Ukraine and commit war crimes, and it’s time for us to permanently shut off that deadly pipeline. The only way we will end the global conflict and corruption caused and funded by fossil fuels is to end our oil addiction and aggressively transition to clean energy. Investing in wind, solar, electric vehicles, battery storage, electric appliances, and energy efficiency are our pathway to a more prosperous and peaceful future.”###"
https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/following-epa-announcement-of-asbestos-ban-senator-markey-calls-for-more-comprehensive-action,"Washington (April 5, 2022) – Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, released the following statement after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans to ban one form of asbestos. Asbestos is a known human carcinogen and exposure can cause mesothelioma, lung, gastrointestinal, laryngeal, and ovarian cancers. Between the 1930s and 1970s, asbestos was widely used in consumer products and as an insulator, including use in schools where millions of children spend many hours each day. “I have long fought to ban this harmful material that kills tens of thousands of Americans every year,” said Senator Markey. “While I’m glad to see the EPA take a strong step forward to eliminate exposure to this major form of asbestos, there remain five types of asbestos that can still be imported in consumer products. We must take a more comprehensive approach to protect Americans from all forms of these toxic chemicals.”  Asbestos production was halted in 2002 in the United States, but it is still imported to produce chemicals used in a wide range of items. EPA’s proposed rule would prohibit the use, manufacture, and import of chrysolite asbestos, known as “white asbestos,” which is used in home building materials and automotive parts.

Markey (D-Mass.) delivered remarks on the U.S. Senate floor today in strong support of the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to fill the seat of retiring Justice Stephen Breyer on the United States Supreme Court.  When confirmed, Judge Jackson would become the first Black female justice to serve on the nation’s highest court, and the first-ever public defender. Senator Markeymet with Judge Jackson on March 24. In his remarks today, Senator Markey referred to the historic nomination of Judge Jackson as a “long overdue step toward making the Supreme Court better reflect the nation whose people the Court serves.” In his remarks, Senator Markey specifically highlighted Judge Jackson’s previous position as a public defender. “As a federal public defender, Judge Jackson represented the most vulnerable among us. She represented the clients other lawyers avoided. In doing so, she followed a long and honorable tradition in the American legal profession that began with John Adams stepping forward in 1770 to represent the British soldiers who committed the Boston Massacre because he feared they would not receive a fair trial without adequate representation.” Senator Markey additionally derided his Republican colleagues on their hostile, partisan questioning during the Judiciary Committee hearings. “As we all saw, some of the questioning of Judge Jackson from some of my Republican colleagues was nothing short of offensive, distorting her record, and tinged with racism and sexism. But Judge Jackson responded with poise. She calmly addressed and corrected her questioners’ false and misleading premises. And she did so while demonstrating deep knowledge of the law and the Constitution, respect for precedent, and displaying precisely the kind of temperament we expect of someone sitting on the nation’s highest court.”  ###"

Markey (D-Mass.), Chairman of the East Asia and International Cybersecurity Policy Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, along with Representative Bill Keating (MA-09), Chairman of the Europe, Energy, the Environment and Cyber Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, sent a letter to President Biden following the State Department’s official creation of a new bureau to lead U.S. cyber diplomatic and deterrence policy yesterday.  The lawmakers expressed concerns that Russia’s cyberattacks against Ukrainian targets may expand in severity and in scope in light of Moscow’s inability to achieve its strategic objectives in its war in Ukraine. The lawmakers call upon the President to appoint an Ambassador-at-large to lead the new Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy, without delay, in order to coordinate global U.S. engagement with allies and partners and to strengthen international norms of acceptable behavior in the cyber domain. “Ukraine’s inspiring resistance in thwarting Russia from achieving its strategic objectives may lead President Putin to unleash cyberattacks on a larger scale — one that exacerbates the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine or tests the boundaries of what the NATO alliance considers an armed attack under Article V of its Charter,” write the lawmakers. “To that end, we strongly urge you to immediately nominate an Ambassador-at-large to head the State Department’s newly created Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy, and provide the Bureau with appropriate staffing and resources. By establishing a single cyber diplomatic point of contact to help allies and partners bolster their own defenses, this Bureau will fill a crucial gap in our cyber support structures spread across U.S. government agencies.” A copy of the letter can be found HERE. Specifically, the lawmakers request that the President answer the following questions on U.S. cyber diplomacy policy: 1.         What lessons have we learned from the Russian government cyberattacks against Ukraine to date?2.         What criteria would the Administration use to determine whether a cyberattack on a NATO member should trigger Article V of the North Atlantic Charter on collective self-defense?3.         Approximately what is the timeline to fully staff up the new Bureau? How will the Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy work with other U.S. government agencies and international partners to build capacity to help deny, deter, and impose costs on malign actors who conduct cyberattacks?4.         Which federal agencies currently engage with other countries to defend against cyberattacks?5.         Will the Administration outline the scope of possible policy responses to cyberattacks on the United States as the European Union has done?6.         Under what circumstances would the Administration support the negotiation of a legally binding international treaty to complement non-binding norms to promote the peaceful uses of cyberspace?7.         How will the State Department evaluate progress towards the further development of the eleven norms of behavior set out in the 2015 report of the Group of Government Experts?"

Markey (D-Mass.) joined Senator Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Chair of the Emerging Threats and Spending Oversight Subcommittee and a group of thier colleagues in calling for an investigation into the failure of the consulting firm McKinsey & Company to disclose potential conflicts of interest when the company was simultaneously working with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on issues related to opioids and for numerous opioid companies, including Purdue Pharma. As the opioid crisis continues to devastate communities, the Senators are calling for a Health and Human Services Inspector General investigation into the FDA’s work with McKinsey and FDA’s contracting policies to ensure that contractors adequately disclose all potential conflicts of interest in the future. In addition to Senators Markey and Hassan, the letter was signed by Senators Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Chair of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committtee, Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). “While working for clients involved in manufacturing, distributing, and selling opioids, McKinsey simultaneously worked on projects for FDA, including projects for the FDA center responsible for approving new drugs, like opioids. Government contracting databases show that since 2008, McKinsey has been hired by FDA on numerous occasions, earning more than $140 million,” the Senators wrote to Christi A. Grimm, Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services. The letter follows Senator Hassan’s previous bipartisan efforts to push for answer from the FDA after learning from media reports that McKinsey did not reveal potential conflicts of interest to the FDA while they were contracted to work for the agency. Following the Senators’ outreach, the FDA responded that it had not known about McKinsey’s work with Purdue Pharma until media reports surfaced in 2021. In their letter, the Senators continued, “Despite these reports, FDA did not conduct any additional contract reviews or discuss with McKinsey conflicts of interest and the firm’s failure to disclose them in earlier contract applications. Furthermore, it is unclear whether FDA has altered or improved its processes and procedures to prevent similar nondisclosures of conflicts of interest in future contracts.” The Senators are calling on the Inspector General to review the actions of McKinsey and FDA as it pertains to these conflicts of interests and McKinsey’s failures to disclose them, and what actions the agency should take to help ensure that these failures don’t occur in the future. Senator Hassan is leading efforts to ensure that the organizations that helped to fuel the devastating substance use disorder epidemic are held accountable. Senator Hassan joined her colleagues recently in calling on the DOJ to investigate whether members of the Sackler family personally engaged in criminal conduct in connection with Purdue Pharma’s admitted criminal wrongdoing in fueling the devastating opioid epidemic. A copy of the letter can be found here. ###"
https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-joins-chairwoman-stabenow-and-senator-murkowskiin-bill-to-extend-school-and-summer-meal-flexibilities-to-feed-children,"Today, U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, and Senator Lisa Murkowski(R-AK) along with 49 of their colleagues introduced the Support Kids Not Red TapeAct.   The bill extends USDA school meal flexibilities from June 30, 2022 to September 30, 2023. These flexibilities have been crucial to feeding children throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. With 90% of our schools still facing many challenges as they return to normal operations, these flexibilities give our schools and summer meal programs much-needed support to deal with ongoing food service issues and keep kids fed. The bill will also help schools transition back to normal meal operations under the National School Lunch Program. USDA requested this authority be extended in the omnibus.  “We should make it easier for kids to get the meals they need – not harder. Our bill cuts red tape and keeps the priority on giving children the healthy meals they need and deserve,” said Senator Stabenow. “As we come out of this pandemic, schools are doing their best - but it takes time for them to transition back to their operations before COVID. We can’t let hungry kids get caught in the middle. Without this support, up to 30 million kids who get food at school will see their essential breakfast and lunch meals disrupted. And millions of hungry kids who rely on summer meals may have nowhere to go to get food.” “For far too many children in Alaska and across the nation, hunger is a daily reality. For many students, the meals served at school, and in summer or afterschool programs, may be the only meals they can count on,” said Senator Murkowski. “Following the widespread disruptions caused by COVID, life is beginning to feel more ‘normal’ for some. However, many Alaskans are still working to overcome the economic fallout from the pandemic and many schools continue to struggle with supply shortages and higher prices. That’s why I’m glad to join Senator Stabenow and my Senate colleagues in a push to allow USDA to extend vital support for school nutrition programs and preventing barriers that may prevent students from receiving a healthy meal.” In addition to Sens. Stabenow and Murkowski, this legislation is cosponsored by Sens. Heinrich (D-NM), Collins (R-ME), Manchin (D-WV), Gillibrand (D-NY), Casey (D-PA), Van Hollen (D-MD), Smith (D-MN), Brown (D-OH), Baldwin (D-WI), Booker(D-NJ), Lujan (D-NM), Klobuchar (D-MN), Durbin (D-IL), Warnock (D-GA),bHirono (D-HI), Duckworth (D-IL), Sanders (I-VT), Reed (D-RI), Leahy (D-VT), Wyden (D-OR), Shaheen (D-NH), Hassan (D-NH), Bennet (D-CO),Merkley (D-OR), Warren (D-MA), Padilla (D-CA), Warner (D-VA), Murray (D-WA), Cardin (D-MD), Coons (D-DE), Cortez Masto (D-NV), Carper (D-DE), Schatz (D-HI), Peters (D-MI), King (I-ME), Feinstein (D-CA), Rosen (D-NV), Menendez (D-NJ), Kaine (D-VA), Blumenthal (D-CT), Murphy (D-CT), Hickenlooper (D-CO), Whitehouse (D-RI), Kelly (D-AZ), Sinema (D-AZ), Ossoff (D-GA), Tester (D-MT),Schumer (D-NY), and Cantwell (D-WA). Anti-hunger and nutrition advocates reiterated the importance of these flexibilities and applauded the Senators’ bill to keep critical flexibilities for school nutrition programs to feed children.  “School meal programs, a crucial source of nutritional support for millions of families nationwide, face tremendous immediate and long-term challenges in the absence of these child nutrition waivers,” said Beth Wallace, president of the School Nutrition Association. “Acute supply chain disruptions, persistent labor shortages and escalating costs make it impossible for these programs to return to normal operations next school year. This legislation is absolutely critical to sustaining school meal programs, ensuring children have access to nutritious school meals and preventing substantial financial losses for schools nationwide.” “Without Congressional action, the child nutrition waivers will end on June 30, 2022, causing millions of children to face a hunger cliff when they lose access to summer and school meals. Furthermore, schools and community-based organizations that feed our nation’s children need time to recover from the impact of the pandemic,” said Luis Guardia, president of the Food Research & Action Center. “We applaud Senator Stabenow for her leadership on this issue and strongly endorse this bill which would extend waiver authority through September 30, 2023. Hungry children can't wait.""  ""As our country continues to experience challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including supply chain and labor shortages as well as increased food costs, access to healthful school meals remains of the utmost importance,” said Kevin L. Sauer, registered dietitian nutritionist and the 2021-2022 President of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “Without crucial waivers in place, more children will be at risk for food insecurity and schools will no longer have flexibilities they badly need to operate successful, financially solvent programs. The Academy thanks and supports Sen. Stabenow, who is championing the Support Kids Not Red Tape Act, which would ensure continued access to healthful meals for students.” “The sooner the USDA is authorized to extend child nutrition waivers, the sooner schools and community organizations can plan meal programs for summer and next school year,” said Lisa Davis, senior vice president of Share Our Strength’s No Kid Hungry campaign. “Schools and community meal providers continue to face extreme pandemic-related challenges like supply chain disruptions, rising food prices and staffing shortages. Without waivers, they will have a difficult time responding to these challenges in real-time, impacting their ability to safely and effectively reach kids with the nutrition they need and stunting their ability to transition to normal operations as those challenges subside.” “Nearly 12 million children struggle to know where their next meal will come from, disrupting their ability to reach their full potential. Fortunately, child nutrition waivers have helped provide year-round access to much-needed nutrition. If the waivers aren’t extended, millions of children will lose that access, with Black, Latino, and Native American children, and children in rural areas, being hit hardest,” said Vince Hall, chief government relations officer, Feeding America. “Because of the delay in extending the waivers, some site sponsors will have to close summer and after-school meal sites, translating to taking away meals that families are relying on to keep their kids nourished. Feeding America, the nation’s largest hunger-relief organization, applauds the introduction of this bill to extend child nutrition waivers, continuing this critical lifeline for children. We urge Congress to act immediately to ensure our children don’t face hunger this summer and beyond.”  A broad spectrum of groups sent in letters to Congress to extend the child nutrition waiver authority. Letters included: o   Nearly 2,000 anti-hunger, nutrition, education, children’s, school, preschool, and out of school providers, faith groups and industry groups, among others, from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. o   Mayors Alliance to End Childhood Hunger, which includes representatives from 47 towns; o   General Mills, and o   23 groups, including the School Nutrition Association, School Superintendents Association, National Education Association, National PTA, and American Commodity Distribution Alliance, among others.  ###"

Markey (D-Mass.), member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and Foreign Relations Committee, released the following statement today after the Biden administration released a plan to help address costs for consumers at the pump as a result of Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Senator Markey first called on the Biden administration to release the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in February, and earlier this month introduced the SAVE Consumers Act with Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), which would release an equivalent to 500 days of Russian oil imports from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Senator Markey recently released his 3-Step Plan for 500 Days to Energy Independence, including utilizing the Defense Production Act (DPA) to support the production of clean energy and energy-efficient electric technologies like heat pumps, solar panels, and wind turbines in response to Vladimir Putin’s energy market disruption. “I am pleased President Biden is taking the step to protect consumers from energy price hikes using our existing supply, as I called for in my 500-day plan,” said Senator Markey. “This can immediately bring down prices without buying into Big Oil’s sob story or bailing out the oil companies’ years of false promises on energy independence. We are vulnerable to volatile global prices and paying into Putin’s war because of our addiction to oil. We need this release of the reserve to be the death rattle of our dependency on oil. But we need to use our investments and revenues from the strategic petroleum reserve to protect consumers and build that clean energy system, not more oil and gas rigs. It is critical that we use all tools available to deploy clean energy and energy-efficient electric technologies now, including heat pumps, solar panels, and wind turbines. We can begin by passing a robust climate justice and clean energy package that spurs the transition to a clean energy economy. “As we work to protect consumers at the pump, we must remember that production without protection won’t build a truly clean economy. We must prioritize clean and justice-focused policies throughout our entire energy system and our supply chain, including mining. Our mining laws are deeply outdated. They’re not in the 21st century, nor even in the 20th century. Critical minerals are a key part of the clean energy supply chain, but we need to reform our dangerously archaic system through regulation and legislation, and we need to build strong protections and consultative processes for the Black, Brown, Indigenous, and rural communities who are most at risk from overzealous mining activities.”  "

Markey (D-Mass), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) today sent a letter to Netflix, urging the company to take steps to decrease young people’s exposure to tobacco, nicotine, and vaping imagery in video content. According to a recent report by the Truth Initiative, Netflix has been the top offender for the last four years with respect to the prevalence of this imagery in both new releases and popular shows among 15 to 24 year-olds. In April 2019, Senators Edward J. Markey, Chris Van Hollen and Richard Blumenthal sent letters to major online streaming companies, inquiring about their role in promoting youth tobacco use and urging the companies to prevent youth smoking initiation. Netflix responded to the Senators stating that it was “committed to reducing portrayals of tobacco use in our content” and pledged that “all newly commissioned projects with ratings of TV-14, PG-13 or below will be tobacco-free, unless it is for the limited purpose of historical or factual accuracy, or to convey an anti-smoking message.” However, research shows Netflix continues to produce the highest volume of series and movies that include tobacco imagery compared to other streaming platforms. “Netflix’s apparent failure to stop the proliferation of this content poses serious health risks to young viewers. Young people who are exposed to tobacco imagery on streaming platforms are three times more likely to begin to use vaping products,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter. “This research builds on decades of evidence supporting the proposition that tobacco use in the media can increase youth tobacco use,” continued the lawmakers. “As young people continue to view Netflix’ programming in large numbers, your company has an obligation to ensure that its programming does not pose a health risk to these viewers.” A copy of the letter to Netflix can be found HERE. In June 2018, Senator Markey and several Senate colleagues called on the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) to take action to reduce youth exposure to smoking imagery, including e-cigarette depictions, in youth-rated movies and ensure responsible and consistent practices in rating youth movies with tobacco imagery. "
https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-and-warren-announce-more-than-80-million-in-weatherization-funding-to-help-massachusetts-families-reduce-their-energy-consumption-and-lower-their-energy-bills,"Washington (March 31, 2022) – Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) today announced that Massachusetts will receive $80.1 million from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, or Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), for the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). This funding is approximately 10 times greater than the state’s appropriated funding for WAP in recent years, and will supplement the annual funding Massachusetts will receive from the Fiscal Year 2022 spending bill. WAP is the Department of Energy’s (DOE) largest residential energy retrofit program. According to a DOE evaluation of the program, WAP recipient households save on average $283 or more every year through energy retrofits and upgrades, such as the installation of insulation, heat pumps, and more energy-efficient lighting. “The cleanest and cheapest watt of energy is the one that is never used. The Weatherization Assistance Program is an important resource that enables low-income families to reduce their energy consumption by making their homes more energy efficient,” said the Senators. “We are pleased that Massachusetts will receive much-needed funding to help families lower their energy bills and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. We will continue to advocate for robust funding for weatherization assistance going forward.” In January, Senators Markey and Warren, alongside three of their Senate colleagues, introduced the Heating and Cooling Relief Act to invest in and expand the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which coordinates with WAP and can provide funding for weatherization assistance. This legislation would increase funding made available for weatherization through LIHEAP and establish a new Just Transition Grant for states and localities to help reduce energy burdens for LIHEAP-eligible households and promote renewable energy usage. ###"

Markey (D-Mass.) and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) called on Facebook, PayPal, Discover, Visa, and Instacart to alter their restrictive public-facing name change policies. These platforms currently require users to submit legal documentation and endure a potentially lengthy and expensive legal process to change their public-facing profile name on their accounts. As a result of these strict policies, trans, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming users can be “deadnamed” – or referred to by the birth or legal name with which they no longer identify – and may be “outed” against their will each time they use these platforms or services, which can endanger their health and safety. The letters reference other companies that provide more flexibility when it comes to name changes, and the lawmakers call on the letter recipients to take steps to increase flexibility and remove the barriers to easy and cost-free name changes. “When transgender individuals cannot change their legal name, and their former birth or legal name remains displayed as their profile name online, they are ‘deadnamed,’ write the lawmakers in their letters to the companies. “Deadnaming can have an especially harsh impact on transgender youth. Displaying a transgender individual’s deadname on their profiles can ‘out’ or reveal that person’s gender identity and sexual orientation without their consent, which can endanger their safety and even their life.” A copy of the letters to the companies can be found HERE. Other Senators signing the letter include Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).  Members of the House of Representatives signing the letter include Mark Takano (CA-41), Gwen Moore (WI-04), Sean Casten (IL-06), Ritchie Torres (NY-15), David Cicilline (RI-01), Dina Titus (NV-01), Marie Newman (IL-03), André Carson (IN-07), Raúl Grijalva (AZ-03) and Alan Lowenthal (CA-47). ###"

Response (PDF) Washington (March 30, 2022) – United States Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) today released the findings of the October 2021investigation they opened into four educational technology companies — Gaggle.net, Bark Technologies, GoGuardian, and Securly Inc. — regarding their use of artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithmic systems to monitor students’ online activity. The senators sought to determine whether these products were surveilling students inappropriately, compounding racial disparities in school discipline, and draining resources from more effective student supports. Their investigation confirms the need for federal action to protect students’ civil rights, safety, and privacy. Warren and Markey’s 14-page report, is the first Congressional investigation of the impacts of the use of these student monitoring tools, which have become increasingly prevalent in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. It finds that:  The senators concluded with the following recommendations: “Absent federal action, these surveillance products may continue to put students’ civil rights, safety, and privacy at risk. Given these risks, the federal government should seek methods to track the potential impacts of student surveillance technology on students in protected classes, clarify the definition of ‘monitoring the online activities’ as mentioned in CIPA, and work to ensure that products used by schools maintain student safety and privacy.” This report builds on Senator Warren’s concerns about algorithmic bias disproportionately affecting communities of color in the financial sector and health care systems. Senators Warren and Markey previously sent a letter to Zoom asking about its student safety and privacy protections during the pandemic and signed onto a letter about student privacy and racial bias in exam-proctoring software. ###"

Markey (D-Mass.) chaired a Senate Climate Change Task Force meeting today, alongside Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) to discuss the importance of the United States becoming energy independent through a clean energy transition.  “Real energy independence is about freedom. It’s about freedom from a volatile globalized oil commodity, from high gas prices, and from pollution, dirty air, and dirty water—especially within Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities, which bear the heaviest burden of pollution,” said Senator Markey during his opening remarks at the Task Force meeting. “An energy freedom strategy that stops funding wars and starts protecting our health and our pocketbooks is the real energy independence strategy. And this is the only acceptable energy strategy for the American people.” During the task force meeting, Senator Markey laid out a plan for 500 days to energy independence in three essential steps: 1.      Ban All Oil Imports from Russia: Last month, President Biden took the important step of banning Russian energy imports. To build on this smart decision, Congress should pass Senator Markey’s SPIGOT Act – co-sponsored by Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and led in the House by Representatives Ro Khanna (CA-17) and Nancy Mace (SC-01) – to make the ban on the importation of Russian oil and petroleum products into the United States permanent, while taking steps to prioritize carbon-free energy as an alternative to Russian fuel and take down Putin’s oil oligarchs by investigating the links between Russian oil and human rights abuses.  2.      Protect Consumers at the Pump and Transition to a Clean Energy Future: Senator Markey’s SAVE Consumers Act – also co-sponsored by Senator Heinrich – will provide consumers short-term relief by releasing an equivalent to 500 days of Russian oil imports from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The SAVE Consumers Act, coupled with Senator Markey’s call for the President to invoke the Defense Production Act to support the production of clean energy and energy-efficient electric technologies, can back out all of the oil the United States currently imports from Russia long-term and put the United States and our allies on a pathway to a clean, affordable, and secure future.  By putting 5 million new electric vehicles on the road, replacing 5.5 million oil heaters with energy efficient heat pumps, and deploying 500,000 new clean school and public transit buses, the United States can cut its demand for oil, create true energy independence, protect the climate, and save consumers money.  3.      Pass Clean Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Climate Justice Measures: Critical climate justice and clean energy provisions – already widely supported by Democrats in Congress – include a Civilian Climate Corps to train a new generation of workers on climate action and clean energy; tax credits and rebates for renewable energy, electric vehicles, heating and cooling devices, and domestic clean energy manufacturing to create good-paying American jobs; national climate bank funding to provide communities with access to capital to fund projects to cut dangerous emissions; and environmental justice investments to bring clean air, clean water, and clean energy to the most disadvantaged communities. If Congress acts on these three essential steps, the United States can permanently end its reliance on Russian energy—while powering the economy with cheaper, cleaner energy—within 500 days. These steps will also put the United States on a path to fully transition to greener, cheaper energy within 10 years. A one-pager of Senator Markey’s proposed plan can be found HERE. "

percent of Massachusetts bridges are currently classified as structurally
deficientWashington (January 15, 2021) – The United
States Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
this week announced the first round of funding from a $27.5 billion bridge
formula program created by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).
This is the largest bridge formula program in American history, with funding
that will be distributed to states and tribal transportation facilities over
the next five years. In this initial round of funding, the Massachusetts
Department of Transportation will receive $225.3 million for fiscal year 2022.
Over the life of the program, Massachusetts will eventually receive $1.1
billion for bridge replacement and repair projects across the Commonwealth.In addition to the formula funding in route to
the Massachusetts DOT today, the IIJA includes a $12.5 billion bridge
investment program, which will provide competitive grants to assist state,
local, federal and tribal entities in rehabilitating or replacing bridges.
Massachusetts can compete for additional resources under this program to
undertake critical projects like the replacement of the Cape Cod Canal Bridges.“This week’s bridge funding announcement marks
the beginning of a new era for surface transportation and bridge safety in
Massachusetts,” said Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.). “Of the 5,229
bridges in our Commonwealth, 472 – or nine percent – are currently classified
as structurally deficient. But we now can end decades of crumbling bridge
infrastructure from Pittsfield to Cape Cod by giving the Massachusetts Department
of Transportation the resources needed to make critical and long overdue
repairs to our most important throughways. And with billions more available for
the Commonwealth from the bipartisan infrastructure law, we can take steps to
replace critical passageways and evacuation routes, like the Cape Cod Canal
bridges, and ensure they are structurally sound and operational for the
remainder of the 21st century.”“This record $225 million federal bridge
investment will increase safety and improve transportation options for
Massachusetts families and businesses while boosting the Commonwealth’s
economy,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). “Today's
announcement is just the first installment of $1.1 billion that’s coming to
Massachusetts for bridge replacement and repairs, and when added to the
additional billions that are coming from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act overall, translates to thousands of good paying jobs that will revitalize
our crumbling infrastructure.”“Modernized and improved bridges statewide will
provide safety for all users, and create good-paying jobs for workers,” said
Congressman Richard E. Neal, Chair of the House Committee on Ways and Means
(MA-01). “Bridges are vital pieces of our infrastructure - not only to our
daily commutes, but also to emergency vehicles and the trucks that are making
deliveries in our communities. I am grateful to the Biden Administration for
making this promise a reality.”“Our national failure to invest in
infrastructure has consequences. We all pay the price in slower commutes, more
dangerous roads, more frequent car repairs, and a backlog of broken bridges a
mile long,” said Congressman Jim McGovern (MA-02). “There are bridges in
the Second District old enough to qualify for Medicare—but thanks to President
Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, things will soon be changing for the
better. This is not just about fixing broken bridges, it’s about investing in
our future and ensuring that America remains competitive in the global
economy.”“I am very pleased to see the first round of
bridge funding has been released to Massachusetts from the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law,” said Congressman Stephen Lynch (MA-08). 
“There are almost 500 structurally deficient bridges across our state and the
first round of $225.3M will allow us to finally start replacing and fixing our
bridges.  This funding is vital to improving transportation safety across
the Commonwealth and I am proud to have worked with all my Massachusetts
colleagues to help secure this funding for our communities.”“Beyond the Cape Cod Canal Bridges, we have many
smaller bridges in Southeastern Massachusetts that have been deemed
structurally deficient - a percentage well above the state’s average,” said
Congressman Bill Keating (MA-09). “The bridge funding will go a long way to
address this concerning issue throughout the region and help the Commonwealth
expedite their plan for repairs. We expect to continue to see dividends from
this bipartisan infrastructure bill.”“There are 472 bridges in poor condition across
Massachusetts, and we know that poor road conditions are both a safety hazard
and lead to costly repairs for drivers,” said Assistant Speaker Katherine
Clark (MA-05). “Today’s funding announcement is just the beginning of the
over $1.1 billion for bridge replacement and repairs our state can expect to
receive over the next five years from the Infrastructure Law. This critical
funding will enhance safety for drivers, improve quality of life and cut costs
for commuters, and create new jobs. This milestone brings us one step closer to
a stronger, competitive 21st-century economy.”“Nobody traveling America’s roads in 2022 should
have to worry about falling through a bridge—and yet that’s how badly we’ve let
things go,” said Congressman Seth Moulton (MA-06).  “With almost
10% of bridges in Massachusetts classified as structurally deficient, this
federal investment will ensure that we can once again trust our roads to get us
where we need to go, and trust our government to deliver on its basic promise
to keep us safe.""“Repairing and modernizing the Commonwealth’s
bridges will help boost our economic recovery, create jobs and make our
communities more safe and connected,” said Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley
(MA-07). “We must get these federal dollars out the door as quickly as
possible, and I’ll continue fighting to deliver President Biden’s full Build
Back Better agenda and make the remaining investments our workers and families
need in this moment.”  “Today’s bridge funding announcement is just
another way the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law continues to deliver for working
families across the Commonwealth,” said Congresswoman Lori Trahan (MA-03). “Crumbling
bridges plague Bay Staters everywhere, but especially families that live along
the Merrimack and Nashua Rivers. By investing billions in new funding to repair
and rebuild bridges in the Third District and beyond, this historic package
will improve the daily lives of working families everywhere and create good
jobs in the process. I look forward to working with my colleagues to maximize
the impact of these investments in the Third District and across
Massachusetts.”“America should be fixing bridges, not building
walls – and now we are,” said Congressman Jake Auchincloss (MA-04).

tools, integrate technologies across scales, and inventory national
infrastructure to improve air quality management Washington
(January 14, 2022)—Today, Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Chair of the
Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate, and Nuclear
Safety, introduced the Technology Assessment for Air Quality Management Act,
legislation to authorize $55 million over five years for the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to annually update and expand its online air quality
toolbox with best-available monitoring technologies and associated uses of
data, connect the toolbox with environmental justice mapping and screening
tools, and create full-time equivalent positions to support the work. The
legislation would also establish a working group consisting of representatives
from EPA regional offices, air agencies, environmental justice networks, data
science, and public health science to develop templates for integrated
monitoring systems. In addition, it would direct the EPA and the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct an inventory of the locations and
operation statuses of air monitors, existing data infrastructure, high-priority
areas for monitoring deployment in environmental justice communities, and
workforce needs to improve air quality management across scales. “Now,
more than ever, we need to address the deep-rooted injustices of air pollution
and its disparate effects on our communities’ public health,” said Senator
Markey. “As air quality technologies continue to improve, we must use those
improvements to institute better, bolder, more adaptive, and more equitable
assessments and management of air quality nationwide.” A
copy of the bill text can be found HERE. The
legislation is co-sponsored in the Senate by Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.),
Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), Richard Blumenthal
(D-Conn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Bernie Sanders
(I-Vt.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Patty Murray
(D-Wash.), and Cory A. Booker (D-N.J.). The
legislation is endorsed by Environmental Defense Fund, American Lung
Association, Clean Air Task Force, American Thoracic Society, and Dr. Sacoby
Wilson (Director of the Center for Community Engagement, Environmental Justice,
and Health). “Hyperlocal
air quality monitoring technologies are critically important for understanding
the local health impacts of air pollution,” said Sarah Vogel, Senior Vice
President for Health at the Environmental Defense Fund. “We need better
data on local sources of air pollution, information on health outcomes, and the
ability to integrate this data into decision-making. We thank Senator Markey
for introducing the Technology Assessment for Air Quality Management Act,
which would provide needed tools to better understand air pollution and protect
health.” “Thank
you to Senator Markey for introducing the Technology Assessment for Air
Quality Management Act and for his continued leadership on addressing air
pollution,” said Harold Wimmer, President & CEO of the American Lung
Association. “Accurately monitoring air quality is a key component in
protecting public health, and it is especially important to prioritize
monitoring in the communities that have been left behind in the pursuit for
healthy air. Exploring ways to expand air quality monitoring and ensuring that
data is efficiently shared with local communities is necessary to ensure clean
air for all.” 
“Innovative
technologies play a critical role to improve our understanding of the air
pollution burden in our nation, especially in environmental justice
communities,” said Dr. John Graham, Senior Scientist of the Clean Air Task
Force. “This Act will provide a fundamental database of air pollution
monitoring techniques and their uses and will help optimize resource deployment
to improve the safety of communities.”"
https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-applauds-ferc-announcement-to-reconsider-weymouth-compressor-station-authorization,"Facility
has shut down four times due to unplanned gas releases and technical concerns
since it began operations in 2020 Washington (January 14, 2022) – Senator Edward J. Markey
(D-Mass.), Chair of the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air,
Climate, and Nuclear Safety, released the following statement after the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) announced it will reconsider the authorization
of the Weymouth Compressor Station in Weymouth, Massachusetts. The facility has
been plagued by unplanned gas releases and shutdowns since it began operating
in 2020. Last April, Senator Markey wrote to FERC in response to its request for a paper briefing on
the rehearing request, urging the Commission to rehear and rescind the
station’s in-service authorization.  “The Weymouth compressor station is a clear threat to our
communities and the environment and does nothing to address energy reliability
in Massachusetts. I am pleased that FERC has finally heeded my repeated calls
to revisit the unwarranted approval of this dangerous project,” said Senator Markey. “Local community members and
environmental justice advocates have long opposed this project, and its
repeated emergency gas releases and shutdowns have only given credence to their
concerns. This facility exports fossil gas for profit while importing new dangers
to families in Weymouth and the surrounding area. I look forward to
continuing to work with the Weymouth community and the dedicated activists to
ensure that FERC does the right thing and finally shuts this project down for
good.” In February 2021, Senators Markey and Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.) and Representative Stephen Lynch (MA-08) wrote to FERC urging the expeditious approval of the rehearing
request for the in-service certificate issued for the Weymouth compressor
station.  Following the second emergency shutdown of the station in
October 2020 due to two unplanned gas releases, Canadian energy company
Enbridge announced it would pause activities at the Weymouth site. In December
2020, against the urging of Senator Markey, the federal government authorized
Enbridge to restart operations. After the third unplanned gas release in April
2021, just days after Senator Markey visited the station, he again urged FERC to approve the rehearing request and called on PHSMA to
immediately investigate the release and pause operation of the gas station. In May 2021, the Weymouth Compressor Station was shut down for
the fourth time in less than a year. Last year,
Senators Markey and Warren introduced the COMPRESSOR Act, which would block construction
or operation of any compressor station built as part of a pipeline project to
export natural gas – as the Weymouth station would, with plans to export
natural gas to Canada.

https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-outlines-opposition-to-fda-commissioner-nominee-dr-robert-califf-calls-for-reforms-at-fda-to-address-failures-that-lead-to-worsened-opioid-epidemic,"Washington (January 13, 2022) – With data showing that the
opioid epidemic has only worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, Senator Edward
J. Markey (D-Mass.) today outlined his ongoing concerns with the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) failures to effectively regulate addictive opioids and his
opposition to FDA Commissioner nominee Dr. Robert Califf.  In his letter, Senator Markey highlighted how, over 25
years, the FDA repeatedly rubberstamped new prescription opioids that increased
the risk of misuse and dependence and failed to limit the broad availability of
these drugs, acted too slowly to remove them from the market or place
restrictions on their labels, and continued to approve powerful new opioids
either over the express objections of its advisory committees or without
convening an advisory committee at all. In 2019, the FDA issued a draft
guidance on risk assessment for opioid analgesic drugs.  However, Senator
Markey notes that the guidance does not explicitly require data on comparative
effectiveness and safety of new opioids or discuss consideration of diversion
in opioid approvals, nor has the FDA taken further steps either to improve or
finalize this critical guidance.  Making the case that stronger regulation of prescription
opioids continues to have a role in controlling the epidemic, Senator Markey
highlighted several key steps the FDA needs to take in order to show necessary
leadership:  Senator Markey met with FDA Commissioner nominee Dr. Califf
in December 2021 to discuss his concerns with the FDA’s efforts to regulate
opioids, asking Dr. Califf to make commitments on the draft risk assessment
guidance, mandatory prescriber education, and the role of independent advisory
committees for opioid approvals. Senator Markey opposed Dr. Califf’s nomination
to be FDA Commissioner in 2016.  “During our meeting, Dr. Califf did not commit to the
decisive and comprehensive action necessary to ensure reforms that the FDA,
under his leadership, would implement on opioid regulation. After years of
agency failures and in the midst of a worsening opioid epidemic, we need FDA
leadership that is fully committed to utilizing the agency’s full oversight
authority to protect public health,” writes
Senator Markey in his letter to Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock. “We
continue to live with the consequences of the FDA’s failure to effectively
regulate opioids. I remain alarmed that the agency has not done enough to
account for or reform its processes for reviewing these supercharged
painkillers.”  A copy of Senator Markey’s letter to the FDA can be found HERE.  Senator Markey is a Congressional leader in the effort to
combat the opioid crisis. He has passed several pieces of legislation to fund
and expand opioid addiction prevention and treatment programs, as well as
introduced legislation mandating
education on safe prescribing for any prescriber of opioid medication. In 2016,
he succeeded in
getting the Food and Drug Administration to agree to his request to reassess
the way it considers the risks of addiction and misuse when it evaluates the
safety of new opioids. In April 2021, Senator Markey led Senators
Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.),
and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) in introducing the Support,
Treatment, and Overdose Prevention (STOP) of Fentanyl Act to
combat the fentanyl overdose crisis.  He is the author of the Addiction
Treatment Access Improvement Act and the Eliminating Opioid-Related Infectious
Diseases Act and has also introduced legislation with Senator Mike
Braun (R-Ind.), the Lessening
Addiction by Enhancing Labeling (LABEL) Opioids Act, which calls for
labeling of prescription opioid bottles with a consistent, clear, and concise
warning label on the potential of the drugs for dependence, addiction, or
overdose.

https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/markey-keating-warren-and-moulton-to-holtec-dont-dump-radioactive-water-into-cape-cod-bay,"Washington
(January 12, 2022)– Congressman Bill Keating, who represents Southeastern
Massachusetts, including Plymouth and Cape Cod, Senator Edward J. Markey, Chair
of the Senate’s Clean Air, Climate, and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee, Senator
Elizabeth Warren, and Congressman Seth Moulton, who represents Massachusetts'
north shore including the fishing port of Gloucester, today sent a letter to
Holtec Decommissioning International expressing opposition to the proposed
discharge of radioactive water from Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station into Cape Cod
Bay.   Late
last year, the Cape Cod Times first reported on Holtec’s proposed plan to
discharge approximately one million gallons of irradiated water from Pilgrim’s
spent fuel cooling pool into Cape Cod Bay—a volume nearly three times greater
than Pilgrim has released over any prior year. 
This news was met with swift opposition across the board – from federal,
state, and local elected officials, local industry officials, and residents of
the communities surrounding Cape Cod Bay.   In
today’s letter, the Massachusetts lawmakers encourage Holtec to consider
alternative methods of disposal, specifically referencing the approach used in
the decommissioning of the Vermont Yankee Power Plant.  There, the NorthStar Nuclear Decommissioning
Company shipped their radioactive water out of state to a proper disposal
facility.  Further, the lawmakers
stressed the importance of Holtec’s obligation to the communities surrounding
Cape Cod Bay and encouraged them to engage with local residents and businesses
on the potential impacts of this critical decision.   “The
strong public opposition to news of the proposed discharge reflects Holtec’s
failure to engage in the forthright, open, and transparent process that it
promised the Plymouth community and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts when it
took over the operating license for the decommissioning of Pilgrim,” wrote the
lawmakers. “Holtec’s proposal to discharge approximately one million gallons of
radioactive water into Cape Cod Bay would only further burden the community
surrounding Pilgrim, which has already borne the negative environmental impacts
of the nuclear plant for more than 40 years. Forcing this latest discharge upon
the community would threaten the reputations and operations of the many
businesses and organizations that rely on Cape Cod Bay’s reputation for clean
and safe water.”   A
full copy of the letter can be found HERE.   Congressman
Keating and Senator Markey have long worked together to ensure that the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) and Holtec prioritizes safety and public
participation throughout Pilgrims decommissioning process. In August 2019,
they, along with Senator Warren, wrote to the NRC urging it to delay its ruling
on the proposed license transfer for Pilgrim from Entergy Nuclear Operations,
Inc. to Holtec until after the Commission considered and ruled on existing
petitions and motions. In October 2018, they demanded clear details from Holtec
and Entergy about the safety, security, and financial integrity issues involved
in the ownership, transfer, and eventual decommissioning of the power plant.

(January 12, 2022) – Today, Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), the Chair of
the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate, and
Nuclear Safety, today issued a statement applauding the Biden administration’s
announcements on federal clean energy deployment. The Biden administration
today announced a record-breaking offshore lease sale that will support
union jobs, new offshore wind consortium grants, investments for manufacturing
and staging hubs at ports, and a new memorandum of understanding between the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management on shared ocean use. The Department of Energy also released a report today on how to amplify offshore wind in the United
States, which includes several policies introduced and led by Senator Markey,
such as offshore wind manufacturing tax incentives.
 “To
create a livable future for the next generation, we need bold and effective
policies to rapidly deploy clean energy sources like offshore wind. Today’s
announcement from the Biden administration shows that the United States will be
a home for offshore wind generation, manufacturing, and good-paying union
jobs,” said Senator Markey. “We can
build on this baseline with the transformational policies to drive deployment
of offshore wind turbines in U.S. waters and foster domestic manufacturing --
many of which are included in the Build Back Better Act. We cannot wait
any longer. Let’s put those winds to work.” Senator
Markey is the author of the Offshore
Wind Jobs and Opportunity Act, which would investigate the offshore
wind industry’s needs by engaging relevant stakeholders and create a grant
program to train new workers for a critical clean energy technology. Senator
Markey has also introduced the Offshore
Wind Manufacturing Act, which would create a 30 percent manufacturing
investment tax credit for facilities that manufacture offshore wind components
and vessels, create a manufacturing production tax credit for selected offshore
wind components, and require prevailing wage rates for workers. In the last
Congress, Senators Markey and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.),
and Congressman Jim Langevin (RI-02) reintroduced legislation that would spur
the growth of offshore wind energy by extending tax credits for the renewable
energy industry. Key components of their Offshore
Wind Incentives for New Development (WIND) Act were included in
the year-end
spending package in December 2020, including the provision that
extends the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for offshore wind facilities at 30
percent through 2025.  In
December 2019, Senator Markey sent letters to offshore wind developers Vineyard Wind, Ørsted,
Mayflower Wind, and Equinor calling on them to enter into Project Labor
Agreements (PLA) for all projects off Massachusetts and the larger East
Coast. A PLA would ensure that newly created jobs in the offshore wind industry
would be filled with a highly skilled local union workforce. The Biden
administration’s leasing announcement for the New York Bight will encourage
PLAs for winning bidders.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced $13.4 million in funding for next-generation plastics technologies that reduce the energy consumption and carbon emissions of single-use plastics. The seven selected research and development (R&D) projects — led by industry and universities — will convert plastic films into more valuable materials and design new plastics that are more recyclable and biodegradable. This investment advances  DOE’s work to address the challenges of plastic waste recycling and supports the Biden Administration’s efforts to build a clean energy economy and ensure the U.S. reaches net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. 

“Single-use plastics generate large amounts of carbon pollution when produced, are hard to recycle, and dirty our nation’s beaches, parks and neighborhoods,” said Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “By advancing technologies that repurpose single-use plastics and make the materials biodegradable, we can hit a trifecta of reduced plastic waste, fewer emissions from the plastics industry, and an influx of clean manufacturing jobs for American workers.” 

Single-use plastics, such as plastic bags, wraps, and films, are incredibly energy-intensive to produce. In fact, plastic production accounts for more than 3% of total U.S. energy consumption. Despite their high embodied energy use, many of these materials end up in our landfills or our environment. Yet, less than 10% of plastics are currently recycled, most of which are “downcycled,” or repurposed into low-value products. 

The seven selected projects will work to develop affordable solutions for “upcycling,” or transforming plastic films into more valuable materials, and to design new plastics that are more recyclable and biodegradable – innovating both the processes of single-use plastics recycling, and the single-use plastics themselves.  
 
Projects selected are: 

“Single-use plastics are everywhere. They are used to make our plastic coffee cups, takeout containers, straws, and grocery bags. Yet despite their ubiquity, they are among the most difficult kinds of plastic to recycle. Combatting the plastic pollution crisis will require us to not only reduce our use of single-plastics, but also develop the technology necessary to properly recycle them. I am proud that the University of Massachusetts Lowell is working on innovative recycling technology to help address this serious problem and that the Biden administration is dedicating resources passed by Congress to this critical issue,” said U.S. Senator Ed Markey (MA).  



“The way we currently produce and dispose of single-use plastics is extremely energy-intensive and detrimental to our environment. I am thrilled the Department of Energy will fund this innovative project from Colorado's TDA Research, which will help reduce waste and cut greenhouse gas pollution to bring us closer to meeting our climate goals,” said U.S. Senator Michael Bennet (CO). 



“Today’s announcement underscores the importance of the groundbreaking research conducted by WVU’s world-class students and faculty and the ongoing partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy. This funding will help advance technologies to reduce emissions from plastic production and enhance our recycling capabilities – innovative solutions critical to lowering our carbon footprint and improving the health and quality of our environment. I look forward to seeing the positive impacts of this project, and I will continue to advocate for funding to support research opportunities across the Mountain State,” said U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 



“I’m glad UMass Lowell is being awarded this grant from the Department of Energy to develop new ways to recycle single-use plastics. I cannot wait to see what solutions they come up with to create a more sustainable future,” said U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (MA). 



“I’m proud that Michigan’s academic and scientific communities continue to lead the world in research and cutting-edge innovation that has been invaluable in the fight to address climate change.
Michigan State University is a world-class institution – and I’m excited they
will continue to spearhead efforts to reduce plastic waste and create more
sustainable environments, making our communities even better places to work,
live, and raise a family,” said U.S Senator Gary Peters (MI). “I congratulate TDA Research Inc., out of
Wheat Ridge, Colorado for innovating the way we use and recycle our food
packaging. Single-use plastics are not only energy-intensive to make, they are
difficult to recycle and reuse. TDA’s work will help make this packaging into a
valuable, reusable product and will make it biodegradable so it doesn’t harm
the environment. It is innovation like this that will help us in the fight
against climate change,” said U.S. Representative Ed Perlmutter
(CO-07). This funding opportunity builds on DOE
investments, including the?Bio-Optimized Technologies to keep Thermoplastics out of
Landfills and the Environment (BOTTLE) Consortium?and the?Reducing EMbodied energy And Decreasing Emissions (REMADE)
Institute.  DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and
Renewable Energy’s?Advanced Manufacturing Office?and?Bioenergy Technologies Office?oversee these investments.
DOE’s?Office of Science,?Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management and ARPA-e?also play key roles in supporting plastic research
and development efforts. ###"

Commonwealth through American Rescue Plan Washington
(January 10, 2021) – Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.) today announced that Massachusetts will receive a record $307.5
million for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) for the 2022
fiscal year. The Biden administration reported that in addition to an annual
appropriation of $120.5 million for Massachusetts, the state received an
additional $187.1 million in funds from the American Rescue Plan – more than
double the state’s typical annual funding for the energy assistance program. LIHEAP is the main
federal program that helps low-income households and seniors with their energy
bills, providing critical assistance during the cold winter and hot summer
months. “This
historic amount of funding to help households cover home energy costs in
Massachusetts means no family or senior has to go cold this winter,” said Senators Markey and Warren. “Thousands of
additional Massachusetts residents will qualify for vital fuel assistance, and
we will once again ensure that our most vulnerable residents are taken care of
– especially in the midst of this pandemic. But as climate change makes
seasons more extreme and supply chain disruptions continue to exacerbate energy
burdens for families, LIHEAP funding must be allocated to not only give
families the annual subsidies they need, but also to provide support for
weatherization, which will help them reduce their energy burdens over time. We
thank the Biden administration for its efforts to distribute this funding and
look forward to continuing to expand this home energy assistance program.”  As
a part of the American Rescue Plan, Senators Markey and Warren advocated for $20 billion in
funding for Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) and $4.5 billion in additional
funding to LIHEAP. On
Wednesday, Senator Markey, Congressman Jamaal Bowman (NY-16), and Congresswoman
Jan Schakowsky (IL-09) led a bicameral letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
urging the agency to use its authority to protect consumers from unfairly high

Markey pushes for comprehensive voting reform in remarks on Senate floor Washington (January 6, 2022) – On the anniversary of the
January 6th United States Capitol insurrection, Senator Edward J.
Markey (D-Mass.) delivered remarks on the floor of the Senate in support of
democracy and voting reform. Below are excerpts from his remarks.  “As we now reflect on these events a year later, we must
understand [that] this attack on our democracy [was] larger than any one
person, candidate, or election cycle… The January 6th mob was fueled not only
by the ‘Big Lie,’ but the rise of authoritarian and nationalist movements that
reject the basic principles of American democracy: equality, freedom, and the
peaceful transfer of power…  “So many were willing to believe lies about the legitimacy
of President Joe Biden’s victory because they had lost faith in the integrity
of our democratic system. Some were even willing to engage in horrific violence
because they believed elections could be stolen… “But we have a chance – right now on the Senate floor – to
stand up to this anti-democratic movement and banish these discriminatory
policies to the political dustbin. The Senate can and must take action to pass
the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement
Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. And we must abolish the filibuster –
if just for this issue – to do so… “With the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and
Freedom to Vote Act, we will not only guarantee that all Americans can exercise
their right to vote in free and fair elections, we can also counter the
distrust and disenchantment that the insurrectionists exploited on January 6th.
These reforms can restore Americans’ faith in the peaceful transfer of power
and prevent another attempt at insurrection by ensuring we have a government

Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Congressman Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), and
Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), led a bicameral letter to Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Chairman Richard Glick urging the agency to
use its authority to protect consumers from unfairly high energy costs. “We write to express our concern in regard to
the effect that anticipated increases in heating and energy costs will have on
our constituents this winter,” wrote the
lawmakers. “As the entity tasked with the regulatory mission of ensuring
consumers can access reliable energy at a reasonable cost, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) has a significant role to play in promoting energy
justice and protecting United States residents from unfairly high energy costs.
Under its statutory authority, FERC has the power to influence retail rates for
natural gas and electricity, including by preventing market manipulation in
wholesale natural gas and electricity markets and enforcing gas spot market
transparency. We urge the Commission to use its existing regulatory authority
to ensure that households’ energy bills are not driven up by manipulation,
obfuscation, or other malfeasance from regulated entities, and to work
collaboratively with other agencies to address energy debt.” “For too long, the federal government has
allowed too many utility companies to put profit above the public,” continued the lawmakers. “We have a responsibility to
ensure that everyone has access to safe living conditions, and we cannot let
corporate greed or a quest for profit get in the way of fundamental human
rights…With high winter energy costs, the ongoing threat of the pandemic, and
racial and economic justice issues surrounding energy debt, we urge FERC to use
its existing statutory authority to better protect consumers from energy market
manipulation. FERC should use existing statutory authority to provide more
transparency on gas spot markets to protect consumers from companies that use
hidden prices to set or manipulate energy costs on a non-competitive basis.” Members of Congress who joined the letter include
Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Dick
Durbin (D-Ill.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.),
Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.),
Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.),

detains people on behalf of ICE Washington
(January 3, 2022) – Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.) are requesting the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conduct an immediate review of the
detainee conditions at the Plymouth County Correction Facility (PCCF) in
Plymouth, Massachusetts, which is managed by the Plymouth County Sheriff’s
Department and currently detains people on behalf of ICE. Attorneys for
immigrant detainees, advocacy groups, and family members of those detained have
raised serious concerns related to the treatment and care of detainees at PCCF,
including detainees’ lack of access to food and hot water, inadequate medical
care, insufficient hygienic maintenance, limited and monitored interactions
with counsel, violation of their rights to practice religion, and retaliatory
punishment.   “We
are highly concerned that the rights and health of people detained on behalf of
ICE at PCCF remain in jeopardy,” write the
Senators in their letter to DHS and ICE. “Detainees should have access to a
safe, dignified, and lawful environment. ICE officials and contractors must be
transparent about how they treat people in their custody, and held accountable
if they have refused to treat people in their custody consistent with basic
human dignity and DHS rules and regulations.” A
copy of the letter can be found HERE. While Plymouth County Sheriff’s Office announced its plans
to end its 287(g) agreement with ICE in September, the decision does not
impact PCCF’s detention of immigrants. After ICE terminated
immigration-detention agreements with the Bristol and Franklin County — the other Massachusetts jails that previously held
immigrant detainees — a number of detainees were
transferred to PCCF.

https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-warren-and-reps-keating-moulton-celebrate-usda-purchase-of-new-england-groundfish-products,"Washington (December 23, 2021) – Senators Edward J. Markey
(D-Mass.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Congressmen William Keating
(MA-09) and Seth Moulton (MA-06), released the following joint statement
celebrating the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) announcement
yesterday that it will purchase $25 million in Atlantic
groundfish products through the Section 32 program for distribution to
various food nutrition assistance programs. The USDA Section 32 program
historically overlooked East Coast seafood, until the Massachusetts
congressional delegation took action last year to push for its inclusion. This
latest purchase will continue to help East Coast seafood producers that have
been devastated by the ongoing effects of the pandemic. “We are pleased that the USDA is continuing to support the
Atlantic seafood industry, as we have urged them to do, after our contributions
went overlooked in federal purchases for far too long. The ongoing effects of
the pandemic warrant ongoing partnerships with the fishing communities that are
keystones of our culture and economy in Massachusetts, as well for the food
pantries that keep our communities fed.” Senators Markey and Warren, and Congressmen Keating and
Moulton, wrote to the USDA in both April
and May
2020 to urge the inclusion of domestic and Atlantic seafood companies in the
deployment of the $9.5 billion awarded by the Coronavirus Assistance, Relief,
and Economic Security (CARES) Act for affected agricultural producers. In
May 2020, the Massachusetts lawmakers were successful when the USDA announced
that it would include $20 million of Atlantic Haddock, Pollock, and Redfish in
additional Section 32 food purchases made available in part by the CARES Act.

""This is a  momentous day for the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, for indigenous communities across the country, and for defenders of justice.  We are grateful that President Biden and his administration, including Secretary Deb  Haaland, Assistant Secretary Bryan Newland, and Solicitor Robert  Anderson, have faithfully implemented the law and respected the sovereign rights of our tribe to protect our reservation. To Senators Warren and Markey, to Representative Keating and former Representative  Kennedy, to all the members of Congress and the Massachusetts  Legislature, the more than 40 tribes and tribal organizations across the country, and the more than 350,000 citizens who have unfailingly championed our cause, we share this day with you. Today's decision allows us to reclaim and protect our cherished Land and better serve the  Mashpee Tribe for generations to come.  While the injustices inflicted upon us cannot be erased, we can look to the future -  a future of freedom, a future of prosperity, and a future of peace. We  wish this not just for the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, but for Tribal  communities all across the land.""""The  Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe has withstood years of uncertainty after the  Trump administration's unlawful, unprecedented and unjust attempt to abrogate their sovereignty and take away their Tribal lands,"" said U.S. Senator Ed Markey. ""The  Department of the Interior's decision today finally lays to rest these wrongful actions and reaffirms the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe's right to this land, which they have stewarded for more than 10,000  years. I join Tribal Leadership and the Wampanoag people in celebrating this decision and look forward to our continued partnership. We must  take every opportunity to support and elevate Tribal sovereignty and  land rights across the federal government as a  cornerstone of our fight for a just, livable future.""  ""I  congratulate the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe on this major victory, which conclusively reaffirms the trust status of their reservation,"" said U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren. ""The  Massachusetts congressional delegation and I have proudly stood with the Tribe throughout its fight to protect their ancestral homelands—a  fight that should never have been necessary in the first place. I am  glad to see the Biden Administration and the Department  of the Interior finally issue this confirmation, and to end the attempt  begun by the Trump Administration's to unjustly disestablish the  Tribe's reservation.""  ""Today's decision by the Bureau of Indian Affairs does not make up for centuries of wrongs foisted upon the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe by the United States government, but it does represent a new chapter of self-determination for the People of the First Light,"" said Congressman Bill Keating. ""I  applaud the BIA's decision to look beyond the political calculations of  the prior administration and instead  focus on the needs and wishes of the Tribe and extend my  congratulations to Chairman Weeden and the Tribe as a whole as they  benefit from this decision going forward."""

of Letter (PDF)Washington, D.C. – United States Senators Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.), and Representatives Ayanna
Pressley (D-Mass.) and Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), sent a letter to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky
and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra
urging them to monitor, report, and address racial and other ethnic demographic
disparities in breakthrough COVID-19 cases nationwide. Comprehensive data collection will improve experts’ ability to study the
spread of new variants, and to address the crucial health needs of communities
most at risk during the pandemic. Currently, just four states report
breakthrough COVID-19 case data by race and ethnicity, while the CDC only
reports breakthrough cases that result in hospitalization or death, and these
data are not publicly available by race or ethnicity. Public health experts have
explained that additional data on breakthrough cases could provide critical
information regarding the spread of new COVID-19 variants, including Omicron.“We urge you to resume collecting data on COVID-19 breakthrough infections
nationwide with breakdowns by race, ethnicity, and other demographic
characteristics and to make this data publicly available as soon as possible.
Comprehensive data collection would allow experts to better understand patterns
in breakthrough cases, identify COVID-19 variants earlier, and analyze the
potential effect of compounding ‘racial and ethnic inequities in wealth,
health, education, work housing, and medical care’ on vaccine response,”
the lawmakers wrote.Black, Latino, and Indigenous communities continue to be at increased
risk of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Even among vaccinated individuals, the
limited available data indicates that breakthrough
cases appear to be more common among people of color than among white
people. More comprehensive data on breakthrough cases will allow researchers
and policymakers to respond effectively to this crucial public health and
racial equity issue.In February 2021, Senator Warren, Senator Markey, and
     Rep. Pressley led their colleagues in introducing the Equitable
     Data Collection and Disclosure on COVID-19 Act,
     legislation to require the federal government to collect and publicly
     release racial and other demographic data on COVID-19. Aspects of the
     legislation were included in a COVID-19 relief package signed into law

https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/massachusetts-congressional-delegation-applauds-historic-investments-in-massachusetts-roadway-infrastructure,"Commonwealth set to receive $804.6 million from
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve roads, promote safety, and reduce
pollution Washington (December 21, 2021) – After enactment of the
bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the U.S. Department
of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is now distributing
$52.5 billion in its first tranche of funding for infrastructure projects that
will improve the safety and performance of America’s highways. This investment
is for Fiscal Year 2022, and Massachusetts will receive $804.6 million in this
round of funding. These federal investments will go toward important
projects, including highway performance improvements, bridge repair, and
expanding pedestrian and bicyclist infrastructure. The total funding also
includes a dedicated $44.4 million for highway safety improvements, $69.1
million for congestion mitigation and air quality improvement, $18 million for
carbon reduction efforts, and $20.5 million for strengthening the resiliency of
transportation infrastructure. “This massive investment into Massachusetts roadways
demonstrates the beginning of our physical infrastructure revolution, while
starting to solve long-unaddressed safety challenges,” said Senator Edward
J. Markey (D-Mass.). “With this funding, we can finally address all too
preventable tragedies on our nation’s roads, expand transportation alternatives
like biking and walking, reduce traffic congestion for Massachusetts commuters,
and begin the process of making our streets cleaner and greener. I am
proud of my colleagues and I for securing this investment in the Commonwealth,
and I look forward to the opportunities that will be available as we continue
to receive additional funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
in the years ahead.”  “I’m delighted that
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is investing over $800 million into our
roads, bridges, and public transportation in Massachusetts. With this
much-needed investment, we’ll repair our crumbling roads and bridges, fight
climate change, and improve safety – all while creating good-paying union
jobs,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). “In MA-5
and across our state, we are no strangers to traffic and potholes. The
funding from the infrastructure law will reverse decades of
neglect and underinvestment and modernize our roads and bridges, decrease
commute times, reduce emissions, create jobs and lower costs for
families. And, by improving our roadways, we are helping to alleviate the
on-going supply chain challenges,” said Assistant Speaker Katherine Clark
(MA-05). This is a critical piece of the Build Back Better agenda, and
Massachusetts will continue to see the impact of President’s vision for a
stronger, more sustainable future.” “The gradual decline in our federal infrastructure
investment has resulted in an alarming number of crumbling roads,” said
Congressman Richard E. Neal, Chair of the House Committee on Ways and Means
(MA-01). “Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we have the
opportunity to make quality upgrades to our federal highway system. Drivers
will benefit from the improvements and skilled workers will be back on the job
to make it a reality.”  “I am
proud to have worked alongside Chairman Richie Neal and my Massachusetts
Congressional colleagues to secure this critical transportation funding for the
Commonwealth,” said Congressman Stephen Lynch (MA-08).  “These
funds are essential to creating a greener transportation system, expanding
rail, improving passenger safety and strengthening the climate-change
resiliency of our infrastructure.  I am also pleased to see these projects
will help reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality, an important benefit
for our communities that struggle with high rates of asthma and respiratory
disease. I look forward to seeing the transformation of our transportation system
and the positive impact it will have on all Massachusetts residents.” “This welcome investment is long-overdue and will help
improve connectivity, make our roads and highways safer, create jobs, and
promote environmentally friendly alternatives to driving such as biking,” said
Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07). “I look forward to seeing this
funding swiftly disbursed and continuing our work to deliver President Biden’s
full Build Back Better agenda.” ""If you have traveled through the South Shore or South
Coast to get to Cape Cod during the summer, you know firsthand how vital
congestion mitigation is,"" said Congressman Bill Keating (MA-09).
""This first wave of funding from President Biden’s Infrastructure Plan
aims to address this issue head-on, and I am glad to see funds arriving so
quickly to Massachusetts as we tackle the infrastructure challenges that lay
ahead, including the replacement of the Bourne and Sagamore bridges.""  “For decades, roads littered with potholes and in need of
repair have made it difficult for Bay Staters to get around,” said
Congresswoman Lori Trahan (MA-03). “The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
changes that. By delivering billions in federal funding to make much-needed
upgrades, this critical investment will create jobs, cut down our commute
times, and modernize our infrastructure — benefiting every single person here
in the Third District and across the Commonwealth.” “This substantial investment into our roadways will make
driving safer; expand access to jobs and services; and help our climate through
carbon reduction initiatives,” said Congressman Jake Auchincloss (MA-04). “Anyone who drives down a road or bridge here in
Massachusetts will tell you that they are often jam packed and in pretty
abysmal condition. These conditions cost drivers more than $600 every single
year, which is why we must fix our existing roads first, not expand them
endlessly,” said Congressman Seth Moulton (MA-06). “How we invest the
money from this bill will determine whether we combat climate change or
contribute to it. Investments in roads must reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
impacts to air quality from those who remain on the road and be paired with
expansion of transit and rail which provide greater environmental gains.” “Thanks to the steadfast leadership of President Biden, we
are finally—at long last—rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure,” said
House Rules Committee Chairman James P. McGovern (MA-02). “Massachusetts
residents are going to feel the major improvements these funds will make in the
form of faster and safer commutes, less traffic, cleaner air, and less
pollution. I’m proud of our delegation for playing a key role in the passage of
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and for securing these vital funds so we can
invest in our future and build a better commonwealth for all.”
