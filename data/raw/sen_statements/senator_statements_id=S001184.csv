https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-manchin-lead-bipartisan-effort-to-designate-september-2022-as-national-childhood-cancer-awareness-month,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) led a bipartisan resolution to designate September 2022 as National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. This resolution recognizes the impact of cancer on the lives of children, urges stakeholders at every level of government to increase public awareness about the risks of cancer and reminds Americans of the bravery of children who are diagnosed with and recover from cancer.“I am proud to co-lead a resolution designating September as National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month,"" said Senator Scott. ""Childhood should be filled with vibrant memories of family gatherings, sports, school, and holiday parties. Children who battle cancer have these memories overshadowed. That’s why my Senate colleagues and I will continue to support these little heroes and their families who endure cancer battles every day.""“Far too many children in West Virginia and across the country are bravely fighting a cancer diagnosis or have lost loved ones to this devastating disease, and childhood cancer is especially heartbreaking,” said Senator Manchin. “I am proud to lead this bipartisan effort to ensure September is dedicated to raising awareness for the terrible battle that many of our children face every day. Gayle and I will continue to keep all cancer patients and their families across West Virginia and the country in our prayers.”""Each year in the U.S. an estimated 16,000 children are diagnosed with cancer, and unfortunately, cancer remains the most common cause of death by disease for children in America. The Alliance for Childhood Cancer thanks Senator Manchin for introducing a resolution to designate September, 2022 as Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. This resolution will raise awareness and encourage research into cures for pediatric cancers,"" the Alliance for Childhood Cancer said in a statement. Senators Scott and Manchin were joined by Senators Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.).The full text of the resolution is available here.###"

Scott. “Their futures — and the future of our nation — depend on us taking action. That’s why I founded the School Choice Caucus, to put the focus back on children and their unique education needs.

The situation is particularly dire for millions faced with 40-year high inflation and in need of their tax refund to support their families. . . . The IRS should use its additional funding to prioritize clearing the backlog of returns and correspondence, and expediently pay taxpayers who are owed a refund.” On Guarding Taxpayers Against Partisan Targeting:“Americans should be able to trust that the government will enforce the law without regard to political beliefs, religion, or party affiliation. Compared to other government agencies, the IRS has a broad and powerful reach into Americans’ daily lives. The American people have a right to expect the IRS will exercise its power in a fair, neutral, and impartial manner. There should be no hint of religious or political bias or partisanship; the IRS must take this responsibility seriously.”On Protecting Taxpayer’s Privacy:“The IRS must hold taxpayer information securely in order to preserve its confidentiality. The law protecting taxpayer information rests on sound principles that evolved from adverse experiences with the misuse of tax information. …“Regarding the ProPublica leak, the American people remain in the dark about who was responsible and how it was allowed to happen. Although we understand TIGTA is investigating the leak to ProPublica, the IRS is not a bystander in this ‘very damaging’ event.” On Modernizing Technology:“Modernizing the IRS’s technology infrastructure must be a top priority. With an additional $4.75 billion of the supersized IRS funding allocated to technological improvements, and with the IRS’s Integrated Modernization Business Plan providing loose sketches of what the IRS wants to do and how it plans on doing it, there is room for realizing productivity gains and accompanying improved taxpayer service.… “Refinement and clear articulation of metrics and milestones that independent overseers can objectively use for monitoring any IRS IT and/or business plan modernization are required.”On Transparency and Accountability:“The IRS needs to report to Congress and the American people clear, reliable metrics for monitoring productivity improvements and related customer service improvements facilitated by its supersized budget.  … “With an infusion of $80 billion of new funding, the IRS must be accountable, and accountability requires transparency and timely communication with its authorizing Committees.”Read the full letter here.###"

And a quality education requires input from those who know children best: their parents,” said Sen. Scott. “Sadly, radical and secretive gender policies have shut parents out of the conversation and broken their trust. My bill will safeguard parental rights, improve the crucial relationship between parents and schools, and ensure that children can learn in an environment free from activist ideology.” The PROTECT Kids Act would restrict federal funding for any elementary or middle school that allows students to change their pronouns, gender markers, or sex-based accommodations (including locker rooms and bathrooms) without the consent of their parents. The bill is supported by Parents Defending Education Action and Independent Women’s Voice.Read more about the bill from the Washington Examiner.Read full text of the bill here.###"

Neither Treasury Secretary Yellen nor the Board of Trustees have signaled any intent to modify internal procedure regulating management of the report schedule, nor have they adopted previous GAO recommendations to improve communication with Congress. It is the responsibility of the treasury secretary to provide these reports to Congress in a timely manner, as required by law, or provide Congress and the American people with explanations for late work.From the letter: “With respect to reporting on the financial conditions of trust funds, once again this year the reports were issued well beyond the statutory deadline, and there was no process followed by the Managing Trustee for informing the public or members of Congress about the delay or reasons for the delay. …“Late reporting on financial conditions of important trust funds that support multi-trillion-dollar Social Security and Medicare programs does not seem important to the administration, even in light of the striking decision by the President to politicize the Social Security Administration.”Read the full letter here. ###"

The truth is: The majority of taxes gained from IRS audits come from individuals making less than $200,000 a year,” said Sen. Scott. “The American people are tired of this administration’s vague, misleading messages. This bill would hold President Biden to his word and ensure hard-working Americans are not forced to pay for yet another broken promise.”“Democrats cannot achieve their desired tax revenue goals without targeting the middle class, small businesses and taxpayers earning under $400,000 per year--taxpayers who cannot afford teams of lawyers and legal fees--which is why they rejected my original amendment,” said Sen. Crapo. “While advocates promise they do not intend to increase audits on people making less than $400,000, the best way to protect those taxpayers is to turn that promise into law.”The legislation would prevent the IRS from using any of the $80 billion of funding for audits on hard-working American taxpayers — including individuals and small businesses — with taxable incomes below $400,000.For bill text, click here.###"

Now they are outdoing themselves with rules that will undermine charter schools — tuition-free, top-notch public education options that serve primarily disadvantaged students,” said Senator Scott. “Support for these schools has never been a partisan issue. It’s time the administration put politics aside and joined parents in the fight for quality education.”Co-signing the resolution are Senators Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), and John Cornyn (R-Texas), James Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.).Background:Earlier this year, the Department of Education announced new rules overhauling the 28-year-old, bipartisan Charter School Program (CSP). The changes would place federal, one-size-fits-all requirements on charter schools, making it difficult — if not impossible — for many of these high-quality public schools to receive funding.Despite substantial bipartisan backlash, the administration is moving ahead with its plans, which will strip families of education choice and give more power to big labor unions and bureaucrats in D.C.For months, Sen.

With Iran continuing to pursue a nuclear weapon and carrying out malign activity in the Middle East, our sanctions regime is our best tool to restrain Iran’s ability to fund operations that endanger Israel, Arab partners, and even U.S. military personal.“The United States, Israel, and our Arab partners remain concerned about the looming threat that a nuclear Iran poses to the stability of the region,” said Senator Scott. “U.S. sanctions are a necessary deterrent for this dangerous and unstable regime, which is why my bill will make the cornerstone of sanctions on Iran permanent.”""Iran has repeatedly undertaken destabilizing activities in the Middle East. This bipartisan legislation will ensure that we continue U.S. sanctions on Iran, which are important for restraining Iran's ability to pursue weapons and technology that threaten our national security and the safety of Israel, our strongest partner in the region,” said Senator Hassan.“I’m pleased to be an original co-sponsor of the Solidify Iran Sanctions Act of 2022, a bill that will make permanent the Iran Sanctions Act, a cornerstone law in America’s broader sanctions program against Iran’s terror-sponsoring regime,” said Senator Hagerty. “As Iran increases its nuclear and ballistic missile threats and its support for terrorism and militancy in the Middle East, the United States should not ease sanctions and make it easier for the regime to continue its malign behavior.”“The Iran Sanctions Act helped bring Iran to the negotiating table. For decades, Congress has extended this critical legislation on a bipartisan basis,” said Senator Rosen. “With Iran closer than ever to a nuclear weapon, I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing bipartisan legislation that ensures we maintain the full range of our economic and diplomatic tools to prevent Iran from ever acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.”The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and FDD Action have expressed support for this legislation.Background:In 1996, Congress passed the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA), which allowed the president to impose secondary sanctions on Iran’s energy sector. Throughout the years, ISA provisions were expanded to include other Iranian industries. ISA consists of “triggers” that place sanctions on firms or entities that violate U.S. sanctions under this law. With looming uncertainty about Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon, it is essential that the United States solidifies its pivotal sanctions to apply pressure towards a rogue regime.Click here to read the bill.###"

But rather than solving the problem, this latest bailout exposed a fundamental reality: Government alone cannot solve the education crisis facing our nation’s children.My new bill—the Raising Expectations with Child Opportunity Vouchers for Educational Recovery Act, or Recover Act for short—empowers parents to fix this crisis.The Wall Street Journal reported that as of May, states and school districts had spent only 7% of the $122 billion set aside for education under the American Rescue Plan more than a year ago. The Los Angeles Unified School District was allocated over $2.5 billion and hasn’t spent a penny.While states and school districts sit on billions, students are struggling.[…] Parents, fearful of the long-term consequences of lost learning, are desperate to help because they know the clock is ticking. The fourth-grader who is still unable to read can’t wait. The junior in high school who won’t be ready for college courses can’t wait. The student with disabilities who hasn’t received consistent services in two years can’t wait.The Recover Act would allow states and school districts to use their unspent dollars from the American Rescue Plan to issue Child Opportunity Scholarships directly to parents. The scholarships, targeted for low-income students, could be used for tutoring, school tuition, curriculum materials, educational therapies for children with disabilities, and other resources designed to get students the individualized help they need.[…] If given access to this funding, parents won’t let 93% of it sit in a bank account while their children fall behind. They’ll fight harder and better than the government ever could to get their kids on the right path. I know because I’ve seen it happen in my own life. When I struggled in school, my mom, who already worked long days as a nurse’s aide to keep food on the table, stayed up late doing homework with me, encouraged me, and at times disciplined me to get my grades back on track. An opportunity scholarship, like the kind I’m proposing in this bill, would have been a game-changer for my family. My mom didn’t have a government position or a college degree. But she knew what her kid needed, and she wasn’t about to let him fail.My story isn’t unique. Each day, millions of parents across the country are fighting for their kids’ success. It’s what they do best.[…] Though the government alone can’t solve this crisis, our nation fortunately has a much more powerful tool to help kids: their parents. Congress must pass the Recover Act to give parents the resources they need to help their children thrive once again. Click here to read the full op-ed.###"

These organizations should not be discriminated against because of their faith or held back by bureaucratic red tape. This bill would ensure that faith-based organizations do not have to compromise their beliefs to provide critical social services to those in need,” said Senator Rubio. Senators Scott and Rubio are joined by Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) as cosponsors of the bill.  The bill is also supported by several organizations including CatholicVote, Family Research Council, First Liberty Institute, Faith & Freedom Coalition, and Heritage Action. ""Catholic Charities is fighting in the courts, legislatures and public arena to preserve their adoption services against new legal pressures to close their doors because they abide by Catholic doctrine. Marco Rubio's legislation would protect those agencies, as well as similar relief agencies, from being shut down by an overwoke government. The welfare of children should always trump the audacity of political correctness."" – Brian Burch, President of CatholicVote  “Faith-based social service providers provide valuable services to the most vulnerable in our communities, from battered women to neglected children. This bill will ensure they can continue to serve freely, without fear of being penalized for their religious beliefs. We applaud Senator Rubio’s excellent efforts to protect these service providers’ religious freedom.” – Kassie Dulin, Director of Government Affairs for First Liberty Institute  “From before the founding of our country until today, religious and faith-based groups have been indispensable in meeting the needs of Americans. Faith-based organizations are vital to strengthening families, combatting poverty, and revitalizing our communities. Sen. Rubio’s LIFTING Local Communities Act will ensure that faith-based organizations are treated equally by the federal government and recognize that they don’t forfeit their religious beliefs and rights when they use federal funds to help serve the public good.” – Timothy Head, Executive Director, Faith & Freedom Coalition  “The Left will stop at nothing to undermine the religious liberty of Americans, even if that means discriminating against religious organizations who provide valuable social services to society’s most vulnerable.  Currently, the Biden administration is currently considering rolling back regulations that ensure that faith-based organizations can apply for and administer federally funded social services on the same basis as secular organizations.  Fortunately, Senator Rubio has introduced the LIFTING Local Communities Act to prevent the administration from changing these regulations by codifying them into law, which will guarantee that religious charities are able to continue serving their communities.” – Jessica Anderson, Executive Director of Heritage Action  Full text of the legislation can be found here.A summary of the legislation can be found here.  ###"

https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-address-violent-crime-,"WASHINGTON – This week, Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) joined Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and 22 Republican colleagues in introducing a comprehensive package aimed at strengthening the violent crime laws related to homicide, bank robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, and other offenses. The Combating Violent and Dangerous Crime Act resolves discrepancies brought on by conflicting court decisions and clarifies congressional intent regarding crimes of violence and respective penalties. “As neighborhoods across America are experiencing a spike in violent crime, it is vital that we update our laws to hold perpetrators accountable and keep the public safe,” said Sen. Scott. “This bill addresses real world problems by helping to deter violent crimes before they take place.” Many communities across the country continue to experience steadily increasing violent crime. Murder rates increased 30 percent in 2020 and continued climbing in 2021. Carjackings, particularly in urban areas are on the rise, with some cities recording up to 400 percent spikes. Overdose deaths surpassed 100,000 last year, with fentanyl appearing in a variety of substances, including candy-flavored drugs that are marketed to children. 2021 marked the deadliest year for law enforcement since the September 11 attacks in 2001. The Combating Violent and Dangerous Crime Act addresses ambiguity and conflicting application of existing law by clarifying congressional intent without establishing sweeping new offense categories. Among other provisions, the bill: “NDAA is excited to endorse the Combating Violence and Dangerous Crime Act, an important effort to fix criminal provisions in Title 18 of the Federal Code which ensures prosecutors have the tools needed to hold bad actors accountable. We look forward to working alongside the Senate Judiciary Committee to adopt these commonsense measures to improve public safety,” said Nelson Bunn, Executive Director, National District Attorneys Association. “This legislation brings clarity to many areas in the law currently impacted by circuit splits. This clarity will enhance the rule of law by creating consistency in criminal enforcement. As violent crime continues to rise in major cities, this legislation will also increase successful prosecutions and deter offenses like bank robbery, carjackings, and kidnappings. This bill also addresses our nation’s ongoing drug overdose epidemic and seeks to protect our nation’s most vulnerable citizens: children. NAAUSA fully supports this legislation and appreciates Senator Grassley for leading on these issues,” said Steve Wasserman, National President of the National Association of Assistant U.S. Attorneys (NAAUSA).“At this moment in history, when violent crime is exploding, the Sheriffs stand with Senator Grassley in supporting his Combating Violent and Dangerous Crime Act.  It is critical that our federal partners have the tools they need to prosecute and incarcerate the most dangerous criminals in America,” said Sheriff Jim Skinner, Chairman, Government Affairs Committee, National Sheriffs Association.“The Major County Sheriffs of America is pleased to support this bill which would clarify and strengthen federal law related to certain violent crimes including carjacking, help safeguard children from dangerous drugs, and protect federal law enforcement officers. We applaud Senator Grassley for this effort to ensure federal law provides tools to deter and punish violent crime,” said the Major County Sheriffs of America. “The Major Cities Chiefs Association member agencies continue to respond to increased violent crime in their jurisdictions. The Combatting Violent and Dangerous Crime Act will provide law enforcement with additional tools to hold these violent offenders accountable by addressing circuit court splits, closing loopholes in the law, and updating outdated statutes. The MCCA thanks Sen. Grassley for introducing this legislation and his continued support for law enforcement,” said the Major Cities Chiefs Association. Senators Scott and Grassley are joined by Senators Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), John Kennedy (R-La.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), James Risch (R-Idaho), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.).

https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-cruz-and-lummis-introduce-resolution-affirming-historic-definition-of-a-recession,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) this week introduced a resolution to affirm the historic definition of an economic recession. Historically, an economic recession has been defined as two consecutive negative quarters of GDP growth.“In the midst of a 40-year high in inflation, the Biden administration is now attempting to redefine the term ‘recession.’ But twisting words does not change the reality: Americans are hurting because of Democrats’ harmful economic policies,” said Senator Scott. “This administration can continue to push reckless spending proposals and insist the economy is moving in a positive direction, but Americans simply aren’t taking the bait. I’m proud to join Senators Cruz and Lummis on this resolution that puts words to the struggle families are facing across this nation.”“The Biden White House is undertaking an Orwellian effort that ignores history in order to try to redefine the actual definition of the term ‘recession’ in order to avoid bad headlines,” said Senator Cruz. “No amount of double-speak can change the fact that President Biden’s failed economic policies are fueling inflation, or have driven our country to the brink of a recession. The American people know this, which is why consumer sentiment has plummeted. Definitions matter, and the Biden White House simply cannot rewrite the facts in order to hide from the truth.”“The definition of a recession is crystal clear, but President Biden is trying to rewrite history and change the definition of a recession to try to make it seem like the economy hasn’t taken a total nosedive since his presidency began,” said Senator Lummis. “I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing this resolution to send a message, loud and clear, to President Biden, that he cannot change economic rules to defend the fact that there has been too much spending the last two years.”Read full text of the resolution here.###"

Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash).  In their letter, the members call for greater accountability from the Biden administration, following its continued attempt to disregard Congressional oversight requests on how COVID-19 emergency funding has been spent.“Since the beginning of the pandemic, Congress has passed five bipartisan COVID-19 relief bills totaling $3.496 trillion,” write the members. “Recently, it has been reported that the Biden administration and Congressional Democrats are pursuing yet another partisan spending bill, despite record levels of inflation and billions of unspent dollars in COVID-19 relief funds.  To date, the Biden administration’s accounting of how it spent trillions of dollars in past COVID-19 relief funding has been inadequate.”The members continue, “As part of Congress’s effort to understand exactly how the Biden administration spent COVID-19 relief money, we request an audit of a $10 billion COVID-19 vaccine public education campaign launched by the Biden administration and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).”The members also raise concerns over the involvement of highly partisan organizations in the public education campaign, potentially inappropriate direct or indirect funding to these politically-affiliated groups, and possible access these organizations may have to personally identifiable information of Americans. “It is incredible that HHS and the Biden administration would partner with partisan political organizations and Democrat-affiliated campaign consultants on a $10 billion taxpayer funded vaccine confidence public education campaign, ostensibly intended to appeal to all Americans. It is not clear from publicly available information exactly what these groups do and what benefits they may derive from being a ‘founding member’ of the COVID-19 Community Corps,” the members write.“First, we are concerned that some of these ‘founding members’ may inappropriately receive direct or indirect funding and support from HHS for partisan activities,” the members continue. “Second, HHS’s agencies contain or have access to vast amounts of personally identifiable information on hundreds of millions of Americans.”“We request that you initiate an audit and investigation of the HHS COVID-19 Communicators program and related public relations campaigns with a specific focus on the whether ‘founding members’ received government funding or access to Americans’ personal information.”To read the full letter, click here.###"

The Senators also requested that the SEC preserve and turn over a number of records related to the proposed rule by June 29th.On July 12th—nearly two weeks past the deadline—Chairman Gensler responded to the senators’ letter with a perfunctory one-page response that included none of the answers or records requested.“Your response is wholly inadequate and unacceptable,” the senators wrote. “In our letter, we asked only a few simple and straightforward questions, including questions that should result in simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answers such as:‘Has the SEC considered the impact that the proposed climate disclosure rule would have on energy prices and any other costs associated with the rule?’; and‘Has the SEC coordinated with any other Federal agencies on the policies contained in the proposed climate disclosure rule?’”As the senators point out, Chairman Gensler’s response completely ignored the request for records and did not indicate that the SEC is taking steps to preserve all records related to the proposed climate rule.“A member of the public who submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request would be entitled to receive more records from the SEC than what the SEC has given members of the Senate committee overseeing the commission,” the senators wrote.Banking Republicans also pointed out the impact that the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, West Virginia v. EPA, could have on the SEC’s proposed climate rule.“Subsequent to our letter to you, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a major decision that reinforces the importance of congressional oversight of the SEC’s climate disclosure rule,” the senators wrote. “In West Virginia v. EPA, the Supreme Court ruled that the executive branch and its agencies, including financial regulators, cannot use creative, new interpretations of existing law to pretend they have legal authority to support sweeping policy changes that Congress never intended. Unfortunately, the SEC appears to be trying to act in precisely this way with its climate disclosure rule.”To read Banking Republicans’ full letter to Chairman Gensler, click here.###"
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-tillis-and-other-senate-banking-republicans-raise-concerns-with-race-based-housing-subsidies,"WASHINGTON– This week, U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) joined Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and other Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee in a joint a letter to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director Sandra Thompson raising significant concerns with the Equitable Housing Finance Plans that contemplate race-based housing subsidies.The Equitable Housing Finance Plans announced on June 8, 2022 were developed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the GSEs) at the direction of the FHFA. The GSEs’ recently-released proposals would use Special Purpose Credit Programs to award race-based subsidies in the form of down payment assistance, lower rates, and reimbursements for appraisals.“The administration’s proposal seems intent on repeating the mistakes of the recent past. It is worth recalling the GSEs’ central role in the 2008 financial crisis,” wrote the senators. “Against this backdrop, we urge FHFA to reconsider these affirmative action housing subsidy plans for the following reasons: First, the plans are manifestly unfair and should be unconstitutional. Discrimination on the basis of skin color is simply wrong. That remains true even when intended to benefit minorities.“Second, the plans risk setting up another generation of minority borrowers for failure. Black and other minority homeowners lost significant wealth as a direct result of lax underwriting by the GSEs before the crisis,” the senators continued. “Third, the plans raise significant legal concerns. By statute, FHFA’s mandate as conservator is to conserve and preserve each GSE’s assets and restore it to a sound and solvent condition. No law authorizes FHFA to use a GSE’s assets to pursue affirmative action in housing.”“Fourth, the plans are a return to GSE mission creep. The GSEs’ charters limit them to supporting the secondary market. These plans, however, contemplate that the GSEs would push into the title insurance market (through bulk purchases and attorney opinion letters), the appraisal market (through new valuation options), and even the lending market (through GSE-funded down payment assistance and GSE-provided homebuyer education). Finally, the plans needlessly politicize the GSEs. The administration is conscripting the GSEs as instrumentalities of its progressive racial equity agenda to achieve outcomes it cannot achieve legislatively or even legally,” the senators concluded.The letter was also signed by Ranking Member Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and U.S. Senators Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) and Steve Daines (R-Mont.). Read the full letter here.  ###"

Scott previously sponsored the Expanding Access to Credit for Small Business Act, which included a provision to allow more fintech companies to participate in the 7(a) program.“Affordable access to capital is crucial for entrepreneurs and small businesses to succeed in starting, and growing their businesses. However, many entrepreneurs and small firms, especially women, minorities, and those living in rural areas, struggle to access the traditional banking system,” wrote Scott, Hickenlooper, Crow, and Donalds.“Modernizing the 7(a) program will allow fintech companies to continue to remove obstacles to access to credit for many small businesses who face difficulty participating in SBA lending programs. Lifting the moratorium on new SBLC licenses will allow additional innovative lenders to securely provide affordable credit to small businesses, especially those that have traditionally been underserved,” they continued.Full text of the letter is available HERE and below.Dear Administrator Guzman:Affordable access to capital is crucial for entrepreneurs and small businesses to succeed in starting, and growing their businesses. However, many entrepreneurs and small firms, especially women, minorities, and those living in rural areas, struggle to access the traditional banking system. We write today to request that the Small Business Administration (SBA) lift its moratorium on allowing additional non-banks to serve as Small Business Lending Companies (SBLC) and allow qualifying non-banks to provide access to the SBA’s 7(a) small business loan program as guaranteed lenders.The digital tools financial technology firms (Fintechs) and other non-bank lenders provide allow small businesses to reach more customers, process payments more efficiently, and better use data. Fintechs also filled gaps in providing pandemic-era relief programs since traditional banks initially only served existing customers.As a result, Congress authorized non-bank lenders to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). A New York Federal Reserve study from late May 2021 found that, while disbursing only a small share of total loan amounts, fintechs provided important support to minority business owners, who have in the past been underserved by the traditional banking industry. Approximately 1 in 4 black-owned companies applied to fintech lenders, more than twice the rate of firms whose owners were White, Asian, or Hispanic.Modernizing the 7(a) program will allow fintech companies to continue to remove obstacles to access to credit for many small businesses who face difficulty participating in SBA lending programs. Lifting the moratorium on new SBLC licenses will allow additional innovative lenders to securely provide affordable credit to small businesses, especially those that have traditionally been underserved.Forty years ago the SBA capped the number of new non-bank SBLC licenses at 14. Given the difficulty that so many small businesses are experiencing accessing affordable credit, it is imperative that the SBA lift its outdated moratorium and expand the number of licensed SBLCs. To that end, we have introduced legislation, the Expanding Access to Affordable Credit for Small Businesses Act, which calls for:While we hope that Congress will enact our legislation as soon as possible, the SBA does not require any statutory changes to lift its non-bank SBLC moratorium or to allow fintechs to expand their provision of vital resources that many small businesses rely on.The SBA has done an admirable job expanding access to capital over the last 68 years. We ask that it further this fundamental mission by removing the moratorium on new SBLC licenses and allowing a more diverse group of lenders into its flagship small business lending program – 7(a). Thank you for your attention to this request. We eagerly await your response. ### "

Now it's over $4 a gallon. And [President Biden] refuses to let our folks here at home domestically drill for the energy we need. That, to me, makes his entire trip, especially his meeting with MBS, a failure.”On why the White House doesn’t support American energy … “What I can tell you is — as a spokesperson for South Carolinians — we would love to see more domestically-created jobs around our energy future. We would love to see the Keystone XL pipeline starting and six or 700,000 barrels of oil coming to this country every single day.”On Democrats’ revived tax and spending spree, or ‘Build Back Better’ … “I prefer to call it ‘Build Back Broker,’ because the truth of the matter is they must not understand what causes inflation. When you think about adding more fuel to the fire or more money to the economy, you're literally talking about increasing inflation. When you increase taxes on our corporations, on our small businesses, you're reducing profit and you're reducing the number of jobs that are available. … We are far better off with the BBB being DOA: dead on arrival.”On President Biden’s disconnect from the American people … “Sometimes the White House seems to suggest, ‘Please believe what we are saying, not what you're seeing with your own eyes.’“They said ‘Afghanistan? It was a great withdrawal.’ What we saw was the death of 13 American soldiers and thousands of Americans stranded in Afghanistan. They tell us that the border is closed, but what we see is almost two and a half million illegal immigrants crossing our border in 12 months. … They tell us, by the way, that inflation is good for the poor, for working class people, because their wages are going up. But the truth is that, even though the wages have gone up, inflation outpaces wage increases, which means that you've had a loss of spending power.“So these are three very clear examples of why the American people are shaking their heads mystified by what this president does not understand about what they're experiencing.”###"

The last thing [the Left wants] to see are people like Clarence Thomas, Ben Carson, and myself standing up and making common sense popular everywhere in the nation. And oh, by the way, we happen to be Black. That is a great threat to the entire coalition on the Left. So they want to shut it down, cancel Clarence Thomas because he dares to think for himself.”On Justice Thomas’ character … “You think about what Justice Sotomayor said about Justice Thomas. She said he was kind, affable, first to celebrate the victories in your life — whether it’s your child’s birthday — he is such a warm-hearted person. Those were her comments, but the Clarence Thomas I have met is consistent with what she said. This is a person who rose from abject poverty in rural Georgia to live the American Dream because in America, all things are possible.

https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/following-sens-scott-ossoff-successful-push-fema-distributes-350-million-in-disaster-relief-to-heirs-property-owners,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.)'s successful push to reform FEMA policies that discriminated against Black homeowners has helped tens of thousands of people get the help they need after natural disasters.Last fall, Senators Scott and Ossoff successfully lobbied FEMA to alter its disaster relief policies that discriminated against heirs property owners by requiring disaster victims to present clear title to property after The Washington Post reported that “more than a third of Black-owned land in the South is passed down informally, rather than through deeds and wills.”In a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Hearing last week, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell testified that after FEMA’s policy change last year, 42,000 homeowners and 53,000 renters nationwide — who would have previously been denied — received disaster assistance, totaling $350 million.“For years I have worked to protect heirs property owners across South Carolina and the country,"" said Senator Scott. ""The disaster relief going to these families, many of which are Black southerners, wouldn’t have happened if not for the FEMA policy change resulting from our commonsense, bipartisan effort.""“For decades, many Black property owners in the South have been unfairly denied disaster assistance due to FEMA policies,” said Senator Ossoff. “Our bipartisan effort has ended those discriminatory practices and delivered hundreds of millions of dollars in disaster relief to Black property owners who would have previously denied help.”“We implemented these changes in our own policies in August of last year and since then, we were able to help over 42,000 homeowners and 53,000 renters and receive assistance we would have denied assistance under our old system. That amounts to somewhere close to $350 million that we would have made them come back to us through an appeal process before,” FEMA Administrator Criswell said in the hearing.###"
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/sen-tim-scott-statement-on-democrats-radical-anti-life-legislation,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) released a statement following the Democrats' failed vote to advance radical abortion legislation.   “In the midst of the Democrats’ show vote on abortion, we still do not have answers about the unprecedented leak of the Supreme Court’s draft decision on the Dobbs case,” said Senator Tim Scott.  “The American people must be able to have faith and confidence in our judicial system. The attempts we are seeing from the Left to compromise the credibility of our nation’s highest court are, simply put, alarming.  “Today, Democrats once again brought radical pro-abortion legislation to the Senate floor. Their actions only further demonstrate how out of touch they are with the American people. I strongly oppose this bill and will continue to fervently fight for the most fundamental American right: the right to life.”### "
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-confronts-sec-yellen-for-troubling-comments-at-banking-hearing,"WASHINGTON – In today’s Senate Banking Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) confronted Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen about troubling comments she made during the hearing as well as the administration’s approach to combating inflation. Sen. Scott also provided closing remarks, in which he underscored how pro-growth policies enacted under Republican leadership fostered economic opportunity and created a more inclusive economy.Click to watchOn Sec. Yellen’s troubling comments … “Secretary Yellen, thank you for being here this morning. Some of your comments in response to [Sen. Menendez] question I found troubling. And just from clarity's sake, did you say that ending the life of a child is good for the labor force participation rate? … Let me just quote what you said, that ultimately ‘increasing access to abortion and reproductive health care allows for our labor force participation rate to continue to increase,’ that ‘denying women access to abortion increases their odds of living in poverty or a need for public assistance.’“I'll just simply say that as a guy raised by a Black woman in abject poverty, I'm thankful to be here as United States senator, first. Second thing I'd say is that we can, at the same time, have a real conversation about increasing child tax credits that are refundable. We can, at the same time, have a conversation about the opportunity to have a more robust system around the issue of child care, of early childhood education. We could have a conversation about financial literacy. There's a lot of ways for us to address the issue about the child that is here. So that, just to me, was unusually piercing comments that you made.”On the administration’s approach to combating inflation … “In [the] face of persistent inflation … slowing growth caused by a backlog pipeline driven by too much demand with too little supply, [and] a lagging labor force participation rate, people aren't coming back to work, so we have millions of jobs that are open. The atrophying of the muscle for work seems to be endemic in this current Biden administration's approach, coupled with government debt that is now well over $30 trillion and growing very fast.”Sen. Scott also provided closing remarks at the hearing.Click to watchRemarks as delivered:“I know that Senator Cortez Masto said why should I impose my circumstances on others? Well, I think because my circumstances [are] like so many others, millions and millions of kids being raised in poverty by single parent households who happen to be Black. Telling Black teenage moms that there's only one alternative for them is a depressing and challenging message.“So sitting through and listening to so many folks stereotype the necessity of making a life altering decision as if it's the option to me is not right. … Even during tough financial times in households like the one I was raised [in], there is still hope. …“I think about the reasons why we should be hopeful and send a message of optimism and opportunity to single moms around this country challenged with too much month at the end of the money.“It's the policies where Senator Cortez Masto talked about the tax reform. Well, the tax reform of 2017 cut a single moms taxes by 70 percent on the federal level, led to 4,000 more dollars in the average pocket of the average household in this nation. We created 7 million jobs [with] two thirds of those jobs going to African-Americans, Hispanics, and women. … And so what I'm suggesting is that, yes, people on the left and people on the right can work together to bring about positive policy changes that can transform the lives of those living in poverty. …“When we're going to have a conversation about improving the outcome of this nation's poorest Americans, I think we should have that conversation. I am frankly willing to have the debate with anyone, anywhere, at any time on my lived experience versus anyone else's, because I believe that America is the solution, not the problem. …“I'm simply saying that the experience of so many of us, millions of us [who grew up] in poverty, I conclude is a reason to be hopeful about what's possible, even for those incredibly powerful, positive women making really hard choices.”###"

We must do everything within our power to protect and expand families’ options by continuing to support our nation’s charter schools.”“Every student deserves access to high-quality education to help set them up for future success,"" said Senator Bennet. “During National Charter Schools Week, we celebrate the educators and school leaders who work day in and day out to make that possible and shape the next generation of leaders.”Joining Senators Scott and Bennet on the resolution are senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).Read full text of the resolution here.###"

That means that the average person in our country is experiencing an invisible tax that is eroding their spending power. That means that our seniors who are on a fixed income have to find a way to ration either their health care or their medicine, their energy, or food. It means that people who are growing up in households like the one I grew up in [are] now having to make harder decisions than they’ve ever had to make. That’s wrong.”On inflation’s global effects … “This feels like the Carter era. When you think about the explosive price in gas, when you think about what it costs to heat or cool your home if you’re in South Carolina, it is drastic. But more importantly, when you look at the global effect, you remember the days when Venezuela was at a 900 percent inflationary effect because of the crushing decisions of their government. … The truth is that the whole globe responds to the type of economic decisions that we make here at home. That’s why our global leadership economically matters so much.“We should be forcing decisions here at home like: Why not restart our own energy economy, creating six-figure jobs here at home? Why not continue the conversation around the Keystone XL Pipeline? … Why not use Opportunity Zones to attract insourcing back into America?”On COVID restrictions hurting the economy … “COVID is endemic within our community at this point, not an epidemic as I see it. So what we need to do is continue to make the adjustments that we’re seeing around the country. The good news is at home in South Carolina, our unemployment rate is 3.4 percent statewide … So the good news is we’re proving that we can handle the COVID challenges in a right-to-work environment. I’d recommend that we export South Carolina values and the dignity of work throughout the rest of the country, especially places like New York and California.”###"
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-feinstein-lead-bipartisan-letter-to-protect-charter-schools,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) wrote a letter to President Biden’s secretary of education, Miguel Cardona, expressing their concerns about a proposed rule from the Department of Education that would jeopardize our nation’s charter schools and limit families’ education options.“During the 2020-2021 academic year, nearly 240,000 new students enrolled in charter schools, representing a seven percent growth as compared to the previous academic year,” wrote the senators.“This clearly demonstrates how critical the [Charter Schools Program] is, as it is the only federal program dedicated to supporting the creation of new public charter schools, replicating high-quality public charter schools, and disseminating information about effective practices within charter schools. … CSP was designed to provide critical resources to expand access to high-quality charter schools, but these proposed regulations could restrict access to new high-quality public charter schools. As such, we are concerned that the NPP does not prioritize the needs of students and limits high quality choices to certain families.”Background:The majority of federal funding for charter schools comes from the 28-year-old, bipartisan federal Charter Schools Program (CSP). Despite a 7 percent increase in charter school enrollment throughout the 2020-2021 academic year, the Department of Education recently proposed a rule that would impose burdensome new requirements on charter schools, making it difficult — if not impossible — for many schools to receive funding.Joining Senators Scott and Feinstein on the letter are Senators Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Richard Burr (R-N.C.), ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.Read the full letter here. ###"

""Our legislation would provide important temporary relief for these businesses who employ thousands of workers across the Palmetto State.”U.S. Senators Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) also co-sponsored the legislation.  “NADA commends Sens. Brown and Scott’s bipartisan leadership to help ease the challenges of global vehicle supply chain disruptions that continue to reduce vehicle production,” said Mike Stanton, President and CEO of the National Automobile Dealers Association. “The bill would provide needed short-term relief to help the auto industry recover from severe inventory shortfalls due to the pandemic and supply chain and semiconductor shortages. NADA strongly supports this legislation to reaffirm existing federal law related to a ‘major foreign trade interruption’ and urges Congress to pass it as soon as possible.”Background:   Auto dealerships often use the Last-In First-Out (LIFO) inventory method, which can result in a large tax bill for dealerships that don’t maintain a minimum level of inventory at the close of the year. The Supply Chain Disruptions Relief Act would provide a statutory determination that the requirements for a qualified liquidation under Section 473 have been satisfied for new motor vehicle dealers that have had a reduction of new vehicles held in LIFO inventory.Click here to read the bill. ###"

Both senators are members of the Senate Special Committee on Aging; the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship; and the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.“Retirement planning is often a daunting and complicated process for millions of people concerned about securing the future of their families,” said Senator Scott, ranking member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging. “This bill will lighten the burden on workers at small businesses that do not always benefit from the same features of retirement plans under larger companies. Leveling the playing field to maximize benefits for the financial futures of all Americans should be a goal we can all get behind.”“Small businesses make up more than 99 percent of our state’s businesses and employ over half a million Nevadans. This bipartisan legislation will ensure small business workers have access to high-quality retirement plan benefits without facing a cost barrier,” said Senator Rosen. “Removing this bureaucratic red tape and additional cost will make small businesses stronger and provide their workers with the best and most comprehensive retirement plans possible.”“Innovative plan design features such as automatic enrollment and financial wellness programs have been shown to have a huge impact on American workers’ financial health and retirement security,” said Brian Graff, CEO of the American Retirement Association. “The expanded flexibility to cover the expenses associated with these programs means that more employers - and most particularly small business owners - will now be able to bring those advantages to even more workers.”Currently, employers who offer 401(k) retirement plans and want to consider a “plan design change,” such as auto-enrollment or auto-escalation, must pay upfront out-of-pocket administrative costs, even if such changes might help employees save more money. This bill would change existing law to allow small business employers to use retirement plan funds to pay expenses associated with retirement plan design changes, lowering the cost of providing better plans to workers.Read full text of the bill here.###"

We should focus ourselves on states like South Carolina, where we have a high-tech manufacturing hub, where we're bringing and producing more things here at home and then selling them other places.”On Democrat policies shipping jobs overseas … “The truth is that we are simply seeing jobs exported from our country, not because the competition is better someplace else, but because of the environmental concerns being raised. And that means that the people who are most vulnerable in this nation—people living paycheck-to-paycheck—now have fewer options, higher prices, and a more bleak outlook. … And frankly, we should do better..”On his Employee Rights Act of 2022 … “The truth is that when you look at the Left’s approach to the future of our employment, they want everyone as a part of a union. This bill says right-to-work states like South Carolina and 26 others, they get to keep their laws. It's creating higher wages, more employment, and a higher quality of life. The Left, their approach is looking back to the past, while ours is looking to the future.”###"
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/remarks-sen-tim-scott-speech-on-the-future-of-the-gop-at-the-reagan-library,"WASHINGTON – Tonight, U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) delivered a speech on the future of the Republican Party at the Reagan Library. He discussed his personal story and the struggles that have put him on the path to conservatism and outlined his vision for education, the economy, and more.The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute hosted the senator as the latest speaker in their “Time for Choosing” series, which is aimed at elevating the leading voices of the conservative movement.Click to watch the senator's remarksRemarks as delivered:We are blessed to be in a place honoring Ronald Reagan.I think to myself, I love the truth of Ephesians 3:20—that “God is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all we ask or imagine.”In unbelievable and yet unexplainable ways, the truth of that scripture often plays out through the lives of seemingly ordinary men and women who respond to the inner call to lead.Defeat cannot stop them. Being misunderstood won’t slow them. Being reviled won’t deter them.There is a mission bigger than themselves that is growing within that requires immense grit to achieve what most think is impossible.Ronald Reagan exemplified that with his life of service. And I, as an American, am very thankful for his leadership.Leadership—more about that word later since witnessing the first 14 months of Biden's administration, I believe our country needs leadership now—like we did in 1980.I shudder to ask... if it were not for President Reagan’s leadership, would that six ton piece of the Berlin Wall that’s outside this building still be dividing East and West Germany?Would it have taken decades longer to come down?“A Time for Choosing.” There is no more fitting theme for this time in American history.As the progressive Left attempts to change the very DNA of our country and what it means to be an American, we need to answer a fundamental question Ronald Reagan posed to us in his “Time for Choosing” speech.He asked us this question: Do we believe in our capacity for self-government or do we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far distant capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them for ourselves?Our nation has had a very challenging and difficult two years. We are emerging from a pandemic that cost people their lives, cost others their health, and devastated our economy and further divided our country.In the aftermath, the world emerging is chaotic and full of peril, both at home and abroad.There are threats all around us, seeking to divide us, and in some cases, seeking to destroy what this nation stands for.Under the Biden administration, our weaknesses on the world stage emboldened enemies like Vladimir Putin to launch an evil genocide against Ukraine. Women and children are being victimized, even targeted.The Reagan doctrine of “Peace Through Strength” is needed now just like it was during the Cold War.At home, supply chains remain disrupted, the costs of basic necessities are skyrocketing, and our labor force participation rate is not keeping up.People flourish when they have a plan, a purpose, and a paycheck.It’s no coincidence that the frustration, the anger, the disillusionment we are experiencing is manifesting itself in rising crime, apathy, and suicide rates ... especially in our kids!Americans are losing one of the most inspirational truths we have, which is hope—hope that things can and will get better, hope that education and hard work can equal prosperity, hope that we remain a city on a hill, a shining example of what can be when free people decide to join hands in self-governance.This is not a partisan observation. This is reality, and it is the natural consequence of what failed leadership feels like to the average worker on an average wage in our country.America stands at a crossroads—with the potential for a great resetting, a renewal, even a rebirth—where we get to choose how we will meet the potential of today and the promise of tomorrow.Will we step forward with strength and perseverance? Will we redouble our conviction in the power of ideas or will we shirk back and allow a great nation to be consumed and degraded?Are we still one nation under God? Are we truly indivisible? Is there liberty and justice for all? Or will we allow our differences to further divide us, to further weaken our resolve?Will we, as our critics have warned, extinguish the light of liberty from within?These are difficult questions for us to consider. But when I take a look at the arc of justice and liberty within America’s history, I have every reason to hold on to hope.With each and every challenge, our nation’s track record is one of strength and unity.Whether it be the Civil War, the Great Depression, the fight against communism, or overcoming racial division—whatever is thrown our way, America has come through, time and time again, stronger and more united than ever before!The reason for that is because our nation was founded on truth, and truth never changes. And that’s what the conservative movement is all about.Conservatism doesn't flirt with what's easy and alluring. It doesn’t tell people what they want to hear but what they ought to hear because it is the truth.Our party is the party of Abraham Lincoln—one of strength, endurance, and resiliency. It’s the party of Ronald Reagan—one of hope, opportunity, and optimism.We have struggled at times to present this message of conservatism with clarity and contrast. We have struggled at times to be messengers for what we know is true and timeless.But if it is indeed the time for choosing—and it is—we have no choice but to lead the world with bravery, resolve, and strength. A strength that comes from the courage of our convictions, a deep seated belief in our principles, and from being certain of what is true.Conservatism understands that beliefs and truths do not ebb and flow with election cycles—that our fight is not merely about 2022 and 2024, but it’s about our future as a country and therefore the future of the world.And that’s why we must endeavor to captivate the hearts and minds of the American people.---I know the power of this because, when I needed it the most, I experienced it.As a kid growing up in North Charleston, South Carolina, I was raised in a single parent household, mired in poverty.My parents got divorced when I was seven years old. We were living on an Air Force base in Michigan.I was devastated—I felt like my whole world was coming apart. We moved back to North Charleston and in with my grandparents.They lived in a 700 square foot home, 2 bedrooms. Me, my mom, and brother shared one bedroom and one room.The house was filled with love but it was tough.Have any of you had a bad week? Well, I had a bad 7 years.From 7 until 14, I drifted.Now how many of you know that all drifting leads in the wrong direction? ... I was angry and discouraged and so my freshman year ... I failed four subjects.I failed world geography and civics. Now civics is the study of politics.I've got to tell you though, after nine years in the U.S. Senate, I am not the only one failing civics in America. I'm just saying!I also failed Spanish and English—when you fail Spanish and English, don't nobody call you bilingual. No.They call you bi-ignorant because you can’t speak in any language.That’s where I found my unhappy self. But I had two major blessings in my life! These two blessings came from completely different backgrounds and had different experiences.One was a praying momma. My mom worked 16 hours a day three days a week [and] eight hours a day two days a week to keep food on the table and to try to keep the lights on, and she usually did.She was a nurse’s aide, which means she basically changed bedpans and rolled patients a lot of hours a week.She wanted to teach me and my brother a lesson our country needs today—that there is dignity in all work, dignity in all work.My mom would come home late and try to encourage me. She’d say to me, “Timmy, if you would just shoot for the moon, even if you miss, you’ll be among the stars.” If I heard that once, I heard it a thousand times.Well, after I failed my freshman year, she came home late at night and saw my report card. I was pretending to be asleep.She woke me up, she looked at me, she looked at my report card, looked back at me, and she said, “Timmy get up and come with me.”I figured she was taking me outside to give me the literal Genesis 15 lessons on the stars and shooting for the moon. I said it with a little attitude, I said, “I know momma, I know if I just shoot for the moon, even if I miss, I’ll be among the stars.”My momma does not like attitude. She said, “No Timmy, you missed that lesson. Tonight I’m going to teach you a different lesson.”So she walked me outside to a tree and she said, “Pick a branch,” so I did.She said, “Tear the leaves off that branch.” ... So I did.She said, “Timmy, do you know what we're doing?”I said, “No ma'am, what are we doing?”She said, “I'm going to introduce you to something else. It's called a switch.”Now I know we're in California and not all of y'all are from the south, but a switch is a southern apparatus of encouragement.It’s applied from here to about here.And I must say I was thoroughly encouraged!I went to summer school, got caught up, graduated on time, went to college.And I can further tell you I never failed another class, not ever. I learned my lesson.This is one of the reasons why I’m so passionate about the GOP being the party of parents and ensuring parents have a say in their kids’ education.We are going to fight for educational excellence in every single zip code in America. Your zip code should never determine the quality of your education.I would not have graduated from high school if it were not for my mother's involvement.One of the small silver linings of the pandemic is that more parents are more engaged in education than ever before. Parents have a right to know what their kids are being taught in the classroom.Teaching kids that some are oppressors is just as bad as teaching other kids that they are always going to be victims.If my mom cannot read a book at a school board meeting because it’s too vulgar, why in the world would we allow our kids to read it in the classroom? To fix that, we should demand that parents have access to their child’s curriculum.Furthermore, we need to make sure that parents are fully equipped with the best options in the poorest areas so that their kids have access to a good quality education.Education is the closest thing to magic in America! The path to prosperity, self-worth, and independence is literally paved with education.We should be the party of education and never let that mantle slip through our grasp.The second blessing in my life touches upon another important pillar—economic freedom.After my sophomore year, I met a man named John Moniz. He happened to be a white guy, and that's so important in our world that seems to be more and more divided—a white guy, a Chick-fil-A operator, and a conservative.John saw something in me that I could not see in myself. And he started teaching me some very basic principles like…Having a job is a great thing but creating jobs is a better thing.He taught me that having an income is good, but creating a profit is even better. I can still hear him say today, “Profits are better than wages!”Now remember I was just a teenager and these principles were brand spanking new to me.I worked at the movie theatre right next door to John's Chick-fil-A, and he noticed one day that when I came to buy something from Chick-fil-A, I only purchased the fries.I didn’t have the money to buy the sandwich.So one day he came over to the concession stand at the movie theatre and slid a Chick-fil-A sandwich across the counter. He sat down, and just started talking to me.He invested in me. There was no formal program—just a man trying to make a difference in the life of a kid. And he did.He too made me take responsibility. He told me if I didn’t like where I was in life, look in the mirror and blame yourself.He said “Don’t blame your mom because she’s working 16 hours a day, and don’t blame your dad because he’s not around.”He said “Look in the mirror and take responsibility. If you find the problem in the mirror you will find the promise in that same mirror.”He said, “If you see the obstacles, you will find the opportunities.”He told me that anyone from anywhere at anytime could rise beyond their wildest imagination.His lessons took root, and I began understanding what he was teaching me.Tragically the first 4 years of my new life ended up being the last 4 years of his life.And two months shy of his 38th birthday, my mentor was gone.John had set a goal to positively impact the lives of a million people. So to honor him, at the age of 19—the night before his funeral—I sat down and wrote my life’s mission statement.I set a goal to positively impact the lives of a billion people with the message of hope and opportunity.Hope being my faith in Christ Jesus.And opportunity—the lessons John taught me about financial literacy. Financial literacy and the American Dream are as inseparable like the wet and the water. When you have one, you have the other.---Unfortunately for too many Americans today, the American Dream seems further and further out of reach.We’ve all heard it’s been said that elections have consequences.In December, 2020, I could drive into a gas station in my home state of South Carolina and fill my car at $1.99 a gallon.In less than a year into the Biden administration, at the same pump, it was $3.40 a gallon in 2021.Now it’s over six dollars a gallon here in California and almost four dollars a gallon in South Carolina.Since the 2020 election, the Democrats have pumped trillions of dollars into our economy—creating inflation, an invisible tax that’s hitting our most vulnerable populations the hardest: our single moms, our seniors on fixed incomes, and people living pay check to pay check.President Reagan once said, “Inflation is as violent as a mugger, as frightening as an armed robber, and as deadly as a hit man.”We can do better for the American people—and we have done better.From 2016 to 2020, we reformed the regulatory state—making it responsible, but not burdensome.I am grateful to have been one of four senators charged with the task of reforming our tax code and the principal architect for modifying the personal side of the code.We cut single moms’ taxes by nearly 70 percent, dual-income households by 60 percent. Those tax cuts led to the average family keeping nearly $4,000 of their own … hard earned money.We lowered the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, which unleashed the American economy.We implemented my Opportunity Zone program to ensure vulnerable communities have better access to economic investment.In just the first full year of Opportunity Zones, 2019, we saw 29 billion in private sector dollars invested in low-income, high poverty, majority minority areas.When we were in leadership, we advanced the most inclusive economy the nation had ever seen. We created 7 million jobs—thanks to tax reform and regulatory certainty.Unemployment rates hit the lowest ever recorded for African-Americans, under 6 percent. Hispanics, under 5 percent. Asians, under 3 percent. Women, a 70 year low. All Americans, somewhere around 3.5 percent.But most incredible, the wages for the bottom 25 percent grew faster than the wages for the top 25 percent.And oh by the way, revenue to the Treasury increased after we lowered taxes—no one on the Left wants you to know that.And guess who would not have been surprised—President Ronald Reagan.The numbers don’t lie. The GOP, the Great Opportunity Party, when we're in leadership, we deliver for the American people.On the flip side of that, Democrats’ leadership has led to a 40-year high in inflation, and they’re pouring more money on this crisis.That’s not good news for moms making decisions in homes like the one I was raised in.President Biden says he wants to lower costs by raising wages. Democrats do not understand how the free market system works.As a man who actually ran a business, I know that you increase wages by improving productivity so that you have more on the bottom line, and with those extra resources you can increase income and benefits.In order for the American economy to grow, we need to get people coming back to the workforce—not leaving it. That's a fact.Today, we have more jobs open than people looking for work. Meanwhile Democrats in Los Angeles are paying people $1,000 a month in so called “UBI”—Universal Basic Income—to stay home!We need to restore the dignity of work!How do we do it? We do it by providing more incentives for people to come back to work.We do it by expanding the definition of “workforce” to include gig workers—ride-share drivers and food deliverers.We want to make sure that the workers of the future have a say in where they work, when they work, how much they work, and what their benefits are.Meanwhile, Democrats continue to push failed policies that force employees into restrictive unions to promote their own political purposes.Ninety percent of union political dollars go to Democrats while 40 percent of union households vote for Republicans.Democrats want to eliminate right-to-work laws in 27 states, ushering in a new wave of unions.That’s wrong for our workers, wrong for our economy, and wrong for our country.Workers want flexibility and they want to build a workplace around their families and personal time.Conservatives can help them accomplish that through common-sense reforms and incentives that focus on the future, not the past.---When I look around today, it honestly feels like we’ve gotten into a time machine and traveled back to the Carter era of the 1970s. That’s when the term “misery index” was born.I remember the 1970s and the rationing of supplies due to weak economic policies and weak leadership in the White House.I remember the Iran hostage crisis and every day—444 of them—every day that went by where American citizens were left in harm’s way.Those Americans were released the day Ronald Reagan was sworn in as President—this was not a coincidence!Joe Biden, they told us, was the most experienced person in matters of foreign policy to ever seek the presidency.What they forgot to tell us is experience and acumen are two different things.Yes, our country and the world are bearing the consequences of Joe Biden being experienced ... in being wrong.President Biden’s weakness on the global stage has emboldened terrorists, bullies, and dictators.In Afghanistan, we had a botched withdrawal that cost 13 American soldiers their lives and left thousands of Americans stranded there.In Iran, after President Trump's wise decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal, the Biden administration is having Russia negotiate a new deal on our behalf.All the while, our adversaries in Venezuela, North Korea, Cuba and China are watching how the Biden administration continues to mishandle global affairs.And what about Russia?What we’re seeing from Vladimir Putin is pure evil, and it must be stopped.The images of children and families seeking refuge in the middle of Putin’s vicious attacks are simply heart breaking.We’re all inspired by the Ukrainian people—the freedom-loving, liberty-defending Ukrainians bravely fighting for their home.President Zelensky has impressively led his people into an awe-inspiring defense of their homeland.But more must be done on the international stage to support the Ukrainian people, including providing them with the weapons they need for a successful defense.The West is working together to squeeze Putin and his regime for this unprovoked and dangerous attack—that’s a good thing.But I would argue those steps came too late.The Biden administration placed misguided hope in the hands of diplomats while military leaders were arguing for a more forceful approach.And Biden’s decision on day one to block the Keystone XL pipeline put us at a huge disadvantage when Russia invaded Ukraine.Hear me clearly. Energy independence is necessary for our national security.But rather than opening up energy production here at home, the Biden administration fiddled with the idea of shifting from one dictator in Russia to another in Venezuela or Iran to increase our oil supply.This would once again compromise our national security.The world—and the American people—need responsible, steady leadership in this moment of crisis.Blood thirsty dictators like Putin only understand strength, and that’s what we must project from the United States.America remains the most important and powerful defender of democracy in the world—a responsibility we must take seriously.As the son of a Vietnam veteran, the brother of a man who served in Desert Storm, and another brother who graduated from the Air Force Academy and retired as a colonel, what I fully understand is that, indeed, peace comes through strength.During my Senate service, I’ve had the privilege of serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee.My family’s service and my experience on the SASC reinforced the need for us to strengthen our military capabilities and expand our resources. What I learned through my family’s nearly 100 years of military experience is that it’s not just about the here and now, but about preparation and training for future threats.My brother Ben, a Command Sergeant Major, who served in the U.S. Army for 32 years, he said to me, “When we decide to go to war, it’s too late to ‘get ready.’”We must never be caught unprepared for the fight. If we cannot engage in multiple conflicts across the globe at the same time, then we are unprepared for the responsibilities of the future. The reality is, today’s warfare does not look like it did in the mid-1900s or the early 2000s.Modern warfare includes cyberattacks, artificial intelligence, and undetectable weapons like hypersonic flight, and more.There is no need to sugarcoat it. We are falling behind.Both China and Russia have been testing hypersonic missiles that pose significant threats to the United States and our allies.Hypersonic missiles travel at over five times the speed of sound, can be maneuvered while in flight, and remain largely undetectable.Modern missile defense systems will be made obsolete by these types of missiles and the United States needs to do more to understand and develop defenses against these weapons.Our president must commit to a defense budget that invests in 21st century technologies and accounts for 21st century threats.---Speaking of our national security, far too little attention has been paid to the security risk at our southern border. If you can walk across our border illegally, you can bring with you incredible national security risks.The border crisis is clearly an immigration crisis, no doubt. 2021 saw a record breaking year—with roughly 2 million people caught crossing illegally.When President Biden speaks about reforms, it’s eliminating Title 42 with no plan to deal with the influx of additional illegal crossings.And when I say additional illegal crossings, what I'm actually talking about is 18,000 additional crossings per day according to the Biden administration. That means it's [a low estimate], doubling last year’s record-breaking illegal crossings.We need a physical barrier at our southern border. We must deploy smart technology to aid law enforcement in their efforts to secure our border.We’ve also seen the effects of weak border policies when it comes to drug trafficking. Traffickers are bringing fentanyl across our border with deadly consequences to the American people.The Biden administration’s policies only encourage vulnerable people to travel to our border, which only exacerbates the growing humanitarian crisis.The policies of today must always take into account the threats of tomorrow and ensure we are keeping Americans safe, at home and abroad.---America was founded on the life changing power of freedom, opportunity, and hope.Have we always gotten it right? Certainty not. But have we made extreme progress along the way? Absolutely. Will we continue to make even more progress into the future? You better believe it!Understanding our history has never been more important—not rewriting it for 1619 or reframing it as oppressed versus oppressors—but understanding the challenges we’ve faced and the price we’ve paid to become a beacon of hope to the world.An uncomfortable truth about our history is that, at times, human behavior has collided with our better angels.Our history bears the scars of considering Black Americans as only three-fifths of a human.It took a Civil War and the Civil Rights era to pave the way toward adopting the self-evident truth in our Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal.America may be the only country on earth to fight a Civil War to set people free!One passage I admire from President Lincoln’s second inaugural address, is where he talks about the importance of not only the Civil War and battling it, but winning it for the future of our great nation.He states: “Fondly do we hope—fervently do we pray—that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondman’s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said:‘The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.’With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation’s wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and for his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish, a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.”His words remain powerful and inspirational even today.When we look at the past, we must acknowledge the significant progress we’ve made.My grandfather was the closest living relative that I knew who suffered the abuses of a very different America.When he was growing up—1921 he was born—he wasn’t even allowed to use the same sidewalk as a white person. He spent his days picking cotton to help his family get by.But he believed in the goodness of America—miraculously he always remained hopeful because he believed then what some doubt now: that better days were ahead.He had only a third grade education—he needed to work to help his family and frankly there was not much need for an educated Black man in the south.Fast forward 5 decades—after we moved in with my grandparents, he would sit at the kitchen table every morning, and he would read the newspaper. He would read every single page. He was enamored with what was in that newspaper. And I was stunned. I wanted to grow up and learn to read like that because he always was reading the newspaper. I was stunned.It wasn’t until almost 15 years years later when I learned my grandfather actually never learned how to read.But he was impressing on his two grandsons the importance of education.And during my grandfather’s lifetime, he was able to go from picking cotton as a kid to watching his grandson pick out a seat in Congress and then the United States Senate.Our story, my story, is the American story: A story of hope and redemption.---Tonight we’re here in this majestic setting with the legacy of Ronald Reagan lingering, charting a new course using a familiar map for the party of Abraham Lincoln.We are the party of freedom, of strength, of personal responsibility and economic empowerment.We are the party of individual liberty, upward mobility, and the party that knows we are a nation of laws, not men—But a nation of laws needs strong women and men to enforce the law in a fair and just way.We have the right ideas, but even so we find ourselves in a state the Republican Party hasn't carried in 35 years, in a nation divided, in a political environment where pessimism has supplanted optimism and hope.It is easy to be daunted, discouraged, demoralized even. But do not.Our ideas are timeless because the truth is timeless. We must believe that. We must believe that our ideas and beliefs can stand the test of time.We must have courage in our convictions and know that conservatism is more than an election strategy.It is more than simply a series of campaign promises.Conservatism is a set of deeply held beliefs that when properly communicated, when faithfully implemented, when actually lived, can change your life and the life of a country.Conservatism is not easy. Few things worth pursuing in life are easy. Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan both wore the marks of their beliefs and convictions.Both were ridiculed, both were mocked, both were shot, and one was killed. And yet their legacies linger as a light guiding us towards that more perfect union.I believe in conservatism because it changed my life.It was education, hard work, and faith that allowed my family to go from cotton to Congress in one lifetime.It was education, hard work, and faith that allowed a grandfather who could not read or write to ride to the polls and cast a vote for his own grandson, a grandson who would be reading and writing bills and legislation, who would meet with presidents and Supreme Court justices.This is America. This is such a blessing to live in this country. This is the power of what we believe.Conservatism is my personal proof there is no ceiling in life.  I can go as high as my character, my education, and my perseverance will take me.I bear witness to that. I testify to that.So, for those of you on the Left, you can call me a prop, you can call me a token, you can call me the N word, you can question my blackness, you can even call me Uncle Tim.Just understand what you call me is no match for the proof of my life.Your words are no match for my evidence. Your pessimism is no match for the truth of my history.I will continue to proclaim boldly this truth from every mountain top, then I will do so from the deepest valley.I will do it in the boardroom, but I will also do it in the class room. I will do it in the auditorium surrounded by friends and the inner city church surrounded by skeptics.I believe it because I have lived it. I have lived the original dream. I have held the truth, the unalienable truth, that all men and women are created equal and endowed by our Creator with the right to be free.I am not merely a believer in the principles of conservatism; I am an eye witness.I bear testimony that America can do for you what it has done for me.So if it is a time for choosing, that is what I have chosen: The power, the life changing power of freedom and hope and opportunity.Will you choose it with me?  Will you join me as a messenger of hope, a missionary that the power of ideas can change our nation again?I will. God bless these United States of America.###"
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-toomey-seek-information-about-allegations-of-racial-discrimination-at-fdic-under-acting-chairman-gruenberg,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and U.S. Senate Banking Committee Ranking Member Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) today wrote to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Acting Chairman Martin Gruenberg regarding troubling allegations of racial discrimination and fears of retaliation at the FDIC under his previous leadership of the agency.On September 17, 2018, a group of African American employees wrote to former FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams to express their concerns about the FDIC’s culture over the prior 14 years—much of which occurred under Acting Chairman Gruenberg’s prior stint leading the FDIC.“For more than half of that time, the FDIC was under your leadership as chairman or acting chairman,” wrote Scott and Toomey. “Chairman McWilliams corrected and improved the agency’s culture in significant ways, but it is essential we understand how the agency functioned prior to changes she implemented in order to prevent a reoccurrence, particularly now that you are again serving as acting chairman.”The employees’ 2018 letter to the FDIC expressed concerns following the 2004 expiration of a consent decree resulting from a class-action lawsuit brought by African American FDIC employees alleging racial discrimination at the agency. The letter alleged that the FDIC was continuing to discriminate in hiring and that its employees were “afraid to speak out about the issues they are facing for fear of repercussions.”“Chairman McWilliams successfully changed the environment at the FDIC before she was forced out of office by the unprecedented and improper seizure of her lawful authority by you and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Rohit Chopra,” the senators continued. “Her actions as FDIC Chairman included launching programs to improve recruitment and hiring, support first generation professionals in the workplace, develop the next generation of leaders, and more. Her changes to the FDIC’s practices increased representation of minorities across the FDIC workforce and put more minorities and women in management-level positions.”To better understand the problems that arose and to ensure the FDIC does not revert back to a toxic workplace, Senators Scott and Toomey requested the FDIC turn over all records pertaining to allegations of workplace misconduct by senior officials, as well as any corrective or disciplinary actions related to those complaints, from November 2004 to September 2018.To read the full letter, click here.###"
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-booker-colleagues-introduce-bipartisan-bicameral-bill-reforming-opportunity-zones,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and U.S. Representatives Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) and Ron Kind (D-Wis.) introduced a bipartisan, bicameral bill reforming Opportunity Zones, the tax incentive for individuals who reinvest unrealized capital gains into high-impact projects in underserved communities. Additionally, U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Representatives Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.), Terri Sewell (D-Ala.), Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) co-sponsored the legislation, called the Opportunity Zones Transparency, Extension, and Improvement Act.Booker and Scott originally introduced the Investing in Opportunity Act in April 2016. A provision based on the bill was included in the 2017 tax bill. As communities across the country have begun to see investments take hold, Scott, Booker, Kelly, and Kind are proposing a series of reforms to the program.“The Opportunity Zone program represents the good that leaders can do for communities across the country when we work together toward common sense solutions,” said Senator Scott. “Independent reporting shows that investments in Opportunity Zones are making a huge impact across the country, with billions of dollars flowing into impoverished neighborhoods. I am glad to build on that success with this legislation to make the program stronger, so that we can ensure this incentive is benefitting the Americans who need it most.”“The Opportunity Zone incentive has the potential to unleash much-needed economic growth in high poverty communities across the country – communities that investors too often overlook. But without robust guardrails in place, the incentive could be undermined or abused by those who aren’t committed to uplifting rural and urban communities across the country,” said Senator Booker. “I am proud to introduce this legislation with Senator Scott to help restore the original promise of opportunity zones by steering private capital to reinvest in underserved communities that have been historically left behind and working to level the economic playing field.”“The creation of the Opportunity Zones initiative in the 2017 tax reform law has succeeded in attracting capital and investments to historically distressed communities. They serve as a critical tool to create jobs, revitalize neighborhoods, and lift Hoosiers out of poverty, which is why I am proud to help introduce the Opportunity Zones Transparency, Extension, and Improvement Act. This bipartisan legislation will better optimize Opportunity Zone investment in neighborhoods and communities across Indiana while strengthening transparency and reporting metrics to improve on the initiative’s success,” said Senator Young.“I am proud to co-sponsor this Opportunity Zone reform bill that will provide more transparency and reporting for these zones,” said Senator Warner. “I was an original leader on the bipartisan Investing in Opportunity Act, which led to the creation of Opportunity Zones, and I know this bill will make meaningful progress and substantially improve the policy.” “Gaps in Opportunity Zone programs have barred economically distressed areas from accessing the critical resources they need to create new local opportunities. This legislation will help close those gaps and ensure that Opportunity Zone investments lift up low-income communities – spurring further investments and ultimately benefiting Marylanders,” said Senator Van Hollen. “Maryland’s own Sparrows Point and Turner Station, alongside hundreds of recovering regions across the country, stand to see renewed economic vitality and more good-paying jobs as a result of this solution.”  ""Opportunity Zones are bringing capital to communities in rural and underserved areas and investing in our local economies,"" said Rep. Kind. ""In order to ensure this program is used as it was intended, we need strong transparency and accountability measures in place. I'm proud to help introduce this bipartisan, bicameral legislation to maximize the potential of Opportunity Zones, improve safeguards, and drive economic growth across the country.""“Opportunity Zones have brought new life to America’s Main Streets and communities that have not seen this type of investment in decades,” Representative Kelly said. “Nationally, one of the best-known Opportunity Zones is in my congressional district in Erie, Pennsylvania.  Due to great community partners and private investment, local leaders have been able to leverage the revitalization of downtown Erie.  Our new legislation will help ensure that Opportunity Zones can continue to revitalize communities like Erie for years and decades to come along with giving taxpayer’s the peace of mind that the government is working for them locally.”This bipartisan legislation would improve Opportunity Zones by:Click here to read the full text of the legislation.Click here to read the legislation one-pager.Click here to read the section by section of the legislation.  Quotes in support of the legislation can be viewed below:John Lettieri, President and CEO, Economic Innovation Group:“Supporting economic growth in low-income communities remains an urgent challenge as the country recovers from the severe disruption of the pandemic. One powerful way to do that is to strengthen the Opportunity Zones incentive, which has proven to be an effective tool for encouraging investment in struggling areas throughout the country,” said John Lettieri, President and CEO of the Economic Innovation Group. “The Opportunity Zones Transparency, Extension, and Improvement Act would enhance the policy on multiple fronts, including by enacting careful reporting and measurement standards, strengthening the incentive to draw in greater investment, creating new ways to attract funding for high-impact activities, and refining the map of designated communities to better align with the intent of the law. EIG applauds the bill’s sponsors for their thoughtful, bipartisan leadership in bringing this important legislation to fruition.” Jonathan Tower, Managing Partner, Arctaris Impact Investors:“Arctaris Impact Investors has invested in the revitalization of under-invested communities for 13 years over 7 funds and, in our experience, the Opportunity Zone incentive is more efficient for delivering capital and social impact to low income census tracts than all the other federal and local economic development programs combined.  The proposed amendments will help attract more institutional-grade capital to OZ funds, and Arctaris looks forward to expanding its platform to support the growth of diverse businesses, community infrastructure, and real estate.  Further, Arctaris has long advocated for and adhered to higher standards for impact reporting than contained in the original legislation, and we welcome the greater transparency requirements in the proposed amendments.”Martin Muoto, CEO, SoLa Impact:“This bipartisan legislation to improve the Opportunity Zones policy will drive investors to focus more on social impact in communities like South Los Angeles,” said Martin Muoto, CEO of SoLa Impact. “The OZ legislation has enabled SoLa to leverage private capital to build over 1,500 affordable and workforce housing units and house hundreds of formerly homeless residents.”Alex Flachsbart, Founder and CEO, Opportunity Alabama:“As presented, The Opportunity Zones Transparency, Extension, and Improvement Act will be the biggest step forward for Opportunity Zones in the program’s history. Providing a longer deferral window and allowing the feeder fund concept will substantially improve the flow of capital into the program - and, thanks to inclusion of additional reporting requirements, we can finally get real data on where those funds will flow. Most important, though, is the inclusion of the State and Community Dynamism Fund, a tool that - if properly implemented - could make Opportunity Zones the most effective incentive in the tax code at driving impactful, ground-up community development work.""  John Persinger, CEO, Erie Downtown Development Corporation:“Opportunity Zones are helping to fuel a $100 million revitalization of downtown Erie, Pennsylvania, which is home to one of the poorest zip codes in America,” said John Persinger, CEO of the Erie Downtown Development Corporation. “Strengthening the oversight provisions and generally improving the legislation will ensure that Opportunity Zones continue to help those communities with the greatest economic and social needs, communities like Erie.”Rick Wade, Senior Vice President, U.S. Chamber of Commerce:“The Opportunity Zone program is a positive, compelling example of government and the private sector working together to solve our nation's challenges. Investments made possible through the Opportunity Zone program will help underserved communities struggling to bounce back from pandemic-induced economic hardships. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is proud to support this bipartisan legislation that ensures Opportunity Zone financing reaches the areas of our country that need it the most and expands the reach of a public-private partnership on track to decrease the poverty rate by 11 percent,” said Rick Wade, Senior Vice President at the U.S. Chamber of CommerceStephanie Copeland, Partner, Four Points Funding:""The changes addressed in this bill not only practically strengthens the Opportunity Zone program, but also continues to align investors to the intent of the incentive. We are thrilled to see the thoughtful progress.""Katie Kramer, Vice President, Council of Development Finance Agencies:“The Council of Development Finance Agencies is grateful to Congress for their efforts to introduce important reforms to Opportunity Zones. The State and Community Dynamism Fund is critically needed at the local levels to fully deploy comprehensive OZ strategies in disinvested communities. We stand ready to support the implementation of the Opportunity Zones Transparency, Extension, and Improvement Act.”Ross Baird, CEO and Founder, Blueprint Local:“As active Opportunity Zone investors, we are excited to see this legislation that can ultimately drive much more impact in distressed communities. It is very positive to see the reporting requirements, which will bring transparency to this catalytic program and drive more impact in communities, as well as the fund of funds provision, which will help many more investors participate in the program and help the country’s most impactful projects find the capital they need.”Ben Seigel, Opportunity Zones & Impact Investment Coordinator, Baltimore Development Corporation:""From Day 1, the Baltimore Development Corporation embraced Opportunity Zones as a tool for attracting impact capital to underserved neighborhoods and projects in our city. We were one of the first cities in the country to hire an Opportunity Zones Coordinator to match investors with projects, as well as track and monitor investments and their impact. While we have been pleased with the results to date, we know that Opportunity Zones can do a lot more to drive inclusive economic growth in our city. This new legislation would significantly increase the promise and potential of Opportunity Zones in a place like Baltimore City by extending the incentive period, requiring impact reporting, and investing additional resources into OZ projects and local capacity building in underserved communities.""Jeremy Keele, Managing Partner, Catalyst Opportunity Funds:""We're really supportive of this new legislation to improve key elements of the Opportunity Zone policy. As impact-focused investors active in the OZ strategy, we believe the proposed changes are likely to improve transparency and accountability program-wide, and more directly target capital and other resources into the low-income communities around this country that stand to benefit most from OZ investment.""###"

https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-cassidy-working-to-save-school-choice-after-bureaucrats-threaten-to-gut-it,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.), and 11 colleagues today urged the Department of Education to reconsider proposed rules that would redefine the Charter School Program, stripping parents of their ability to choose the best school for their child.“Rather than overseeing and enforcing existing safeguards intended to ensure that high-quality schools are able to open or expand, the Department of Education is engaging in an aggressive attempt to dictate Federal, one-size-fits-all rules for charter schools,” the senators wrote. “This proposed rule would add new requirements for applicants that are entirely unrelated to student outcomes.”“After teachers’ unions spent the pandemic keeping public schools closed while many charter schools stayed open, it is particularly appalling that the Department is working aggressively to limit charter school options for families in need,” the senators continued.Senators Scott and Cassidy were joined by Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), John Boozman (R-Ark.) and James Lankford (R-Okla.). Read the full letter here or below.Dear Secretary Cardona:We write to express our deep concern regarding the proposed rewrite of the bipartisan federal Charter Schools Program (CSP). Rather than overseeing and enforcing existing safeguards intended to ensure that high-quality schools are able to open or expand, the Department of Education is engaging in an aggressive attempt to dictate Federal, one-size-fits-all rules for charter schools. This unprecedented attempt at micromanaging a 28-year-old bipartisan program only serves to discourage charter schools from applying for these grants, effectively harming access to high quality schools for millions of students around the country. This proposed rule would add new requirements for applicants that are entirely unrelated to student outcomes. Applicants would have to demonstrate “unmet demand for the charter school”. This means that having tens of thousands of children on charter waiting lists will not be enough. The Department wants evidence of “over-enrollment at existing public schools,” meaning that charter applicants in areas with shrinking enrollments, which includes most big cities, would most likely be rejected. Demand for charter schools is not just about the availability for any seat, but the demand for a high-quality seat, like those that exist at many of the nation’s premier charter schools. This requirement overrides the will of parents to affirmatively choose charter schools for their children and subjugates parents and students to the bureaucratic priorities set by the Department of Education. Since the pandemic, public charters have seen a substantial increase in demand. A logical approach would be to expand this program and build on what is already working for students and families. Instead, the Department of Education is taking direction from special interest groups, who seem more concerned with union membership rather than what is best for America’s students.This rulemaking makes no mention of how any of these new, burdensome hurdles will improve student achievement or help serve America’s neediest students. In fact, “academic achievement” is only mentioned twice in the text of the rule and not in a manner that shows how any requirement will improve such achievement; rather, an application must only describe the current achievement of students in areas from which it hopes to draw enrollment. At a time when students are falling behind in record numbers, we need new and innovative approaches to our education system. This is the precise reason the CSP exists: to offer innovative teaching models and to increase autonomy for teachers and schools. These proposed rules would take away choice from families and give more power to unelected bureaucrats in Washington.After teachers’ unions spent the pandemic keeping public schools closed while many charter schools stayed open, it is particularly appalling that the Department is working aggressively to limit charter school options for families in need. Public charter schools currently serve more than 3.4 million students across 42 states. The CSP, which has enjoyed bipartisan support since its inception in 1994, works to support these schools by providing federal funding to create promising new public charter schools, replicate successful public charter schools, and disseminate information about effective practices within charter schools. In fiscal year 2022, the CSP was funded at $440 million. Grants have benefited about half of existing charter schools and hundreds of thousands of predominately low-income students of color across the country.Changes of this magnitude should be thoughtfully considered through the regular legislative process with proper input from relevant community stakeholders and Congress. Instead, the Department seems to be ignoring the will of Congress, through unilateral action. Therefore, we urge you to withdraw the proposed rule and engage with Congress on better ways to serve America’s students. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.###"
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-reed-introduce-resolution-declaring-april-financial-literacy-month,"WASHINGTON – This week, U.S. Senators Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.), co-chairs of the Financial Literacy Caucus, introduced a resolution declaring the month of April as Financial Literacy Month. “Having grown up in an underserved community, I know the enormous impact that early financial education can make on the trajectory of a person’s life,” said Sen. Scott. “Throughout this month and beyond, I’ll continue working to expand financial literacy and empower Americans with the tools and the confidence they need to secure a more prosperous future.”According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), approximately 7.1 million Americans are unbanked. These individuals have limited or no access to savings, lending, and other basic financial services, reducing their ability to build wealth and achieve long-term financial security. The resolution was cosponsored by Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), and Rick Scott (R-Fla.)Read full text of the resolution here.###"

https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-colleagues-introduce-bipartisan-law-enforcement-de-escalation-training-act,"WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) joined Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), and others in introducing the bipartisan Law Enforcement De-escalation Training Act to help law enforcement respond more effectively to people suffering with mental or behavioral health crises.“As the first ones on the scene, America’s law enforcement officers must be ready to respond to crises of all types. Equipping them with the necessary training and resources to ensure they can do their jobs and keep our communities safe is just plain common sense. I have been calling for this type of reform for years, and I am glad to be a part of this bipartisan group working to finally make it happen,” said Senator Scott.The senators’ bill would improve training for police officers interacting with individuals dealing with mental or behavior health issues. The training would include alternatives to force, de-escalation tactics, and instruction on working with mental health professionals on crisis intervention teams. It would also empower police and the mental health professionals working with them to link individuals to mental and behavioral health services in their community. “Too often, police respond when someone is suffering a mental health or behavioral health issue, yet lack the resources they need to do so effectively. We can save lives by equipping officers to recognize and respond appropriately to those situations, to work with mental health professionals, and connect people to treatment,” said Senator Whitehouse. “I’m pleased to join with Senator Cornyn on this important bill.”“We ask law enforcement in our communities to wear too many hats, including that of mental health provider, and they often do not have enough resources or training to provide the level of care individuals in crisis need,” said Senator Cornyn. “We must give them the necessary tools so officers feel supported while helping those experiencing mental health emergencies and other crises, and this legislation would do just that.”Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) are also original cosponsors of the bill.Background:Underfunded and overworked mental and behavioral health systems often leave police to confront people who urgently need mental or behavioral health care. But many police departments don’t train officers on how to deal with such situations, leading to encounters that are dangerous for all involved.  In response, a growing number of communities have developed community intervention programs to help law enforcement address mental or behavioral health crises. These programs connect officers on the street with mental and behavioral health providers and hospital emergency services.  In addition to protecting officers and communities, these programs reduce arrests and prison time for people in need of mental or behavioral health treatment. This is better for the individual facing mental or behavioral health challenges, and can save governments on prison costs. As the National Alliance on Mental Illness has observed, an inmate in Detroit battling mental illness costs $31,000 a year in jail, while mental health treatment costs only $10,000 a year in the community.At minimum, all police officers should be equipped with the skills to respond to people with mental or behavioral health issues safely and with compassion. To improve officer training on mental and behavioral health, and to promote community intervention programs, the Bipartisan Law Enforcement De-escalation Training Act would:The bill is endorsed by the National Criminal Justice Association, National Association of Counties, American Psychological Association, National Alliance on Mental Illness, American Counseling Association, National Register of Health Service Psychologists, American Association of Suicidology, Major Cities Chiefs Association, Major County Sheriffs of America, National Association of Police Organizations, National Sheriffs’ Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the College of Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacists, the American Association on Health and Disability, the Lakeshore Foundation, the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, the American Association for Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work, the Maternal Mental Health Leadership Alliance, the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors, the National Association for Rural Mental Health, and the Niskanen Center.Full text of the senators’ bill is available here.###"

https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/icymi-tim-scott-on-the-megyn-kelly-show,"WASHINGTON – This week, Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) joined the Megyn Kelly Show for a discussion on President Biden’s handling of the economy, policing in America, workers’ rights, and much more.Click to watchOn policing in America … “Police officers today are literally being shamed in streets, pushed around. They are having more violence against them than in the history of the country. … In big blue cities all across this country, homicide rates are up nearly 50 percent if not higher. … [There has been a] 70 percent increase in officers being shot in the last two years. Put those two statistics together; it’s an ugly reality for people growing up in poverty and in communities living on the margins like the one I grew up [in]. …“Eighty percent plus [of] African-Americans agree with me on recent polling. They want more policing or the same level of policing in their neighborhoods. You don’t get there by defunding the police, by shaming the police, and by taking away the necessary qualified immunity that keeps them at work and able to defend themselves.”On the Biden administration’s mishandling of the economy … “Let me just say it simply: The president and his administration fundamentally misunderstand the American economy. They obviously have not spent any time working in the private sector. Fifty years in the government is not good for understanding how the real world works.“Kitchen table economists — also known as moms around the country — get this better than anybody else. Corporations write the check, but people pay the tax. That’s something we should always remember. So when you take the tax from 21 percent to 28 percent, you’re only increasing … the burden on everyday people who are buying those products [by a third]. … There are countries today that are trying to get into the teens in their corporate tax rate. That means that we’re heading in the wrong direction.On prioritizing kids above labor unions … “There’s no doubt that the Democrat Party and especially the progressive wing — I’m not sure that there’s actually a difference anymore — has been wed to the labor unions more than they have [been] to the kids. … One of the reasons why we are the party of parents is we want to make sure that parents are much more in charge of the education pathways of their kids. What stands in the way of that? Big labor unions in education. …“It’s one of the reasons why, Megyn, for the first time — at least in my lifetime — African-American support of school choice is over 70 percent, Hispanics around 77 percent, working class families [is] 80 percent. Something is fundamentally broken in education, and the parents want to be responsible for their kids and hold big labor unions accountable for the misdirection of America’s education system.”On workers’ rights … “Ninety percent of labor union spending on politics — on elections — [goes] to Democrats. Now, interestingly enough, Megyn, about 40 to 45 percent of the members of unions vote for Republicans. So they literally have no control over how their dues are being spent. It’s one of the reasons why, in my Employee Rights Act, the legislation that I sponsored, we’re trying to make sure that we empower the union members to decide whether or not you can use their dues for elections … We want to make sure that the workers of the future are in charge of the workplace, and what the Democrats want is centralized control of every facet of your life to include your workplace. That’s the wrong direction for America. That’s going backwards, not to our future.”On President Biden’s failed leadership … “I haven’t seen this number of missteps in a row in my lifetime by a United States president. The American presidency is ultimately the platinum standard of leadership. And now it might be copper because literally we’ve lost a lot of the shine on the leadership posture that we have held in this world for my entire lifetime. It cannot be going much worse for the administration as it relates to their inability to make a decision and stick with it.”On the crisis in Ukraine and the need for American strength … “Here’s what the Ukrainian people, the liberty-loving, freedom-defending people of Ukraine want. They want the resources to defend their nation. And too often our president has been slow in delivering the resources and the weapons they need to do the work. …“There’s no question that the Russians continue to look for a reason to talk about escalation. The fact of the matter is, every time President Biden takes a step back, the Russians and Putin take a step forward. There are very, very few things that we can do to stop the escalation. Giving the Ukrainians the resources and the weapons necessary to do so is one of the things I believe that Putin would respond to. He’s a thug. He responds to power. Without that, he doesn’t respond at all. … We need an American strength now more than ever.”###"

Yes, elections have consequences.“I wish the administration was listening to people working across South Carolina, as I do. Sitting in Longhorn’s restaurant before I flew back to Washington on Monday … the waitress at the table tells me that she moved from the north to South Carolina, a good choice. She wanted a higher quality of life and a more affordable place to live. … She starts talking to me. She says, ‘Sir, I put $92 in my tank this morning.’“And I thought about that. [For] the average American, the median income in this country is around $17 to $17.50 an hour. Once you take the taxes out, it means that she has to work the first six or seven hours of her work week just to put gas in that tank.“Ladies and gentlemen, this is not an issue about partisan politics. This is an issue of how failed leadership feels to the average worker on an average wage in our country. They deserve better from this administration.

https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-finance-committee-republicans-ask-yellen-for-update-on-social-security-and-medicare-trustees-reports,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Social Security, Pensions and Family Policy Todd Young (R-Ind.), along with all other Finance Committee Republicans, sent a letter requesting U.S. Department of Treasury Secretary Yellen provide an update on the status of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds reports, which by law are to be issued annually by April 1.The reports have rarely been distributed on time in recent years, with the 2021 report not delivered until August 31.  While the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has made recommendations to Treasury on process improvements in recent years, the recommendations have not been fully incorporated into the process for developing the trust fund reports.  As Managing Trustee of the trust funds, it is the responsibility of the Treasury Secretary to provide these reports to Congress in a timely manner, as required by law, or provide Congress and the American people with explanations for late work.From the letter:“The 2021 trustees report was released 152 days late, with little-to-no information provided to the public and to Congress explaining the reasons for, and the expected duration of, the delay.”…“Before Congress debates any further legislation that impacts either the Medicare or Social Security programs, it is imperative that policymakers have accurate and timely information regarding the financial operations of these critical safety-net programs.”…“For Congress and the public to provide effective oversight of the Social Security and Medicare programs and trust funds, your role as Managing Trustee of the boards of trustees for Social Security and Medicare requires that you provide timely information as required by the law.”  Read the full letter here or below. Dear Secretary Yellen,The Social Security Act requires that reports analyzing the current and projected financial status of both the Social Security and Medicare trust funds be issued annually, and no later than April 1 of each calendar year.  According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), the trustees have consistently failed to release these mandated reports to Congress on time.  In 2019, GAO stated that the trustees had missed their statutory deadline in 17 of the preceding 25 years.  The 2021 trustees report was released 152 days late, with little-to-no information provided to the public and to Congress explaining the reasons for, and the expected duration of, the delay.Regrettably, 2008 was the last year in which the statutory reporting deadline had been satisfied.   Congress continues to make key decisions regarding fiscal spending and long term outlays through the current budgetary window (2022-2031).  Either through reconciliation or regular order, there is every expectation that Congress will consider additional health care related legislation this year.  Before Congress debates any further legislation that impacts either the Medicare or Social Security programs, it is imperative that policymakers have accurate and timely information regarding the financial operations of these critical safety-net programs.  Exacerbating this problem further, since 2016, there have been no public trustees confirmed to serve as public voices in communicating the state of the trust funds to the American public.  Denying participation of public trustees in the report development process effectively denies the American people a voice when it comes to Social Security and Medicare.Seeking to amend this broken reporting process, Republicans in Congress asked GAO to review the trustees report development process and provide recommendations to improve or modify it.  In 2019, GAO submitted two suggestions for executive action to address the late issuance of reports:A subsequent September 30, 2021 GAO report noted that Treasury had taken relatively minor steps to improve report management, but that overall the suggested recommendations have not been fully implemented.  On the first recommendation, GAO observed, “Other than tracking the planned and actual dates of each reporting cycle, Treasury has not told [GAO] about any other steps it took to manage the report development schedule…”On the second recommendation, GAO noted that agency officials representing the trustees and overseeing the development of the reports indicated that a policy had been established to notify Congress if the trustees anticipated issuing the reports after the April 1 statutory deadline.  According to GAO, that new policy states that “the chairperson of the working group will ‘assess the need to notify Congress of the reports’ timing.’”  GAO continued, “The policy does not specify how the trustees would make that assessment, nor does it mention including the reasons for the delay in this communication to Congress.”  A Treasury official acknowledged that they did not interpret GAO’s recommendation to mean that the policy itself had to address communicating the reasons for the delayed report.  Consequently, GAO deemed the Treasury response inadequate, saying, “This policy does not fully address our recommendation because it implies that notifying Congress should be discretionary and does not call for any explanation for the delays and updated time frames.  The policy should serve as a prompt for subsequent working groups to provide timely updates and address all of the information we recommended communicating to Congress.”Although GAO observed that agency officials had informed congressional staff via an email in March 2021 that Treasury anticipated missing the statutory reporting deadline by “at least eight weeks,” GAO also noted that Treasury officials failed to follow-up with congressional staff until the reports were publicly issued on August 31, 2021.  GAO further reported that Treasury stated its intention to have provided an additional update in May, but that this communication had not occurred “due to an internal miscommunication.”While the COVID-19 pandemic affected every part of society in 2020 and 2021, the delayed issuance of the trustees reports in those years remained consistent with the long-term trend of administrations evading, or at the very least, failing to uphold, their statutorily-defined duties.  The specific lack of responsiveness exhibited by Treasury staff last year, which Senator Crapo detailed in his previous letter to you of August 5, 2021, indicates that proactive outreach by Congress continues to be met with no substantive actions to improve matters. Furthermore, the leadership void at the Social Security Administration created by the politicized firing of Commissioner Saul and Deputy Commissioner Black, and the continuing vacancies of the public trustee positions for both Social Security and Medicare, cannot excuse the remaining members of the boards for their noncompliance.  This Administration has made itself and one political party solely responsible for the management of Social Security and Medicare, and it now bears the duty to provide a comprehensive update on its management to the congressional committees of jurisdiction.We therefore urge you, as Managing Trustee, to fully incorporate GAO’s 2019 recommendations, including these examples of actions GAO listed in their 2021 report:Our understanding is that Treasury received an advanced draft of GAO’s 2021 report, and that Treasury is committed to improving the reports’ timeliness, as well as “…to communicating with Congress on these issues, [including to] track and log working group notifications to Congress on report timing going forward to promote the delivery of prompt updates.”For Congress and the public to provide effective oversight of the Social Security and Medicare programs and trust funds, your role as Managing Trustee of the boards of trustees for Social Security and Medicare requires by law that you provide timely information.As we now approach the April 1 deadline, we request that you provide:Neither we nor our staffs have received any communications regarding the development of the 2022 trustees reports, causing concern about their status.We respectfully request that you, as Managing Trustee, commit to developing better policies, more in line with GAO’s recommendations, to keep the congressional committees of jurisdiction and the public regularly informed of the anticipated report delivery dates when trustees anticipate missing the statutory deadline of April 1.  Doing so will ensure that the management of these important programs will remain accountable to the American people under both Republican and Democratic administrations./s/###"

This legislation, which serves as an alternative approach to the overbearing child care proposals Democrats pushed in their reckless tax and spending bill, works to improve affordability of child care programs and protects the ability of parents to choose the provider that best fits their family’s needs.“The Democrats’ child care proposals would take a wrecking ball to our child care system and replace it with a one-size-fits-all approach that limits families’ options,” said Senator Scott. “I believe there is a better way. This bill improves upon a program that has already helped families afford a variety of options to care for the most important people in their lives: their kids.”“Working parents need affordable, reliable, and safe child care that best fits their family’s needs,” said Senator Burr. “Throughout the pandemic, as public schools closed, child care providers across the nation remained open, thanks in large part to the architecture and flexibility of the CCDBG program. As many states now face a shortage of affordable child care, the last thing Congress should do is force through unpopular, partisan proposals that many states will reject and that will leave millions of children uncovered. Instead, we should build on existing, bipartisan, and successful programs, like CCDBG. I’m proud to work with Senator Scott on this important legislation.”Cosponsoring the bill along with Sen. Scott and Ranking Member Burr are Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), and Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska).Background:Rather than create two new child care and preschool entitlement programs, as the Democrats proposed in their tax and spending bill, the CCDBG Reauthorization Act of 2022 makes responsible enhancements to the historically bipartisan CCDBG program, which has assisted working families with their child care and preschool needs for the last 30 years.

Scott delivered the following remarks:Thank you Chair Murray for the opportunity to address the witnesses on such an important topic around child care and preschool.Looking for ways to really improve the outcome for the kids who are growing up in sometimes challenging circumstances, I think about good intentions. I think both sides probably have good intentions as it relates to the conversation and sometimes the debate around providing high-quality child care to folks who are in desperate need of it.I think about the approach that was going to be taken in the Build Back Better plan. That approach would have increased — according to the progressive think tanks — increased the cost of child care from $15,888 to around $29,000. In an attempt to make child care more affordable, I think they would have made child care less affordable. …If we want to see folks coming back to work, solving this problem, bridging the gap is so critically important to the kids who are literally looking for a safe place to learn, parents who are looking for a way to be able to have their kids in a safe environment — a good environment — so they can continue to work because you can’t be at work and at home at the same time. And we saw that challenge exacerbated throughout the pandemic. … So one of the things I’ve done over the last four or … maybe six years [or so] is make sure that we kept the choice in the hands of the parents…And today I introduced legislation — the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Reauthorization Act of 2022 — because the child care and development block grant program has assisted working families and their children for more than 30 years, all while ensuring that parents have maximum freedom to make the best decisions for their children. … This is a lifeline for low-income [parents] looking to participate in the workforce or continue their education.This bill also traditionally enjoyed immense bipartisan support. That’s why we are actually having a conversation, in my opinion, today. My new bill would make responsible enhancements to the CCDBG program to better support America’s working families.###"

Sen. Scott also announced his new bill, the Employee Rights Act of 2022, which will counter the Democrats’ PRO Act by increasing flexibility and protection for America’s workers.Click to watchOn how Republicans will evaluate Judge Jackson … “What we’re going to focus on are the concerns we have about her philosophy as a judge. We’re going to focus on how [she has ruled] in the past and why [some of those rulings were] overturned by a higher court.“We’re going to focus on making sure that America’s Supreme Court gets the justice they deserve. This is not Biden’s Supreme Court. This is not the progressive’s Supreme Court. This is America’s Supreme Court. And so I can tell you that Republicans will dig into her record, but we’re interested in who she is as a judge, not what she looks like.”On his new Employee Rights Act of 2022 … “[Republicans] are going to focus on the future, while the Democrats are focusing on the past. We literally understand that workers want the flexibility in their schedules, and they want to build a workplace around themselves. We can help them get that accomplished through my legislation. So I’m really excited to see the progress we’re making [on ensuring that today’s] employees decide when they work, how much they work for, and the benefits they get. Whether you’re an independent contractor or an employee, we want a workplace that is conducive for your priorities.”On the Democrats’ PRO Act … “The PRO Act, which failed in California, the most liberal state in the country — failed by a 20 point margin [at the polls] — [Democrats are] trying to bring that failed legislation to the national scene where they literally require every employee to join a union or pay dues to a union, whether they are a member or not.“They want to be able to take those union dues and use them for political purposes. Ninety percent of the money goes to Democrats, while 40 percent of the union members vote for Republicans. We have to break that stronghold that they currently have. They want to — through the PRO Act — eliminate 27 states’ Right to Work laws, in other words ushering in a new wave of unions. That is wrong for our economy, wrong for our workers, and wrong for our country.”###"
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/senator-scott-colleagues-introduce-the-employee-rights-act-of-2022,"WASHINGTON – This week, U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) introduced the Employee Rights Act of 2022. The bill updates and modernizes the Employee Rights Act to protect independent contractors, franchisees, entrepreneurs, and anyone seeking flexible work options.“The complexities of our modern economy demand creative, forward-thinking legislation that gives workers and small business owners stability and flexibility,” said Senator Tim Scott. “The Democrats continue to push for legislation that prioritizes politics over people by protecting labor unions at the expense of workers. The Employee Rights Act puts workers back in the driver’s seat by giving them basic protections and the power to choose how to make a living for themselves and build a future for their families. I am grateful to my colleagues who are joining me in this fight to make workers’ voices heard in the halls of Congress.”The Employee Rights Act of 2022 is co-sponsored by Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee Ranking Member Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and Senators John Thune (R-S.D.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.).“Americans increasingly expect their careers to provide them with flexibility, freedom, and the ability to pursue their own goals, especially as we face the highest inflation rates in decades and recover from the unprecedented economic strain of the pandemic,” said Senator Burr. “It’s unfortunate Democratic politicians are attempting to reshape America’s workforce by discriminating against workers who do not wish to join a union. Instead, we should support policies that protect the successful franchise model and gig economy. This legislation does just that by modernizing our labor policies to match the needs of our evolving workforce. I’m proud to join my colleagues on this important legislation that reigns in Washington’s desire to run businesses across the nation and supports innovation and job growth for years to come.”""When Democrats took control of the House, the Senate, and the White House, they inherited an economic rocket ship ready to take off,"" said Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""Instead, they capitulated to special interests and pushed policies that have smothered the economy. The Employee Rights Act represents the Republican vision for the future of the American workforce: allow growth and innovation among the gig economy workforce; ensure labor laws protect workers, not union bosses; and ensure that Americans take home more of the money they earn.""“Democrats in Washington have long bowed to the demands of union bosses by prioritizing radical labor policies that harm small businesses and workers,” said Senator Thune. “I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing this common-sense bill that would ensure workers’ rights are protected against coercion from union bosses and provide a much-needed update to labor laws so they are more reflective of the modern economy.”Representative Rick Allen (R-Ga.), lead Republican on the Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions Subcommittee on the House Education and Labor Committee, is introducing the companion bill in the House.“Republicans stand with the 21st Century worker, and it’s time to ensure our labor policies do too,"" said Representative Allen. ""The Employee Rights Act of 2022 protects employees’ privacy, membership dues and the union election process from being abused by union bosses. It also provides all employees, independent contractors and new gig economy workers the necessary protections so they can focus solely on their jobs. Even though Congressional Democrats and Joe Biden have the support of big labor who wrote their wish-list into the PRO Act, our legislation is supported by dozens of national, state and local organizations comprised of workers from across the nation.”Click here to read the bill in full. More than 60 pro-worker, pro-business groups have endorsed the Employee Rights Act.

Accountability begins at the top, and as U.S. Secretary of Education you must explain your role, or your staff’s role, in the creation of this letter.”Signatories to the letter include Senators Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and John Hoeven (R-N.D.).BACKGROUNDClick here or read the full text of the letter below. January 13, 2021Delivered via EmailThe Honorable Miguel CardonaSecretaryU.S. Department of Education400 Maryland Ave., SWWashington, DC 20202Dear Secretary Cardona:Parents are not “domestic terrorists” and it is appalling that anyone would suggest that exercising the constitutionally protected freedoms of speech and assembly would be characterized as a threat. Parents across the country are outraged that their children’s education has been disrupted, delayed, even denied over the past two years.Study after study shows how much educational harm has been done to schoolchildren with shutdowns and closures. It is estimated most students lost between 30 and 50 percent of their learning gains because of school closures. Moreover, minority and low-income students and students with disabilities were among the hardest hit as a result of these disruptions, with many losing as much as a full year of educational progress. Students’ mental health suffered as well. According to the CDC, teen suicide attempts among girls increased by 51 percent, likely due in part to students’ inability to access in-person learning.Yet on September 29, 2021, the National School Boards Association (NSBA) sent a letter to President Biden accusing parents expressing concern and frustration with lockdowns, shutdowns, school closures, mandates and more with “domestic terrorism.” The letter even suggested using the PATRIOT Act against parents who are concerned about months and years of lost educational opportunities due to school closures, shutdowns, and unnecessary restrictions.On October 4, 2021, Attorney General Garland issued a memo at NSBA’s behest, directing the FBI and U.S. Attorneys to act on the contents of the NSBA letter. That evoked the prospects of the FBI using the powers of the PATRIOT Act against peacefully protesting parents frantic to get their children back in school so they don’t fall behind and lose a year of education.On October 22, 2021, the NSBA apologized for the letter, as they should. Many state school board associations have called into question their affiliation with the NSBA, and the NSBA has a lot of work to do to regain the trust of America’s moms and dads without significant reforms.Unfortunately, the Attorney General has not rescinded his memo, as he should.While we knew early on that White House staff were complicit in the creation of this letter, it is only recently that information has surfaced implicating you and your office in this shameful episode. News reports indicate that the letter from the NSBA to President Biden was actually initiated at your request.Accountability begins at the top, and as U.S. Secretary of Education you must explain your role, or your staff’s role, in the creation of this letter.Please respond to the following questions by 4:00 p.m., Friday, January 14, 2022:Thank you for your attention to this matter.Sincerely,/s/###"
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/sens-scott-and-thune-introduce-bill-to-combat-inflationary-spending,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and John Thune (R-S.D.) introduced the Inflation Prevention Act (IPA) that would help combat inflationary spending. Due to record government spending over the last two years, many Americans are facing rapidly rising costs of consumer goods. This bill would bar legislation that would be estimated to increase inflation until the year-over-year inflation rate drops below 4.5 percent.“American families cannot continue to endure the burden of skyrocketing costs of everyday goods brought on by reckless spending in Washington,” said Senator Tim Scott. “A sound financial future requires wise financial action now.” “Our country is facing the highest level of inflation in nearly 40 years, and South Dakotans are paying more for food, utilities, and gas,” said Senator Thune.“I’m proud to join Sen. Scott in the fight to stop the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending spree, which would significantly worsen the already damaging inflation crisis.”Joining Senators Scott and Thune are Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), and Steve Daines (R-Mont.). “From gas to groceries, Iowans and all Americans are paying higher prices because of record inflation stoked by irresponsible government spending. Our bill seeks to prevent Congress from pouring even more gasoline on the fires of inflation by restricting the ability of Congress to approve new spending while inflation remains historically high,” said Senator Grassley.“Families are worried about the skyrocketing inflation our country is experiencing. We know that reckless government spending causes inflation, but President Biden and the Democrats have absolutely no plans to slow down spending or get our debt under control. It’s shameful. Congress needs to get real about the true cost on every American family that this wasteful spending brings and start acting responsibly. That’s why we must pass the Inflation Prevention Act. I look forward to my colleagues supporting this measure to stop reckless spending and getting our country back on the path to prosperity,” said Senator Rick Scott.“President Biden’s policies continue to cause soaring inflation–the highest in forty years–pinching the pocketbooks of hardworking Iowans and making it harder for them to purchase everyday household items from groceries to gasoline. We must reign in the Democrats’ out of control spending, and this effort will take steps to ensure spendthrift lawmakers are held accountable for the impact their action have on everyday Americans,” said Senator Ernst.“It’s clear that Democrats’ reckless spending approach to the pandemic has created the inflation crisis Oklahomans now face, especially after inflation hit a devastating 7% in December,” said Senator Lankford. “I have warned about the impact of out-of-control spending on our economy for years. Our proposal protects against federal over spending that makes inflation worse, helps make sure future emergency spending only moves forward when absolutely needed, and reins it in when the federal pork barrel buffet starts to roll toward inflation.”“Under the Biden inflation crisis, inflation is at a 40-year high and working Americans are struggling to pay for the daily essentials. For months, Democrats have ignored the problem, blaming everything instead of their socialist spending agenda. The Inflation Prevention Act would ensure that the bills we are voting on in Congress do not make this problem worse,” said Senator Young.“Everyday Americans could care less about a lot of the issues we have been discussing lately in the Senate,” said Senator Rubio. “What people are really worried about is the fact that it costs more to feed their families and put gas in their cars. People can’t get basic goods because grocery store shelves are empty. And rather than fixing the problem, the Biden Administration and Democrats in Congress are making things worse. This bill puts a few commonsense guardrails in place to curb reckless spending habits in Congress that threaten to create even more challenges for American families. That’s the kind of action we should be taking right now.”“Inflation is a tax on all Americans and it is now the highest rate it has been in 40 years,” said Senator Hoeven. “The Inflation Prevention Act will prohibit legislation that worsens inflation. Prices are continuing to rise, and our bill will help prevent further harm to American consumers.”This bill has also garnered support from several organizations including the National Taxpayers Union, Heritage Action, Americans for Tax Reform, FreedomWorks, and the Conservative Political Action Coalition (CPAC).""Runaway inflation has hurt the pocketbooks of countless American families, especially low-income families, and it is critical that policymakers in Washington avoid making the situation worse. NTU is glad to support this resolution from Senators Tim Scott and John Thune, which would ensure that Congress does not pass legislation that increases inflation at a time of historically high inflation. We encourage all Senators to support this effort."" – Andrew Lautz, director of federal policy, National Taxpayers Union “While Democrats try to bankrupt the country on a liberal wishlist of policies, everyday Americans are struggling to make ends meet because of the inflation that these very policies are causing. Senator Tim Scott is leading the fight against this reckless spending spree by introducing legislation to make it harder for the federal government to spend money unnecessarily at times of high inflation.” – Garrett Bess, vice president of Heritage Action“Inflation is crushing American families and small businesses, costing the typical family thousands of dollars in 2021. President Biden and Congressional Democrats want trillions in tax increases and new spending that will only make this problem worse. Senators Tim Scott and John Thune should be applauded for pushing safeguards that ensure new legislation does not exacerbate this rampant inflation.” – Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform“The socialist Democrats in Congress have shown that they care little about hardworking Americans. As they continue with their unhinged spending, inflation is crippling the economy. At a time when people are hurting, Senator Tim Scott has stepped up to help by introducing a check on the reckless policies of the left. Senator Scott’s inflationary spending legislation will work to curb the socialists democrats as they continue to try to spend us into unsustainable debt.” – Matt Schlapp, chairman of CPAC “Americans are hurting as prices rise on everything from gas to groceries. As the result of decades of out-of-control spending, inflation is wreaking havoc on hardworking Americans nationwide. Unfortunately, many in Washington have yet to receive the message that their irresponsible spending habits have devastating consequences. – Adam Brandon, president of FreedomWorks Full text of the legislation can be found HERE. ###"

Think about this: We started this last year off — this administration — with a $1.9 trillion supposed ‘COVID spending’ with only 1 percent for vaccines and less than 10 percent for COVID-related health. In other words, they spent $1.7 trillion overheating this economy, leading to inflation that feels like a tax increase and is a pay cut. Those are the results of this administration’s mishandling of the economy and the COVID challenges.”On President Biden Stoking Division … “Bottom line is this: We had an opportunity to handle this crisis at the beginning in 2021 under this administration. Remember President Biden came into office promising us a unified country, but looking at what he’s doing with voting, he’s trying to divide our country. He said he would handle the COVID relief [and] things would get better, not worse, [but there have been] more deaths in 2021 than 2020. Here’s what we understand as the American people: We’re losing confidence in what he says because what he wants us to do is deny what we see and believe what he says.”On President Biden’s Disingenuous Election Reform Speech … “The importance of the civil rights movement can never be overstated. … [A]s a southerner, I’m offended — I’m insulted — that [President Biden] refuses to recognize the tremendous progress made by Americans — not by Republicans or Democrats, not by Black folks or white folks, [but] by Americans coming together to fight for the rights of every single man [and] woman to vote. … We fought too hard [and] too long for the progress that he is denying.”###"

Scott and Rep. Timmons. “In short, we feel that these actions being proposed by the CFPB are misguided and ill-informed, especially considering the challenges that farmers are currently facing due to rising inflation, prolonged supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages. We strongly urge you to change course.” “At a time when the federal government seems to be doing everything it can to make farmers’ jobs more difficult—we believe this unnecessary regulatory expansion is ill-timed and hurtful,” they continued.Click here or read the full letter below.The Honorable Rohit ChopraDirector, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau1700 G Street, NWWashington, DC 20552Director Chopra, We write to you regarding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) proposed rule entitled “Small Business Lending Data Collection Under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B)”. This proposal, as you know, would amend Regulation B to implement an amendment to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act made by section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Act.While we are extremely concerned with the burden that this proposed rule would have on small businesses and small community banks in South Carolina and across the United States, it has been brought to our attention that the proposed rule would have an outsized effect on Farm Credit institutions and the farmers that they serve. We feel that the CFPB has failed to take the appropriate steps to engage with these institutions on this proposed rule, and by doing so, we believe that the Bureau has fashioned a rule that would hurt not only these lending institutions, but American farmers themselves. In short, we feel that these actions being proposed by the CFPB are misguided and ill-informed, especially considering the challenges that farmers are currently facing due to rising inflation, prolonged supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages. We strongly urge you to change course.As written, the proposed rule would cover a greater proportion of Farm Credit lenders than any other category of lenders. In fact, while the rule states that it would impact 40% of all depository institutions, it would simultaneously impact 100% of farm credit lenders. This has to do with theproposal’s definitions of “small business” and “business credit” that do not take into account the inherent differences between American farms and other American businesses. If the CFPB had actively worked to hear the concerns of the lenders they regulate, this type of oversight would not have happened.The data requirements under the proposed rule impose a significant burden on smaller community banks and other small lending institutions in particular, and this burden would ultimately trickle down to their clients across all industries. In the case of Farm Credit institutions and smaller banks that make farm loans, those clients are farmers and ranchers. At a time when the federal government seems to be doing everything it can to make farmers’ jobs more difficult—we believe this unnecessary regulatory expansion is ill-timed and hurtful.Given the Bureau’s cursory attempt to collect public comments on this proposed rule, we are both concerned that you do not intend to honestly take any outside input into account. After all, a number of stakeholders have asked for more time to publicly comment, but those requests have been ignored. We sincerely hope to be proven wrong, and again, we urge you not to take any action without a thorough data collection process and careful consideration of input from—and the resulting impact on—all lenders and their clients./s/ ###"

About 10 percent of the money for education on the local level comes from Washington, D.C., but 90 percent of the strings also come from D.C. We should probably equalize that a little bit. We need to cut some of the red tape so those 50 laboratories of democracy actually work for the kids. We need a system designed for kids in local areas, not for adults in Washington, D.C.”On his message for young people heading into the new year … “… I’d tell them three things — it’s one of the messages I love to share. … Number one, I’d say that America is the story of redemption. We need to remember to fail forward because, in life, you’re going to have hard times — you’re going to have struggles — but fail forward. Don’t fail backward, but fail forward. That means that we don’t count the number of times you get knocked down. In America, we count the number of times you get up.“Number two, America is the story of sacrifice. In other words, if you want to stand out in life, stand up for those who can’t stand for themselves. That’s why our nation is such an exceptional place to live — because we find people going the extra mile for each other every single day.“And finally, hold on to your dreams. The American Dream is within our grasp. There’s an old scripture that says that we are able, through God, to do exceedingly, abundantly above all that we ask or imagine. That’s good news. Our kids need to see the best of who we are, and that gives us a chance to live that dream.”On his goals for 2022 … “Well, you know, 2022 is about making continuous improvement. … I want to do more homework on how to make America a better place and how to market that. We should not spend more time on the darker angels that [seem] to be overcast over this country. We should be piping hope into every corridor of this country.”###"

""She played an instrumental role in the implementation of rules to alleviate regulatory burdens on community banks and helped guide the industry through pandemic-related economic uncertainty. Her strong and fair leadership will be greatly missed.  ""Over the course of her career, Chairman McWilliams has established an impressive reputation as a good faith negotiator and dealmaker, all while staying true to her core principles. Moreover, throughout her FDIC tenure, she has been a consummate consensus builder. The fact that Biden administration regulators have seemingly failed to conduct board business through the standard procedural channels in an open and honest manner with a regulator as well known for her integrity as Chairman McWilliams speaks volumes. I remain deeply concerned that the flagrant, politically-motivated efforts to appropriate the authorities granted by FDIC bylaws to the agency’s Senate-confirmed chairman represent a dangerous attempt to politicize the independent and historically apolitical practice of federal bank regulation.” ###"

In a letter, the senators cited that the Senate's HELP Committee was unable to report Dr. Weil's nomination favorably when it was considered this year and listed concerns with actions Dr. Weil took while serving as Wage & Hour Administrator during the Obama administration, including implementing job-killing rules, arbitrarily constricting the standard for who is considered an independent contractor, and presiding over a 93% increase in litigation due to an expansion of the ""joint employer"" definition.  ""Small business entrepreneurs in this country deserve a Wage and Hour Division Administrator that will work constructively alongside them,"" the senators wrote. ""The Senate has spoken this year that Dr. Weil is not the right fit for this position. We appreciate your responsiveness to this request, and ask for prompt confirmation that the nomination of Dr. David Weil is formally withdrawn.""   Click here to download or read the full text of the letter below:   Dear Mr. President,  We write to urge you to formally withdraw the nomination of Dr. David Weil, of Massachusetts, to be Administrator of the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor, vice Cheryl Marie Stanton. Dr. Weil’s track record is hostile to employers, unproductive to the employees served by such employers, and the actions he took at the federal level were mired in costly litigation.  The United States Constitution divides the responsibility for populating top positions in the federal government between the President and the United States Senate. The appointments clause (Article II, Section 2) empowers the President to nominate “by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate”. The role of the Senate to give advice and consent is an integral part of the process for populating top officials in our government.  The Senate received Dr. Weil’s nomination on June 8, 2021. The Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) carefully considered the merits of his nomination, actions that included a full committee hearing. The HELP Committee was unable to favorably report Dr. Weil’s nomination to the full Senate during an August 3, 2021 business meeting, lacking the necessary votes to do so. In the nearly five months that followed this failed business meeting, no action was taken by the full Senate to discharge or otherwise consider his nomination. On December 21, 2021, this nomination was formally returned to the White House, as the Senate did not give consent to hold over Dr. Weil’s nomination.  The lack of sufficient support for Dr. Weil's nomination is not surprising considering the actions he took during the Obama administration as Wage & Hour Administrator. Chief among the concerns with his record: promulgation of a job-killing overtime rule in 2016 that overstepped and was therefore struck down by the U.S. District Court; an arbitrarily strict standard for classification of independent contractors in 2015; and a destructive expansion of “joint employer” definition in 2016 that led to a 93 percent increase in litigation. Additionally, both Dr. Weil and the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts have refused to provide all the documents regarding Weil’s actions with the Labor Advisory Board in Massachusetts. Requests to both by the Ranking Member’s staff have been stonewalled and public records requests have been unnecessarily delayed. These are not the actions of an individual committed to transparency and accountability in government service. His nomination has raised sincere concerns on behalf of many of the constituencies we represent.  Small business entrepreneurs in this country deserve a Wage and Hour Division Administrator that will work constructively alongside them. The Senate has spoken this year that Dr. Weil is not the right fit for this position. We appreciate your responsiveness to this request, and ask for prompt confirmation that the nomination of Dr. David Weil is formally withdrawn.### "
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/icymi-scott-talks-dem-spending-2021-highlights-and-2022-agenda,"WASHINGTON – This week, U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) joined Leyla Gulen on Fox24 Charleston. Sen. Scott slammed Democrats' spending, talked legislative highlights of 2021, and laid out his agenda for 2022.Click to watch part one of the interview  On Dem Spending … “Well, if you think about their plan, the Build Back Broker (BBB) as I prefer to call it, frankly that's three trillion dollars of unpaid spending if those programs continue for all 10 years and the likelihood of that is good if they can get it passed. …I hope [what] we'll see over the next several weeks is no passage of the BBB. That is good news for the American people.”“Leyla throughout South Carolina whether you're in Charleston, Union, [or] McCormick South Carolina, the one thing you know is that gas prices have exploded — a 70 percent increase throughout our state. Utilities are up 25 percent if not even more. That is caused by reckless spending from Washington having a negative impact on every single household in the great Palmetto State. We can stop that from exploding again by not spending money we do not have, buying things we simply cannot afford.”Click to watch part two of the interviewOn 2021 Highlights … “Another really impressive issue this year frankly — is our bill that stopped the IRS from being able to peer into our financial accounts. That has been great news frankly — having all 50 Republicans get on that bill in less than 24 hours and then having Joe Manchin and a couple of other Democrats come out and say we can't do that that's just ridiculous.”On His Areas of Focus for 2022 …  “I’m sticking with the less is better agenda. So, we're going to continue to fight against certain provisions in the BBB — things like that childcare component that I talked about earlier. The average family cannot afford an 80 percent increase in the childcare cost. If we can defeat that provision specifically, we will have empowered parents to keep making the choice for their kids. Education opportunity — this is the closest thing to a civil rights issue we'll see in our lifetime. Creating parity for poor parents and poor zip codes is job one for us as a nation on the domestic agenda and something that I’ll continue to fight for. Then, continuing to eliminate inflation as well as [preventing] the IRS [from having] more purview into your accounts. Then, if I had to put icing on the cake, I would simply say to take away the disadvantages in the Build Back Broker plan against states like South Carolina.”###"

The senators are also requesting that federal financial regulators monitor how inflation and inflationary-related pressures are affecting the agriculture industry and, in turn, the community financial institutions that serve it.“The destructive impact of inflation has already affected individuals, families, and businesses across the nation, and no one is immune from these price increases,” the senators wrote. “Caused in large part by an unprecedented increase in federal government spending, in addition to supply chain bottlenecks, these higher prices are not just increasing grocery bills and home heating costs, but they are also raising costs on businesses, including on our nation’s farmers and ranchers.”The letter was also signed by Senators John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), John Kennedy (R-La.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.).Senator Scott is committed to investigating and pushing back against any actions taken by the administration that contribute to inflation, which takes its greatest toll on low-income Americans.Read the full letter here.###"
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-finance-republicans-demand-treasury-analysis-of-oecd-agreement,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.), along with Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and all other Senate Finance Committee Republicans, wrote to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen renewing requests for information regarding international tax negotiations. To date, the Department of the Treasury (USDT) has been unwilling or unable to fully engage with Congress to provide details on the negotiations, which will have a significant impact on American workers, businesses and revenue.The senators raise concerns with how the negotiations may negatively impact U.S. competitiveness; the commitment from the United States to increase its global minimum tax before any other country; and suggestions that USDT could implement the agreement without the advice and consent of the Senate, bypassing the treaty process.“The Administration’s rush to reach a political agreement, tied to its domestic spending plans and pursuit of revenue, has come at the expense of thorough analysis and meaningful engagement with Congress and the business community, and may ultimately put U.S. businesses at risk. . . . Given this agreement’s potential to jeopardize U.S. competitiveness, we continue to have concerns with the lack of detail underlying the approach being proposed under Pillar One and its lack of foundation in any discernible tax principles,” the senators wrote.“Further troubling is Treasury’s continued insistence that the United States once again move first by significantly increasing the U.S. global minimum tax. . . . As Pillar Two does not require other countries to adopt a global minimum tax, we are not confident that our biggest foreign competitors, like China, will enact and implement a global minimum tax on the same terms or on the timeline agreed to at the OECD. …“Finally, suggestions that the United States could fully implement Pillar One without the advice and consent of two-thirds of the Senate through the treaty process are highly problematic. . . . [A]ny suggestion that Pillar One can be implemented absent treaty ratification is a dramatic shift from past precedent and calls into question the binding nature of any such agreement, thereby threatening the very tax certainty that many of our companies, and this Administration, claim to seek under Pillar One.”The senators end the letter with a detailed list of questions regarding the proposals, reiterating that any opportunity for a bipartisan outcome will require greater transparency and engagement from USDT.Signing the letter along with Senator Scott and Ranking Member Crapo were all other Republican members of the Senate Finance Committee: Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), John Cornyn (R-Texas), John Thune (R-S.D.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Pat Toomey (R-Penn.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), and John Barrasso (R-Wyo.).Full text of the letter can be found here.###"

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).The members agree that the EPA acted outside its congressionally-authorized authority by issuing significantly overreaching rules—namely the Clean Power Plan—to attempt to transform the nation’s power sector through emissions regulations under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act.“If Congress had intended to give the EPA such sweeping authority to transform an entire sector of our economy, Congress would have done so explicitly. An administrative agency like the EPA may decide issues of such vast economic and political significance only when the agency can point to 'clear congressional authorization.'“Decisions regarding greenhouse gas emissions and the power sector are major policy questions with vast economic and political significance. Only elected members of Congress, representing the will of the people, may decide these questions. The EPA’s attempt to issue expansive regulations cannot stand in the absence of clear congressional authorization.“Congress knows how to address greenhouse gas emissions. In recent years, Congress has decided to pass transformative laws that incentivize reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from a wide range of industries, including the electric power sector,” the brief states. Senate cosigners of the brief include Senators Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Rick Scott (R-Fla.).House cosigners of the brief include Representatives Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Steve Scalise (R-La.), Fred Upton (R-Mich.), Michael C.

https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/senator-scott-banking-republicans-call-on-president-biden-to-rebuke-fdic-coup-attempt,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and fellow Senate Banking Committee Republicans are calling on President Joe Biden to rebuke Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Director Rohit Chopra and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Director Marty Gruenberg for their illegitimate attempt to violate the FDIC’s 88-year tradition of working independent from partisan political influence. In a letter, the senators also urged President Biden to immediately replace Director Gruenberg—whose term expired three years ago and is serving in a temporary capacity—and nominate an individual to fill the vacant Republican seat on the FDIC board.“As a public servant who spent nearly four decades serving in the U.S. Senate, we believe you understand and hold deep respect for historical precedent, institutional norms, and courteous treatment of your colleagues—even in the face of political disagreement,” the senators wrote. “America’s independent financial regulators are respected the world over for their professionalism and integrity, and we fear the actions of Director Chopra and Director Gruenberg, if left unchecked have the potential to weaken faith in our financial institutions and markets.” On December 9, CFPB Director Chopra and FDIC Director Gruenberg published a joint statement to the CFPB’s website claiming the FDIC approved a request for information (RFI) on bank mergers. Shortly thereafter, the FDICclarified that no such document had been approved by the FDIC and that there was no valid vote by the FDIC board. “Director Chopra and Director Gruenberg’s statement and actions make clear that they violated FDIC procedures with the apparent goal of usurping the powers of the chairman and inhibiting her ability to carry out her official duties and responsibilities,” the senators continued. “In addition to violating the FDIC bylaws and processes, their actions upended an 88-year tradition of the FDIC board working on a collegial basis with its chairman as well as working independent from partisan political influence.” As the senators point out, Director Gruenberg is going on nearly two decades as an FDIC board member, but is currently serving in a temporary role because his term expired three years ago. Despite the fact that his position requires Senate confirmation, he has continued to serve on the FDIC board long after the expiration of his term in order to undermine its Senate-confirmed leader.“We urge you to nominate promptly a candidate to replace Director Gruenberg, as well as a candidate to fill the vacant Vice-Chairman position on the FDIC board. These candidates should be well-qualified, mainstream individuals who will respect the institutional norms and practices that Director Chopra and Director Gruenberg have willfully chosen to ignore.” To read the senators’ full letter to President Biden, click here. BACKGROUND###"
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/senators-scott-and-hassan-introduce-bill-to-expand-educator-tax-deduction,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) introduced a bill to extend the educator Expense Tax Deduction to K-12 athletic coaches and administrators. This bill will amend the tax code to allow K-12 coaches to be classified as ""eligible educators"" in order to be eligible for tax deductions for out-of-pocket expenses relating to instructional expenses. “Coaches and athletic administrators are often integral to the success of students both in and out of the classroom,” said Senator Tim Scott. “It is only right that we expand the tax code to ensure that they receive the same benefits as they continue to personally invest in the future of students across America."" “Athletic directors and coaches across New Hampshire play an important role in setting students up for success, including by fostering health and wellness and helping student-athletes get on the road to college,” Senator Hassan said. “It is nonsensical that coaches are left out of getting tax cuts to help cover out-of-pocket costs for supplies when all other teachers have that option. I am glad to introduce this bill with Senator Scott that would include athletic directors and coaches in the group of educators who can get certain out-of-pocket expenses covered, and I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation.“Several organizations have expressed support for this bill including Nike, Inc, adidas America, Inc, Sports and Fitness Industry Association, and the National Interscholastic Athletic Administrators Association (NIAAA).“We thank Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) and Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH) for this bill that directly offers a positive benefit to interscholastic athletic administrators,” said NIAAA Executive Director Dr. Mike Blackburn. “Just as the original 1986 IRS code allows deductions for out-of-pocket educator costs, this bill offers the same financial option to those in the profession of high school and middle school athletic administration and coaching. We appreciate our supportive members of the U. S. Congress, as well as our advocates, and NIAAA Board of Directors.” “Interscholastic athletics is an integral component of the education system. First and foremost, we are thankful for the actions of Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) and Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH) for recognizing interscholastic athletic administrators and interscholastic athletic coaches as educators. The financial options of the tax bill is a welcomed addition and is very much appreciated,”said NIAAA President Dr. Lisa L. Langston. BACKGROUND###"
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/senator-scott-representative-norman-lead-effort-to-protect-faith-based-child-welfare-providers,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Representative Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) led a bicameral letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra, condemning HHS’s recent reversal of protections for faith-based adoption and foster care agencies. “For decades, faith-based child welfare agencies have provided safe and loving homes for our nation’s children,” said Senator Scott. “Rather than celebrating that work, Secretary Becerra and President Biden’s recent steps will force many providers to choose between abandoning their religious beliefs or closing their doors. This is not only an attack on religious liberty—it’s also a disservice to the 400,000 children who depend on the work of these providers.”“Faith-based child welfare agencies are doing incredible work throughout our nation and here in South Carolina, and it is unconscionable that government bureaucrats would seek to roadblock their efforts. By withdrawing non-discrimination waivers and cutting out the Office for Civil Rights’ authority to review religious freedom complaints, this appears to be a deliberate attempt by this Administration to devalue religious liberties, making them a mere footstool to elevate their far-left agenda. On behalf of countless faith-based agencies and the families they serve, I want to know exactly how HHS and Secretary Becerra have reached these alarming decisions, and what the Secretary intends to do to reaffirm and protect religious freedoms,” said Representative Norman.“We find it disturbing that one day before it released its 2021 AFCARS report, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)—with your express approval— announced the rescission of waivers that were previously granted to faith-based adoption and foster care agencies in Michigan, Texas, and South Carolina,"" the members of Congress wrote in their letter. “As you know, rescinding the waivers puts providers in these states in the untenable position of choosing between serving children under the Title IV-E foster care program or operating in accordance with the tenets of their faith – the same faith that drives them to serve children in the first place. HHS should be welcoming child welfare providers, not excluding them. Children are too important to be pawns in political games.”BACKGROUND:On November 18, HHS announced it was rescinding waivers previously issued to faith-based adoption and foster care agencies in South Carolina, Michigan, and Texas that allowed them to qualify for HHS grants while operating in accordance with their deeply-held religious beliefs. Additionally, the HHS announced it was moving to strip the Office for Civil Rights of its authority to enforce the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act and the religion clauses of the First Amendment.Senator Scott and Representative Norman’s letter articulates that:Cosigners on the letter are Senators John Cornyn (R-Texas), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), John Boozman (R-Ark.),  Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), James E.

It’s simply an American issue.Imagine, if you will, households across the country and specifically those households in South Carolina—[like the one] I grew up in when I was a kid. Single-parent [households are] waking up to the sense of desperation because your gas prices are up nearly 75 percent, so instead of spending less than $2 a gallon in 2020, you’re now spending over $3.30 a gallon in 2021.Imagine, if you will, turning your heat up or, likely, turning your heat down to conserve money because your utilities are up 25 percent. And then you wake up to the BBB—as I call it, the “Build Back Broker” plan—and you realize that the bone-crushing, life-changing, hope-stealing, job-killing aspects of the BBB include increasing your child care costs, as Senator Burr said, by $13,000.To understand the actual impact of the $13,000, you have to first understand that the current cost is over $15,000. So, said in a way that everybody in our nation can understand, with median income around $34,000, you take taxes out, [and] the cost of child care is now more than your take-home pay. Literally, providing child care for one kid is more than the take-home pay of the average income in our nation.And somehow, we are to celebrate this notion that the government is here to do something for you, when in fact, you know the government is taking something from you. And what are they taking? Your hope, your future, your plans. And so, while we may think of this as an exercise of political philosophy [or] one side versus the other … this is literally an attempt to fundamentally transform what it means to take care of your child in the place you want to send your child, by eliminating options, increasing the cost, and stealing the hope from far too many families who deserve better from their government.###"

Finally, Chairman Powell is speaking the truth, which is [that] this is unprecedented. The last time inflation was this high, I had an afro. That is a long time ago. That’s early 1980s.“The truth is that we have to find a way to forge forward by reducing spending from the federal government and allowing raises to increase in the private sector. That means that we have to pull back on this ‘Build Back Broker’ plan that the Democrats are still trying to weave together.”On inflation’s effect on service members … “[In South Carolina] we actually make marines at Parris Island; we train the army folks at Fort Jackson. So if you think about [a service member] who may even be eligible for public assistance because they get paid so little—[working] paycheck-to-paycheck—they drive up to the gas station and now gas is up almost 75 percent. … Can you imagine someone who’s serving our nation … and they simply cannot put gas in their cars while they defend our nation?On the path forward … “Median income in this country is around $35,000 a year. When you think about what this inflationary impact is on folks living paycheck-to-paycheck, it means that you have to choose between sometimes your health care, sometimes your energy, and sometimes the utilities in your house. … We can change that by [stopping reckless spending] in Washington and [allowing] the American people to catch up. That means putting more focus on an incentive-based economy where we let the private sector do what they do really well and getting the government out of the way.”###"

https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/senator-scott-questions-fda-nominee-on-the-future-of-mrna-and-crispr-technologies,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) questioned Dr. Robert Califf, President Biden’s nominee for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner, on the future of mRNA and CRISPR technologies and their potential to treat and cure rare diseases like Sickle Cell Anemia.Click to watch the senator’s questionsA full transcript is below.Senator Scott: Thank you, Dr. Califf, for spending some time with us today and talking about some really important issues that we could all spend a day talking about. I only have five minutes, [which is] good news for you.My first question is: You’re coming into a very important position in the midst of, really, headwinds in the public health space. And I appreciate the enormity of your responsibilities if you are confirmed to lead the FDA. How do you view the FDA’s role in granting Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the new, as well as repurposed, products to address the COVID-19 pandemic? Should the FDA use a wider latitude to ensure multiple avenues—for instance drugs like budesonide, as well as COVID-19 testing kids—making sure that they’re available to combat the pandemic?Dr. Califf: Thanks senator, it’s good to be here with a fellow South Carolinian. … You’re well aware, and it was during my tenure that the EUA guidance was written that the potential benefits need to be weighed against the potential risks. That’s the authority the FDA is given.So there’s a lot of latitude on the types of things that you mentioned, yet I would still point out we need to have enough evidence that we can make a fair assessment of what the potential is, and we need a system in this country, as I’ve emphasized over and over, that produces the evidence more quickly because under that framework, it’s possible you could get it wrong. It’s different if you’ve actually measured the benefits and risks and then you’re confident about it. And so it’s finding that right balance that’s really in play for the FDA.Senator Scott: No doubt. I would suggest that, based on the severity of the challenge in the public space, that taking the appropriate calculated risk seems to be necessary nowadays more than it has been in the past, and I think we can do that in a way that involves coming to good decisions consistently.On the long view of public health, I am excited about the role that the mRNA played in bringing the vaccine to the forefront and saving millions of lives. What’s the future of that technology for future needs in the vaccine arena, number one?Number two, I think about the 7,000 rare blood diseases that have very few therapies, [or] treatments of any sort. And I focus a little bit more on CRISPR technologies for things like Sickle Cell Anemia and that path going forward. Do you see: A) more application for CRISPR in the rare blood disease space? And B) on the future forefront of the mRNAs and vaccines, is that future as bright as it appears it could be with the use of these technologies?Dr. Califf: This is one of the things, senator, where the excitement of being part of this is what keeps me going and coming back. I mean, I’m old enough to remember when the Human Genome Project was just being developed, and now we have the code for the genome, and what you’re describing are the downstream consequences of that with reading the code and producing proteins and other substances that determine whether we’re sick or healthy. And there are a whole array of technologies, you know, specifically for mRNA. I think, as a platform for vaccines, this is something that we’ve only dreamed about, but it’s a reality now. And you know, this took a collaboration of FDA scientists and, of course, academia and the private sector all working towards a common goal over decades.You also mentioned CRISPR, and the ability to change the fundamental genome is an amazing possibility but also has significant risks. And so, like everything else, we’ve got to come up with the ideas, try them out, and measure things and see what really works, but almost nothing could be more exciting than curing a rare genetic disease with a gene substitution, perhaps for life. And I think, for people with Sickle Cell Disease, I’ve done a lot of work … I think this is something that’s really needed, and it ties in. You know, chronic treatment for Sickle Cell Disease is not going so well in this country because many of the patients live off the beaten path of the big high-tech centers, and we’ve got to get treatments that are more effective.Senator Scott: I think we should at least take a second and thank Dr. Francis Collins for his work on the project that really has produced amazing results for our nation and, frankly, for the world. I know he’s retiring or just retired. His work has been amazing for all of mankind, number one. Number two, I would suggest that, as we look into that future, the ethical issues around the new technologies like CRISPR will continue to pop up around the world. I know that China has had some challenges already with the use of CRISPR, and so what becomes a solution also becomes a problem. That’s called reality, and hopefully we will wrestle with those ethical issues in the public forum sometime in the very near future.###"

The bill is designed to prevent Democrats from turning the Small Business Administration (SBA) into a direct lender, as they are attempting to do in their tax-and-spend reconciliation bill.“Forcing community banks and local credit unions to compete with a massive government agency is inefficient and wrong,” said Senator Tim Scott.“Funneling tax dollars through the federal government in order to loan it back to small business owners with interest makes no sense. This is just another example of Democrats’ misguided plan for a big government takeover of virtually every aspect of American life and private institutions.”“Fraud and inefficiency characterize the Small Business Administration’s history in direct lending,"" said Senator Kennedy. ""The government shouldn’t encroach on a space where private lenders are already doing a good job getting funds to the small businesses that need them. I’m proud to partner with Sen. Scott to stop the SBA from replacing community and other private lenders with bureaucrats.""The bill is co-sponsored by Senators Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Pat Toomey (R-Penn.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Steve Daines (R- Mont.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), and Rick Scott (R-Fla.).BACKGROUND###"
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/senate-passes-scott-booker-resolution-raising-sickle-cell-awareness,"WASHINGTON – This week, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed U.S. Senators Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Cory Booker’s (D-N.J.) resolution designating September as Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) Awareness Month.“Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited blood disorder in the U.S., affecting one in every 365 Black Americans,” said Senator Scott. “Yet despite the prevalence of SCD, research and treatments remain far too limited. With this resolution, we commit to raising awareness and seeking out legislation that will help our medical community fight—and one day, cure—this painful disease.”“Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited blood disorder in our country, and yet research, treatment, and awareness efforts for the disease still lag far behind other chronic illnesses,” said Senator Booker. “More work and research remains to be done, and we must continue to raise awareness of sickle cell disease and ensure that communities that are largely affected by this condition have equitable access to care and treatments that help improve their health. I am proud to lead the Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month resolution with Senator Scott and I will continue to champion federal initiatives to raise awareness, improve access to care, and help find a cure for this disease.”Senator Scott’s sickle cell legislation, the Sickle Cell Disease and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment Act, was signed into law in 2018, and the senator continues to advocate for the sickle cell community today.The resolution was cosponsored by Senators Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Todd Young (R-Ind.)

The decision to hold this illegitimate vote has upended the FDIC’s decades-long commitment to respect and collegiality between board members, regardless of political affiliation, to instead pursue an egregious and possibly illegal political power grab.”###"

If successful, President Biden’s DOJ could pay out hundreds of millions of dollars to illegal immigrants while hardworking American taxpayers are struggling under Democrat’s reckless tax-and-spend policies. “With far more than a million illegal crossings this year alone, there is a clear humanitarian and national security disaster at our border,” said Senator Scott. “Yet—even as hardworking Americans struggle to buy gas and groceries in the face of roaring inflation—Democrats want to give nearly half-a-million dollars to individuals who broke our nation’s laws. This is wrong not only for Americans, but also for the migrants who don’t need another incentive to cross our border illegally and put their families in harm’s way.” “Our southern border is a disaster, and President Biden’s failed policies have continued to fuel this ongoing crisis,” said Senator Tillis. “We are seeing the most illegal immigration this year alone than ever recorded, and now President Biden wants to give illegal immigrants a payout, further rewarding lawlessness and chaos. These $450,000 settlements are an insult to all hardworking Americans who will subsequently be funding these large settlements with their hard-earned tax dollars. I am proud to work with my colleagues to make sure this doesn’t happen.”“While American families are struggling anxiously just to keep pace with President Biden’s inflation, the President now wants to make millionaires out of people who crossed the border illegally. It’s beyond parody,” said Leader McConnell. “Obviously, this would only exacerbate the Democrats’ border crisis and incentivize the riskiest and most dangerous kinds of illegal immigration.”Senators Scott and Tillis were joined by Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), James Risch (R-Idaho), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Josh Hawley (R- Mo.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Steve Daines (R- Mont.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), and Mitt Romney (R-Utah).Read the full bill text here."

In his remarks, Senator Scott highlighted the mandate’s harmful effects on public safety. Click to watch Senator Scott’s remarksRemarks as delivered: “I won’t repeat what my friends and colleagues have said up here already, but I do want to focus on the importance of the mandate’s impact on public safety.“Having grown up in South Carolina in North Charleston, I see cities throughout South Carolina and around the country, frankly—New York City being, perhaps, the poster child of bad decisions, especially as it relates to this mandate and the oppressive decision that [Mayor De Blasio] has made, and the negative impact it will have on public safety is without question. [It’s] one of the most alarming aspects of this mandate and one of the reasons why I look forward to the passage of this [Congressional Review Act].“Importantly, I think about the firefighters who are no longer working on their jobs, think about the EMS drivers [and] the EMTs who are no longer able to save lives, think about the law enforcement officers—the police officers in my hometown and throughout this nation—who are no longer on the job.“The negative impact on public safety in a year where violent crime is hitting highs … it’s a devastating impact in places like the one that I grew up in, where the last thing you want is fewer officers patrolling the streets in the neighborhoods. The thing you want the most is the presence of law enforcement in those neighborhoods. And we see that’s not … possible as city after city across this nation sees the loss of more and more officers, sees the loss of more and more firefighters, sees the loss of more and more EMTs because of this mandate.“The negative impact will be felt in the loss of lives because of the lack of individuals responding to emergencies in communities all across this country, not responding because the government gets in the way.”###"
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/senator-scott-delivers-message-on-one-year-anniversary-of-the-pandemic-,"WASHINGTON – Today, one year after the United States went under lockdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus, Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) released a statement on the challenges we’ve endured, the progress our nation has made, and the light he sees at the end of the tunnel. “About a year ago, our nation and the world was devastated by COVID-19,” said Senator Scott. “Five hundred and twenty thousand Americans have lost their lives, and our nation will forever mourn that loss. But while there is still work to do, there is also good news on the horizon: we went to work on behalf of the American people, and I am thankful to say the seeds we sowed in 2020, like the Payment Protection Program and broadband efforts, are now coming to fruition in 2021.” Senator Scott has worked in four important ways over the last 12 months to help the people of South Carolina through the pandemic: 1) Protecting public health: As a member of the Senate health committee, Senator Scott helped draft the three 2020 pandemic response bills. He also worked to provide increased resources for vaccines, personal protective equipment, telehealth services, and more. 2) Supporting jobs and the economy: As a member of the Senate tax and small business committees, Senator Scott helped craft the Payment Protection Program (PPP) to support small businesses and workers. He worked with the Treasury Department to ensure Opportunity Zones survived through the crisis, and he supported both rounds of the 2020 stimulus checks. 3) Keeping our children healthy and educated: Senator Scott has led the fight to protect our students mentally and intellectually by re-opening schools. He also helped secure funding for HBCUs and other struggling schools across the country, and he advocated for increased broadband—working to close the digital divide that has made it harder for many students to learn remotely. 4) Protecting the vulnerable: Senator Scott worked to increase support for charitable giving, ensure non-profits were eligible for PPP loans, and increase funding and authority for emergency feeding programs. ###"
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/senator-scott-colleagues-lead-push-to-incentivize-charitable-giving-,"WASHINGTON – Senators Tim Scott (R-S.C.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), and Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-Nev.) introduced the bipartisan Universal Giving Pandemic Response and Recovery Act to expand and extend the current deduction for charitable giving. The bill would ensure that Americans who donate to charities, houses of worship, religious organizations, and other nonprofits are able to deduct that donation from their federal taxes at a higher level than the current $300 deduction.“Nonprofits, charities, and houses of worship all across South Carolina and the nation have filled the void that many communities developed during the pandemic,” said Senator Scott. “They have been the hands and feet of their neighborhoods, going into places that need aid the most. I am proud to introduce the bipartisan Universal Giving Pandemic and Recovery Act to ensure those who have helped these organizations give back are not taxed on their generosity.” Senator Scott has been fighting on behalf of charitable organizations throughout the pandemic. In previous tax and COVID relief packages, he secured provisions to extend and increase charitable giving deductions and ensure nonprofits and houses of worship are eligible for loans through the Payment Protection Program.Specifically, the bill would make available to taxpayers who do not itemize on their tax returns—for tax years 2021 and 2022—a below-the-line deduction for charitable giving on federal income taxes valued at up to one-third of the standard deduction (around $4,000 for an individual filer and $8,000 for married joint filers).The Universal Giving Pandemic Response and Recovery Act is supported by several nonprofits including Together SC, National Council of Nonprofits, Charitable Giving Coalition, The Philanthropy Roundtable, Faith and Giving Coalition, United Way Worldwide, National Philanthropic Trust, Association of Art Museum Directors, The Nonprofit Alliance, Council for Advancement and Support of Education, Alliance for Strong Families and Communities, American Red Cross, National Association of Evangelicals, Philanthropy Southwest, Council on Foundations, Independent Sector.Madeleine McGee, President and CEO of Together SC said, “The pandemic and economic slowdown dual crises have tested the resilience of South Carolina nonprofit like nothing any of us has experienced in our lifetimes. For most nonprofits in our state, demand for services has and costs have risen, yet revenues have fallen drastically to unsustainable levels. When the results of a Together SC survey of 4,000 nonprofits become available next week, we’ll know exactly how challenging the past year has been and what the future looks like. We already know, however, that the Universal Giving Pandemic Response and Recovery Act, introduced today by Senator Tim Scott and others, goes directly to the problem of declining revenues and will be a welcome tool to encourage additional giving by our state’s generous donors. Together SC, the statewide association of nonprofits, enthusiastically endorses this legislation and thanks Senator Scott for his ongoing support for the nonprofits that help make our state great.”“Throughout the pandemic, all Americans have watched charitable nonprofits repeatedly rise to meet their communities’ challenges by providing support and relief to the people who need it most. We are proud to endorse the Universal Giving Pandemic Response and Recovery Act because it will enable all Americans to support the vital work of charitable organizations in helping their neighbors and communities as our nation recovers,” said Tim Delaney, President and CEO, National Council of Nonprofits.“Incentivizing all taxpayers to give to charity – regardless of their income or whether they itemize – ensures that nonprofits doing critical work in our communities will receive the resources necessary to help as many Americans as possible. The bipartisan and bicameral introduction of the Universal Giving Pandemic Response and Recovery Act signals Congress’ recognition of the importance of expanding the universal charitable deduction and therefore driving more donations to organizations when they need it most. The Charitable Giving Coalition applauds Senator Scott and his colleagues for their leadership on the issue, and we look forward to working with Congress to enhance charitable giving,” said Brian Flahaven, chair of the Charitable Giving Coalition.“The Philanthropy Roundtable supports the Universal Giving Pandemic Response and Recovery Act. In a time of national crisis, charitable organizations are facing increased needs and fundraising challenges,” said Elise Westhoff, CEO of The Philanthropy Roundtable. “This bill would encourage all Americans, including those who do not itemize on their tax returns to continue stepping forward to support our vibrant charitable sector at this crucial time.” “The Faith & Giving Coalition supports the introduction of the bipartisan Universal Giving Pandemic Response and Recovery Act. We are grateful to Senator Lankford and his colleagues for their continued leadership to ensure that the charitable deduction's benefits and incentives are available to all taxpayers – not just the wealthy. Most important, the Act would stimulate the increased giving that is desperately needed to help hurting individuals and communities across America recover well from the pandemic,” said Brian W. Walsh, Executive Director, Faith & Giving Coalition.“United Way is appreciative of Senator Lankford’s reintroduction of the Universal Giving Pandemic Response and Recovery Act. The health and economic crises which have arisen due to COVID-19 will have far-reaching implications on our communities, and this legislation is a crucial step in enabling charitable organizations to address both the short- and long-term needs of Americans,” said Suzanne McCormick, US President of United Way Worldwide.###"
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-protect-faith-based-foster-care-providers,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) introduced the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act, along with Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), John Kennedy (R-La.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), James Risch (R-Idaho), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.).“In South Carolina and across the country, faith-based foster care providers support the 400,000 children in our foster care system who—through no fault of their own—have nowhere else to go,” said Senator Tim Scott. “At a time when religious freedoms are under assault, the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act is a necessary protection for those who are living according to their convictions. I am grateful my colleagues are standing with me to protect this most fundamental right.”“The government should not make it more difficult for a child in need of a home to find a safe, loving family,” said Dr. Cassidy. “It is wrong and offensive that discrimination against child welfare providers because of their religious beliefs even exists today. Parents who choose to adopt or foster a child should be able to get help from the organization of their choice.”“Our nation is entering into a precarious time when religious liberties can be so easily trampled,” Hyde-Smith said.  “This reasonable legislation would protect child welfare providers, who hold fast to their religious beliefs or moral convictions.  States that choose to discriminate against these workers would in turn be choosing to hurt overall services for all caregivers, children, and families.”  Senator Rick Scott said, “The protection of free speech and religious beliefs is enshrined in the First Amendment. I’m proud to join my colleagues to support religious freedom.”“Adoption is so important to Montana families. We should applaud and protect child welfare service providers with faith-based foundations that place foster children with loving families in Montana and across our country. The government should not discriminate based on religious affiliation to determine which providers can receive federal support,” Daines said.“Adopting a child is one of the greatest decisions a family can make,” Inhofe said. “Faith-based providers working across the nation are finding their services endangered because of their religious beliefs, which in turn means fewer loving homes for children in need. That’s why I am proud to join Sen. Tim Scott’s legislation today which ensures child welfare providers can operate in accordance with their religious beliefs without discrimination. This is a commonsense bill which should be law.”“Religious institutions and faith-based groups have long provided some of the best adoption services in the country,” said Sen. Lee. “This bill will protect their right to keep doing so in accordance with their beliefs, and ensure that children are not unnecessarily prevented from being adopted into loving homes.”Faith based groups provide homes to millions of children in need of love, support and affection. The discrimination against such groups for their religious beliefs must end. We should incentivize, not penalize, religious organizations to continue to serve the most vulnerable children in our communities. – Senator Blackburn“It is unacceptable for the government to make it more difficult for a child to find a safe, stable, and loving family,” said Senator Tillis. “When a family decides to adopt or foster a child, they deserve to get help from the provider of their choice. Faith-based adoption and foster care providers have a history of connecting children with loving homes, and this legislation ensures those providers can continue their child welfare services free of discrimination.”“Faith-based child welfare providers are an essential part of caring for some of the most vulnerable children in our communities. I’m deeply saddened to see some government officials punish foster services for their sincere religious beliefs. That discrimination comes directly at the expense of boys and girls who are waiting for loving, healthy homes. No government agency that discriminates against people based on their faith—which goes against the interests of foster children—deserves taxpayer dollars.” – Sen. John Kennedy“Anyone trying to improve the lives of struggling children should never have to choose between helping kids and violating their personal religious beliefs in order to comply with bureaucratic regulations,” said Senator Cramer. “Our bill ensures child welfare providers can continue to operate and defend themselves properly without the threat of discriminatory government rules hanging over their heads.”U.S. Representative Mike Kelly (R-Penn.) introduced companion legislation in the House.“Several state and local governments are requiring faith-based adoption agencies to choose between helping kids and violating their religious faith,” said Rep. Mike Kelly. “This blatant attack on the First Amendment makes it even harder for children to find loving homes. We must stand up for kids, protect these organizations, and defend religious liberty.  I am proud author this legislation.”Supporting organizations include: Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Heritage Action, Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee, and the Family Research Council.“Far too many children are waiting, right now, either for adoption or foster families. Our government must not stand in the way of those seeking to care for them. It is difficult to imagine a more important goal for child welfare policy than the goal of seeing vulnerable children who need a loving home be united with families committed to caring for them. Protecting the rights of faith-based adoption and foster care agencies only ensures that more children will have access to the love and support they so desperately need. This is precisely what the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act would do.” – Russell Moore, President, Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty CommissionBackground###"

He also highlighted the tremendous progress our country has made, thanks in large part to conservative policies that provide all citizens with equal access to the American Dream.Click here to listen to the full interview.On Democrats’ “COVID relief” bill… “The fact of the matter is a very simple one. Less than 10 percent is targeted and temporary for COVID relief. The other 90 percent is the Democrats’ liberal, progressive policy positions manifesting as a ruse on the American people. It is not a COVID relief package. It is certainly a progressive payment plan that seems to pay everybody… It is hard to digest that we are seeing not a push to the left, but a literal leap to the far left.” Click here to read Senator Scott’s statement on the Democrats’ Partisan Stimulus Package. On school closures… “Think about this: Whether you’re a black kid or a brown kid or a white kid, here’s what’s happening throughout this country. Keeping kids isolated and separated from their friends and their loved ones outside of their home has manifested in a 30% increase in emergency room visits – parents taking their kids for emotional reasons. It has manifested in an unprecedented level of suicides… The learning loss could be permanent for low income, at-risk kids. We are talking about devastating not just today but their tomorrows. Keeping a child out of the classroom is keeping a child from the best future they could have.” Click here to read more about Senator Scott’s fight to reopen schools. On Republican policies… “Pre-pandemic, African American unemployment reached the lowest levels in the history of this country. Hispanic unemployment reached the lowest levels in the history of this country. Women employment reached the highest levels in 70 years. Why? Because under President Trump, we created the most inclusive economy in the history of the country. We saw the bottom make more money faster than the top. Because of the tax reform, we saw single mothers’ taxes get cut by 70% on the federal level. We’re talking about transformational policies. And what do the Democrats sell? They sell a caste system and a socialist paradigm that relegates the poorest Americans to always be at the bottom of the food chain. It’s antithetical to what it means to be an American.” On race and progress in America… “We have to slow down for a second, take out all the hyperbole, and have a serious conversation. America is a good country. I believe in the goodness of America. Here’s the truth: We are not where we want to be; I do thank God that we are not where we used to be. This nation has made more progress in less time than any other nation on God’s green earth. The America that I know, the America that I trust, and the America that gave me a second chance is the America that embraces people who put forth their best effort… Whether you’re a black American, a white American… we all have the same story in many, many ways. It’s the story of trouble and then triumph, a story of obstacles and then opportunities, the story of pain and then prosperity. It is the American story. We always end up standing on our feet.”###"
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-statement-on-democrats-partisan-stimulus-package,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) released the following statement on his vote against the Democrats’ partisan, special-interest filled stimulus package.  “In a made-for-television, twenty-four hour spectacle that left Capitol Hill paralyzed, Democrats rammed through a deeply partisan package that left more questions than answers. Ninety percent of this pork-filled bill is unrelated to the pandemic, less than ten percent of this bill is for COVID health care relief, and only one percent is designated for vaccines. To make matters worse, it creates slush funds to bail out states that mismanage their finances, has no requirements to get children back in the classroom, slows down our already recovering economy, discourages people from re-entering the workforce, and even provides stimulus checks to people in prison today. Simply put, this is not a ‘COVID relief package,’ it is a Trojan Horse for the radical Left’s progressive wish list.”###"

Sen. Scott is leading the movement to reopen schools and highlighting the devastating impact school closures have on our children. He will also support numerous amendments ensuring that our children and families are put first ahead of labor unions. Scott on reopening America’s schools…“Labor unions and their bosses are the reason that many of our nation’s schools are still shuttered, even though science says in-person education is low-risk. The pandemic has created not only a health crisis, but also an education crisis that I fear may permanently affect the future of millions of students, especially those who grew up in poverty like I did. For our children’s sake, schools must be fully reopened for in-person learning.”As Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, Senator Scott will file an amendment to reduce funding for states that have an active investigation into nursing homes for underreported deaths due to the coronavirus. He offered a similar amendment last month, which was rejected by all 50 Senate Democrats who voted against holding these states accountable for misreporting COVID-19 deaths.  Scott on keeping states accountable for underreported nursing home deaths…“Far too many COVID-19 deaths have been left unaccounted for due to the negligence of state and local leaders who have put politics ahead of people. We must shine a light on those who have inaccurately reported deaths to hold them accountable for their devastating decisions. Americans deserve to know the truth, and we will work to ensure justice is being done for the families of those who lost their lives.”Senator Scott will support amendments that combat the Biden-supported, Democrat plan to fundamentally alter the American economy. He will vote against any amendment designed to increase the minimum wage or expand the size and scope of government.  Scott on the progressive economic amendments Democrats are proposing…“Democrats have never let a crisis go to waste, and it’s clear that they are using their ‘COVID relief package’ as a vehicle to fundamentally destroy the American economy. This bill is a Trojan Horse for the radical Left’s takeover of the country. Less than 10 percent of this bill goes to COVID health care relief and only one percent goes to vaccines.

https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/senators-scott-blackburn-introduce-modern-worker-empowerment-act-,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), along with U.S. Representatives Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Michelle Steel (R-Calif.), introduced the Modern Worker Empowerment Act to create certainty, clarity, and consistency for workers, job creators, and entrepreneurs.“It is important now more than ever that we make it easier, not harder, for workers to find jobs that allow flexibility and independence,” said Senator Scott. “This legislation creates clarity and consistency for both workers and job creators in how we define independent contractors. This stability will open avenues to innovation and entrepreneurship for American workers in all 50 states.”“The success of American workers should not be hampered by outdated bureaucratic regulation,” said Senator Blackburn. “Laws defining employment ought to be up to date so that they adequately serve today’s creators and businesses in a way that enables them to live out the American Dream.”“I am proud to introduce this commonsense solution to lift a needless burden off the shoulders of America’s workers and aspiring entrepreneurs,” said Congresswoman Stefanik. “The laws of our land should be as straightforward as possible to allow for innovation, encourage entrepreneurship, and help people across the country achieve their unique American dream.”“Through AB 5, California made it harder for independent contractors and entrepreneurs to work—especially during the pandemic—and we need to make sure this doesn't happen on the federal level,” said Congresswoman Steel. “There are more than 2 million independent contractors and entrepreneurs working across California, and now more than ever we should be supporting our workforce. This legislation would empower employees and job creators, ensuring they are more protected under federal law. I’m proud to support our workforce through this legislation.”Background:Support for the MWEA: Allstate, American Bakers Association, American Society of Travel Advisors, American Trucking Associations, Americans for Tax Reform, Competitive Enterprise Institute, Customized Logistics and Delivery Association, Direct Selling Association, Financial Services Institute, Forest Resources Association, Freedom Foundation, Heritage Action for America, Independent Bakers Association, Insights Association, International Franchise Association, MBO Partners, MSPA Americas, National Association of Home Builders, NetChoice, NFIB, Open Competition Center, Private Care Association, Rio Grande Foundation, Small Business & Entrepreneurship CouncilFull text of the bill is available here.###"

https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-schatz-shaheen-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-increase-access-to-telehealth-in-the-midst-of-the-pandemic,"WASHINGTON— Today, Senators Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Brian Schatz (D-HI), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) reintroduced the bipartisan Telehealth Modernization Act that would update coverage restrictions that have long prevented life-saving telehealth services for many of the nation’s roughly 61 million Medicare beneficiaries. They are joined by Senators Blackburn (R-TN), Marshall (R-KS), Tester (D-MT), and Wicker (R-MS).""As Ranking Member on the Senate Aging Committee, I know how important telehealth is to our nation’s seniors. Telehealth has been a godsend for millions of Americans receiving health care services during the pandemic, while ensuring the spread of the virus stays at a minimum,"" said Senator Scott. ""Updating our laws to solve today’s challenges through commonsense and practical approaches will ensure more access to health care and a safer aging population.""""Telehealth has been a critical lifeline for millions of patients who need care during this pandemic. Now we need to make sure that the emergency expansions of telehealth coverage for Medicare beneficiaries are made permanent,"" said Senator Schatz. ""This new bill works hand in hand with the CONNECT for Health Act by removing unnecessary barriers in Medicare and making it easier to keep using telehealth moving forward.""While these Medicare access gaps predated the pandemic, the spread of COVID-19 highlighted the urgency of updating telehealth coverage rules, prompting Congress to provide authority for temporary emergency waivers designed to ensure safe access to care for seniors and other vulnerable populations. As the pandemic raged, Medicare beneficiaries turned to telehealth services to minimize exposure risk and receive medically necessary care in safe and accessible settings. In April 2020, more than two-fifths (43.5%) of Medicare FFS primary care visits were provided through telehealth, and from mid-March through early July of that year, more than 10.1 million beneficiaries accessed telehealth services. Without further congressional action, however, these emergency flexibilities will expire at the end of the public health emergency, creating chaos for tens of millions of Medicare beneficiaries, including many who have come to rely on telehealth for critically needed care. Our nation’s seniors deserve better. The Telehealth Modernization Act would help to support their needs through necessary updates to coverage policies. The Telehealth Modernization Act makes permanent two changes:  • Ensures that patients can access telehealth anywhere by permanently removing Medicare’s so-called ""geographic and originating site"" restrictions, which required both that the patient live in a rural area and use telehealth at a doctor’s office or certain other clinical sites. • Protects access to telehealth for patients in rural areas.And gives the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services new authority to do these three things: • Help patients continue to access telehealth from physical therapists, speech language pathologists, and other health care providers.  • Help give Medicare recipients many more telehealth services. • Help Medicare hospice and home dialysis patients use telehealth to keep receiving necessary care.Supporting Organizations: ACT | The App Association, Alliance for Aging Research, Alliance for Connected Care, American Academy of Neurology, American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, American Clinical Neurophysiology Society, American Heart Association, American Medical Association, American Nurses Association, American Telemedicine Association, American Urological Association, College of Healthcare Information Management Executives, Connected Health Initiative, eHealth Initiative, Endocrine Society, Health Innovation Alliance, HIMSS, Infectious Diseases Society of America, Medical University of South Carolina, National Association of ACOs, National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, National Organization for Rare Disorders, Palmetto Care Connections, Personal Connected Health Alliance, Prisma Health, Society of General Internal Medicine, South Carolina Hospital Association###"
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/icymi-senator-scott-out-front-on-fight-to-reopen-schools,"CHARLESTON, S.C.—Today, U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) was live on America’s Newsroom calling for the immediate reopening of our nation’s schools. He highlighted the science that supports the reopening of schools, the plight of poor children losing irreplaceable opportunities for life-changing education, and the psychological effects the lockdown is having on young Americans.     Click photo above to watch. Click here for full segment.On the effects of school lockdowns on minority kids: “If we want to look at a way to destroy the economic potential of minority communities throughout this country, let’s keep kids out of school even longer.”On the psychological effects on our nation’s children: “31% increase in kids going to the emergency room for emotional reasons and challenges. That’s black kids, brown kids, white kids… all kids. When you look at the suicide increase in our kids, we have to take seriously the importance of a child being back in school because it saves lives. It educates the future of America and improves the outcome of families who are literally at their wits’ end…”On the future economic mobility of kids on school lockdowns: “11 months out of the classroom is devastating to their future earning potential and eliminates the ability to catch up in K-12.”Earlier this month, Senator Scott released the following statement on his bill to withhold additional supplemental funding from schools that do not reopen for in-person learning after teachers have received a COVID-19 vaccine.“Keeping our nation’s students out of the classroom for a year is permanently injuring the educational aspirations and opportunities of an entire generation. The children most negatively impacted are those who are growing up poor, just like I did.  While teacher unions and their allies continue to change the rules as we go, we must be clear: if you have been vaccinated, it’s time to get back into the classroom.” Senator Scott also recently wrote a piece on Fox News about how school choice matters more than ever before in light of the coronavirus pandemic.

My bipartisan Enhancing Entrepreneurship for the 21st Century Act is just one of the many tools we can enact to get the American economy back on track.”“Entrepreneurship and innovation are key to our economic prosperity and are needed more than ever as we rebuild our economy and put the pandemic behind us,” said Senator Klobuchar. “As co-chair of the Senate Entrepreneurship Caucus, it’s an honor to work with business leaders across the country as they work to spur innovation, create jobs, and move our country forward.

https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/sen-scott-renews-call-for-accountability-amid-ny-nursing-home-scandal,"In case you missed it, just one week ago all 50 Senate Democrats voted against Senator Tim Scott’s amendment to hold states accountable that misreport COVID-related nursing home deaths.  Now, new reports show that Governor Cuomo’s administration knowingly withheld the state’s nursing home death toll.  Last night, Senator Scott issued the following statement: “Last week, every Senate Democrat voted against my amendment to hold states like New York accountable for misreporting data on COVID-related nursing home deaths. Now we find out the truth. This is unacceptable, & those involved must be held accountable.""  WATCH Senator Scott’s remarks from last week demanding accountability for nursing home deaths:SEN. TIM SCOTT: Colleagues, as of last month, two out of every five COVID-related deaths in this country are either residents of nursing homes or the staff of nursing homes.   Inaccurate information affects life-and-death decisions for communities. Requiring states to provide accurate data is common sense for anyone who believes, as I do, that we should have a science-based, fact-driven response to this pandemic.   We should not offer more funding to states that have mismanaged and then covered up their pandemic response until they fix it. It simply makes no sense. That is why my colleagues should join me in supporting this amendment.### "
https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/senator-scott-fights-job-killing-artificial-minimum-wage-hike,"Late last night, the Senate unanimously agreed to a budget amendment co-sponsored by U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) to prevent an artificial minimum wage hike to $15 during the pandemic, which would destroy jobs and crush small businesses already on life support.As millions of businesses have closed their doors and thousands more are on the verge of closing permanently, Senator Scott has been a vocal champion for job-creators that are trying to make it through the pandemic. Some of the hardest hit, especially in South Carolina, have been restaurant owners. Earlier this week, the senator visited with a bar manager from a DC restaurant who talked about how the Democrats’ plan to artificially increase the minimum wage would cut her paycheck. CLICK HERE to watch that conversation.Senator Scott also spoke to Chef John, the owner of the same restaurant, about the impact the Democrats’ wage plan would have on his business: longer days, reduced staff, and increased expenses. While the Senate rightly agreed to not increase the minimum wage during the pandemic, this fight is not over. Businesses and workers will need support as the economic recovery continues for years to come. CLICK HERE to watch Senator Scott’s latest installment in his minimum wage series.Click Video to Watch Prior to the Senate voting on the Ernst-Scott minimum wage amendment, support from advocates poured in for Senator Scott’s own amendment to stop an artificial minimum wage hike:Heritage Action: Legislation is not a magic wand and there are real-world consequences to politicians' meddling in the market. Senator Tim Scott is listening to his constituents. Hear one South Carolina bar manager describe how a $15 minimum wage would hurt workers.Americans for Tax Reform: Senators should support Senator Tim Scott’s amendment to prohibit an increase in the minimum wage from taking effect during the pandemic.Taxpayers Protection Alliance: Fortunately, there is at least one voice of reason in DC.  When Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) heard about the proposal he noted that, “Forcing a $15 minimum wage into a coronavirus relief bill would do nothing but shutter the millions of small businesses already on life support and would force those that survive to lay off employees.”Key Supporters also included the National Federation for Independent Business, National Restaurant Association, International Franchise Association, FreedomWorks, Americans for Prosperity, and the National Taxpayers Union."
