https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-highlights-health-care-provisions-in-inflation-reduction-act,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) today took to the Senate floor to deliver a speech about health care provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act that will save Medicare recipients thousands of dollars.  Durbin began his remarks by sharing the story of a 73-year-old Illinoisan who relies on an expensive medication to control his diabetes.“Americans have paid the highest price in the world for prescription drugs… I have stories sent to me from time to time by people I represent – especially senior citizens – who tell me that these sky-high prescription drug prices force them to choose between essential medications and other basic necessities, like food and shelter.  Phillip is one of those stories… He’s 73 years old and a diabetic.  After several heart and back surgeries, he can’t work any longer,” Durbin began. “He takes several medications regularly… Do you know what a one-month prescription for Trulicity costs Phillip? $2,000.  So what does Phillip, who can’t work and has a fixed income, do?  He tries to cut the pills in half to try to make his prescriptions last longer.  Sometimes he skips medications altogether.”The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was passed without a single Republican vote in Congress, will assist seniors on Medicare in affording the cost of their prescriptions.  Durbin continued his speech by highlighting provisions in the IRA – allowing Medicare to negotiate medication prices; capping the cost of insulin at $35 a month and limiting seniors’ out-of-pocket costs for medications to $2,000 annually; and imposing penalties on drug companies that raise the prices of drugs faster than the rate of inflation.   “The Inflation Reduction Act also is going to lower health care costs – one of the biggest items in every family’s budget. First, it begins to let Medicare negotiate fair prices for medications used by seniors… Is that a radical idea, that a federal agency, on behalf of the people it serves, negotiates for lower drug prices?  It's an idea that's been at work in the Veterans Administration (VA) for years.  Our VA, serving our veterans, men and women who serve this country, pays on average half of what Medicare pays for exactly the same drugs now, because VA could negotiate and Medicare could not,” Durbin explained. This approach to prescription cost management has enjoyed popular support.“Second, the Inflation Reduction Act will cap the price Medicare recipients pay for insulin at $35 a month and limit seniors’ out-of-pocket costs for all medications to $2,000 a year.  Remember Phil?  Phil was paying $2,000 a month for Trulicity.  Under this bill, which we passed a month ago without a vote on the other side of the aisle, we're going to limit seniors' responsibility under Medicare for prescription drugs to $2,000 a year,” Durbin continued.Durbin noted his support for capping the cost of insulin at $35 for every American, not just those enrolled in Medicare. “Third, the Inflation Reduction Act will curb the outrageous cost increases that Medicare beneficiaries pay for medications.  It does that by tying prescription drug price increases to the cost of living.  Pharmaceutical companies that raise their prices faster are going to pay a penalty if they do,” Durbin said.Durbin went on to dismantle Republican talking points that argued that pharmaceutical companies would lose the profits used to develop new, cutting edge medical treatments. “Of course, the pharmaceutical giants and their lobbyists fought us every step of the way.  They said, ‘you put limits on the prices we can charge, and we're going to have to cut our research.’  Guess what they didn't tell you and what [my] colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not admit? It isn't true,” Durbin said.“Studies have found that Big Pharma could lose $1 trillion in sales over the next decade, and it would still remain the most profitable industry in America.  By the way, did you know these pharmaceutical companies spend more money on advertising and marketing than they do on research?  Did you know that the research that they're using is based on research started at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at the expense of American taxpayers?” Durbin argued.Durbin also explained that even those not enrolled in Medicare could see a reduction in health care costs.“More than 14 million Americans who receive their health coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace will save hundreds, even thousands of dollars on their monthly insurance premiums because of the Inflation Reduction Act.  Under the American Rescue Plan, we lowered monthly premiums for middle-income families and those with ACA health plans.  TheInflation Reduction Act will continue this for another three years,” Durbin concluded.Video of Durbin’s floor speech is available here.                                            Audio of Durbin’s floor speech is available here.Footage of Durbin’s floor speech is available here for TV Stations.-30-"

I will continue working with Senator Durbin to ensure those treating and preventing opioid addiction have the resources and federal funding they need to serve their communities.”This investment includes four types of critical funding for communities in need:-30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-klobuchar-colleagues-introduce-comprehensive-legislation-to-address-the-rise-in-threats-targeting-election-workers,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, today introduced comprehensive legislation to address the rise in threats targeting election workers. The Election Worker Protection Act would provide states with the resources to recruit and train election workers and ensure these workers’ safety, while also instituting federal safeguards to shield election workers from intimidation and threats. The bill includes provisions that were developed with input from election officials, as well as provisions from theFreedom to Vote Act, voting rights legislation supported by all Democratic Senators.“In a recent survey, one in six election officials reported receiving threats because of their jobs on the frontlines of democracy,” said Durbin. “Donald Trump’s Big Lie not only encouraged these violent threats and the destruction of faith in our elections—it facilitated them. As we face this new, unfortunate reality, this bill is a common sense way to protect the safety of the public servants who administer our elections.”“Election workers are facing a barrage of threats from those seeking to undermine our democracy,” said Klobuchar. “We need to respond to these threats head on and make sure that election workers are able to do their jobs. This legislation would ensure that state officials and law enforcement have the tools and resources they need to protect those on the frontlines defending our democracy.” The Election Worker Protection Act has received the support of a bipartisan group of current and former election officials, including former Republican Philadelphia City Commissioner Al Schmidt, who testified before the Rules Committee last year about the threats he and his family received.“As a Philadelphia City Commissioner during the 2020 elections, my family and I received death threats simply for fulfilling my duty to certify legitimate election results,” said Schmidt. “I know that election workers across our country are facing similar harassment and intimidation on a daily basis from bad faith actors seeking to delegitimize our elections. That’s why it’s critical that Congress pass this commonsense legislation to protect election officials and safeguard our democratic processes.”A group of 15 Secretaries of State joined a lettersupporting the Election Worker Protection Act and calling on Congress to take action to protect election workers.“Additional action is needed at the federal level to ensure that all election workers have the necessary support and protection to do their jobs. The Election Worker Protection Act makes clear that these attacks on election workers will not be tolerated,” wrote the Secretaries. “We know what tools are needed to protect election workers, and we look forward to working with Congress to advance this legislation.”The Election Worker Protection Act would: In addition to Durbin and Klobuchar, the Election Worker Protection Act is cosponsored by Senators Michael Bennet (D-CO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Angus King (I-ME), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Patty Murray (D-WA), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Tina Smith (D-MN), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), and Mark Warner (D-VA).The legislation is endorsed by Protect Democracy, End Citizens United / Let America Vote Action Fund, Democracy21, Issue One, Voices for Progress, Transparency International U.S., NETWORK Lobby forCatholic Social Justice, and 20/20 Vision DC.As Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Durbin has long championed efforts to protect our electoral process, including the safety of election workers. In August, Durbin held a Judiciary Committee oversight hearing that included testimony from officials at the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on threats to election workers—the first formal update to Congress since DOJ’s announcement one year ago that it was launching a task force to address the rise in threats against election officials. The hearing also included testimony from Secretaries of State Jocelyn Benson and Maggie Toulouse Oliver, who endured threats following the 2020 election.In June, Durbin and Klobuchar led 20 of their colleagues in urging the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to notify state and local law enforcement of rising threats against election workers.-30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-rubio-duckworth-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-ban-us-recognition-of-any-ukrainian-territory-annexed-by-russia,"WASHINGTON – In order to bolster support for Ukraine and defend against efforts to force Ukraine to give up its sovereign territory, U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Co-Chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), led a bipartisan group of their colleagues in introducing the Non-Recognition of Russian Annexation of Ukrainian Territory Act. The bill would require U.S. policy to not recognize any Russian claim of sovereignty over any portion of the internationally recognized territory of Ukraine and prohibit any federal department or agency from taking any action or extending any assistance that implies recognition of Russian claims over Ukraine.Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans to hold referendums in four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine with the goal of annexing these regions into the Russian Federation. Announcing annexation is intended to paint Ukrainian efforts to restore its territorial integrity as aggressive actions against the Russian Federation so as to depress the West’s assistance to Ukraine.“Putin’s threatened sham referendums reek of desperation,” said Durbin. “The world knows the war in Ukraine is a disaster and, increasingly, so do the Russian people, who are tired of their kids dying over Putin’s warped nostalgia for Soviet dystopia. Today’s bill reaffirms our commitment to the Ukrainian people and that the United States will never recognize sovereign Ukrainian territories as part of Russia.”“There is no amount of propaganda or political scheming that can change the reality of what is happening in Ukraine,” said Rubio. “Vladimir Putin is the real aggressor in this war, and he is attempting an unjustified takeover of a sovereign, democratic country. The United States cannot recognize Putin’s claims or we risk establishing a dangerous precedent for other authoritarian regimes, like the Chinese Communist Party, to imitate.”“As Putin continues to wage his unjustified and unprovoked war of aggression, our country and the free world are firmly united with Ukraine and against Russia’s autocratic regime and its malign actions,” said Duckworth. “This bipartisan bill recognizes that and no matter what Russia claims, they cannot and will not diminish our support for Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty, its people and its right to self-governance.”Yesterday, Durbin hosted Ukrainian Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin to receive an update on Putin’s unprovoked war in Ukraine, and specifically on reports of war crimes and crimes against humanity by Russians.Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Rob Portman (R-OH), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), John Cornyn (R-TX), Patrick Leah (D-VT), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Chris Coons (D-DE), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Angus King (I-ME), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Patty Murray (D-WA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Jack Reed (D-RI), Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), and Raphael Warnock (D-GA) are cosponsors of the legislation. -30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-meets-with-nominee-to-be-archivist-of-the-united-states,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today met with Dr. Colleen Shogan, nominee to be Archivist of the United States to administrate over the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Dr. Shogan’s nomination has gained national attention after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) searched former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence forclassified documents following NARA’s discovery of classified materials in several boxes of government records that Trump improperly removed from the White House. NARA’s role in identifying presidential and classified records at Mar-a-Lago, and in identifying records responsive to congressional investigations into the January 6 attack, underscores the importance of its work. Notably, the Senate Judiciary Committee has relied on NARA in its continuing efforts to investigate the events detailed in the Committee’s Subverting Justice: How the Former President and his Allies Pressured DOJ to Overturn the 2020 Election report. Likewise, the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol continues to rely on NARA to help provide a full accounting of Trump’s attempts to hold on to power. During their meeting, Durbin urged Dr. Shogan to ensure that NARA responds to Presidential Records Act (PRA) requests from Congress in a timely manner so that Congress can conduct oversight of any misconduct by former White House officials.“The aftermath of the Trump Administration has made crystal clear the necessity of adequate recordkeeping and the preservation of presidential history. Trump and his administration attempted to shield their misconduct both in office and post-presidency, as we can see from the number of classified and sensitive government records uncovered at Mar-a-Lago. We need to be able to rely on our nation’s archivist for accurate records and proper storage of presidential records for the sake of historical preservation and to allow misconduct to be identified and investigated,” Durbin said. “I am confident that Dr. Shogan will take her role as chief archivist seriously and provide the documentation the Senate Judiciary Committee and all Congressional Committees need in a timely manner.”A photo of Durbin’s meeting is available here.Dr. Shogan is currently serving as the Senior Vice President and Director of the David M. Rubenstein Center for White House History at the White House Historical Association and as a professor at Georgetown University. Before her current position, she worked for more than a decade at the Library of Congress, including in senior positions as the Assistant Deputy Librarian for Collections and Services and the Deputy Director of the Congressional Research Service. -30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-colleagues-urge-president-biden-to-fully-fund-hurricane-relief-in-puerto-rico,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) joined Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and 11 of his colleagues in a letter to President Biden asking him to waive any local cost-share for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) aid to Puerto Rico.On September 18, 2022, Hurricane Fiona made landfall in Puerto Rico, cutting off power to the entire island and leaving many areas under water. That same day, President Biden approved an emergency declaration to authorize the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and FEMA to work in coordination on disaster relief efforts. Public Assistance grants issued by FEMA come with a requirement that states and territories shoulder a share of the cost of recovery.  On September 21, President Biden also issued a major disaster declaration for Puerto Rico.  While these cost-share requirements can be adjusted to lighten the state or territory’s burden, this has not yet been done for Puerto Rico.“In light of the continued concerning news about the devastation the hurricane has wrought on the island, which has prompted Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi to announce his request for a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto Rico’s municipalities, as well as the ongoing economic challenges faced by the island, we write to urge you to waive the local cost-sharing requirements by setting the federal cost-share at 100% for Public Assistance grants issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to Puerto Rico,”wrote the Senators.This letter was also signed by Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Patty Murray (D-WA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), and Chris Murphy (D-CT).Prior to President Biden’s approval of Governor Pierluisi’s request for a major disaster declaration, Durbin joined a letter to the President supporting this request for all of Puerto Rico’s municipalities in response to Hurricane Fiona.Full text of the letter is available here and below: September 21, 2022 Dear President Biden: Thank you for swiftly declaring an emergency in Puerto Rico resulting from Hurricane Fiona, and for acting swiftly to surge federal support to the island. In light of the continued concerning news about the devastation the hurricane has wrought on the island, which has prompted Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi to announce his request for a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto Rico’s municipalities, as well as the ongoing economic challenges faced by the island, we write to urge you to waive the local cost-sharing requirements by setting the federal cost-share at 100% for Public Assistance grants issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to Puerto Rico.Puerto Rico was already facing an extremely challenging financial situation before Hurricane Maria struck five years ago this week. That hurricane and its aftermath, along with a failed federal response, resulted in the deaths of thousands of U.S. citizens. The island’s economic challenges mounted, and Puerto Rico still has not fully recovered. Now, Hurricane Fiona deals another blow to U.S. citizens who need urgent federal support. We are concerned that Puerto Rico will have difficulty covering the 25% local match, which could delay access to federal assistance forremoving debris and making emergency repairs to public facilities and infrastructure.The President has statutory authority, pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, to reduce or eliminate the local cost-share requirement following major disasters. This has been done in the past. We strongly urge you to take this step now, and not to allow the cost-share to impede the provision of maximum help to those in need.Thank you for your attention to this urgent request. Sincerely,-30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-republicans-filibuster-disclose-act,"WASHINGTON – Today, Senate Republicans filibustered the DISCLOSE Act, legislation to combat the flood of anonymous special interest spending in American politics. The bill would require organizations spending money in federal elections to disclose their donors, allowing the American people to see who is attempting to sway their elections and gain control over their government.  Durbin is a cosponsor of this legislation.Ahead of today’s cloture vote, U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, urged his colleagues to support the legislation in a speech on the Senate floor, noting that “dark money is a dire threat to American democracy.”“The DISCLOSE Act is really pretty basic… protecting American democracy from foreign interference and requiring super PACs and special interest groups to disclose anyone contributing $10,000 or more to their cause. That’s it. We don’t prohibit the actual contribution. We just require disclosure,” Durbin said. “It would literally say to America you have the right to know who’s paying for this candidate’s ads, who’s putting all those ads on TV, what special interest group is behind this cause. Senator McConnell says we should be dealing with serious issues. There is no more serious issue than the integrity of our campaign process.” Durbin concluded, “This system we have in America is one we need to protect and not exploit. When the U.S. Supreme Court in Citizens United decided that money was speech and that corporations had a right to speak, it really corrupted the system in ways unimaginable. We’re living with the results today. Citizens United was a terrible decision… the idea that if you’re rich, you can speak more loudly and more often in America is a corruption of the basic right we all should protect and enjoy.”Video of Durbin’s floor speech is available here. Audio of Durbin’s floor speech is available here.Footage of Durbin’s floor speech is available here for TV Stations.-30-"

https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-graham-shaheen-portman-meet-with-ukranian-prosecutor-general,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Co-Chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, hosted Ukrainian Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin to receive an update on Putin’s unprovoked war in Ukraine, and specifically on reports of war crimes and crimes against humanity by Russians. Durbin was also joined by Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Co-Chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH). “Perpetrators committing unspeakable war crimes, such as those unfolding before our very eyes in Ukraine, must be held to account,” said Durbin. “Today’s meeting was deeply upsetting when discussing the atrocities committed by Vladimir Putin, but as I mentioned to Prosecutor General Kostin,  we remain steadfast in our commitment to Ukraine and the brave Ukrainian people. In Congress, we will keep pushing to pass critical legislation to ensure Putin pays the price. The world cannot tolerate this barbarity.”“The United States stands with Ukraine and its efforts to hold Russia accountable for its heinous war crimes against the Ukrainian people. I enjoyed speaking with Prosecutor General Kostin today about ways that the United States can aid Ukraine in its efforts to investigate and prosecute cases of war crimes conducted by Russian soldiers in Ukraine,” said Portman. “I strongly encourage my colleagues to approve more funding for Ukraine. This will help Ukrainian prosecutors investigate more war crimes cases and secure justice for innocent victims, and it will help Ukrainian soldiers liberate their fellow citizens from future Russian atrocities.”“There can be no equivocation: Vladimir Putin’s intentional shelling of schools, train stations, maternity hospitals and other heinous attacks targeting civilians must be met with the fiercest condemnation and action from the global community,” said Shaheen. “His war is to not only build a Russian empire, but to erase Ukrainian history, culture and identity. In our meeting today, I made clear to Ukrainian Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin that the U.S. stands firmly by Ukraine, not only as they defend their sovereign rights, but to fully investigate and hold accountable those culpable in crimes against humanity.”“We had a great meeting with the Ukrainian Prosecutor General,” said Graham. “In a bipartisan fashion, we reinforced our commitment to the Prosecutor General to provide resources and help document war crimes committed by Russia against the Ukrainian people. Accountability in this war is the best way to deter future conflicts. We stand firmly for justice in Ukraine.”Photos of the meeting are available here.In May, Durbin and Graham, along with Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Representatives David Cicilline (D-RI) and Victoria Spartz (R-IN), introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Justice for Victims of War Crimes Act, legislation that updates the current war crimes statute to enable prosecution of foreign war criminals in the United States regardless of the location or targets of their atrocities. The bill also extends the statute of limitations for war crimes discovered years after they occur.Today, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a new campaign that would call for a partial mobilization of more Russian reservists and made a veil threat of using nuclear weapons.-30-"

The ongoing crisis has left many regions of the country uninhabitable and unsafe, caused at least an estimated $10 billion in damage, and contaminated the water supply, spreading an array of waterborne illnesses, including diarrhea, malaria, acute respiratory infections, skin and eye infections, and typhoid. In addition to Durbin and Gillibrand, the letter to President Biden was also signed by Senators Patty Murray (D-WA), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Mark Warner (D-VA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Bob Casey (D-PA), and Tina Smith (D-MN). “Granting TPS to Pakistani nationals in need is a small but consequential step that the United States can take to immediately reduce the human suffering caused by this natural disaster and would reaffirm our stance as a global leader committed to humanitarian relief efforts and protections,” wrote the Senators. “Should Pakistan officially request TPS designation given the current conditions the country is facing, we urge the Biden administration to prioritize such a request while continuing to monitor ongoing developments and deliberate on the best way to aid the Pakistani community.” This action is supported by the National Immigration Forum, Asian American Federation (AAF), the Climate Justice Collaborative at the National Partnership for New Americans, Communities United for Status and Protection (CUSP), and South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT).The full text of the letter is available here and below: September 21, 2022Dear President Biden: We write to respectfully urge your Administration to considerdesignating the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Unprecedented flooding in Pakistan is currently impacting approximately 33 million people and has killed more than 1,500 people, including 536 children. Given the severity of this crisis, the United States must ensure that Pakistani nationals present in the United States are not forced to return to conditions that could imperil their lives. Current conditions in Pakistan represent an ongoing environmental disaster – one of the statutory bases for TPS designation. Extreme flooding has left most regions of the country uninhabitable and unsafe. According to data from the European Space Agency, approximately one-third of Pakistan is underwater. The Indus River is exceeding its capacity, which has led officials to evacuate entire villages in hopes of mitigating further disaster. Half of Pakistan’s municipal districts have declared a “state of calamity” and the country’s National Disaster Management Authority estimates that one in seven Pakistanis has been affected. According to Pakistan’s finance minister, the damage is likely to exceed $10 billion, which is equivalent to 4 percent of the country’s annual gross domestic product.Even as Pakistanis are reeling from the physical destruction caused by the flooding, they are also facing the spread of waterborne illness that this environmental crisis has exacerbated. Tens of thousands have been stricken by diarrhea, malaria, acute respiratory infections (ARI), skin and eye infections, typhoid, and other health issues resulting from contamination of the water supply. While we applaud your Administration’s decision to provide a much needed $30 million in humanitarian assistance and dispatch a USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team, further action is needed to mitigate the harmful effects of this crisis.Forcing Pakistanis to return to a country that is experiencing what U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has called a relentless impact of “epochal” levels of rain and flooding would be a grievous obstruction to relief efforts. It would also risk fueling further displacement, destabilizing the region, and undermining key U.S. national security interests.8 The use and implementation of TPS as a humanitarian tool would provide necessary relief to individuals that are unable to return to their country due to the extraordinary environmental and public health conditions.   Additionally, designating Pakistan for TPS would also contribute to your Administration’s multi-pronged disaster response. It would decrease the strain on Pakistani infrastructure and provide a safe haven for those who cannot return to their homes or whose homes have been destroyed. Should Pakistan officially request TPS designation given the current conditions that the country is facing, we urge you to prioritize such a request and take it into serious consideration while you continue to monitor ongoing developments and deliberate on the best way to aid the Pakistani community. TPS is a small but consequential step that the United States can take to immediately reduce the human suffering caused by this natural disaster and would reaffirm our stance as a global leader committed to humanitarian relief efforts and protections. Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to your timely reply. -30-"

Durbin reminded McConnell, who moments before had argued for improved legal immigration, that he voted against the last bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill that had reached the Senate floor.“This morning, Senator McConnell said orderly, legal immigration is part of what makes America strong. Anarchy and open borders make us weak. I don’t know of any rational person who would disagree with that comment. But I think, for the record, we should make clear that nine years ago, when we considered comprehensive immigration reform, a bipartisan bill on the floor of the United States Senate, the Senator from Kentucky voted against it,” Durbin said.“Fourteen Republican Senators voted for this measure. It passed the Senate. It was the product of the so-called Gang of Eight…We worked for months, put in all the effort that was expected of us in addressing an issue which had not been addressed by Congress for nearly 30 years to try to upgrade our immigration system – to do what Senator McConnell says needs to be done – orderly, legal immigration. That was what the bill sought to achieve. Fourteen Republicans joined us in voting for it. Senator McConnell did not,” Durbin continued.The Gang of Eight, consisting of Senators Durbin, Michael Bennet (D-CO), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), John McCain (R-AZ), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Chuck Schumer (D-NY), authored the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act. The legislation passed the Senate in June 2013 with 68 votes. However, the Republican-controlled House refused to debate, consider, or move the bill to the floor. “If that had passed, it would change the circumstances we have today. Circumstances where we don’t have nearly enough legal immigrants to work in the agricultural sector of America. It is estimated that one out of two – 50 percent – of all ag workers today are undocumented. We still eat the food that they pick and harvest. We still take advantage of their hard work in meat processing plants, and yet the reality is, we know in our heart of hearts, that they are not being treated in a sensible, reasonable, humane way,”Durbin said.Durbin went on to condemn Republican governors for their cruel tactics to address immigration, including busing migrant families across the country. As Durbin points out, these families have been legally recognized to stay in the U.S. until a decision is made on their asylum claim. Often, local officials are not notified that migrants will be brought to their community. “Listen to what Senator McConnell had to say in describing what I’ve just told you. He said, ‘out of desperation, a few governors along the southern border are now giving some Democrat-run states and cities just a tiny, tiny taste of what border communities have been enduring literally for years.’ What he’s trying to say to us is, this is an act of political spite,” Durbin explained.“What are they [governors] using to make their point? Innocent people here legally in the United States who are being shipped off many times with deception and promises that’ll never be kept in terms of opportunities for them in these various places…You see the point that’s being made here? These people are being bused without any warning where they’re going to end up, what their final destination may be, simply to make the political point that the Democrats have to be reminded of the Republican position on immigration,” Durbin said. “Why is it that whenever Republicans want to make a point on immigration, it always ends up being the children who are the pawns? Whether they’re kids in cages or forcibly removing children from their parents, or in this case, busing them off with their parents to communities they’ve never heard of?”Durbin went on to emphasize the need for comprehensive, bipartisan immigration reform. He called on his colleagues to join him in this effort in hopes that migrant children will stop being exploited for political purposes.“The right thing to do is what we did nine years ago – a bipartisan approach to fixing the immigration system. Instead of exploiting it for political purposes, let’s fix it. We’ve done that. We’ve passed legislation on a bipartisan basis, even in this evenly divided Senate…I’m ready to do that, and the Senate Judiciary Committee would start as soon as we have Republicans of goodwill willing to sit with Democrats and work together. But continuing to exploit these people and the children of these families is just plain wrong,” Durbin concluded. Video of Durbin’s floor speech is available here. Audio of Durbin’s floor speech is available here.Footage of Durbin’s floor speech is available here for TV Stations.-30-"

These pollution prevention (P2) grants will allow the University of Illinois System to provide businesses with technical assistance to help them implement P2 practices to prevent or reduce pollution before it is even created, while also reducing business and liability costs.“Preventing pollution before it begins is a cost-effective way to combat climate change,” said Durbin. “This funding will allow the University of Illinois System to support overburdened communities with environmental best practices, and I’ll keep working to bring home federal dollars to work toward a more sustainable future.”“By prioritizing communities that are underserved or too often bear the brunt of pollution, our nation is continuing to move in the right direction to combat climate change while improving the health for many Illinoisans—which is why programs like P2 as well as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are so important,” Duckworth said. “I’m proud to help announce this infusion of federal resources alongside Senator Durbin, and I will continue to advocate for clean air, water and land across Illinois and our nation.”These P2 grants are among 39 national grants made possible by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s $100 million program investment.Recipients of the P2 grants include:-30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-meets-with-president-preckwinkle-cook-county-health-leadership,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) today met with Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle and Cook County Health & Hospital System CEO Israel Rocha about improving access to health care for marginalized communities, including incarcerated individuals, immigrants, and people of color. Durbin, President Preckwinkle, and Mr. Rocha discussed the need to offer health care services to the migrants arriving in Chicago after being bused to the region by the Republican Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott. While Cook County Health & Hospital System is providing wellness services to the migrants, Durbin wrote to Senate Appropriations Committee leadership urging them to increase federal funding to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Emergency Food and Shelter Program to address the needs of arriving migrants. This funding would support the Cook County Health & Hospital System as it provides initial support, including medical services, to asylum seekers arriving in the U.S.During their meeting, Durbin also expressed his support forrestoring Medicaid coverage for eligible incarcerated individuals 30 days prior to their release. Under current federal statute, incarcerated individuals are prohibited from any form of federal health coverage, which leads to a lack of health care or addiction treatment as formerly incarcerated individuals are released.Durbin also received an update about the newly-launched Change Institute – a think tank devoted to addressing social determinants of health that contribute to disparities. The Institute was created in response to a recent report showing the two-year decline in Chicagoans’ life expectancy, with Black and brown communities experiencing even more severe decreases in life expectancy.“The pandemic has taught us that we must focus our efforts on addressing health disparities and ensuring our health care systems have the resources to serve those most in need, including immigrants and the formerly incarcerated. My conversation with President Preckwinkle and Cook County Health & Hospital System CEO Rocha today underscored our shared commitment to improving the accessibility of health care in the Chicagoland region,” said Durbin.A photo of the meeting is available here.-30-"

Just days before the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Maria, the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history, Hurricane Fiona ravaged the island with catastrophic flash flooding, unprecedented rainfall, and high-speed winds.“Governor Pierluisi has formally requested a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto Rico’s municipalities in response to Hurricane Fiona. We strongly urge you to approve this request to ensure Puerto Rico has all the federal resources available to respond to this disaster,” wrote the bicameral group of lawmakers to President Biden.“Furthermore, 750,000 homes remain without potable water. Bridges have collapsed, roads are blocked with debris, and schools are damaged,” the lawmakers added. “FEMA Public Assistance is urgently needed to begin restoring this vital infrastructure.”In 2017, thousands of lives were lost in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria due to the Trump Administration’s botched response. In 2020, following Hurricane Maria, the island faced destructive earthquakes, requiring more disaster recovery resources. The lawmakers also highlighted how institutions in charge of the electric grid have failed to repair the electrical system, resulting in continued frequent and widespread power outages. “These events have left Puerto Rico’s critical infrastructure vulnerable to extreme weather. We urge you to help the people of Puerto Rico equitably recover from these multiple disasters and access the federal funding they urgently need,” concluded the lawmakers.Joining Durbin, Duckworth, Menendez, and Velázquez in signing the letter were Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Richard Blumenthal, (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Ed Markey (D-MA), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Tom Carper (D-DE), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Bob Casey (D-PA), Jack Reed (D-RI), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Jon Ossoff (D-GA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR).The letter was also signed by U.S. Representatives Adriano Espaillat (D-NY-13), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY-14), Bennie Thompson (D-MS-02), Val Demings (D-FL-10), Darren Soto (D-FL-09), Alma Adams (D-NC-12), Pete Aguilar (D-CA-31), Ruben Gallego (D-AZ-07), Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon (R-PR), Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA-06), Al Green (D-TX-09), Ritchie Torres (D-NY-15), Jesús “Chuy” García (D-IL-04), and Raúl Grijalva (D-AZ-03).A copy of the letter can be found here and below.September 20, 2022Dear President Biden,Governor Pierluisi has formally requested a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto Rico’s municipalities in response to Hurricane Fiona. We strongly urge you to approve this request to ensure Puerto Rico has all the federal resources available to respond to this disaster.Hurricane Fiona devastated the island with catastrophic flash flooding, unprecedented rainfall, and high-speed winds. The hurricane caused an island-wide blackout, leaving over three million residents without power for over twenty-four hours. Furthermore, 750,000 homes remain without potable water. Bridges have collapsed, roads are blocked with debris, and schools are damaged. FEMA Public Assistance is urgently needed to begin restoring this vital infrastructure. In addition, Hurricane Fiona has caused significant flood damage to homes across the island. Many families are now seeking temporary shelter and will require significant aid in order to rebuild their homes. FEMA’s Individual Assistance is critical to assist with these housing costs and other recovery expenses. We thank you for swiftly approving Puerto Rico’s Emergency Declaration this past Sunday.In 2017, thousands of lives were lost in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria due to the butchered government response by the Trump Administration. In 2020, the island faced destructive earthquakes, requiring more disaster recovery resources. Five years since Hurricane Maria, LUMA Energy and the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) have yet to adequately repair the electrical system, resulting in continued frequent and widespread electrical outages. These events have left Puerto Rico’s critical infrastructure vulnerable to extreme weather. We urge you to help the people of Puerto Rico equitably recover from these multiple disasters and access the federal funding they urgently need.  Given the damaged infrastructure, we urge you to promptly approve Governor Pierluisi’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto Rico’s municipalities in response to Hurricane Fiona. Sincerely, -30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-delivers-opening-statement-during-senate-judiciary-antitrust-subcommittee-hearing,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today delivered an opening statement during a Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Protection hearing titled, “Oversight of Federal Enforcement of the Antitrust Laws.” During his statement, Durbin discussed his longstanding efforts to bring fairness, transparency and competition to the credit and debit card systems, which have long been plagued by excessively high interchange, or swipe, fees. Specifically, he highlighted his bipartisan Credit Card Competition Act of 2022, legislation he introduced with U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-KS) that would enhance competition and choice in the credit card network market, which is currently dominated by the Visa-Mastercard duopoly. Key Quotes: “The Judiciary Committee has been busy in the antitrust space this Congress.  At last count, we have held eleven hearings, including today’s, on competition policy, and reported nine competition bills, with another on this week’s markup agenda.”“Our hearings and bills have covered a wide variety of topics, from credit card swipe fees and prescription drug markets to food supply chains and Big Tech. Antitrust laws don’t always make for great sound bites, but they are essential. Competition drives innovation and the economy.  It forces businesses to improve their products and services while lowering costs forconsumers. Although competition issues are complex, we cannot afford to ignore them.  The cost is literally too high.”“Last year, American businesses paid an extraordinary $77 billion in fees for credit card transactions under the Visa-Mastercard duopoly.  Those fees are passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices, and they contribute to inflation.  A few months ago, Visa’s CEO actually said, ‘inflation has been positive for us.’  If there was ever an industry where more competition is needed, it’s the credit card network industry.”“That’s why Senator Marshall and I recently introduced the bipartisan Credit Card Competition Act.  This bill would direct the Federal Reserve to ensure that giant credit card-issuing banks offer a choice of at least two networks on their credit cards, one of which must be other than Visa or Mastercard.” “But it’s not just the credit card market that is broken.  In the pharmaceutical market, drug prices are skyrocketing… In digital markets, ‘gatekeeper’ companies are consolidating their control.  In the agriculture industry, consolidation is creating enormous challenges for producers and consumers.  The list goes on and on.”“While we are working to address these competition concerns, more needs to be done. I’m glad Senators Klobuchar and Lee are holding this hearing, and I look forward to hearing more about the FTC and DOJ’s efforts to ensure markets are competitive and working for consumers.”Video of Durbin’s opening statement is available here.Audio of Durbin’s opening statement is available here.Footage of Durbin’s opening statement is available here for TV Stations.-30-"

As Co-Chair of the Senate Baltic Freedom Caucus and as a son of a Lithuanian immigrant, I will continue to be an outspoken ally to the Lithuanian people and the nation’s Baltic neighbors as they work to uphold these values in an increasingly tense situation. Today’s conversation reaffirmed our alliance and proved in the face of Putin’s war, the courage and resilience of the people of Eastern Europe is unparalleled.”“We will continue to stand with our friends in Lithuania. This year our countries celebrated the milestone that is one century of continuous diplomatic relations. Amid ongoing Russian aggression and Chinese bullying, we in the Senate Baltic Freedom Caucus and throughout the country are steadfast in our support for our longstanding ally Lithuania. I look forward to more engagement and friendship between our nations in the years to come,” Grassley said.“We are grateful for US leadership which together with strong transatlantic alliance are essential at this critical time for the world order and especially for European security. The scenarios for our common future are being played out in Ukraine. We are also witnessing efforts by external forces to destabilise NATO and the EU. In the race for strategic patience with Russia, we must not only remain united and resolute, but step up our efforts to defend what we hold most dear - freedom, democracy, our values. That is why it is essential to continue to provide comprehensive assistance to Ukraine, to stop Russian aggression, to strengthen NATO’s Eastern flank, to increase energy independence, and to support other democracies around the world, including Taiwan. Lithuania stands ready to work together with our strategic partner the US for a better future,” said Viktorija Cmilyte-Nielsen, Speaker of the Parliament of the Republic of Lithuania.Photos of the meeting are available here.In June, Durbin met with Speaker Cmilyte-Nielsen in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he received the Aleksandras Stulginskis Star Award—only the second individual and first American to receive this award.  The new award honors Aleksandras Stulginskis, former President of Lithuania who served from 1920-1926 and was a strong advocate for a democratic republic. It was granted to Durbin for his decades-long support of Lithuanian independence and democracy and his promotion of parliamentary values. In February, Durbin visited with U.S. servicemembers at the NATO base in Pabrade, Lithuania.  In May, he and Grassley introduced the Baltic Defense and Deterrence Act, legislation to effectively codify the Baltic Security Initiative and create a complementary initiative at the U.S. Department of State. Durbin’s mother was born in Lithuania and came to the United States with her mother and siblings in 1911.-30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-unanimously-passes-resolution-condemning-violence-and-threats-of-violence-against-the-fbi,"WASHINGTON – In a speech on the Senate floor, U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today spoke about the increased violence and threats of violence Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) employees have faced since the August 8 search executed at former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort—and the need for swift Senate action condemning such behavior and the rhetoric that contributes to it.“I have repeatedly made clear that violence against law enforcement is never—never—acceptable, no matter what ideology motivates it,” Durbin said. “But here is the reality: in the past month, following the FBI's execution of a search warrant at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, the FBI has faced a flood of threats against its employees and its facilities—and these threats have been egged on by the former President and his allies.”Last month, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a joint intelligence bulletin detailing an increase in violent threats and acts of violence against federal law enforcement officials following the August 8 Mar-a-Lago search. In response, and at Durbin’s request, the agencies held a private briefing with Members of the Senate Judiciary and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees last week.Durbin continued, “I cannot share the specifics from this closed-door briefing, but I will say this: it should go without saying that the men and women of the FBI risk their lives every day on our behalf. But the increase in threats to their personal safety since the August 8 Mar-a-Lago search warrant [is] shocking. Beyond the direct threats and violence, there are also rising concerns about the public spread of personal information about FBI employees and families, a practice known as doxing… Let's condemn these baseless attacks on the men and women of the FBI and the despicable political game they represent.”Durbin went on to ask for unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S.Res.775, expressing the sense of the Senate that violence and threats of violence against the employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation are unacceptable and should be condemned. The resolution passed without objection.Durbin concluded, “This resolution, which just passed without objection of any member of the Senate, will be a reminder to the men and women who serve in law enforcement, particularly the Federal Bureau of Investigation, that we stand behind them. That those who would exploit political events at the expense of the safety of these men and women are beyond the pale of constitutional conduct. We want to stand behind those who are standing for us, to protect us and our families.”In addition to today’s resolution, under Chair Durbin, the Judiciary Committee has prioritized supporting our federal, state, and local law enforcement officers and their efforts to keep our communities safe. On July 26, 2022, the Committee held a hearing on law enforcement officer safety—specifically on the threat America’s gun violence epidemic poses to law enforcement. One week later, the Committee held an oversight hearing with FBI Director Wray—the Director’s third appearance before this Committee this Congress—on the greatest threats to both this nation and to the work of the FBI and its law enforcement partners. Video of Durbin’s floor speech is available here.Audio of Durbin’s floor speech is available here.Footage of Durbin’s floor speech is available here for TV Stations.Full text of today’s resolution is available here.-30-"

Providing additional space to train more educators and health care professionals on best practices forsupporting patients and students allows The Knowledge Center to better serve communities and disrupt the cycle of trauma.”The Knowledge Center is a national training, consultation, and research facility dedicated to improving child and adolescent mental health care.  The center has held in-person and virtual trainings forbehavioral health professionals, educators, and other human service professionals around the world for best practices in providing attachment and trauma care.The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which Durbin supported, provides more than $3 billion in appropriations for school-and community-based mental health and trauma-informed care. Durbin secured an additional $250 million in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act for community-based violence initiatives, including improving mental health access. In June 2021, Durbin also reintroduced the bipartisan RISE from Trauma Act—which would help children and families who experience trauma cope with their experiences, and prevent this root cause of trauma from leading kids to engage in violence.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that between 2019 to 2020, mental health-related emergency room visits for children ages 5-11 increased 25 percent.  In 2021, 37 percent of high school students reported poor mental health and 44 percent persistently felt hopeless.  In December, in a rare public advisory, the U.S. surgeon general warned of a “devastating” mental health crisis among adolescents. Numerous hospital and doctor groups have called it a national emergency, citing rising levels of mental illness, a severe shortage of therapists and treatment options, and insufficient research to explain the trends.  Nearly, 40 percent of Illinoisans live in a mental health professional shortage area, including residents of Adams County. -30-"

https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-delivers-opening-statement-during-senate-judiciary-immigration-subcommittee-hearing-on-our-health-care-workforce,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today delivered an opening statement during the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety hearing entitled “Flatlining Care: Why Immigrants Are Crucial to Bolstering Our Health Care Workforce.”  Today’s hearing will explore how immigrants can help fill gaps in our health care system to ensure that our communities have access to the health care they need and deserve.  The U.S. health care workforce shortages are dire, with studies confirming physician demand in the U.S. will continue to grow faster than supply, leading to a projected total physician shortage up to 124,000 by 2034.Key Quotes:“We are here to discuss the shortage of health care workers, and yet the conversation so far from the other side of the aisle has not addressed that issue.  They want to talk about border security and border safety.  They are important issues… but I would hope that we would focus more of our time on actually trying to deal with a problem that’s very real across the United States.”“What we are talking about today is looking at the immigration issue and seeing nurses and doctors and medical professionals and care givers.  They are already here and we need more of them.”“I traveled my state in the month of August from the City of Chicago down to the most rural areas of Illinois and the message was consistently the same… they are facing a dramatic shortage in nurses, a dramatic shortage in doctors.  And what we are trying to do here is find a solution to this.  But as long as we are stuck on the issue of law enforcement, we can’t even address this.”“Our immigration system is broken, and the reason we haven’t changed it is not for lack of effort… we are a 50-50 Senate and a 50-50 Committee… it is difficult to find a bipartisan approach that rings true to everyone involved.  We have tried, and I’m afraid we haven’t reached it yet, but I hope we do soon.”“Wouldn’t it be something if we did, before the end of the year, a bipartisan bill that brought more doctors and nurses to America where we desperately need them right now.  If we put aside all of our differences on the other things and dealt with that?  Wouldn’t it be refreshing to the American people that we get it?”“The American Hospital Association recently called the current hospital workforce shortage a ‘national emergency.’  They project a shortage of 1.1 million nurses by the end of the year.  This is a critical emergency.  To say that we have to solve the Southern border crisis before we can consider allowing nurses to come to this country and care for Americans is just plain wrong.”“The Association of American Medical Colleges estimates that the U.S. could see a shortage of 124,000 doctors by 2034.  That is for real.”“I can tell you that there are many of them that are here, these physicians, already serving our communities and saving lives as we speak.  And many of them, unfortunately, due to the lack of available green cards, are forced to remain on temporary visas… and when their kids reach the age of 21, the protection that allows them to stay with their parents in the United States evaporates and they are subject to deportation.”“We can fix that.  That is what this Committee does.  This is our jurisdiction.  Wouldn’t it be great if before the end of the year, we had a bipartisan answer to that simple challenge?”“The bills that have been addressed here—the Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act, which I cosponsor with Senator Cornyn, the Conrad State 30 and Physician Access Reauthorization Act—have more than a dozen Republican cosponsors.”Video of Durbin’s opening statement is available here.Audio of Durbin’s opening statement is available here.Footage

in Marion, Illinois, since 2011.  Dr. Alur is also one of thousands of doctors who are stuck in the green-card backlog.Key Quotes:“Dr. Alur’s hospital serves veterans [from] Southern Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, and Indiana… he is caught up in the green-card backlog… He now has helped to co-found an organization of similar physicians who want to be part of America’s future and want their family to be part of America’s future.  And they are stymied by the limitations of green cards available to allow that.”“It is time for us to drop the blinders and realize we need you, Dr. Alur.  The veterans of Southern Illinois and Kentucky need you and people just like you all across the United States.  So I’m glad you’re here today.  We are honored for your presence.”  Video of Durbin’s

https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-blackburn-bill-to-support-survivors-of-child-sex-abuse-headed-to-presidents-desk,"WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. House of Representatives passed S.3103, the Eliminating Limits to Justice forChild Sex Abuse Victims Act of 2021, a bipartisan bill first introduced in the Senate by U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN). The bill now heads to the President’s desk.“The science of trauma is clear: it often takes years for victims to come forward,” Durbin said. “Our bipartisan bill honors the basic notions of justice for survivors, and I was proud to work with Senator Blackburn and our colleagues in the House to lead it across the finish line. By signing this legislation into law, we can finally help survivors have their day in court and a moment of healing—when they are ready.”“The statute of limitations for sexual abuse offenses should never prohibit young survivors from getting the justice they deserve,” Blackburn said. “The bipartisan effort to eliminate the civil child sexual abuse statute of limitations is a critical step to guarantee survivors their day in court.""On September 15, 2021, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing entitled “Dereliction of Duty: Examining the Inspector General’s Report on the FBI’s Handling of the Larry Nassar Investigation.” This hearing was convened in light of an Inspector General report documenting the FBI’s failure to properly investigate allegations that Larry Nassar was assaulting young athletes, which enabled the continued abuse of dozens of additional victims.According to CHILD USA, the National Think Tank for Child Protection, data suggests that 86 percent of child sexual abuse goes unreported. For victims who do report their abuse, “delayed disclosure,” or the tendency of survivors of child sex abuse to wait for years before disclosing abuse to others, is common. One study of more than 1,000 survivors found that the average age of survivors at the time of disclosure was about 52 years old. Historically, delayed disclosure has impacted survivors’ path to justice. Survivors often were barred from civil and criminal remedies at the time they disclosed their abuse due to statutes of limitations (SOLs) that did not take into account evidence regarding delayed disclosure. In recent years, however, many states have expanded opportunities for victims to access justice by lengthening SOLs. Since 2002, 48 states and Washington D.C. have amended their child sex abuse laws to expand or eliminate SOLs in varying degrees.Under current federal law, no statute of limitations bars the prosecution of criminal offenses involving child sex abuse anytime while the child victim is alive or 10 years after the offense, whichever is later. However, statutes of limitations remain an obstacle for survivors under the federal civil remedy statute. While Congress in 2018 lengthened the SOL for federal civil child sex abuse claims until the victim reached age 28 or until 10 years from the discovery of the violation or injury, this SOL still does not reflect the current state of research on delayeddisclosure. Under the bill that now heads to the President’s desk, statutes of limitation will no longer serve as a bar to claims brought by survivors of child sex abuse under the federal civil remedy statute.Durbin and Blackburn’s bill unanimously passed the Senate in March of this year.

https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-duckworth-announce-3-million-for-illinois-state-board-of-education,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) and U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) today announced $3,000,000 in Competitive Grants for State Assessments for the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE). This funding will allow ISBE to create innovative assessments for Spanish language arts students in grades 9 and 10, as well as significantly expand educator professional learning and parent/student engagement activities.“Today’s students are tomorrow’s future – it is critical that our assessments are equitable and allow students to show their knowledge,"" said Durbin. “This investment will allow educators to meet the needs of more students and engage families, and I look forward to seeing the positive outcome from these inclusive assessments.”“This infusion of federal support for Spanish-speaking students will contribute to more inclusivity in our state’s education system,” said Duckworth. “With these resources, the Illinois State Board of Education will be better equipped to meet the needs of so many high schoolers and their families, while helping more of Illinois’s young people succeed in school and beyond.”English-learner (EL) students are the country’s fastest growing students demographic, but the least likely to graduate. ISBE’s implementation of these high-quality assessments will provide valuable information foreducators, students, and to help close the gaps in student opportunities and improve outcomes for EL students. Along with developing the new assessments for students in grades 9 and 10, ISBE will engage up to 150 educators across the state in intensive, year-long learning activities to help them better understand the new assessments and strategies to improve the success of Spanish-dominant high school students.-30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-visits-quincy-bay-discusses-restoration-project,"QUINCY – U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) today visited Quincy Bay, one of the largest natural bays of the Upper Mississippi River, to discuss its restoration project. This project aims to reverse the impact of sedimentation and erosion at Quincy Bay to improve the quality and diversity of waterfowl, fish, and wildlife populations, aquatic and forest habitat, and other ecologically significant features such as water depth and wetlands.Durbin pushed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to include the project as part of the Upper Mississippi River Restoration (UMRR) Program, resulting in the current feasibility study which began last year and will be completed in 2024. Durbin will continue to work to secure funding for the UMRR program to ensure the Quincy Bay project moves forward.“Eighty years of river traffic has brought sediment, silt, and a significant loss of water volume to Quincy Bay, making the environmental need for this restoration project very clear,” said Durbin. “Restoring Illinois’ waterway ecosystems are an essential component of our state’s environmental diversity, and I’ll keep pushing for federal investments to make sure these critical projects have the funding they need.”Quincy Bay has experienced severe sedimentation and land erosion that is impacting the area’s ecosystem, including more than 70 percent loss in water volume during the past 80 years. This restoration project will dredge Quincy Bay to 10-foot depths. A rock dam will be built to prevent further erosion from river traffic and topological improvements, such as island elevation and wildlife habitat restoration.In July, Durbin secured several key Illinois priorities in the Senate-passed Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), including an increase in the funding limit for the UMRR Program from $40 million to $75 million. The additional $35 million—if appropriated—would help ensure the full completion of UMRR projects like the restoration of Quincy Bay.  Durbin also helped secure $33 million for UMRR in the FY22 Omnibus. -30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-questions-cftc-chairman-at-agriculture-committee-hearing-on-digital-assets,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), today, in a Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee hearing, questioned the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Rostin Behnam about financial market stability given the extreme volatility of the crypto market.“My concern is this: I’m glad we’re talking about regulation. We have to have it. But I worry we are doing enough to salve our conscience, but not doing enough to put up guardrails and stop signs on the crypto express,” Durbin said. Mr. Behnam agreed that cryptocurrency is disrupting financial markets. He said that while being deliberate and cautious, the CFTC must engage and instill regulatory principles.Durbin responded, “If you’re serious about regulation of an industry where one in five Americans has invested… and we’re now getting into retirement accounts… there’s a lot more exposure and a lot more risk than just a year or two ago.”Durbin has raised concerns about cryptocurrency and the dangers it poses to personal finances and retirement. Durbin, along with Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Tina Smith (D-MN), previously requested answers from Fidelity Investments on their decision to allow 401(k) plan sponsors to offer plan participants exposure to Bitcoin, a highly volatile and unregulated digital asset. Fidelity is one of the largest 401(k) providers with around 40 million individual investors and around $11.3 trillion in assets under administration. Video of Durbin’s remarks from the hearing is available here.Audio of Durbin’s remarks from the hearing is available here.Footage of Durbin’s remarks from the hearing is available here for TV Stations.  -30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-slams-fdas-missed-deadlines-to-protect-our-children-from-nicotine-addiction,"WASHINGTON – In a speech on the Senate floor today, U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) condemned the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) failure to meet e-cigarette and synthetic nicotine deadlines, unwillingness to take action against companies that defy the agency’s orders, and general lack of urgency when it comes to protecting children from the harms of tobacco and nicotine use.  The court-ordered deadline for FDA to finish reviewing e-cigarette applications was more than one year ago, September 9, 2021, and yet the agency has only completed reviews of about half of those e-cigarettes with submitted applications that represent a large share of the market—leaving dangerous, kid-friendly e-cigarettes available on store shelves to hook children.Durbin said, “As a result of FDA’s inaction, dangerous, kid-friendly e-cigarettes remain available on store shelves without FDA review or authorization.  The Truth Initiative estimates that in the year since the FDA missed the federal court deadline to approve or reject e-cigarette applications, nearly two and a half million children and young adults started using vaping products.  Many of those young people may go on to develop nicotine addictions, with serious harm to their health.  That is the human cost of the FDA’s unwillingness to do its job.”Durbin also condemned FDA for failing to meet synthetic nicotine application deadlines.  Durbin and Senator Susan Collins (ME-R) successfully secured a bipartisan provision in the Fiscal Year 2022 Omnibus Appropriations bill that clarified FDA’s ability to regulate products containing synthetic nicotine as tobacco products.  This legislative fix was necessary to close legal loopholes that manufacturers of kid-friendly, flavored e-cigarettes sought to sidestep FDA regulation, which had the potential to erase recent progress made toward curbing the nationwide youth vaping epidemic.  Unfortunately, FDA also failed to complete its review of synthetic nicotine products by a July 13th deadline, leaving these addictive products on the market without authorization and in violation of the law. One of the most popular e-cigarettes among children today, Puff Bar, uses synthetic nicotine.  “To make matters worse, even when the FDA does review a product and issues a denial, many e-cigarette companies just ignore them.  It's reached a point that they're not viewed seriously.  The number one regulator of food and drugs in America when it comes to protecting our kids from these deadly addictive products isn't viewed seriously.  The FDA has the legal right and the legal authority to do something. They can pull these products off the shelves tomorrow. And yet with respect to illegal e-cigarettes, they do nothing,” Durbin continued.Given these ongoing failures of FDA to meet deadlines or enforce orders, last week, Durbin sent a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra to step in.During his speech, Durbin also urged his colleagues to attach his bipartisan dietary supplement legislation to an upcoming reauthorization of FDA’s “user fee” programs. These programs authorize FDA to collect various user fees from the companies they oversee, including prescription drug and medical device companies.“Many people were surprised to learn that today dietary supplement companies are not even required to register their products with the FDA. They aren't required to tell the FDA the ingredients of their products,” Durbin said.Durbin and Senator Mike Braun’s Dietary Supplement Listing Act of 2022 would require dietary supplement manufacturers to list their products with the FDA, as well as provide basic, common sense information about ingredients and labels.  Durbin is currently pushing for the legislation to be included in any final “user fee” package that reaches the Senate floor.Durbin concluded, “The FDA is one of the most important agencies in the federal government. It's fallen on hard times.  It is there to protect the health of families across the country, especially our children.  Whether it's dietary supplements, tobacco, or e-cigarettes, we need to make sure the FDA not only has the tools for the job, but uses them.”Video of Durbin’s floor speech is available here.Audio of Durbin’s floor speech is available here.Footage of Durbin’s floor speech is available here for TV Stations.-30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-we-should-work-together-to-create-an-immigration-system-that-reflects-the-best-of-america,"WASHINGTON – In a speech on the Senate floor, U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, reflected on his recent visit to the Salvation Army Freedom Center in the Humboldt Park neighborhood in Chicago to meet with migrant families who were forced to come to Chicago from Texas by Governor Greg Abbott (R-TX). During his speech, Durbin praised Chicago’s agencies for stepping up to support these migrants. Durbin’s mother is an immigrant who came from Lithuania to the United States in 1911.Durbin said, “These modest acts of generosity have changed everything for the families arriving at that Salvation Army Freedom Center. In Chicago, we are honored to offer a warm, welcoming hand to these families escaping unimaginable horror… America opened its doors to my family all those years ago—and gave us a chance to find stable footing in a new land of opportunity. Today, it is our responsibility to welcome families fleeing violence and persecution, seeking nothing more than safety and a fair shot. This is fundamental to who we are as Americans. But sadly, it seems some politicians think otherwise.”Durbin blasted Governor Abbott for exploiting a humanitarian crisis to score political points. Abbott also refused to notify Illinois or Chicago that these migrants were coming.  “He took advantage of the fear and confusion. He rounded these families up, boarded them onto a bus, and shipped them to cities like Chicago and New York, without even telling them where they were headed, and without any consultation with their destination states. This is cruelty of the highest degree,” Durbin continued.During his visit, Durbin met a man named Carlos, who came to the United States with his wife and two young daughters from Venezuela. The family traveled to reach the Texas-Mexico border by foot. The journey took four months, and they were faced with violence, theft, and exploitation. Durbin also met another man, William, who fled Venezuela, looking for a better life in America.  “Carlos had no intention of ending up in this great city. When he and his family arrived in America, he told me, with real gratitude, that he wanted to stay in Chicago. I warned him to get ready for the winter. They've been amazed by the welcome they've received from the Salvation Army and from so many others,” Durbin said.As the lead author of the Dream Act and Chair of the Judiciary Committee, Durbin has been a champion for immigration reform for years. Both Carlos and William are eager to work in the United States, but because they are asylum seekers, they are at least six months away from being able to legally work here.“This is yet another example of a broken immigration system. The system has failed not just these families, but our nation's economy as well. We have ten million unfilled jobs in this country. We have five million unemployed Americans. There are jobs in every direction... In every direction they need these workers and now. Yet we don't have a system that allows for these people to come to this country and to legally work. It doesn't make any sense,” said Durbin. “We are a nation desperate for workers—particularly young, able-bodied people like Carlos and William. But we can’t put them to work. How does that make any sense? It’s the same story for millions of people living throughout our hemisphere: even though American employers would be willing to sponsor them, there are few, viable legal immigration pathways for them to make it to America. And as a result, the arduous journey to the Mexican-American border is the only option they have in front of them. I’ll be the first to agree with my colleagues on the other side in saying we need an orderly process at our border.”Durbin continues to work with his colleagues to find viable options for comprehensive immigration reform. Durbin, along with seven of his Republican and Democratic colleagues worked on a comprehensive immigration reform package that would have addressed many of the challenges our nation faces at the border today.  That legislation passed the Senate with bipartisan support in 2013 but did not receive a vote in the Republican-controlled House. Durbin concluded, “Our nation’s immigration system should reward hard work and a determination to make it in America. Instead of exploiting families who are fleeing for their lives, we should work together to create an immigration system that reflects the best values of America.”Video of Durbin’s floor speech is available here.Audio of Durbin’s floor speech is available here.Footage of Durbin’s floor speech is available here for TV Stations. -30-"

I applaud efforts by the Biden administration, our Quad partners, and the IMF in providing critical humanitarian and economic assistance, and affirm my commitment to continue to work with my colleagues to advance stability and prosperity in Sri Lanka and the broader region.”  “The Rajapaksa family enriched themselves at the expense of the Sri Lankan people, ruthlessly silencing their opponents, inciting ethnic tensions, and leaving the country an economic shambles,” Leahy said. “After years of civil war and government mismanagement and abuse, Sri Lanka needs a government that is committed to ethnic tolerance, equitable economic development, human rights, and justice.  That should also be the focus of U.S. policy.” “The Sri Lankan people have sent a firm message that they want their government to address the dire economic and humanitarian crises that are afflicting their country,” Booker said. “I stand with the Sri Lankan people and support their peaceful efforts to address their needs. Furthermore, the international community must continue to push for justice, transparency, and accountability for human rights violations committed during the civil war to help the people of Sri Lanka move forward.” While commending the Biden administration and other Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) members’ support for Sri Lanka, the resolution calls on the UN Human Rights Council to extend its war crimes accountability resolution; urges Sri Lankan security forces to respect Sri Lankans’ rights to protest peacefully; and presses President Ranil Wickremesinghe to work with opposition parties and ethnic minority groups in efforts to address the crisis.  Find a copy of the resolution here.-30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-grassley-press-twitter-ceo-on-reports-of-security-failures-and-foreign-infiltration-at-twitter,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today sent a letter to Twitter Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Parag Agrawal seeking information regarding a recent whistleblower report concerning the social media platform. On August 23, 2022, multiple news outlets released a lengthy disclosure containing allegations made by Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, the former head of security at Twitter, alleging serious security failures and foreign infiltration at Twitter.“We write regarding recent allegations that Twitter has turned a blind eye to foreign intelligence infiltration, does not adequately protect user data, and has provided misleading or inaccurate information about its security practices to government agencies,” the Senators wrote. “These allegations raise serious concerns given Twitter’s significant role in the U.S. communications landscape and its global reach… [Mr. Zatko’s] disclosure paints a disturbing picture of a company that has fallen short of basic security standards in the technology industry, failed to adequately mitigate attempts by foreign governments to gain access to sensitive user information, and willfully misled government regulators.”In their letter, Durbin and Grassley outline some of the more serious concerns raised by the whistleblower, including the prospect that more than half of the company’s full-time employees have privileged access to Twitter’s production systems, enabling several thousand employees to access sensitive user data—while, at the same time, Twitter reportedly lacks sufficient capacity to reliably know who has accessed specific systems and data and what they did with it.The Senators continued, “With tens of millions of users in the U.S. and hundreds of millions of users worldwide, your company collects and is responsible for vast troves of sensitive data. This data can reveal not just a user’s activity on Twitter, but also their personally identifiable information—and even their geolocation. If accurate, Mr. Zatko’s allegations demonstrate an unacceptable disregard for data security that threatens national security and the privacy of Twitter’s users.”In addition to today’s letter, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing tomorrow, September 13, 2022. Mr. Agrawal declined the Committee’s invitation to testify. Full text of the letter to Mr. Agrawal is available here and below.September 12, 2022Dear Mr. Agrawal:            We write regarding recent allegations that Twitter has turned a blind eye to foreign intelligence infiltration, does not adequately protect user data, and has provided misleading or inaccurate information about its security practices to government agencies. These allegations raise serious concerns given Twitter’s significant role in the U.S. communications landscape and its global reach.  In light of these allegations, the Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 13, 2022, and we have extended an invitation to you, through your counsel, to appear at that hearing.             On August 23, 2022, multiple news outlets released a lengthy disclosure containing allegations made by Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, the former head of security at Twitter.[1] The disclosure paints a disturbing picture of a company that has fallen short of basic security standards in the technology industry, failed to adequately mitigate attempts by foreign governments to gain access to sensitive user information, and willfully misled government regulators. Among other serious concerns, the disclosure suggests that more than half of the company’s full-time employees have privileged access to Twitter’s production systems, enabling several thousand employees to access sensitive user data—while, at the same time, Twitter reportedly lacks sufficient capacity to reliably know who has accessed specific systems and data and what they did with it. In addition, the disclosure raises questions about Twitter’s capacity to adequately address misinformation and disinformation, particularly in non-English speaking countries. A draft of an independent report requested by Mr. Zatko and included with the disclosure suggests that Twitter may take “a largely reactive approach to misinformation, disinformation and spam in which action is taken on content and threats only if it is flagged by reporters or news headlines, partners, or political officials due to the lack of people and sufficient tools to do proactive analysis.”[2]            The disclosure also raises the prospect that your company’s data security practices may enable foreign governments and intelligence agencies to access sensitive data identifying Twitter users. This is not a theoretical concern. Last month, a federal jury convicted a former Twitter employee of acting as an unregistered foreign agent for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.[3] While employed by Twitter, the defendant accepted payments in exchange for accessing and conveying the private information of Twitter users to the Saudi Royal family and other Saudi officials. He is one of two former Twitter employees charged by the Justice Department in connection with their efforts to provide Saudi officials with the personal information of dissidents and activists critical of the Saudi regime, including email addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses—data that could enable Saudi officials to identify and locate these Twitter users.[4]            With tens of millions of users in the U.S. and hundreds of millions of users worldwide, your company collects and is responsible for vast troves of sensitive data. This data can reveal not just a user’s activity on Twitter, but also their personally identifiable information—and even their geolocation. If accurate, Mr. Zatko’s allegations demonstrate an unacceptable disregard for data security that threatens national security and the privacy of Twitter’s users.             To enable us to better understand your company’s data security practices and further assess Mr. Zatko’s disclosures, please provide written responses to each of the following questions as soon as possible, but no later than September 26, 2022:                   If you have any questions, please contact Jack Solano of Chair Durbin’s staff at 202-224-7703 or Dario Camacho of Ranking Member Grassley’s staff at 202-224-5225.

https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-judiciary-committee-to-investigate-new-reports-of-political-interference-during-trump-presidency,"WASHINGTON –U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today sent a letter to Attorney General Garland seeking information on reports of political interference during the Trump presidency by then-Attorney General Barr and other Trump loyalists. In his letter, Durbin points to recent claims made by Geoffrey Berman, the former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), including that high-ranking Trump administration appointees pressured the SDNY U.S. Attorney’s Office to prosecute critics of the former president and protect the former president and his allies. “These reported claims indicate astonishing and unacceptable deviations from the Department’s mission to pursue impartial justice, which requires that its prosecutorial decisions be free from political influence,” Durbin wrote.  “They also compound the already serious concerns raised by then-Attorney General Barr’s 2020 efforts to replace Mr. Berman with a Trump loyalist.” Mr. Berman—who volunteered for the 2016 Trump campaign and transition and served as U.S. Attorney for more than two years under then-President Trump—is expected to outline these allegations in a book set to be released tomorrow, September 13. Among these are claims which suggest that former President Obama’s White House Counsel Gregory B. Craig was prosecuted for political reasons after the SDNY U.S. Attorney’s Office determined that there was no basis to charge him.Durbin continued, “If accurate, Mr. Berman’s claims indicate multiple instances of political interference in the Department’s investigative and prosecutorial decisions. The Senate Judiciary Committee will investigate these episodes.”Full text of today’s letter is available here and below: September 12, 2022Dear Attorney General Garland:On September 8, The New York Times reported that, according to former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) Geoffrey S. Berman, high-ranking Trump administration appointees pressured the SDNY U.S. Attorney’s Office to prosecute critics of the former president and protect the former president and his allies.[1] These reported claims indicate astonishing and unacceptable deviations from the Department’s mission to pursue impartial justice, which requires that its prosecutorial decisions be free from political influence. They also compound the already serious concerns raised by then-Attorney General Barr’s 2020 efforts to replace Mr. Berman with a Trump loyalist.Perhaps most shockingly, Mr. Berman’s allegations suggest that former President Obama’s White House Counsel Gregory B. Craig was prosecuted for political reasons after the SDNY U.S. Attorney’s Office determined that there was no basis to charge him. Mr. Berman reportedly claims that in September 2018, Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Edward O’Callaghan asked Mr. Berman’s deputy to charge Mr. Craig with a violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act before the midterm election. According to Mr. Berman, Mr. O’Callaghan “cited the Southern District’s recent prosecutions of two prominent Trump loyalists” and said “[i]t’s time for you guys to even things out.” Mr. Berman reportedly rejected the request because, based on months of investigation, he believed that Mr. Craig was innocent. Mr. Berman claims that Department officials then “peddled” the investigation to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, which indicted and tried Mr. Craig—who was acquitted by a jury in fewer than five hours.Mr. Berman, who volunteered for the 2016 Trump campaign and transition and served as U.S. Attorney for more than two years under then-President Trump, reportedly details additional episodes of political interference in a forthcoming book. For example, he contends that Department officials pressured his office to remove references to President Trump from the charging document for Michael Cohen, his personal lawyer, as well as later attempts by Attorney General Barr himself to reverse Mr. Cohen’s conviction and stop related investigations and prosecutions entirely. Mr. Berman also indicates that on May 9, 2018—following two days of President Trump attacking former Secretary of State John Kerry on Twitter—Department officials instructed his office that it was to lead an investigation into Secretary Kerry for alleged violations of the Logan Act. After his office declined to charge Kerry, Berman was told that Barr planned to shop the investigation to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland, which also declined to prosecute.If accurate, Mr. Berman’s claims indicate multiple instances of political interference in the Department’s investigative and prosecutorial decisions. The Senate Judiciary Committee will investigate these episodes. To that end, please produce the following materials as soon as possible, but no later than October 3, 2022:Thank you for your prompt attention to this important matter.                                                                       Sincerely,                -30- [1] Benjamin Weiser, Trump Pushed Officials to Prosecute His Critics, Ex-U.S. Attorney Says, N.Y.

The court-ordered deadline for FDA to finish reviewing e-cigarette applications was September 9, 2021, exactly one year ago today, and yet the agency has only completed reviews of about half of those e-cigarettes with submitted applications that represent a large share of the market —leaving dangerous, kid-friendly e-cigarettes available on store shelves to hook children. In the period of time during which the FDA has defied a court order to regulate all e-cigarettes on the market, the Truth Initiative estimates that nearly two and a half million children and young adults have begun using vaping products.Durbin said in part, “I am deeply concerned that FDA has not taken the steps necessary to complete these premarket reviews and to remove unauthorized products from the market.  Youth e-cigarette use remains a serious public health problem, and FDA’s inadequate response is leaving our kids at risk… Further, the agency has continued to state in court filings that it does not expect to complete review of the most popular e-cigarette products until the end of June 2023—nearly three years after the court-ordered deadline for manufacturers to submit applications, and nearly two years after the deadline established by the court for FDA to have completed those reviews.  As a result of these harmful delays—and FDA’s refusal to use its authority to remove e-cigarette products from the market until reviews are complete—many unauthorized e-cigarettes that are attractive to kids remain on the market.  Of note, FDA has only completed reviews of about half of those e-cigarettes with submitted applications that represent a large share of the market.”Further, Durbin criticized FDA for not taking action against e-cigarette and synthetic nicotine products that flout FDA orders, and called on HHS to step in and take on a more robust role in protecting children from vaping products.  A recent STAT News investigation reviewed 120 denial letters that FDA sent to vaping companies between August 2021 and May 2022, ordering their products off the market.  The investigation found that at least 139 of these products—more than 50 percent of the products named in those warning letters—are still being sold in the United States. Durbin continued, “The FDA has sweeping legal authority—granted to it by Congress—to crack down on e-cigarette companies that ignore denial orders, including the ability to impose seven-figure fines and physically remove products from the market.  Yet, inexplicably, FDA has never used those powers against illegally marketed e-cigarettes. The agency has further refused to use its power and authority—and legal mandate—to regulate the synthetic nicotine marketplace… If the FDA cannot, or will not, do its job, then it is time for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to step in.  Millions of children nationwide are now addicted to nicotine because of e-cigarettes and synthetic nicotine products.  How many millions more must become addicted before our public health agencies act?”In March, Durbin led a bipartisan letter with 14 of his colleagues calling on FDA to finish its review of e-cigarettes immediately; reject applications for e-cigarettes, especially kid-friendly flavors, that do not prove they will benefit the public health; and clear the market of all unapproved e-cigarettes. The letters build upon an important bipartisan provision that Durbin and many of the letter’s co-signers led in the fiscal year 2022 Omnibus appropriations bill to clarify FDA’s authority over e-cigarettes’ synthetic nicotine. The FDA’s and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention’s National Youth Tobacco Survey found that more than two million youth used e-cigarettes in 2021.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse’s Monitoring the Future survey found that 19.6 percent of high school seniors used e-cigarettes last year. Approximately 85 percent of youth e-cigarette users report using flavored products.Full text of the letter is available here and below:September 9, 2022 Dear Secretary Becerra and Commissioner Califf: One year.Earlier this week, JUUL Labs—arguably the company most responsible for what one former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner dubbed our nation’s “youth vaping epidemic”—tentatively agreed to pay nearly $440 million to nearly three dozen states suing over the company’s marketing and sales practices, which targeted children nationwide.  Attorneys General in those states did not cower to JUUL’s legal prowess or its cadre of former FDA officials now on payroll.  Instead, they saw a company that was preying on children, and they acted decisively—an approach that seems foreign to the FDA.As of today, the FDA is exactly one year overdue in fulfilling a court order to complete its premarket review of e-cigarette products, including JUUL.  I am deeply concerned that FDA has not taken the steps necessary to complete these premarket reviews and to remove unauthorized products from the market.  Youth e-cigarette use remains a serious public health problem, and FDA’s inadequate response is leaving our kids at risk. In 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland found that FDA had acted without legal authority by suspending operation of the premarket review requirements of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act and set a deadline of September 9, 2020, for manufacturers to submit premarket applications.  Under the court’s order, products for which applications were filed timely could remain on the market for up to one additional year during FDA’s review.  FDA is now one year past the court-ordered deadline to complete its premarket reviews. One year.Further, the agency has continued to state in court filings that it does not expect to complete review of the most popular e-cigarette products until the end of June 2023—nearly three years after the court-ordered deadline for manufacturers to submit applications, and nearly two years after the deadline established by the court for FDA to have completed those reviews.  As a result of these harmful delays—and FDA’s refusal to use its authority to remove e-cigarette products from the market until reviews are complete—many unauthorized e-cigarettes that are attractive to kids remain on the market.  Of note, FDA has only completed reviews of about half of those e-cigarettes with submitted applications that represent a large share of the market.  This inaction has real life consequences—with the Truth Initiative estimating that nearly two and a half million children and young adults have begun using vaping products over the past year.      It is bad enough that FDA is now one year delinquent in finalizing review of e-cigarette applications, but it appears as though—even when FDA has actually completed review of a product and denied an application—many vaping companies regularly flout the agency’s orders.  And FDA does nothing to stop them.  A recent STAT News investigation reviewed 120 denial letters that FDA sent to vaping companies between August 2021 and May 2022, ordering their products off the market.  The investigation found that at least 139 of these products—more than 50 percent of the products named in those warning letters—are still being sold in the United States.  The FDA has sweeping legal authority—granted to it by Congress—to crack down on e-cigarette companies that ignore denial orders, including the ability to impose seven-figure fines and physically remove products from the market.  Yet, inexplicably, FDA has never used those powers against illegally marketed e-cigarettes.            The agency has further refused to use its power and authority—and legal mandate—to regulate the synthetic nicotine marketplace.  Many companies, such as PuffBar, developed kid-friendly flavored synthetic nicotine products in an attempt to evade FDA regulation.  When Congress became aware of this problem, and at FDA’s request, we acted—passing a law that requires synthetic nicotine products to receive FDA authorization in order to remain on the market.  The deadline for FDA to complete review of synthetic nicotine products came and went on July 13, nearly two months ago.  To my knowledge, not a single synthetic nicotine product has been authorized, and yet these illegally marketed products remain widely available in a plethora of flavors on store shelves nationwide.            The FDA continues to fail our children with its missed deadlines, failure to enforce orders, and general lack of urgency with respect to e-cigarettes and synthetic nicotine products.  For years, a bipartisan chorus of Senators and Representatives have been sounding the alarm about the dangers of these products to our children, while FDA action has been too slow or, in many instances, completely non-existent.  If the FDA cannot, or will not, do its job, then it is time for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to step in.  Millions of children nationwide are now addicted to nicotine because of e-cigarettes and synthetic nicotine products.  How many millions more must become addicted before our public health agencies act?Sincerely, -30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-democrats-are-rebuilding-america-and-rewarding-american-workers,"WASHINGTON – In a speech on the Senate floor today, U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) highlighted how the legislative accomplishments of Congressional Democrats and President Biden are improving the lives of Americans and boosting our economy. Durbin began his speech by highlighting the CHIPS and Science Act, critical legislation for our economy and national security that provides billions to expand our domestic semiconductor manufacturing and scientific research capabilities. He also mentioned President Biden’s trip to New Albany, Ohio, tomorrow—to join the CEO of Intel in breaking ground on a new, multi-billion-dollar semiconductor plant. Durbin said, “It’s one of the largest investments of its kind in American history. And it’s going to create thousands of good-paying jobs—for everyone from construction workers to structural engineers… That’s a big shift after years of microchip production being shipped to Asia.”Durbin continued his speech by highlighting the Inflation Reduction Act, groundbreaking legislation that will fight inflation, make drug prices more affordable, reduce costs, and make the nation’s largest ever investment in combatting the climate crisis.“The weeks since the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, companies throughout the country have unveiled, ‘a series of big ticket projects to kick start our clean energy future.’ A future that will be made in America by American workers. I would like to remind everyone we passed that law without a single Republican vote. Not one Republican Senator would join us in this effort,” Durbin continued.Due to the Inflation Reduction Act, Toyota announced it will invest billions of dollars in manufacturing batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles here, in America. First Solar—announced another billion-dollar investment to build a new facility in the Southeast. Three other companies—Honda, LG, Samsung—announced billions of dollars in investments to make components for electric vehicles on our shores.“Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, these jobs aren’t going overseas—they’re staying right here in America. New manufacturing projects are lighting up across the country, like a constellation of hope, marking a new era of renewal and renaissance for American families. A big piece is taking place in my home state of Illinois,” Durbin said. “Earlier this week the company T/CCI announced that it will invest millions of dollars into retooling its facility in Illinois to make compressors for electric vehicles… This is a chance for the Decatur community to play its part in electric vehicle revolution and once again these investments will create good-paying jobs right here in America.”Durbin continued, “We are leaving no town behind. We are investing in the future of every community from Chicago to Decatur and we are honoring America's history as a land of opportunity.”Durbin then highlighted the rich history of Decatur, where Abraham Lincoln delivered his first political speech.“So as we celebrate the new funding for jobs and development coming to cities like Decatur today, I find it interesting that one of the first policies Abraham Lincoln ever endorsed was internal improvements… The challenges we face in America today are a little more sophisticated but we also passed an infrastructure bill, the largest in the history of the United States,” said Durbin.Last year, Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, historic, bipartisan legislation that invests in our nation’s infrastructure.  “Roads and bridges crumble beneath our feet, generations of good-paying jobs going overseas, the world's wealthiest trying to save a few bucks, and skyrocketing inequality is not American. Fixing it is not socialism. It is fairness. The last President spent four years declaring infrastructure week had nothing to show for it. In less than two years, President Biden and the Democrats delivered on their promise of rebuilding and putting American workers back to work. We've had the largest growth in job creation ever in the history of the United States in the last year and a half under President Biden… The policies we enacted during this Congress will help move America forward. Together they represent a new vision for America's future,” Durbin concluded.Video of Durbin’s floor speech is available here.Audio of Durbin’s floor speech is available here.Footage of Durbin’s floor speech is available here for TV Stations.-30-"

During their meeting, Durbin received an update about the Springfield Rail Improvement Project (SRIP), which will alleviate rail congestion in the city by building new underpasses and overpasses at critical rail crossings, and the construction of the Springfield-Sangamon County Transportation Center. Durbin has actively supported the project since its inception in 2014 by securing more than $80 million in federal funding for its development.“Springfield, in the heart of Illinois, has been my home for decades. I was glad to host my hometown’s community leaders, including Mayor Langfelder, for a discussion about the future of Springfield’s transportation infrastructure,” said Durbin. “Springfield has exciting developments in the works through the Springfield Rail Improvement Project and the new transportation center for Sangamon County. I’ll continue to be a strong federal partner in securing the funding to make these plans a reality.”Photos of the meeting are available here.Last month, Springfield received a $19.8 million RAISE grant, which Durbin secured, to assist in the construction of a new grade separation underpass over the Norfolk Southern and Illinois Midland rail lines.-30-"

https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-expresses-support-for-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-in-speech-on-senate-floor,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) delivered a speech on the Senate floor addressing the burdensome cost of higher education, which has quickly become one of the biggest worries facing middle- and low-income families in America. Durbin began his speech by recalling the inception of the National Defense Education Act, which was enacted to counter the Soviet Union’s exploration of space and their growing technology industry. As a result of the legislation, students were offered loans to attend college.“The National Defense Education Act said that those who applied for federal college loans could borrow money and pay it back at three percent interest but not have to repay until one year out of college and then they had ten years to pay it off. I didn’t know at the time but that turned out to be my ticket to college…I ended up borrowing enough to get through college and law school. The amount of debt if I said it would draw a laugh from everyone else because it was so small,” Durbin began.Durbin continued by citing additional restrictions that saddle students with a lifetime of debt. In his remarks, Durbin explained that federal legislation bars student borrowers from discharging their debt in bankruptcy because of an antiquated legality. Under current law, most types of debt – mortgages, credit card debt, boat loans – can be discharged in bankruptcy court except for student loans, which continues to prevent middle- and low-income Americans from living in financial security.“When it came to student loans [in bankruptcy court], we said… we’re not going to allow [students] to discharge it in bankruptcy. It ultimately meant that for those who borrowed money to go to school and college when they were 19 or 20 years old, they would have a debt that they had to pay back or carry to the grave,” Durbin explained.“Should [student loans] be dischargeable in bankruptcy? I think under some circumstances they should be. If ten years have passed and you still had a balance on your student loans and you were literally head over heels in debt, you ought to be able to discharge that in bankruptcy,” Durbin said.To address this oversight in student loan forgiveness, Durbin introduced the bipartisan FRESH START Through Bankruptcy Act to restore the ability for struggling borrowers to seek a bankruptcy discharge for federal student loans after waiting a period of ten years.Durbin went on to praise President Biden’s move to offer up to $10,000 in student loan forgiveness to Americans earning less than $125,000 annually and married couples earning less than $250,000. President Biden’s plan also offers up to an additional $10,000 to Pell Grant recipients.“Under the plan, 43 million Americans will receive some amount of debt cancellation. A majority of them, about 27 million borrowers, will see up to $20,000 knocked off their student loan balance. For 20 million borrowers, that’s enough to totally wipe out their entire student loan balance. They can start again. They can consider going back to school, maybe even a good school that gives them the kind of training, education, and degree that really can lead to a better life,” Durbin said.Today, two-thirds of college graduates have student loans. On average, a student graduates with nearly $25,000 in student loan debt. For students that attend predatory for-profit colleges, the burden of student debt can be far worse. Lured in by the false promises of for-profit college advertisements and recruiters, students often do not graduate from these programs but are left on the hook to pay thousands of dollars in student loans.Durbin shared the story of Vickie Vences, one of the thousands of Illinoisans who was scammed by Westwood College, a for-profit institution. A first-generation college student, Vickie enrolled in Westwood’s criminal justice program in Chicago in 2004, believing recruiters’ promises that a Westwood degree would help her secure a well-paying job in law enforcement. Vickie, however, was unable to secure employment in law enforcement because of Westwood’s lack of accreditation.“Because Westwood College hid the truth about the fact they were not accredited in Illinois, a lot of young people were duped into believing it was a ticket to a good law enforcement job. By the time Vickie figured out how badly she was into it, she had $50,000 in student loan debt and she didn’t even have a Westwood degree to point to,” Durbin shared.Vickie now works at non-profit organizations that assist victims of domestic violence. However, she rarely makes enough to pay down her student loans, forcing her to live in fear of wage garnishment. The Department of Education (Department) recently announced that students who attended Westwood qualify for borrower defense group discharge due to pervasive misrepresentations and misconduct at Westwood. Vickie’s entire loan balance has been cancelled. Without this burden, Vickie can consider going back to college to help her secure a job in law enforcement.The Biden Administration’s one-time student loan debt relief plan and the Department’s recent decision to provide borrower defense discharges for students who were scammed by for-profit schools will allow millions of borrowers to see relief. As Durbin goes on to point out, however, Republicans are quick to decry President Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan under the faulty argument that this debt forgiveness is a handout to graduates of elite schools.“President Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan is not a giveaway to rich doctors and lawyers who racked up big debt at Ivy League schools. Ninety-eight percent of the student loan borrowers did not attend those schools. The majority of these debts are held by families who have zero net worth. What will their life be like without help? Nearly ninety percent of the relief dollars in the President’s plan go to borrowers earning less than $75,000 a year,” Durbin asserted.Durbin reminded his Republican colleagues that several of them accepted loan payments from the government through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). When the federal government was offering this relief, Republicans remained quiet about the federal assistance.Durbin concluded, “We started talking about trillion-dollar relief packages in the pandemic. We said to people that we’re going to have loans through the Small Business Administration for people who have a job or a business and need a helping hand in terms of borrowing money to get by. If you can prove that you spent the money on payroll and utilities and rent, it’s forgiven…We had a number of Members of Congress who applied for PPP loans, the same people criticizing forgiving student loan debts literally, personally borrowed money they didn’t pay back to the federal government. They didn’t think there’s anything wrong with that,” Durbin pointed out.“The bottom line is this. If we can help these young student borrowers get an opportunity to reduce the debt that they owe and get their lives back online, that is a great outcome for them and a great one for this nation….Joe Biden’s step is a reasonable, humane step in the right direction. It should have bipartisan support,” Durbin concluded.Video of Durbin’s floor speech is available here.                                                                          Audio of Durbin’s floor speech is available here.Footage of Durbin’s floor speech is available here for TV Stations.-30-"

Durbin focused his questions on differentiating between advocating for a client in private practice and the impartiality of a judge.“You have been in private practice. You have represented clients, some of them controversial. Many people are going to draw conclusions about who you are and what you believe in based on your clients. Tell me your own thoughts on advocacy for a client versus the responsibility of a judge,” Durbin asked both Judge Douglas and Mr. Garcia to explain.In her response, Judge Douglas discussed her experience representing a wide-range of clients, from individuals to Fortune 500 companies to nonprofits. Judge Douglas explained that, while serving on the bench, she strives to preside over cases with Judicial Canon 3 in mind, which requires judges to approach cases with impartiality.Mr. Garcia noted that while both the role of advocate and judge are vital to the judicial system, they serve different functions. Explaining that his resume has allowed him to work on both ends of this spectrum, Mr. Garcia emphasized that his experience clerking for Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan will assist him in remaining unbiased if he is confirmed as a judge for the District of Columbia Circuit.Video of Durbin’s questioning of Judge Douglas and Garcia in Committee is available here.Audio of Durbin’s questioning of Judge Douglas and Garcia in Committee is available here.Footage of Durbin’s questioning of Judge Douglas and Garcia in Committee is available here.-30-"

Of the 18 circuit judges confirmed by Senate Democrats, 14 are women and 13 are people of color. Of the 57 district judges, 42 are women and others represent historic firsts, including the first Muslim-American Article III judge and the first Latina Article III judge in the State of Illinois.This evening, the Senate will vote on another highly qualified nominee: Judge John Lee, who has been selected for an Illinois seat on the Seventh Circuit. If confirmed, Judge Lee will be the first Asian-American judge ever to serve on the Seventh Circuit.Durbin continued, “Since joining the bench, [Judge Lee] has written hundreds of opinions [and] presided over 35 trials that went to verdict or judgment. He has also sat by designation on the Seventh Circuit a number of times, writing several opinions for the majority. During his time on the bench, he’s always applied the law to the facts before him, in an even-handed and fair fashion… He has the strong support of myself and Senator Duckworth. I urge my colleagues to join us.”Durbin concluded, “I want to close by emphasizing this: our work is not finished by a long shot. Judge Lee is one of the ten circuit court nominees awaiting action by the full Senate, and many more nominees are still moving through the Judiciary Committee. Each one of these public servants will bring much-needed professional and demographic diversity. The judges being confirmed by this Senate will ensure that the rule of law applies to every single one of us—without fear or favor. They will work to uphold America’s most sacred promise: equal justice for all.” Video of Durbin’s floor speech is available here.Audio of Durbin’s floor speech is available here.Footage of Durbin’s floor speech is available here for TV Stations.-30-"

https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-visits-local-farm-to-discuss-impact-of-inflation-reduction-act-on-illinois-agriculture-industry-,"CARBONDALE – U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, today visited a local farm to discuss the impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act on the Illinois agriculture industry.“Illinois’ agriculture industry is not immune to climate change, with droughts in some parts of the state and flooding in others,” said Durbin. “These weather changes are not exclusive to Illinois–they’re a global issue.  Congress designed the Inflation Reduction Act to help farmers by providing a historic $40 billion investment in voluntary incentives for our nation’s agriculture industry.  More customers, and more agribusinesses, at home and globally, want climate-smart crops, and I want Illinois to be their first choice because it means additional markets for Illinois agriculture and additional revenues for farmers.  Our farmers who are ahead of the game, and our farms that invest in these new practices early, will strengthen their competitive advantage well into the future.”Over the last century, the Illinois growing season has lengthened by about two weeks while the climate has become 10 percent wetter—changes that are expected to continue in the coming decades. Illinois now experiences more extreme rainfall events followed by more dry spells. These can lead to planting delays, soil compaction, nutrient losses, and the need for replanting. Illinois is also experiencing greater humidity, which promotes plant diseases, pests, and fungus.The Inflation Reduction Act includes:The funds from the Inflation Reduction Act will provide farmers with incentives to improve conservation practices that can cut expenses like fertilizer applications while adopting carbon reduction practices such as expanding cover crops and reducing nitrogen runoff—all of which will increase the value of corn and soybeans in future markets. Illinois USDA will expand the following programs: Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP), Agriculture Conservation Easement Program (ACEP), and Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP).

Of the 79,000 claims discharged, 12,650 belonged to Illinois student borrowers, amounting to $228.2 million in relief.“After almost ten years of urging multiple Administrations to discharge these borrower defense claims, I am grateful that the Department of Education is finally relieving these students of the financial burden put on them by the predatory, for-profit Westwood College. With Attorney General Kwame Raoul’s continued advocacy, Illinois student borrowers are getting the relief they are entitled to after being conned into a fraudulent degree program.“Today’s announcement was a victory for students, but we must do more to crack down on for-profit colleges that lie and lead Illinoisans into mountains of student debt without a viable degree or career path.”In 2012, then-Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan filed a suit against Westwood College for using deceptive marketing in violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. Westwood College deceived Illinois students about the costs and accreditation of its criminal justice program, misleading students into believing that the program was highly respected by employers and would ensure them a job in law enforcement. Upon graduation, students found that Illinois law enforcement agencies did not recognize their Westwood education, leaving them drowning in student debt with no job prospects.Durbin, alongside then-AG Madigan and current AG Kwame Raoul, has been continuously advocating for discharging these student borrower defense claims since the Obama Administration. In 2016, Durbin urged then-Secretary of Education John King to discharge the debt of defrauded Illinois Westwood students based on the evidence found in Illinois AG Madigan’s suit. He repeatedly pressed former Secretary Betsy DeVos on the matter during the Trump Administration.In his first letter to Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, Durbin called on him to promptly provide federal student loan debt relief to students defrauded by Westwood College, citing Illinois’ lawsuit and its conclusive evidence that the for-profit institution misled students. Durbin followed up on his request with a second letter earlier this summer.In June, Durbin delivered a speech on the Senate floor calling on the Department to forgive the outstanding federal student loans of borrowers who were enrolled in Westwood College’s fraudulent criminal justice program.-30-"

https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-hosts-rural-health-summit-to-discuss-workforce-challenges-federal-assistance,"SPRINGFIELD – U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) today convened a Rural Health Summit to discuss workforce challenges with local health leaders and educators. Durbin also discussed the federal government’s role in addressing these challenges, including $1 billion in funding he secured in the American Rescue Plan for the National Health Service Corps and the Nurse Corps to place more providers in underserved communities.“For more than two years, health care workers have provided care for us in the middle of a pandemic, despite the real risks to themselves,” said Durbin. “It is critical that we provide more funding and resources for them, not only to support our current health care workforce, but to also recruit the next generation of health heroes. I secured an additional $1 billion in funding to put more providers in underserved communities across our state – but there is still so much work to be done. I will continue working to find ways the federal government can help support our providers across Illinois.”Today’s summit examined three major areas of need for rural health workforces: creating pre-professional pipelines to recruit local students into health careers; expanding capacity of clinical education programs; and enhancing recruitment of clinicians to rural areas.  In Illinois, 1.5 million people live a county that is considered rural. Significant health disparities exist for people living in these rural counties when compared with their urban counterparts, including higher rates of obesity, smoking, child poverty, teen pregnancies, and uninsured and under-insured families.In Illinois, 30 percent of rural hospitals are in designated “primary care physician shortage areas” and 94 percent are in designated “mental health service shortage areas.”  COVID strained the resources of all health care systems and nurses have borne much of that pressure.  The nursing shortage is expected to get worse in Illinois as more than half of the nearly 195,000 registered nurses in the state are over the age of 55 with more than one-quarter planning to retire in the next five years.  Less than 8,000 new nurses graduate each year.For Fiscal Year (FY) 2023, Durbin requested additional Congressionally Directed Spending—also known as an earmark— for the expansion of several nursing schools, as well as SIU’s Institute for Rural Health to coordinate services and education across its three campuses. Additionally, Durbin requested increased appropriations for several programs through the Health Resources Service Administration, including National Health Service Corps and Nurse Corps scholarship and loan repayment programs, Area Health Education Centers, and Nurse Faculty Loan Programs. The appropriations bills must be conferenced with the House bills before they are finalized, and Durbin will continue advocating for this funding throughout the duration of the appropriations process.Durbin was joined at today’s summit by Dr. Sameer Vorha, the Director of the Illinois Department of Public Health; officials from the SIU School of Medicine; Illinois State University Nursing College; the Illinois Critical Access Hospital Network; and several health organizations from Central Illinois, the Metro East, and Southern Illinois.-30-"

Lightfoot today announced that Chicago Union Station will receive $3,000,000 in federal funding, awarded by the Federal Railroad Administration, to complete the design process for planned renovations to the train station’s concourse level, which serves Amtrak and Metra passengers.  “Chicago Union Station has been a central transportation hub in the Midwest since its original construction in 1925. But the station must meet the needs of Metra and Amtrak passengers in the 21st century,” said Durbin. “With this federal funding, we can take the next step in Chicago Union Station’s revitalization. As the nation’s fourth busiest Amtrak station, Chicago Union Station is worthy of this federal support and Illinoisans and travelers will benefit from this investment for years to come.”“For nearly a century, Chicago’s Union Station has been a critical transportation center and helped power our economy by connecting people, cities and businesses across the nation,” Duckworth said. “Improving its infrastructure would mean more good-paying jobs in our region, improved service and more Illinois families traveling across our great state and country. I’ll continue to call for federal support for the Station, and I look forward to its continued presence as a key transportation and commercial hub.”""Public transportation is quite literally what keeps our city moving,” said Lightfoot. ""Union Station brings thousands of people to and from our City for work and play every single day. These improvements will enhance the commuter experience and connect even more visitors to our great city via train""“A renovated Chicago Union Station Concourse will support network growth of intercity passenger rail in the Midwest, increasing access to jobs, providing new service to underserved communities, and promoting a more economic and environmentally sustainable mode of transit,” said Jeannie Kwon, Amtrak Vice President, Stations/Capital Delivery. “Production of final design documents will allow Amtrak to quickly secure a construction contractor to execute a high-quality design.”-30- "

Prior to today’s new conference, Senator Durbin met with residents impacted by chronic flooding in Cahokia Heights and also visited sites in East St. Louis damaged by recent storms.“When you combine aging sanitary sewer and storm water systems with the realities of climate-driven changes in weather, you have the recipe for chronic flooding that threatens the health and homes of families in the region,” Durbin said. “I have delivered $28 million in federal funding for Cahokia Heights for critical infrastructure projects to help provide effective solutions for area residents.”Durbin was joined at today’s news conference by Cahokia Heights Mayor Curtis McCall Sr., East St. Louis Mayor Robert Eastern III, and officials from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and HeartLands Conservancy.The American Rescue Plan (ARP), which Durbin supported, has provided $26.5 million to Cahokia Heights for water infrastructure projects via city, county, and state shares of ARP funding. Durbin also secured $1.5 million in Congressionally Directed Spending—also known as an earmark—in the Fiscal Year 2022 Omnibus Appropriations bill for demonstration projects identified as part of HeartLands’ ongoing 95,000-acre Prairie Du Pont Watershed Plan study. The study is also funded by a $920,000 grant from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and is driven by residents, advised by area experts, and will complement other projects in the area.Durbin also requested the expertise of the Corps to help find solutions and has secured the necessary federal funding for the upcoming Corps study to analyze root causes of flooding in the Ping Pong area (Canal 1 Watershed), which is one of most impacted areas. The study is expected to recommend key future projects to alleviate flooding.As a result of a scoping and documentation process fully funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Corps proposed a wastewater infrastructure assistance project on a section of sanitary trunk sewer crucial to prevent a bottleneck before arriving at the treatment plant. Durbin’s Fiscal Year 2023 Congressionally Directed Spending request for $3.5 million to fund this project was included in the draft Fiscal Year 2023 appropriations bills released by the Senate Appropriations Committee last month.

Today’s historic legislation will do just that. The Inflation Reduction Act will deploy American-made clean energy to cut greenhouse gas emissions and energy costs, cut families’ health care costs, and finally allow Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for fair prices, a long overdue provision to help the over two million Illinoisans on Medicare.  “We know Americans are feeling the brunt of inflation. This plan is fully paid for by finally cracking down on Big Pharma greed and tax cheats, and closing tax loopholes exploited by wealthy corporations to avoid paying their fair share of taxes—and no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay more in taxes because of our plan.“This bill is fair, it’s paid for, it fights inflation, and it lowers the deficit.  It’s exactly what American families need.”-30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-urges-colleagues-to-pass-the-historic-inflation-reduction-act,"WASHINGTON – In a speech on the Senate floor today, U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) urged his colleagues to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, historic legislation that will lower health care costs, combat climate change, reduce the federal deficit, and fight inflation.Durbin began his speech by highlighting the various bills the Senate has passed in the last six weeks—thanks to Senate Democrat’s leadership. On Tuesday, the Senate passed the Honoring Our PACT Act, legislation that will expand eligibility for health care for veterans suffering from toxic exposure in the line of duty. The Senate also voted to ratify the membership of Finland and Sweden into NATO—sending a clear message to Vladimir Putin amid his war in Ukraine.Durbin said, “Two major achievements in just two days, both with huge bipartisan majorities. That's proof for the doubters that the Senate can work together when the need is urgent and the solutions are just. Now we are debating another historic plan that should have the support of both parties.”“I listen to the speeches each day on the floor of the Senate, and every day our Republican colleagues stand on the floor and say it's about time we did something about inflation,” said Durbin. “They know that's exactly the way the American families feel, and I feel as well. And then sadly when given a chance as they will be in just a few minutes, my Republican friends try to stop legislation that will lower the cost and give American families a break on their cost of living. All the speeches notwithstanding, they refuse to vote for a provision which will actually lower families' living costs. They oppose cutting taxes for families. They oppose banning price gouging by oil companies. They oppose cutting health care premiums. They oppose extending the child tax credits. They oppose lowering prescription drug prices. But we're going to give them another chance to do the right thing.”The Inflation Reduction Act includes many provisions that will help cut costs for American families. It will reduce our national deficit by about $300 billion, cut energy costs—now and in the future—by deploying American-made clean energy and by making the biggest investment to battle the climate crisis in U.S. history, and combat climate change. The Inflation Reduction Act invests in clean, new American energy sources, so that our energy future can be determined by American ingenuity, not a foreign oil cartel. The bill will enable the U.S. to cut greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 40 percent by 2030.Durbin continued, “Whether it's an extreme drought, an extreme flooding situation, more tornadoes than ever at different times of the year, the list goes on and on… And the question is when we give speeches, will we lament these extreme weather events or will we do something? That's why this bill that's coming up today is so important… And to reduce greenhouse gas emissions not only does the right thing for America, it sets an example for the world.”A recent analysis by the Office of Management and Budget warns that climate change could reduce the nation’s GDP by 10 percent and cost Americans $2 trillion a year by the end of the century—about one-third of the entire U.S. budget this year.The Inflation Reduction Act will also cut families’ health care costs. The bill extends the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies for 13 million Americans for three more years; it allows Medicare finally to negotiate fair prices for prescription drugs; it caps seniors’ out-of-pocket prescription costs at $2,000 a year; and it penalizes drug companies if they try to increase the price of their Medicare drugs more than the rate of inflation.“We want to cut health care costs to make sure as well that seniors cap their out-of-pocket prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year—$2,000 a year still is a sacrifice for many seniors, but it's a reasonable amount,” Durbin said. “We know what's happening now. Many seniors have drugs that they're supposed to be taking. They can't afford to fill the prescriptions. They take half the dose when they should be taking a full dosage. That's the reality of the prescription drug pricing in America. Is it a serious problem? Well, just ask Blue Cross Blue Shield in Chicago—and I have. What's the impact of these inflated prescription drug prices on health care premiums? Blue Cross Blue Shield said to me, it's the number-one driver of increased health insurance premium costs. The cost of prescription drugs. So when we start bringing down these costs, we're also going to create a situation where we have less incentive to increase premiums for health insurance.”Over the past five years, the 14 largest drug corporations spent more on stock buybacks—lining the pockets of their CEOs—than on R&D.Durbin also debunked Republican myths that this bill will raise taxes on working families. Five years ago, Republicans used the Senate’s reconciliation process to pass a nearly $2 trillion tax bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that overwhelmingly benefitted big corporations and the wealthiest individuals in America. The Inflation Reduction Act helps every day Americans, and no one earning less than $400,000 a year will see any increase in their taxes.“What's wrong with this picture? The average American family is paying its taxes, as the law requires, yet these corporations have found an escape hatch to avoid paying any taxes whatsoever… the poor families are doing their part to pay their taxes. It's time these wealthy individuals and corporations did the same. Instead of adding to the national debt, as our Republican colleagues did with their tax cuts for the corporations and wealthy, our proposal we’ll vote on today will reduce the deficit by $300 billion… Cutting the deficit reduces inflation pressure in the long run. In [the] short term, we're fighting inflation by lowering the costs of energy and health care,” said Durbin.Durbin concluded, “Do our Republican friends really want to tame inflation and help families with energy and health care or just come to the floor and complain? That's the choice they have. If they want to help, we have a plan. It's fair, it’s paid for, it fights inflation, and it lowers the deficit… it's what America is waiting for and looking for. I hope that a number of Republicans will surprise us and join us.”Video of Durbin’s floor speech is available here.                                                              Audio of Durbin’s floor speech is available here.Footage of Durbin’s floor speech is available here for TV Stations.-30-"

This is the Committee’s second annual FBI oversight hearing since Senator Durbin became Chair, and FBI Director Wray’s third appearance before this Committee during the past two years. Durbin asked Director Wray about mass shootings and military-style assault weapons that can be used to kill large numbers of people in mere seconds, including law enforcement.“I am noticing that law enforcement officials are more vulnerable. Bullets fired from AR-15's are powerful enough to pierce soft body armor. This proliferation of guns, particularly assault weapons, is deadly and dangerous when it comes to our law enforcement. What is your observation?” Durbin asked.Director Wray confirmed, “my fellow law enforcement leaders worry about it all the time. We are trying to do the best we can with better protective equipment and better training.” Last week, the Committee held a hearing on the threat America’s gun violence epidemic poses to law enforcement. Firearm-related fatalities were the leading cause of line-of-duty deaths in 2021 after COVID-19, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund (NLEOMF). Durbin then asked about the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021 and why the FBI has been unable to identify hundreds of remaining individuals who breached the Capitol.“One of the most outrageous examples of violence against law enforcement occurred right here in the U.S. Capitol complex on January 6, 2021, when an insurrectionist mob attacked the men and women who were trying to defend me and us and that resulted with at least five people dead and 140 law enforcement officers injured… The FBI is still trying to identify more than 350 suspects believed to have committed violent attacks on the Capitol grounds. What has made it so difficult to identify these 350 additional suspects?” Durbin asked.Director Wray stated the FBI continues to investigate the attack and is trying to track down these individuals. Given the extensive online planning for violence on January 6, Durbin asked about comments by Jill Sanborn, the FBI’s former Counterterrorism head, that it is not within the FBI’s authorities to monitor publicly available social media conversations.“How do you reconcile this with the Attorney General’s Guidelines, which authorize the FBI to “proactively surf the Internet to find publicly available websites… [where] the promotion of terrorist crimes is openly taking place?” asked Durbin.Director Wray and Durbin both agreed the use of Artifice Intelligence (AI) has made this effort “more efficient.” Director Wray went on to say, “the FBI like other organizations has a big data problem and Artificial Intelligence is an important tool as we get through the mountains of information.”Video of Durbin’s questions in Committee is available here.Audio of Durbin’s questions in Committee is available here.Footage of Durbin’s questions in Committee is available here for TV Stations.-30-"

I look forward to holding a confirmation hearing for these nominees in the Senate Judiciary Committee in the near future to learn more about their records and approach to federal sentencing.”The U.S. Sentencing Commission is a bipartisan, independent agency within the federal judiciary that was created to establish policies and practices to reduce sentencing disparities and promote transparency and proportionality in criminal sentencing. To accomplish this, the U.S. Sentencing Commission collects and analyzes information on federal sentencing practices to help develop fairer and more effective criminal justice policies. The Commission has not had a quorum since 2019 and has therefore been unable to respond to important developments in sentencing law, including the enactment of the landmark First Step Act of 2018.-30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-questions-witnesses-at-senate-appropriations-committee-hearing-on-global-food-security,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today questioned David Beasley, Executive Director of  the World Food Program; Tjada D’Oyen McKenna, Chief Executive Officer at Mercy Corps; and Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank, at a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs hearing on global food security and the COVID-19 response. Durbin began his questioning asking about nutrition in extreme places of famine.“In areas of famine, I’ve seen the use of food supplements, Plumpy’nut, and also rehydration therapies. When you talk about food aid agencies, does it include these things?” asked Durbin.Beasley confirmed the use of these supplements are utilized, which has shown a substantial improvement in added nutrition. The UN warns that without immediate humanitarian assistance, over 43 million people in 38 countries across the globe are at risk of falling into famine or famine-like conditions. Durbin also asked about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine hesitancy in poorer countries. For example, fewer than 17 percent of Africans have received a primary COVID immunization, with nearly half of the vaccine doses delivered to the continent thus far having gone unused.  “The U.S. has developed very effective vaccines, but we struggled to supply them to the rest of the world. Now we have a greater challenge in poorer countries than just providing vaccines–weak health infrastructure, vaccine hesitancy, and other competing basic health demands. A member of my staff returned from West Africa and I asked him specifically to look at COVID-19 and vaccine supplies. He reported a surplus of vaccines but not enough demand… it isn’t just the value of the vaccine, it’s the means of the delivery,” said Durbin.According to the United Nations’ 2021 report, The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, close to 12 percent of the world’s population, representing 928 million people, faces severe food insecurity and 30 percent face at least moderate food insecurity.  The impact is particularly significant on women and children, with more than 149 million children under the age of five affected by stunting and nearly 30 percent of women around the world between the ages of 15 and 49 affected by anemia.   Conflict and climate change are major contributors to the global hunger problem – a situation further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in recent years.      Earlier this year, Durbin led a letter to President Biden urging any future supplemental funding request include support for emergency food aid.  The most recent Biden Administration Ukraine-related request did include food aid.  It passed the House yesterday and is expected to be voted on in the days ahead in the Senate. Video of Durbin’s remarks from the hearing is available here.Audio of Durbin’s remarks from the hearing is available here.Footage of Durbin’s remarks from the hearing is available here for TV Stations.  -30-"

We know the best way to rebuild our communities is through historic investment, which is why I was a strong advocate of the American Rescue Plan and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. With this federal funding in hand, Illinois can begin long-term projects that will fortify our roads and expand broadband access in every corner of the state,” said Durbin.“We know our local governments were hit hard by the economic impacts of COVID-19,” Duckworth said. “But with the American Rescue Plan—thanks to Democrats and President Biden—we were able to provide necessary resources for municipalities in every corner of our state. I was proud to support the American Rescue Plan, and I’m going to keep working for policies that help our small businesses, support our working families and allow our economy to thrive.”Photos of the meeting are available here.-30- "

Wade following the leak of the Supreme Court’s draft majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. “Last week, Americans woke up to the news that was perhaps not unexpected but still stunning.  It appears that in a matter of weeks, we may soon live in a country where women have fewer constitutional rights than their parents or grandparents.  In one bold move, the ultra-conservative, activist majority on the Supreme Court appears poised to erase the constitutional right to choose whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term,” Durbin said.  “I want to be clear, the leak of the majority draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization is an unprecedented breach of the Court’s confidential deliberations.  It may harm the trust the Justices have in one another as well as the public’s trust in the Court.  Still, one must wonder, why is it that our Republican colleagues have been focused so exclusively on the leak of the draft opinion rather than the substance of the opinion itself?”Durbin continued, “Sadly, many Republicans are desperately trying to deflect from this ruling and what it means for every single American.  If the legal reasoning in the Court’s draft opinion becomes final, that decision in Dobbs will end a half-century guarantee that the right to abortion is protected in our Constitution… In the past, when the Court has taken the serious step of overturning settled law, it has done so to expand freedom, expand opportunity, not eliminate it.  What the activist, anti-choice majority on this Court would do is unprecedented, radical, and dangerous.”During his speech, Durbin also encouraged his colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would codify the right to provide and obtain an abortion free from medically unnecessary restrictions.  The Senate will vote on the motion to proceed to this legislation tomorrow.“That’s why we must take action to protect women’s reproductive rights.  Tomorrow the Senate will vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act.  This bill will codify the right to provide [and] obtain an abortion free from medically unnecessary restrictions.  The American people deserve to know where their Senators stand,” Durbin said.  “I will not stop fighting for the right of every American, especially the women of America, to have these rights as established for over 50 years.” Durbin concluded, “For years, the Republicans have claimed they are a party for families, the party of family values, yet they spent decades ignoring the needs of working families.  Republicans are willing to force women to carry unwanted or unexpected or even dangerous pregnancies to term, but they are not willing to help them raise the children.  There are aspects of the voting pattern in the Senate that make it clear that when it comes to helping families with basics such as tax credits for children, making sure that families have paid medical leave for their newborns or other family members, all of these things are family-friendly and family values.  Unfortunately they’re not supported by many, if any, Republicans.  That would be a demonstration that they truly care for families.”Video of Durbin’s remarks on the Senate floor is available here.Audio of Durbin’s remarks on the Senate floor is available here.Footage of Durbin’s remarks on the Senate floor is available here for TV Stations.-30-"

I hope you’ll make them part of your thinking about future demands for developing high quality materials and equipment,” Durbin said.Wormuth confirmed they are factoring the Army’s Arsenals into their organic industrial base plan and she plans to visit the Rock Island Arsenal in the future.Durbin, Co-Chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, asked about Ukraine in light of Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war. He stated that although early reports predicted Kyiv would fall quickly, it is still in Ukrainian hands.“What lessons have you learned as a professional observing this in terms of the efforts by the Ukrainians and the Russian capacity to fight a war?” Durbin asked.  General McConville credited Ukraine’s success in part to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s leadership and the will of the Ukrainian people to stay and fight.Durbin concluded by asking about the United States’ capacity to provide Ukraine with the tools they need.“Are we being pushed to a limit we have to reconsider in aspects of our own defense and how much is allocated?” Durbin asked.Wormuth confirmed that when providing aid to Ukraine, the Army factors in the U.S.’s needs and continued assistance to Ukraine remains within our limits.  President Biden authorized another $150 million in military assistance for Ukraine for artillery rounds and radar systems on Friday and requested a $33 billion supplemental aid package for Ukraine. During a speech on the Senate floor last week, Durbin urged Congress to pass this supplemental aid package for Ukraine. The additional aid will give the people of Ukraine the weapons to repel Russia’s war as well as bolster our allies and partners in the region such as the Baltics, Poland, and Moldova.Video of Durbin’s remarks from the hearing is available here.Audio of Durbin’s remarks from the hearing is available here.Footage of Durbin’s remarks from the hearing is available here for TV Stations. -30-"

https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/in-speech-on-the-senate-floor-durbin-highlights-impact-of-american-rescue-plan-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-in-creating-american-jobs,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) today delivered a speech on the Senate floor praising the Biden Administration for the uptick in American jobs shown in the April 2022 jobs report and the unemployment rate of 3.6 percent, which reflects pre-pandemic levels. During his remarks, Durbin highlighted the efforts of Congressional Democrats and President Biden in passing the American Rescue Plan to provide relief to families and small businesses and Democrats’ leadership success in passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.“April marked the 15th consecutive month of job growth under President Biden. And the United States has now recovered more than 90 percent of the jobs that were lost during the coronavirus pandemic. Put it into context: When President Biden took office, 20 million Americans relied on unemployment benefits just to get by. Now that number is down to slightly more than one million,” Durbin said.“It’s also the result of bold, decisive economic actions taken by the Democrats in Congress and President Biden. The American Rescue Plan… passed without a single Republican voting in favor of it last year. That plan helped us get shots in arms and provided economic relief to small businesses and unemployed Americans when they needed it the most. And the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act represented a historic investment in America, in our nation’s infrastructure… This legislation is creating jobs. We see it in the report. It’s helping Americans stay connected at home, at school, and with their doctors. It’s allowing us to meet 21st century demands like climate change and cyber-attacks,” Durbin continued.While he acknowledged the historic prosperity these two laws have created, Durbin also noted the impact that rising global inflation has on American families. In his speech, Durbin explored potential solutions to rising expenses, including fortifying the U.S. supply chain.“But even with last Friday’s good news, we still have more work to do to make sure we have an economy that really works for everyone… Democrats are committed to taking action to lower household costs and combat rising prices, get kids back to school, and workers back to work. We need to give families a helping hand when it comes to the basics – medication, housing, and gas for your car or truck,” said Durbin.Durbin concluded by emphasizing the importance of preparing for the next public health emergency or global pandemic.Durbin concluded, “We need to think ahead by preparing and investing now for future COVID surges so we can save lives and minimize the potential disruption to our supply chains and the economy... I urge my Republican colleagues to sit down, get real… We need to boost domestic manufacturing and jobs, we need to lower costs for families, and we need to insulate our economy against future COVID [surges].""  Video of Durbin’s remarks on the Senate floor is available here.Audio of Durbin’s remarks on the Senate floor is available here.Footage of Durbin’s remarks on the Senate floor is available here for TV Stations.-30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-there-will-be-a-victory-day-parade-in-ukraine-to-honor-the-valiant-ukrainians,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Co-Chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, spoke on the Senate floor to condemn Vladimir Putin’s cynical Victory Day speech, in which Putin tried to justify the heinous war crimes he has committed against Ukraine. Durbin also praised First Lady Dr. Jill Biden’s visit with Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska in Ukraine on Mother’s Day. The visit further strengthened relations between the U.S. and Ukraine.Durbin said, “Putin disgraced himself and the millions of Russians who suffered horribly during World War II by crudely comparing their struggle to his unprovoked and unconscionable assault on Ukraine today. Cynically using Russia’s World War II Victory Day, Putin described his war in Ukraine as ‘sacred’ and necessary for the ‘security of our homeland.’ This is delusional.  It is Putin who is now acting in the same way as those who so brutally attacked the Soviet Union during World War II.”Durbin also spoke on the brutal weekend assault on civilian targets that left 60 or more Ukrainians buried or presumed dead. Putin has forcibly deported as many as 300,000 Ukrainians to Russia,  tried to erase Ukrainian identity from seized areas, and praised Russia military units accused of war crimes. A Washington Post editorial recently noted the historical parallel carried out by the Soviet regime as part of a campaign by Joseph Stalin.Durbin continued, “Well, I have a message for Vladimir Putin on this Victory Day:  You have disgraced yourself by selfishly exploiting the memory of those Russians who protected your nation in World War II to defend your war crimes of today. You will not erase Ukraine. You have only strengthened Ukrainian identity and the collective will of the global community to defend against Russian tyranny.”Durbin concluded, “There will be a Victory Day parade in Ukraine one day, and it will be to honor the valiant Ukrainians who sacrificed on the front lines to defend freedom and democracy in Ukraine and worldwide.”President Biden authorized another $150 million in military assistance for Ukraine for artillery rounds and radar systems on Friday.During a speech on the Senate floor last week, Durbin urged Congress to pass President Biden’s $33 billion supplemental aid package for Ukraine.

https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-grassley-cardin-press-doj-on-egregious-conditions-at-prison-facility-in-nations-capitol,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee; U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee; and U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) are pressing the Department of Justice (DOJ) on the egregiously bad conditions at the District of Columbia Central Detention Facility (CDF), which is operated by the D.C. Department of Corrections (DOC). A surprise October 2021 inspection of CDF by the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) revealed grotesquely poor sanitation, mistreatment of inmates, and misconduct by DOC staff. In a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, the Senators raise serious concerns about the conditions at CDF and USMS’s failure to address these conditions sooner. Prior to the inspection, this facility housed detainees facing charges in the U.S. District Courts for the District of Columbia and Maryland or awaiting placement in a Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) facility to serve their sentence.“From October 18 through October 22, USMS conducted an unannounced inspection of CDF and the District of Columbia Correctional Treatment Facility (CTF),” the Senators wrote. “Though USMS found conditions in CTF to be ‘largely appropriate and consistent with federal prisoner detention standards,’ the agency identified a litany of egregious conditions at CDF, including cells with standing human sewage; detainees deprived of water and food as punishment; water shut off in cells for days at a time; hot meals served cold and congealed; detainees with observable injuries with no corresponding medical or incident reports; and a failure to follow COVID-19 mitigation protocols.”The Senators continued, “While we appreciate the steps USMS has taken to address the unsafe and inhumane conditions at the facility, we are concerned by its failure to uncover these deplorable conditions sooner—and that it took recent complaints by January 6 pretrial detainees to address conditions that have long been a matter of public record.”Following last October’s inspections, authorities at the DC jail ordered USMS to leave the facility—a move that Lamont J. Ruffin, the U.S. Marshal who ordered the inspection, described as unprecedented to the point of being the “first time in history.”The Senators continued, “A particularly disturbing aspect of USMS’s findings was that DOC staff appeared to chill, silence, and ignore complaints of detainees during the inspection. Those who deprive detained persons of their civil rights may be subject to criminal charges under 18 U.S.C. § 242. We urge DOJ to immediately investigate potential civil and criminal violations of federal law at CDF and make the results of those investigations public.”Full text of the letter to Attorney General Garland is available here and below. May 6, 2022 Dear Attorney General Garland:We write to follow up on a recent briefing that the United States Marshals Service (USMS) provided to our offices on its October 2021 inspection of the District of Columbia Central Detention Facility (CDF). No person should be held under the unconscionable conditions that USMS found at CDF, less than two miles from the United States Capitol.From October 18 through October 22, USMS conducted an unannounced inspection of CDF and the District of Columbia Correctional Treatment Facility (CTF). Though USMS found conditions in CTF to be “largely appropriate and consistent with federal prisoner detention standards,” the agency identified a litany of egregious conditions at CDF, including cells with standing human sewage; detainees deprived of water and food as punishment; water shut off in cells for days at a time; hot meals served cold and congealed; detainees with observable injuries with no corresponding medical or incident reports; and a failure to follow COVID-19 mitigation protocols.1 One detainee reportedly was suffering from chemical burns after guards pepper sprayed him and then denied him access to a shower for days.2 USMS also encountered unacceptable conduct by D.C. Department of Corrections (DOC) staff, who antagonized and told detainees not to cooperate with the inspection; obstructed USMS access to the facility; and appeared unfamiliar and unconcerned with applicable policies and standards.3In response, USMS removed the majority of detainees in federal custody from CDF. Since then, USMS has also entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with DOC to remedy DOC’s failures with respect to the management of CDF. While we appreciate the steps USMS has taken to address the unsafe and inhumane conditions at the facility, we are concerned by its failure to uncover these deplorable conditions sooner—and that it took recent complaints by January 6 pretrial detainees to address conditions that have long been a matter of public record.For example, in 2015, the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs conducted a study and issued a report on the “appalling conditions” at CDF,4 including vermin and pest infestation, growing mold, and decaying plumbing contributing to sub-standard and unhealthy conditions. The failure to address these conditions at the time raises significant concerns. To date, USMS has not addressed how long the conditions at CDF existed before the unannounced inspection last October and whether previous complaints were adequately investigated. Nor has USMS indicated what, if any, policy or procedural changes it has adopted to ensure that complaints regarding subpar detention facilities will be timely addressed going forward.We understand that USMS forwarded its October findings to the Civil Rights Division for review of potential violations of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), which authorizes DOJ to investigate and seek equitable relief to remedy prison conditions that deprive detainees of their constitutional rights. The Department’s investigative authority is not limited to civil remedies, however. A particularly disturbing aspect of USMS’s findings was that DOC staff appeared to chill, silence, and ignore complaints of detainees during the inspection. Those who deprive detained persons of their civil rights may be subject to criminal charges under 18 U.S.C. § 242.We urge DOJ to immediately investigate potential civil and criminal violations of federal law at CDF and make the results of those investigations public. In addition, please respond to the following requests as soon as possible, but no later than May 27, 2022:We appreciate your consideration and look forward to your prompt reply.Sincerely,-30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-schakowsky-call-for-passage-of-bipartisan-inform-consumers-act,"CHICAGO – U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) and U.S. Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (D-IL-09) today joined consumer protection advocates and local business leaders to call for the passage of their bipartisan Integrity, Notification, and Fairness in Online Retail Marketplaces for Consumers (INFORM Consumers) Act. This legislation would combat the online sale of stolen, counterfeit, and dangerous consumer products by ensuring transparency and verification of high-volume third-party sellers in online retail marketplaces. Requiring authentication of the identity of these online sellers will help deter organized retail crime rings who seek to fence stolen goods online. The bill will also benefit consumers by providing them with basic identification and contact information for the high-volume third party sellers who sell them consumer products. Durbin and Schakowsky are working with colleagues to include the INFORM Consumers Act in the final House-Senate conference report for economic competitiveness legislation, which is expected to be completed in the coming weeks.“If a product sold online turns out to be dangerous, counterfeit, or stolen, consumers should be able to know who sold it to them and demand accountability,” Durbin said. “The INFORM Consumers Act ensures a baseline level of transparency for online marketplaces, where currently it may be difficult to know who third-party sellers are. Our bill will not only help promote responsible marketplace behavior, it will also discourage organized retail crime. This bill is good for consumers and businesses.”“Counterfeit and stolen products defraud consumers, pose a risk to their health, and harm legitimate businesses,” Schakowsky said. “We cannot allow dangerous or stolen products sold online to line criminals’ pockets. The bipartisan, bicameral INFORM Consumers Act will protect consumers and legitimate businesses by holding online marketplaces accountable. As a member of the conference committee, I will fight to include the INFORM Consumers Act in the final competitiveness legislation.” Along with the rise in popularity of online marketplaces like Amazon, Facebook, and eBay, there has been an increase of stolen, counterfeit, and dangerous consumer products offered for sale online to consumers. Currently, it is relatively easy for third-party sellers to go onto an online marketplace, create an account, sell high volumes of illicit goods to unwitting consumers, and then shut down the account and disappear before facing any accountability.The INFORM Consumers Act would require online marketplaces to verify the identity of their high-volume third party sellers of consumer products by obtaining and verifying information including the seller’s name, tax ID, bank account information, and contact information. The bill would also direct online marketplaces to ensure that consumers have sufficient information so they can identify and contact a high-volume third party seller who has sold them consumer products.  The online marketplace would also have to provide a hotline to enable customers to report to the marketplace suspicious marketplace activity such as the selling of stolen or counterfeit goods. Last November, Durbin, Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, held a committee hearing entitled, “Cleaning Up Online Marketplaces: Protecting Against Stolen, Counterfeit, and Unsafe Goods.” He heard testimony from the founder of a toy company, Crazy Aaron’s, who talked about how dangerous counterfeit versions of his toys are routinely sold online. He also heard from a major pharmacy about how organized retail theft gangs have been targeting their stores and re-selling stolen goods online in large quantitiesSupporters of the INFORM Consumers Act include: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, AFL-CIO, the Fraternal Order of Police, Consumer groups including Consumer Reports and U.S. PIRG, the Buy Safe America Coalition (which includes the Retail Industry Leaders Association, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, the Toy Association, the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributers, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, the International Council of Shopping Centers, the American Apparel & Footwear Association, The Home Depot, Walgreens, 3M, CVS Health, Nordstrom, Ulta Beauty, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Gap Inc., HP, Levi Strauss & Co., Phillips, Rite Aid, and more), the Coalition to Protect America’s Small Sellers, including eBay, Etsy, Poshmark, Pinterest, OfferUp, Redbubble, and more.-30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-brown-introduce-legislation-to-clarify-critical-tool-for-holding-human-rights-violators-accountable,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and U.S Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) today introduced the Alien Tort Statute Clarification Act, legislation which will expressly state that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) applies extraterritorially.  This clarification will ensure that foreign national victims can hold perpetrators within the jurisdiction of the United States accountable for human rights violations that occur abroad. “It is imperative that we treat international human rights as not just an aspirational concept, but a legal reality,” Durbin said.  “The bill Senator Brown and I are proposing will clarify Congress’s intent to ensure that human rights violators within the jurisdiction of our courts can be held to account by their victims regardless of where the abuses occurred.” “For decades, corporations have closed down production in Ohio and outsourced to the lowest global bidder.  And these corporations would have you believe they are not liable on civil grounds for forced labor – including child labor – in their global supply chains, after arguing at the Supreme Court for a contrived loophole,” Brown said.  “To eradicate forced labor from global supply chains, we need to clarify that the Alien Tort Statute always applied to cases abroad, as Congress intended.” The First Congress originally enacted the Alien Tort Statute as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789 to ensure that foreign citizens would have a remedy in U.S. courts for civil wrongs in violation of international law.  In recent decades, the ATS has served as an important tool for holding violators of international human rights accountable.  In recent years, however, the Supreme Court has called on Congress to clarify whether the ATS applies to extraterritorial violations of international law.  The legislation Durbin and Brown are proposing answers that invitation and clarifies that the ATS applies wherever the violations take place as the First Congress intended. -30- "

https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/on-senate-floor-durbin-proposes-solutions-to-cut-costs-for-working-americans,"WASHINGTON – In a speech on the Senate floor, U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) today highlighted solutions Congress can implement to help American families save money. Due to inflation caused by Russia’s unprovoked war in Ukraine and rising COVID cases in China, every day Americans are feeling the brunt of rising prices for gas, groceries, and housing. During his speech, Durbin highlighted ways to cut gas prices, including implementing President Biden’s emergency fuel waiver allowing E15 to be sold across the country this summer, reducing the cost of insulin, and reining in the excessive swipe fees charged by Visa and Mastercard.Durbin said, “Anyone who has filled up a gas tank in the last couple months has felt the sticker shock of Putin’s war in Ukraine… Normally, E15 isn’t sold in the summer. The White House estimates that allowing gas stations to sell E15 this summer will save Americans 10 cents a gallon. If we’re really serious about reducing the price of gas and reducing the power of Putin, we can do that by investing more in electric cars, or clean energy sources that don’t break the bank or the planet.”Durbin also proposed capping the monthly costs of insulin at $35. Durbin is a cosponsor of Senator Raphael Warnock’s (D-GA) bill, the Affordable Insulin Now Act, to reduce the outrageous and increasing prices charged by the pharmaceutical industry for this lifesaving medication. There are 37 million Americans who have diabetes – and that number continues to rise every year.Another issue that Durbin, Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has been a leader on is addressing the excessive swipe fees imposed by Visa and Mastercard. During yesterday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Durbin questioned witnesses from Visa and Mastercard about rising interchange fees that lead to higher consumer prices for goods and services and add to inflationary pressures. It was the first hearing the Committee has held on the topic in 16 years.Durbin said, “Visa and Mastercard control about 80 percent of the credit and debit card market.  And every time a card with a Visa or Mastercard logo is swiped, Visa and Mastercard charge fees that take a cut out of the transaction amount. For merchants operating on tight profit margins–and that’s most merchants–these fees can add up to a big problem.”Durbin explained the fee Visa and Mastercard require card-accepting merchant to pay the card-issuing bank is called an interchange fee. It’s usually charged as a percentage of the transaction, plus a flat fee—for example, two percent plus 10 cents per transaction. If you’re paying $100 in groceries on your credit card after the fees are deducted, the merchant gets $98 or less. During yesterday’s hearing, the CEO of Giant Eagle, a regional grocery store chain based in Pittsburgh, explained that these swipe fees can exceed their entire profit margin of one percent.Durbin continued, “They [merchants] have to raise their prices to cover the high swipe fees required by Visa and Mastercard.  And customers end up holding the bag.  Swipe fees aren’t just annoying to the retailers—they are anticompetitive… the banks let Visa and Mastercard price-fix the fees for them. When fee rates go up, banks make more money every time people use debit or credit cards. That benefits Visa and Mastercard, who take their own cut – called a network fee – out of each swipe.  They have an incentive to keep raising fees.”To address this issue, Durbin highlighted various solutions, such as making clear to consumers on their monthly statement how much was deducted in swipe fees on each transaction, preventing Visa and Mastercard from hiking swipe fees up to an unreasonable level, and promoting competition by giving merchants more competitive options on each swipe.Durbin concluded, “The bottom line is this:  If we’re serious about reducing costs for American families, get serious about reining in swipe fees.  Visa and Mastercard swipe fees are adding to the fires of inflation every day. Is that what we want in our economy? Is that what American families need at this moment in history? I think not.”Last year, U.S. merchants paid out a staggering $77.48 billion in credit card fees and $28.06 billion in debit card fees imposed by Visa and Mastercard.  And two weeks ago, Visa and Mastercard further increased many of their interchange fee rates despite bipartisan calls from Congress not to do so.Video of Durbin’s floor speech is available here.Audio of Durbin’s floor speech is available here.Footage of Durbin’s floor speech is available here for TV Stations.-30-"

Wade.Key Durbin quotes:“At least four Republican appointees who currently sit on the Supreme Court appeared as nominees before this Committee and claimed they would respect the Court’s nearly 50-year precedent on a woman’s right to choose, and treat it as settled law.  They assured us they would not be activist judges… This draft opinion tells a much different story.”“Consider what then-Judge Alito, the draft opinion author, told me when he appeared before his 2006 confirmation hearing under oath.  I asked then-Judge Alito if he viewed Roe as settled law. He responded, and I quote, ‘If settled means that it’s a precedent that is entitled to respect as stare decisis… then it is a precedent that is protected, entitled to respect under the doctrine of stare decisis.’  President Trump’s three Supreme Court nominees paid the same lip service.”“If this draft opinion becomes the Court’s majority opinion, these nominees will have shown again what we said for years about certain [Republican] appointees to the bench: They are, in fact, judicial activists.  They are driven by desired policy outcomes and beholden to an ideological agenda… These Justices were put on the bench by President Trump and Senator McConnell to deliver this outcome.”“Confidence [in the Court] has been shaken this week.  I hope it can be restored.”Video of Durbin’s opening statement is available here.Audio of Durbin’s opening statement is available here.Footage of Durbin’s opening statement is available here for TV Stations.-30-   "

https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-announces-25-million-in-federal-funding-for-ev-infrastructure-and-workforce-training,"CHICAGO – U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) today announced $2.5 million in new federal funding he secured to support electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure and workforce training that will lead to good paying jobs in the electrical industry. In the Fiscal Year 2022 Omnibus appropriations bill, Durbin secured $500,000 for IBEW to support its career training program at local high schools and $2 million for the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) to upgrade its 103rd Street bus garage to accommodate electric buses and charging infrastructure.“The Chicago region has the workforce, institutions, and leadership to play an important role in the EV revolution. With the funding I secured in the FY22 omnibus appropriations bill and passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are poised to be a national leader in building a cleaner, stronger economy,” Durbin said. “IBEW is leading the effort to train the next-generation of skilled workers to build and install new EV infrastructure, and the CTA is committed to building a more efficient and environmentally friendly network of electric buses. I will continue working to provide federal support for these initiatives that will improve our infrastructure and economy.”“IBEW Local 134 has been at the forefront of the energy transition, training a diverse and inclusive workforce through partnerships with area high schools, community colleges, and community-based organizations. With the support of addition funding secured by Senator Durbin, IBEW will be able to expand our programming to additional schools and reach more students.  These programs are designed to create a pathway to good paying, union careers in the electrical industry that provide economic stability and a solid footing in the middle class to benefit future generations,” said Gene Kent, Director at IBEW NECA Technical Institute (IN-Tech).Durbin secured $500,000 for IBEW to support their career training program for high school students in the Chicago region. This program will bolster the pipeline to unionized jobs in a growing industry and increase the number of qualified workers in Illinois for EV-related projects. As green-industries continue to grow, highly-skilled electrical workers with experience working on EV and renewable energy infrastructure will be in high demand.  Further investments from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which was signed into law by President Biden last year, could lead to even higher green job growth in Illinois.Durbin also secured $2 million for the CTA’s 103rd Street Bus Garage, which will allow the CTA to redesign the garage to accommodate electric buses and charging infrastructure. The CTA has committed to transitioning its bus fleet to 100 percent electric by 2040, and redesigning their main bus garages on the South and West sides will allow electric buses to better serve routes across areas of Chicago that historically have had some of the worst air quality in the city. To date, Durbin has helped secure more than $70 million in federal funding for the CTA to electrify its bus fleet, and IIJA includes $5 billion in competitive grant funding for low emission transit buses, which the CTA is eligible for. -30-  "
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-calls-on-illinois-education-professionals-to-raise-the-alarm-on-for-profit-colleges,"WASHINGTON – As the conclusion of the academic year approaches and high school seniors make their final decisions about higher education, U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) is enlisting the help of Illinois high school principals, counselors, and teachers to warn college-bound students and their families about the risks associated with attending for-profit colleges. As the COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to classrooms, a report from the National Student Clearing House Research Center found that, from Spring 2020 to Spring 2021, for-profit college enrollment has held relatively steady despite total undergraduate enrollment dropping 3.5 percent and community college enrollment dropping as low as nearly 10 percent. For-profit colleges enroll only eight percent of post-secondary students, but account for 30 percent of all federal student loan defaults. In today’s letter, Durbin said for-profit colleges have “proven themselves to be a direct threat” to Illinois educators’ efforts to prepare students for better opportunities through education. “As our nation continues to recover from the pandemic, economic uncertainly looms over your students’ postsecondary education decisions—likely causing many of your students to reevaluate their plans… For-profit colleges pounce on economic uncertainty to exploit students who are trying to better their future through education.  We’ve seen it before—most recently during the Great Recession.  They spent massively on marketing, bombarding students with misleading advertisements.  Owners and investors lined their pockets while students paid exorbitantly high tuition in exchange for often worthless degrees… For-profit schools are using the same tactics today,” Durbin wrote.  Durbin’s letter continued, “In the last several years, several major for-profit college companies have collapsed under the weight of their own wrongdoing, including Corinthian College, Inc. (operated Everest Colleges), ITT Tech, Education Corporation of America, Vatterott, and Dream Center’s Argosy University and Illinois Institute of Art.  These companies engaged in a variety of fraudulent and predatory practices.  When they closed abruptly, hundreds of thousands of students across the country—including thousands in Illinois—were left with student loans and no degree.  These closures put students at risk of having their education disrupted, losing credits when starting at a new school, and taking on more debt to finish their studies.” “You have dedicated your life to preparing Illinois students for better opportunities through education.  For-profit colleges have proven themselves to be a direct threat to your life’s work.  For an Illinois student, getting the right information from the right person, especially at this time of uncertainty, can mean the difference between a successful future and a lifetime of student debt,” Durbin’s letter concluded. This is the ninth consecutive year that Durbin has written to Illinois educators and school leaders about the risks of predatory for-profits and offered reliable resources to help students make well-informed decisions about their postsecondary education choices.   Organizations helping to distribute today’s letter include Illinois Principals Association, Illinois Education Association, National Association for College Admission Counseling, Illinois Federation of Teachers, American Federation of Teachers, National Education Association, and Illinois Association of Community College Trustees.  Full text of the letter is available here and below: April 28, 2022 Dear Principal/Teacher/Counselor: It is that time of year again.  Each spring, for the last nine years, I have written to you asking for your help ensuring Illinois’ students receive accurate and up-to-date information about their post-secondary education options, including the risks associated with attending for-profit colleges.  You and your colleagues around the state have answered that call. But, first, I want to recognize you for answering a different call—that of guiding our children and communities through the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.  At the same time, you undoubtedly faced personal challenges and difficulties in your own families and households.  It hasn’t been easy, and I want to thank you for your incredible dedication to Illinois students and families.  As our nation continues to recover from the pandemic, economic uncertainly looms over your students’ postsecondary education decisions—likely causing many of your students to reevaluate their plans.  According to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, total undergraduate enrollment dropped 3.5 percent from the spring of 2020 to the spring of 2021.  Fewer students seeking postsecondary education will have negative consequences for the future economy and country.  Not all postsecondary institutions, however, have fared the same.  Community colleges have seen enrollment declines of nearly 10 percent from the spring of 2020 to the spring of 2021.  On the other hand, enrollment at four-year for-profit colleges has, alarmingly, held fairly steady. For-profit colleges pounce on economic uncertainty to exploit students who are trying to better their future through education.  We’ve seen it before—most recently during the Great Recession.  They spent massively on marketing, bombarding students with misleading advertisements.  Owners and investors lined their pockets while students paid exorbitantly high tuition in exchange for often worthless degrees.  As of December 2021, more than 423,000 borrowers had applied for discharge of their federal student loans from the Department of Education as a result of being defrauded by their schools—the vast majority coming from those who attended for-profits.[1] For-profit schools are using the same tactics today.  According to the Brookings Institution, for-profit colleges spent about $400 per student on advertising, compared to just $14 by public universities prior to the pandemic.  The Century Foundation has found that these for-profit companies have spent even more during the pandemic.  Some even are using the pandemic itself in ads to target students.  In the last several years, several major for-profit college companies have collapsed under the weight of their own wrongdoing, including Corinthian College, Inc. (operated Everest Colleges), ITT Tech, Education Corporation of America, Vatterott, and Dream Center’s Argosy University and Illinois Institute of Art.  These companies engaged in a variety of fraudulent and predatory practices.  When they closed abruptly, hundreds of thousands of students across the country—including thousands in Illinois—were left with student loans and no degree.  These closures put students at risk of having their education disrupted, losing credits when starting at a new school, and taking on more debt to finish their studies.  Since 2014, more than 2,000 for-profit campus locations around the country have closed, including 68 campus closures in Illinois. As was the case with these examples, regulatory scrutiny and financial instability can indicate that a company or school is more likely to close.  Nearly every major for-profit college company has been investigated or sued for deceptive practices.  According to publicly available information, the following for-profit college companies and brands operating in Illinois are currently or have been the subject of investigations or lawsuits by state Attorneys General and/or federal agencies, have recently paid millions as part of state and/or federal settlements for deceptive practices, or been found guilty of fraud in a court of law.  Additionally, a number of for-profit institutions have been placed on Heightened Cash Monitoring (HCM) by the U.S. Department of Education (Department).  Institutions are placed on HCM when the Department identifies concerns related to the school’s financial instability or compliance issues with federal regulations.  The designation results in greater scrutiny of the school by the Department and, in the words of former Under Secretary of Education Ted Mitchell, should serve as a “caution light” for prospective students.  According to the most recently available public data, for-profit colleges operating in Illinois on the Department’s most recent HCM list include[2]:  Parents and students often look at an institution’s accreditation status as an indicator of legitimacy and quality.  After all, if an institution is accredited by a federally recognized accreditation agency, students are able to use federal student loans to attend the institution.  However, some accreditors have been slow to address the widespread fraud and abuse in the for-profit college industry—making a school’s accreditation status too often an unreliable predictor of academic quality.  Consider the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS).  This organization put its stamp of approval on predatory institutions like Corinthian, ITT Tech, and Westwood Colleges.  Despite clear evidence of these companies’ abuses, ACICS continued to accredit them.  In fact, Corinthian and ITT Tech were fully accredited by ACICS to the very day that they declared bankruptcy.  Rather than relying on a school’s accreditation status, students and families should seek information about outcomes.  Here’s one outcome statistic I hope you will remember and explain its significance to your students: for-profit schools enroll just 8 percent of all postsecondary students, but account for 30 percent of all federal student loan defaults.  Families can find information about a specific school’s student outcomes through the College Scorecard.  Created by the Obama Administration, the Scorecard provides information on median earnings, typical debt after graduation, and typical monthly federal student loan payment.  It can be accessed online at https://collegescorecard.ed.gov. Additionally, a federal regulation known as the Gainful Employment rule is meant to ensure that career training programs prepare students for jobs that pay enough to allow students to reasonably repay their student loan debt.  Under the first year of Gainful Employment disclosures, more than 98 percent of programs that failed the Gainful Employment criteria were operated by for-profit schools.  Of those that failed in Illinois, all were operated by for-profit companies.  Former Secretary DeVos unfortunately repealed this rule.  I hope we can reinstate this important protection for students.  Still, students should ask schools for Gainful Employment disclosures for the career education programs they are considering and use it to compare their options.  The most recently available Gainful Employment data for all career programs as of 2018 is available at https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-center/school/ge by clicking on “Download the Debt to Earnings data spreadsheet.” The Gainful Employment data will often reveal to students that their best option is to enroll in a community college.  Unlike for-profit schools, community colleges offer quality programs with credits that will almost always transfer to other schools.  They do this at a fraction of the cost and free of the predatory record that hangs over the for-profit college industry after years of misconduct.  I encourage you to work closely with your local community colleges and other not-for-profit institutions to ensure students have information on quality, affordable post-secondary education options. You have dedicated your life to preparing Illinois students for better opportunities through education.  For-profit colleges have proven themselves to be a direct threat to your life’s work.  For an Illinois student, getting the right information from the right person, especially at this time of uncertainty, can mean the difference between a successful future and a lifetime of student debt.  I appreciate your support in this effort and encourage you to reach out to my office at 202-224-2152 if you have any questions. Sincerely, -30-   [1] Department of

https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-statement-on-proposed-fda-rules-prohibiting-menthol-cigarettes-and-flavored-cigars,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) today released the following statement after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced regulations banning menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars: “For years, Big Tobacco has added menthol flavor to mask the harshness of cigarettes, and targeted these addictive, deadly products particularly to Black smokers. Prohibiting menthol in cigarettes and banning flavored cigars will save lives, reduce disparities, and improve health. Today’s announcement is a long-overdue step forward, and I will continue to push the FDA to protect our kids from Big Tobacco’s predatory tactics by prohibiting any menthol-flavored e-cigarettes.”   Today’s regulation is estimated to reduce smoking rates by 15 percent and prevent up to 650,000 smoking-related deaths. Durbin and Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) have pushed the FDA to act for years, previously sending a letter to the FDA to swiftly implement its proposed ban on menthol cigarettes and cigars. For more than 50 years, the tobacco industry has targeted Black Americans with pervasive marketing of menthol cigarettes through sponsorship of community and music events, magazine advertising, and retail promotions. Today, menthol cigarettes continue to be heavily advertised, widely available, and priced cheaper in Black communities, making them especially appealing to price-sensitive youth.  In the 1950s, less than 10 percent of Black smokers used menthol cigarettes. Today, about 85 percent of Black smokers smoke menthols (three times the rate of white smokers).  While Black smokers smoke less, they die of heart attacks, strokes, and other causes linked to tobacco use at higher rates than white smokers, and have lower success rates of quitting.-30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-questions-secretary-of-state-antony-blinken-on-situation-in-ukraine-at-senate-appropriations-committee-hearing,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), today at a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs hearing questioned Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the U.S. Department of State’s Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23) budget request. Durbin, Co-Chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, began his questioning asking about Ukraine’s needs following Putin’s unjustified and unprovoked war.“Are we falling short for what they need [Ukraine]? Are we doing enough from a diplomatic or military point of view?” Durbin asked.Blinken answered by stating the United States and other countries are coming together to ensure Ukrainians have the necessary resources. He also confirmed coordination efforts are swift and efficient – stating Ukrainians have the resources as soon as 72 hours from when President Biden signs off.   Durbin then raised the topic of war criminals, specifically legislation he plans to introduce to ensure the United States has the tools to hold accountable the perpetrators of war crimes and other atrocities. Due to gaps in existing law, many foreign war criminals who come to the U.S. cannot be prosecuted, held civilly liable, or deported for their crimes. For example, a Russian official or soldier who committed war crimes against Ukrainians and is later found in the United States could not be prosecuted in U.S. courts.  “We should make it clear to anyone engaged in Putin’s strategy–they will never find a comfortable, safe home in the United States. I hope to bring that to your attention and you’ll take a look at it,” Durbin said.Blinken confirmed they will look into this issue.  Durbin then asked if the State Department was aware of Mark Frerichs, an Illinois resident being held captive in Afghanistan. Blinken replied he is more than aware of the situation. Durbin again urged to bring Mark home.  He also mentioned ongoing concern over the troubling detention of Philippines Senator Leila DeLima. Video of Durbin’s remarks from the hearing is available here.Audio of Durbin’s remarks from the hearing is available here.Footage of Durbin’s remarks from the hearing is available here for TV Stations. -30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-confirms-critical-law-enforcement-positions-following-unanimous-consent-request,"WASHINGTON – Today, the Senate confirmed the nominations of eight U.S. Attorneys (USAs) and two U.S. Marshals (USMs) following a unanimous consent (UC) request by U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH).  The nominees included Ryan K. Buchanan, to be United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia; Jason M. Frierson, to be United States Attorney for the District of Nevada; Mark A. Totten, to be United States Attorney for the Western District of Michigan; Marisa T. Darden, to be United States Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio; Delia L.

Starting in 1994, Chief Reynolds held several high-ranking positions for the Oak Park Police Department. He has the experience to succeed and help keep our communities and our federal judiciary safe.” LaDon Reynolds served since 2019 as the Chief of Police and the Emergency Preparedness Coordinator for the Oak Park Police Department in Illinois before recently stepping down, and his service to the Oak Park Police Department began in 1994. Chief Reynolds has held numerous leadership positions while at the Department, including Detective Commander from 2010 to 2017, Deputy Police Chief from 2017 to 2018, and Acting Chief of Police from 2018 to 2019. In February, Chief Reynolds was favorably voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by a voice vote.  Over the course of the last three months, Durbin has asked unanimous consent twice on the Senate floor in an effort to confirm U.S. Attorney and U.S. Marshal nominees—including Chief Reynolds—whom Senate Republicans were holding.  Today, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) asked unanimous consent on 10 U.S. Attorney and U.S. Marshal nominees—including Chief Reynolds—and Republicans did not object, therefore confirming all 10 nominees. -30-"
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-d-davis-underwood-mark-senate-passage-of-veteran-rapid-retraining-assistance-program-restoration-and-recovery-act,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) and U.S. Representatives Danny Davis (D-IL-07) and Lauren Underwood (D-IL-14) today marked Senate passage of their legislation, the Veteran Rapid Retraining Assistance Program Restoration Act (S. 4089).  The bill passed the Senate last night by voice vote. Once passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, the bill would give the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) authority to restore benefits under the American Rescue Plan’s Veteran Rapid Retraining Assistance Program (VRRAP) to veterans whose education is interrupted by their school’s closure or loss of eligibility. It also gives VA the authority to recoup federal dollars from the fraudulent school. The legislation would help more than 300 Illinois veterans who were scammed out of their benefits by the unaccredited, for-profit Future Tech Career Institute in Chicago.  VRRAP was created by the American Rescue Plan to help veterans gain new skills to meet changing workforce demands during the pandemic. “During the pandemic, Congress created the Veteran Rapid Retraining Assistance Program to help veterans get the skills they need to get good jobs. Unfortunately, we have seen at least one example where a for-profit college took advantage of this program to line its own pockets at the expense of veterans and taxpayers,” said Durbin. “Our veterans deserve better. I introduced this bill to give student veterans a second chance at their education and give taxpayers the ability to recover lost funds. I urge the House to quickly pass this bill to deliver relief to Illinois student veterans and those across the country.”   “Veterans served our country with honor and earned their Rapid Retraining Assistance education benefits,” said Davis. “I am proud to work with Senator Durbin and Representative Underwood to restore these benefits to students who attended institutions that closed or experienced a disapproval of educational programming. I applaud the Senate for passing the Veterans Rapid Retraining Assistance Program Restoration and Recovery Act, and I will work with House leadership to pass this important bill with the urgency required to help veterans.” “We need to provide VA with the authority to ensure that no veteran is denied the benefits they have earned as they pursue post-military education,” said Underwood. “As a member of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, I am honored to be working with Senator Durbin and Representative Danny Davis on the Veterans Rapid Retraining Assistance Restoration and Recovery Act, which will restore important education benefits to veterans who have been ripped off by unaccredited institutions. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House to get this bill passed and signed into law.” -30-  "

During the meeting, Durbin also spoke about the need for Congress to pass immigration reform, as immigrants play a crucial role in keeping the hospitality industry running. Durbin went on to express his support for replenishing the Small Business Administration’s Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF), which granted more than $1.4 billion to 4,542 Illinois restaurants and bars. The RRF was created by the American Rescue Plan, which Democrats passed in March 2021.  Durbin is a cosponsor of the Continuing Emergency Support for Restaurants Act, which would provide an additional $48 billion for the RRF.“Illinois restaurants are the lifeblood of our communities. In the face of an unprecedented pandemic, Illinois restauranteurs showed resilience while Democrats worked persistently to provide them with the aid they needed,” said Durbin. “In my meeting with the Illinois Restaurant Association today, we discussed how I can continue to be a federal partner to Illinois’ restaurant industry as it deals with the ongoing economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.”Photos of the meeting are available here.-30-"

Durbin asked Ms. Freeman about her background as a public defender and specifically her representation of Anthony Velazquez. As Ms. Freeman argued, Mr. Velazquez’s trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to properly enter a plea of guilty but mentally ill. “Ms. Freeman I’d like if you can [speak to whether] you bring any particular bias to the role of circuit court judge based on your previous professional experience and if you could refer to your case of Anthony Velazquez which is a good illustration of your background,” said Durbin. Ms. Freeman confirmed in her more than twelve years as a federal public defender, she has been impartial. If confirmed, she would fairly and neutrally apply the facts. She reaffirmed the Third Circuit agreed procedural requirements had not been fulfilled in Mr. Velazquez’s case. Durbin also questioned Judge Stephanie Davis, nominee to be United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit. Durbin asked about her role in United States v. Shafinia, a case involving five defendants who were indicted for conspiring to issue fraudulent prescriptions for oxycontin—and other controlled substances. Judge Davis was a prosecutor in the case, one of the earliest prosecutions targeting the opioid epidemic in the Eastern District of Michigan. “Both of you bring extraordinary experience to this new pursuit in your careers and bring [diverse] personal and professional background, which are important for the court to see,” Durbin concluded. Video of Durbin’s questions to Ms. Freeman and Judge Davis in Committee is available here. Audio of Durbin’s questions to Ms. Freeman and Judge Davis in Committee is available here. Footage of Durbin’s questions to Ms. Freeman and Judge Davis in Committee is available here for TV Stations.  Durbin also questioned Evelyn Padin, nominee to be United States District Judge for the District of New Jersey; Jennifer Rearden, nominee to be United States District Judge for the District of New York; and Robert Huie, nominee to be United States District Judge for the District of the Southern District of California. Video of Durbin’s questions to Ms. Padin, Ms. Rearden, and Mr. Huie Committee is available here. Audio of Durbin’s questions to Ms. Padin, Ms. Rearden, and Mr. Huie in Committee is available here. Footage of Durbin’s questions to Ms. Padin, Ms. Rearden, and Mr. Huie in Committee is available here for TV Stations.   -30- "

https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-braun-introduce-legislation-to-improve-safety-and-ensure-transparency-of-dietary-supplement-industry,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) and U.S. Senator Mike Braun (R-IN) introduced the Dietary Supplement Listing Act of 2022, bipartisan legislation to require dietary supplement manufacturers to list their products with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  In 1994, Congress passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA), which provided FDA with authorities to regulate dietary supplements.  However, DSHEA did not require dietary supplement companies to register their products with FDA—leaving the agency without the much-needed authority or information to properly understand or oversee the market.  In 1994, there were 4,000 dietary supplements marketed in the United States.  Today, there are anywhere between 50,000 and 80,000.   “FDA—and consumers—should know what dietary supplements are on the market and what ingredients are included in them,” said Durbin, “There are tens of thousands of products on the market and we don’t know about many of them.  Americans deserve a transparent dietary supplement market, and it’s past time that we deliver it for them.  I’m grateful to Senator Braun for working with me on this important legislation.” “A large majority of Americans take dietary supplements daily, yet there is little transparency into this industry to allow patients and providers access to information needed to make decisions around dietary supplement consumption,” said Braun. “I am proud to introduce this legislation to improve visibility into the dietary supplement industry because American consumers deserve to know what they’re taking. Having this information will enhance Americans’ health care options.” “Today, FDA has few tools to spot and address dangerous supplement ingredients, and risky products are often found only after people have been harmed,” said Liz Richardson, director of The Pew Charitable Trusts’ health care products project. “This bipartisan, pragmatic proposal would bring transparency and stronger safety oversight to the vast dietary supplement marketplace. Nine in 10 adults support requiring manufacturers to inform the agency of all supplements they make and their ingredients. This bill would answer that call, and Congress should pass it without delay to ensure that FDA knows which products are being sold—and what’s in them.” “Transparency is the best disinfectant, and a mandatory product listing will give FDA and consumers visibility into the dietary supplement marketplace,” said Steve Mister, President & CEO Council for Responsible Nutrition. “CRN member companies produce a large portion of the dietary supplements marketed in the United States, so we know responsible industry supports mandatory product listing for supplements. We appreciate the opportunity to work with Sens. Durbin and Braun on this critical legislation.” ""The dietary supplement marketplace is an uncertain place for consumers -- so little transparency, so much confusion. The American Medical Association appreciates the bipartisan effort of Sens. Richard Durbin (D-IL) and Mike Braun (R-IN) to introduce some clarity to this situation. The Dietary Supplement Listing Act would create a much-needed electronic database so consumers can access vital product information. We urge Congress to be on the side of consumers and pass this legislation,"" said AMA President Gerald E. Harmon, M.D. The Dietary Supplement Listing Act of 2022 would require companies to provide FDA with vital information about their products, including product names; a list of all ingredients; an electronic copy of the label; allergen statements; health and structure/function claims, and more. This information would be made public to Americans. More than 75 percent of American adults use a dietary supplement.  No product is without risk, which is why greater oversight is needed.  In 2021, FDA received more than 2,400 adverse event reports related to dietary supplements.  However, due to significant underreporting, FDA estimates the actual annual number of adverse events is 50,000.  Over the last 27 years, annual dietary supplement sales increased from $4 billion to more than $50 billion. The legislation is endorsed by the Council for Responsible Nutrition, Pew Charitable Trusts, the American Medical Association, and U.S. Pharmacopeia. -30-  "
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-grassley-press-dhs-ig-on-reported-attempts-to-bury-allegations-of-widespread-sexual-harassment-and-misconduct,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, are pressing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Inspector General to address reports that it has delayed and downplayed reports of sexual harassment and misconduct at DHS.  In a letter to DHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari, the Senators cite documents recently released by the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), which suggest intolerable levels of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct at DHS.  These documents raise serious concerns about DHS OIG’s efforts to delay the release of an unpublished report containing troubling findings about apparent widespread sexual harassment and misconduct within the agency.  The Senators further asked Cuffari to explain his reasoning for removing certain information from draft reports and how these decisions comply with CIGIE standards. “The unpublished report reveals that a DHS OIG survey completed in 2018 found that more than 10,000 of 28,000 responding employees at DHS law enforcement components say that they have experienced sexual harassment or misconduct,” the Senators wrote. “The majority of respondents also said that they did not report the incidents, and of those who did, about 41 percent reported that doing so ‘negatively affected their careers.’” The Senators continued, “[D]elays and revisions in publishing the report appear to have downplayed the severity of the crisis… Sexual harassment and misconduct in agency ranks always demand immediate action. Any efforts by an OIG to obscure or downplay the seriousness or pervasiveness of the issue, or to improperly delay releasing evidence of misconduct, are inappropriate.” Full text of the letter to DHS Inspector General Cuffari is available here and below. April 26, 2022 Dear Inspector General Cuffari:             We write to express our concern regarding recent reports that you and senior officials in your office have diminished and delayed reports of sexual harassment and other misconduct at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). These reports raise serious questions about DHS Office of Inspector General’s (OIG) commitment to independent oversight and to defending the rights and safety of the tens of thousands of employees at DHS. Documents recently released by the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) suggest intolerable levels of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct at DHS, as well as DHS OIG’s efforts to delay the release of an unpublished report containing troubling findings about apparent widespread sexual harassment and misconduct within the agency.[1] The unpublished report reveals that a DHS OIG survey completed in 2018 found that more than 10,000 of 28,000 responding employees at DHS law enforcement components say that they have experienced sexual harassment or misconduct. The majority of respondents also said that they did not report the incidents, and of those who did, about 41 percent reported that doing so “negatively affected their careers.”[2] Such findings demand an urgent agency-wide response. However, delays and revisions in publishing the report appear to have downplayed the severity of the crisis. It’s also not clear that the OIG considered whether these findings triggered its statutory obligation to notify agency leadership and Congress “whenever the Inspector General becomes aware of serious or flagrant problems, abuses, or deficiencies.”[3] The documents released by POGO also indicate that the scope of a prior report related to domestic violence was substantially restricted, with the final version omitting findings and recommendations concerning DHS’s failure to adequately investigate or discipline personnel alleged to have committed domestic violence.[4]  In a July 9, 2020 email, you make several recommendations to the report, including removing language that would, in your words, risk DHS OIG “appearing biased” and put DHS OIG in a position to “second guess DHS disciplinary decisions” without having “full facts” and “potentially in violation of applicable rules.” It is not clear what rules you are referencing, why you believed the information that was removed would make the OIG appear “biased,” or why you believed that DHS OIG did not possess adequate evidence to make substantive claims and recommendations about these cases.   Sexual harassment and misconduct in agency ranks always demand immediate action. Any efforts by an OIG to obscure or downplay the seriousness or pervasiveness of the issue, or to improperly delay releasing evidence of misconduct, are inappropriate. To that end, please respond to the following questions as soon as possible, but no later than May 17, 2022:         Thank you for your prompt attention to this important request. Sincerely,  -30- [1] Chris Cameron, Homeland Security Watchdog Omitted Damaging Findings From Reports, The New York Times (Apr. 7, 2022), https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/07/us/politics/homeland-security-inspector-general.html.[2] Adam Zagorin and Nick Schwellenbach, Protecting the Predators at DHS, Project on Government Oversight (Apr. 7, 2022), https://www.pogo.org/investigation/2022/04/protecting-the-predators-at-dhs/.[3] 5 U.S.C.

https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-discusses-criminal-justice-and-public-safety-with-illinois-department-of-corrections-director-jeffreys,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee and lead sponsor of the landmark First Step Act, today met virtually with Rob Jeffreys, Director of the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC).  During their meeting, Durbin and Jeffreys discussed the Director’s reform efforts within IDOC, including improvements to programming, reentry services, and incentive-based corrections.  Durbin and Jeffreys also discussed ways in which the federal government can assist IDOC through grants and partnerships.“Establishing robust programming and incentives for incarcerated individuals—the vast majority of whom will return to their communities—is critical to improving public safety and reducing recidivism, which should be a primary goal of our criminal justice system,” said Durbin.  “I’m glad to work with Director Jeffreys on efforts to improve our justice system.” -30- "
https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-statement-on-president-bidens-clemency-grants-plan-to-increase-opportunity-for-formerly-incarcerated-persons,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee and lead sponsor of the landmark First Step Act, today released the following statement after President Biden announced a plan to expand opportunities for formerly incarcerated persons: “It is common sense that once incarcerated Americans complete their sentences and return to society, they should have a fair chance to fully participate in society.  Policy actions like these are critical to making our system of justice fairer and undoing the decades of harm that the failed ‘war on drugs’ caused—particularly in communities of color.  I commend President Biden for a plan that upholds the values of dignity, fairness, and belief in second chances.” Additionally, President Biden announced that he is pardoning three people who have demonstrated their commitment to rehabilitation, and commuting the sentences of 75 people who are serving long sentences for non-violent drug offenses, many of whom have been on home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic—and many of whom would have received a lower sentence if they were charged with the same offense today, thanks to the bipartisan First Step Act, which Durbin co-authored. “In far too many cases in our justice system, the punishment does not fit the crime.  This led to an explosion of the U.S. prison population due to lengthy sentences that are oftentimes unfair, fiscally irresponsible, and even a threat to public safety.  But today, more than 70 Americans are getting a second chance.  As we move forward with criminal justice reform in Congress, I urge the President to continue using the clemency process to improve the fairness of our criminal justice system.” Durbin has long championed efforts to address inequities in the criminal justice system and mandatory minimum sentencing.  In 2010, President Obama signed into law Durbin’s Fair Sentencing Act.  The bipartisan bill to curtail the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine marked the first time Congress has repealed a mandatory minimum since the Nixon administration. Durbin has since sponsored both the Smarter Sentencing Act and the Eliminating A Quantifiably Unjust Application Of The Law (EQUAL) Act.  In 2018, President Trump signed into law Durbin’s First Step Act (FSA), landmark prison and sentencing reform legislation that included key sentencing reforms from Durbin’s Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act.  As Chair of the Judiciary Committee, Durbin and Ranking Member Chuck Grassley (R-IA) introduced the bipartisan First Step Implementation Act, the COVID-19 Safer Detention Act, and the Prohibiting Punishment of Acquitted Conduct Act of 2021, legislation that aims to build on the FSA and continue Congress’s bipartisan efforts to make our criminal justice system fairer. -30-"
