https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-democratic-colleagues-reintroduce-bill-of-rights-for-airline-passengers,"The Airline Passengers’ Bill of Rights would put in place essential consumer protections for fliers, including passenger compensation for airline-caused delays and cancellations & payments to passengers for oversold flights [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – Ahead of a busy holiday travel season, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) along with U.S. Senators Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Bob Casey (D-PA) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) reintroduced comprehensive legislation to expand protections for air travelers. Among a host of key consumer protections, the Airline Passengers’ Bill of Rights would ensure that airlines provide passengers with fair compensation, refunds, and recourse in the event of airline-caused flight delays and cancellations, require airlines to pay at least $1,350 to passengers denied boarding as a result of an oversold flight, and mandate airlines to immediately refund bag fees for damaged or lost bags. “This comprehensive bill will make the skies friendlier for airline passengers,” said Blumenthal. “From skyrocketing fees and shrinking seats to airline-caused delays and cancellations, air travel has become stressful, unpredictable, and uncomfortable for fliers. As passengers are nickel-and-dimed at every turn, the airline industry has raked in billions. Americans are in dire need of stronger consumer rights and protections, and I’m proud to lead the Airline Passengers’ Bill of Rights to restore sanity to the skies.”“Exorbitant checked bag and change fees, shrinking seats, flight cancellations and delays, and growing dissatisfaction with the flying experience make a passengers’ bill of rights as important as a boarding pass,” said Markey. “Ensuring that airline customers have basic consumer rights every time they fly is a requirement in the 21st century, especially as we build back better from the global pandemic. The Airline Passengers’ Bill of Rights gives passengers control over their flying experience, returning fairness to the friendly skies.”“Almost everyone who has flown is familiar with how much of a hassle air travel can be, and COVID-19 has only amplified many of the challenges,” said Wyden. “It’s time for a new ‘Airline Passengers’ Bill of Rights and to stand up for the rights of all air passengers by ensuring ironclad consumer protections for air travel.”“Airlines are subjecting passengers to ever-shrinking seats and ever-increasing fees, leading to more stress for consumers and frontline staff who are doing their best to keep everyone safe during the pandemic,” said Whitehouse.  “Our Airline Passengers’ Bill of Rights will make air travel more predictable, affordable, and comfortable for the millions of Americans who fly each day.”This legislation expands on the advancements Blumenthal and Senate Commerce Committee Democrats have made on this issue, both in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act of 2018 and the 2016 FAA extension, and follows President Joe Biden’s August Executive Order directing the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to engage in a series of rulemakings to address unfair airline baggage and in-flight service fees.The Airline Passengers’ Bill of Rights would protect air travelers by:Requiring Airlines to Refund Tickets and Compensate Passengers for Delays and Cancellations Caused by the AirlinesRequires airlines to provide ticket refunds and alternative transportation for flights delayed between one and four hours.Requires airlines to provide ticket refunds, alternate transportation, compensation, and cover the cost of meals and lodging (as applicable) for flights delayed more than four hours.Directs the DOT to facilitate interline agreements between airlines to ensure availability of alternative flights.Cracks down on airlines using weather as an excuse for delays and cancellations that are actually the airlines’ fault.Providing Compensation for Involuntary Denied BoardingEstablishes that $1,350 is the minimum level of compensation an air carrier or foreign air carrier must pay to a passenger who is involuntarily denied boarding as the result of an oversold flight.Encourages airlines to provide compensation to passengers who relinquish their seat in the form of a cash payment.Prohibits airlines from imposing a cap on the amount of compensation provided to a passenger for relinquishing their seat.Stopping Airlines from Endangering Safety by Shrinking SeatsProhibits airlines from shrinking seat size further until DOT implements a minimum seat size requirement.Bolstering the Transparency of Passengers’ Rights Requires airline employees to undergo biannual training on passengers’ rights.Ensures that passengers receive a clear explanation of their rights at ticket purchase and throughout travel. Protecting Basic Humanity on PlanesRequires that the FAA study food and water safety on aircraft and mandate drinking water and restrooms be available free of charge.Requires working restrooms on all aircraft and that restrooms must accommodate passengers with disabilities.Grounding Sky-High Nickel-and-Dime FeesProhibits airlines from charging exorbitant, unnecessary fees that bear no relation to the service provided.Requires airlines reveal the true costs of flying and offer lowest fares on multi-segment flights.Requires airlines be transparent about changes and costs associated with frequent flyer programs.Requires airlines refund bag fees immediately for damaged or lost bags.Restoring Consumers’ Rights to Pursue Claims against AirlinesReinstates the right of passengers to sue airlines in federal and state court for unfair and deceptive practices.Reinstates the right of passengers with disabilities to sue airlines in federal court for denying basic access.Improves process for passengers to submit airline complaints and forces airlines to address concerns quickly.Bolstering DOT’s Enforcement against the Airline IndustryRequires the DOT to explain reasons for failing to impose penalties on airlines for violations of passenger rights.Institutes a study by DOT and consumer groups on the feasibility of system in which fines on airlines go directly to passengers.Eliminates the cap on fines that DOT charges airlines for violating consumer protection laws and prevents airlines from negotiating low, slap-on-the wrist fines for egregious conduct.Addressing Lack of Meaningful Competition in the Airline Industry-30-"

Markey (D-MA), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Rick Scott (R-FL) introduced a bipartisan a resolution to recognize the significant scientific, educational, and economic contributions made by the Arecibo Observatory telescope. The Arecibo telescope, completed in 1963, was the world’s largest single-aperture telescope for more than five decades, and collapsed one year ago this week.“The telescope at Puerto Rico’s Arecibo Observatory was a scientific marvel, extensively expanding our understanding of the universe,” said Blumenthal. “Its collapse left a significant educational void for our country and the scientific community across the world. I’m proud to recognize its important contributions alongside my colleagues and express our strong support for further studies for how best to replace—and build upon—this telescope’s capabilities at the world-class Arecibo Observatory.”“For decades, the telescope at the Arecibo Observatory provided us with new atmospheric insights, solar system information, and heightened imagination for the future of scientific discovery,” said Markey. “While its collapse last year left gaping holes in our research, I am proud to join Senator Blumenthal to introduce this resolution to encourage the National Science Foundation to find the best pathway forward in replacing the iconic telescope. We can restore Puerto Rico’s scientific prowess, while also preserving the historic and cultural significance of the Arecibo Observatory.”“The Arecibo Observatory contributed to numerous scientific advances and served as a source of inspiration for so many people in Puerto Rico and beyond,” said Warren. “The collapse of its main telescope one year ago was a major loss, and we must explore ways to replace the telescope and recognize the historical and cultural significance of the Arecibo Observatory.”Over its 57 years in operation, the Arecibo telescope significantly advanced STEM education and played a vital role within the scientific community. The Senate resolution recognizes the loss of this important scientific instrument for the research community and the important role it played in advancing the studies of space and atmospheric sciences, radar astronomy and planetary sciences, astronomy, and astrophysics. The resolution encourages the National Science Foundation (NSF), the current owner of the Arecibo Observatory, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to work with other agencies to continue their studies to determine the most appropriate way to replace the scientific capabilities that were lost at the observatory, utilizing new state-of-the-art technologies at the site.The full text of the Senate resolution can be found here.

Markey (D-MA), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), y Rick Scott (R-FL) presentaron una resolución bipartidista para reconocer las importantes contribuciones científicas, educativas y económicas del telescopio del Observatorio de Arecibo.“El telescopio del Observatorio de Arecibo fue una maravilla científica, que expandió ampliamente nuestra comprensión del universo. Su colapso dejó un impactante vacío educativo para nuestro país y la comunidad científica en todo el mundo. Estoy orgulloso de reconocer sus importantes contribuciones junto con mis colegas y expresar nuestro firme apoyo para que se realicen más estudios sobre la mejor manera de reemplazar y construir sobre las capacidades de este telescopio en el Observatorio de Arecibo de clase mundial”, dijo Blumenthal.“Durante décadas, el telescopio del Observatorio de Arecibo nos brindó nuevos conocimientos atmosféricos, información del sistema solar y una mayor imaginación para el futuro de los descubrimientos científicos. Su colapso el año pasado dejó enormes agujeros en nuestra investigación científica, estoy orgulloso de unirme al senador Blumenthal para presentar esta resolución para alentar a la Fundación Nacional de Ciencia a encontrar el mejor camino a seguir para reemplazar el icónico telescopio. Podemos restaurar la destreza científica de Puerto Rico, al mismo tiempo que preservamos la importancia histórica y cultural del Observatorio de Arecibo”, dijo Markey.“El Observatorio de Arecibo contribuyó a numerosos avances científicos y sirvió como fuente de inspiración para tantas personas en Puerto Rico y alrededor del mundo. El colapso de su telescopio principal hace un año fue una gran pérdida, y debemos explorar formas para reemplazar el telescopio y reconocer la importancia histórica y cultural del Observatorio de Arecibo”, dijo Warren.Durante sus 57 años de funcionamiento, el telescopio de Arecibo avanzó significativamente en temas educativos de las ciencias, la tecnología, la ingeniería y matemáticas. El telescopio de Arecibo desempeñó un trabajo vital dentro de la comunidad científica. La resolución del Senado reconoce la pérdida de este importante instrumento científico para la comunidad investigadora y el importante trabajo que desempeñó en el avance de los estudios de las ciencias espaciales y atmosféricas, la astronomía de radar y las ciencias planetarias, al igual que en temas de la astronomía y la astrofísica. La resolución insta a la Fundación Nacional de Ciencias, el actual propietario del Observatorio de Arecibo, y a la Administración Nacional de Aeronáutica y del Espacio  a trabajar con otras agencias para continuar sus estudios para determinar la forma más adecuada de reemplazar las capacidades científicas que se perdieron en el observatorio, utilizando nuevas tecnologías.El texto completo de la resolución del Senado está aquí.

https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-and-toomey-introduce-legislation-to-increase-food-donations_promote-food-security,"Introduced on Giving Tuesday, the legislation would expand food donation efforts of manufacturers, restaurants, grocers, & others[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – Today, U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Pat Toomey (R-PA) introduced the Food Donation Improvement Act to expand food donation efforts across the country. With millions of Americans facing food insecurity, ambiguous, outdated, and limited liability protections often prevent many businesses and organizations from donating food. The Food Donation Improvement Act would encourage food donation efforts by extending liability protections to food donors when food is either given directly to a person in need or when a recipient pays a deeply reduced cost.“This bill will eliminate legal roadblocks that discourage food donations by restaurants, retailers, and others,” said Blumenthal. “Nearly 40 percent of our nation’s food goes to waste – creating a clear opportunity and imperative to help Americans going hungry every day. I’m proud to partner with Senator Toomey on this bipartisan effort to enable timely and efficient food donations to Americans facing food insecurity.”“Food donations make a big difference in the lives of many Americans, and Congress should make donating food to the less fortunate as easy as possible,” said Toomey. “The bipartisan Food Donation Improvement Act will reduce food waste and help get more food to those who need it most by shielding good faith donors from frivolous lawsuits.”The Food Donation Improvement Act would extend liability protections to food donors when food is given directly to a person in need rather than a nonprofit intermediary, or when food is given at a deeply reduced cost. Expanding these protections would allow retail grocers, wholesalers, agricultural producers, restaurants, caterers, school food authorities, and higher education institutions to increase the quantity and efficiency of their food donation efforts. The bill would also clarify labeling standards that food products must meet to be eligible for liability protections. The text of the legislation is available here.-30-"
https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-and-blackburn-introduce-legislation-to-protect-kids-from-ingesting-button-batteries,"The bipartisan Reese’s Law, named in honor of 18-month-old Reese Hamsmith, will create stronger federal safety standards for products with button cell and coin batteries to prevent them from being easily ingested by children[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – Today, U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security, introduced Reese’s Law to strengthen safety standards for products with button batteries. The bipartisan bill is named in honor of Reese Hamsmith, an 18-month-old child who died last year after ingesting a button cell battery from a remote control. Button batteries are frequently found in everyday items including cameras, calculators, battery-operated candles, flashing apparel, and even greeting cards. Blumenthal and Blackburn unveiled the legislation during a hearing earlier today with Reese Hamsmith’s mother, Trista Hamsmith, founder of Reese’s Purpose.“Stronger safety standards for button batteries can prevent thousands of serious injuries—often requiring trips to the emergency room,” said Blumenthal. “Reese Hamsmith died tragically when she swallowed this small but deadly hazard found commonly in items around the house. Reese’s mom Trista powerfully turned her grief into advocacy to save others. This common-sense bill would require products with button cell and coin batteries to have clear warning labels and child-resistant battery compartments, helping save other families from experiencing the Hamsmith family’s pain.”“Cheaply made and counterfeit products from overseas — especially from China — can directly threaten consumer safety,” said Blackburn. “Reese’s Law will encourage the industry to collaborate with the Consumer Product Safety Commission on solutions to protect kids and families from products that are so poorly designed they may be life-threatening. Especially during the Christmas season, product safety must be a priority.”“In Reese’s hospital room there was a plaque that read ‘He has a plan and I have a purpose.’ Reese’s Purpose and my mission was born from this tragedy,” said Trista Hamsmith. “Every week I hear from parents who don’t know how dangerous these batteries are and how easily children can access them, especially during the holidays. Last year at this time Reese was fighting for her life. Now I fight to protect other children and families from this same fate. Reese’s Law is our opportunity to protect all the children who can’t - and shouldn’t have to - protect themselves.”Small button cell and coin batteries pose a serious danger to young children and infants if swallowed, but many products with these batteries lack sufficient safety mechanisms. Button cell and coin batteries are used in toys, remotes, portable electronics, games, and many other products commonly found in homes and child care facilities. Swallowing button batteries can cause serious injuries or death for some children, including severe internal burns.Reese’s Law will direct the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to create safety standards to prevent accidental ingestion of button batteries by children, including:Reese’s Law was introduced by U.S. Representatives Robin Kelly (D-IL), Jodey Arrington (R-TX), and Ted Lieu (D-CA) in the House in September, and has been endorsed by a number of advocacy and consumer protection groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, Consumer Reports, Kids In Danger (KID), and the Consumer Federation of America.“It’s far too easy for children to access these batteries, and if they swallow them, they can be seriously injured or killed,” said William Wallace, manager of safety policy for Consumer Reports. “Families urgently need a strong law on the books that will force companies to put safety first. Congress should pass Reese’s Law to help keep children safe from preventable harm.”“I applaud Senators Blumenthal and Blackburn for introducing Reese's Law which would create safety standards for button cell batteries to reduce accidental ingestion by children,” said Nancy Cowles, executive director of the nonprofit Kids In Danger (KID). “And also Reese’s family for pushing for measures that come too late for Reese. At KID, we hear all too often about severe injuries and death when a child ingests one of these ubiquitous batteries, often with their parents unaware the battery was even accessible. The requirements for child resistant packaging and compartments, along with warnings are vital to keeping children safe.”“Button cell batteries pose serious and potentially fatal ingestion hazards to thousands of children each year,” said Rachel Weintraub, Legislative Director and General Counsel with Consumer Federation of America. “For far too long, effective solutions have not been implemented nor required to adequately protect children from this hidden hazard. We applaud Senators Blumenthal and Blackburn for introducing Reese’s Law which will require strong standards that will prevent these serious hazards in the future. We look forward to working together to make this bill law.”The text of the legislation can be found here.-30-"
https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-schumer-lujan-and-tonko-announce-bicameral-legislation-to-stop-cyber-grinches-from-stealing-christmas,"Online bots buy up popular toys & send toy prices surging ahead of the holidays[WASHINGTON, D.C.]  – With holiday shopping underway, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), U.S. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-NY), U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), and U.S. Representative Paul Tonko (D-NY) today announced the introduction of the Stopping Grinch Bots Act. The bicameral bill will crack down on cyber Grinches using “bot” technology to quickly buy up whole inventories of popular holiday toys and resell them to parents at higher prices. These third-party sellers use bots to bypass security measures and manipulate online sales systems to buy toys, leading to some toys being almost impossible to buy online or in stores at retail prices, exacerbating shortages caused by stressed supply chains.“This bill seeks to stop Cyber Grinch greed from ruining kids’ holidays,” said Blumenthal. “New tools are needed to block cyber scammers who snap up supplies of popular toys and resell them at astronomic prices. Price gouging hot toys by Grinch bots should have zero tolerance.”“The average holiday shopper is unable to compete with the light speed of the all-too-common Grinch bot and are then held at ransom by scalpers and third-party resellers when trying to buy holiday presents. After a particularly trying year, no parent or American should have to fork over hundreds - or even thousands - of dollars to buy Christmas and holiday gifts for their children and loved ones,” said Majority Leader Schumer. “It is of upmost importance that these Grinch bots are thwarted in their attempts to steal Christmas - and money - from hardworking Americans.”“The rush of the holiday season leaves far too many Americans vulnerable to the malicious practices of Grinch bots that manipulate the market and drive up prices,” said Luján. “This is a sacred time to be spent with family and loved ones. Americans should not be stressed financially by online algorithms that hoard high-demand toys and goods and resell them at huge margins. This critical legislation will protect New Mexico's consumers during the holidays and year round.”“At a time when families should be able to spend time with their loved ones, digital “Grinch bots” are forcing Americans to scour online sites in the hopes of finding an affordable gift or paying exorbitant prices for a single toy,” said Tonko. “These bots don’t just squeeze consumers, they pose a problem for small businesses, local retailers and other entrepreneurs trying to ensure they have the best items in stock for their customers. Our Grinch Bots Act works to level the playing field and prevent scalpers from sucking hardworking parents dry this holiday season. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this legislation immediately to stop these Grinch bots from stealing the holidays.” The legislation is supported by a number of consumer organizations, including Consumer Reports, Consumer Federation of America, and the National Consumer League.“Shoppers shouldn't have to compete with unscrupulous cyber Grinches who use automated bots to snatch up hundreds of products in a matter of seconds and re-sell them at outrageous prices,” said Chuck Bell, Advocacy Program Director at Consumer Reports. “This bill will help stop this predatory practice and create a more level playing field so everyone has a fair chance of buying popular products at reasonable prices when shopping online.” “Consumers shouldn’t have to fight armies of bots to buy the products they want from the online retailers they want to do business with,” said Susan Grant, Director of Privacy and Consumer Protection at Consumer Federation of America. “We support outlawing sneaky tactics that shady operators use to corner the market on popular items and then charge consumers excessive prices for them.”“Finding the right gift this holiday season is going to be difficult enough as it is,” said John Breyault, Vice President of Public Policy, Telecommunications, and Fraud for the National Consumers League. “Shoppers shouldn’t have to also compete against resellers who use sophisticated software to buy up in-demand toys in an instant. The National Consumers League is proud to support the Stopping Grinch Bots Act, which would ensure that consumers have a fair shot at finding the right gifts for their loved ones.”Bots are software programs that can automatically spot and snap up inventory on sale online. In a matter of seconds, third-party vendors can purchase hundreds of items, squeezing out parents and children. In 2016, Blumenthal, Schumer, and Tonko’s Better Online Ticket Sales Act (BOTS Act) was signed into law to ban “ticket bots” that intentionally bypass security measures on online ticketing websites to unfairly outprice individual fans. This new legislation would apply the mechanism of the BOTS Act to e-commerce sites to ban bots bypassing security measures on online retail sites. -30-"
https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/promoting-app-store-competition-bipartisan-support-grows-for-the-open-app-markets-act,"As Apple & Google continue to exercise gatekeeper control of the multi-billion dollar app economy, bipartisan support grows for antitrust legislation to promote competition & boost consumer choice[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – Amid building momentum to rein in Big Tech’s anticompetitive practices, U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) announced growing bipartisan support for the Open App Markets Act, which would set fair, clear, and enforceable rules to protect competition and strengthen consumer protections within the app market. The legislation, first introduced in August along with Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), was recently co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Lindsey Graham (R-SC).Two companies, Google and Apple, have gatekeeper control of the two dominant mobile operating systems and their app stores. Google and Apple’s dominance allows them to exclusively dictate the terms of the app market, inhibiting competition and restricting consumer choice. More information on the legislation is available here.“Apple and Google have reigned over the multi-billion app market for years, restricting consumer choice and squashing competitors,” said Blumenthal. “There is clear, growing bipartisan momentum for the Open App Markets Act to break their ironclad grip, open the app economy to new competitors, and give users more control over their own devices.”“Big Tech giants are forcing their own app stores on users at the expense of innovative start-ups,” said Blackburn. “My colleagues and I are committed to ensuring U.S. consumers and small businesses are not punished by Big Tech giants like Apple and Google. American consumers should be able to benefit from a competitive app store marketplace and choose the products that suit their needs.”“Competition is critical to protecting small businesses and consumers and spurring new ideas. But as mobile technologies have become essential to our daily lives, a few gatekeepers controlling the app marketplace have emerged, wielding incredible power over which apps consumers can access,” said Klobuchar. “Since introducing this legislation, it has only become more clear that this raises serious competition concerns. As support for our bill continues to grow, I will keep working to move this legislation forward to ensure an innovative and fair app marketplace.”“Too often, Big Tech companies exploit their market power to squeeze out competitors, leading to fewer choices and higher prices for American consumers,” said Rubio. “By blocking these companies from abusing their gatekeeper positions, the Open App Markets Act will force long overdue competition into Silicon Valley, provide more options for users, and reduce the control of Big Tech over Americans’ day-to-day lives.”“I am proud to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bipartisan legislation,” said Lummis. “For too long, Apple and Google have created walled gardens around their app stores. History has shown time and time again that when a single company, from railroads to phones, has complete control over a closed ecosystem, it stifles innovation and ultimately hurts consumers. This legislation would introduce much-needed competition into these app store ecosystems. I will continue to fight for the people of Wyoming to ensure a free and fair digital marketplace.”“For years, two tech giants have used their position as gatekeepers to limit the ability of their competitors and tech startups to participate fairly in the mobile app marketplace,” said Booker. “I am proud to join my colleagues in introducing this bipartisan legislation that sets fair rules of the road to hold these dominant tech companies accountable, spurs competition and innovation within the app economy, and strengthens consumer protections.”“The time has come for these largely unregulated Big Tech giants to either be broken up, regulated, or subject to litigation for their actions,” said Graham. “These companies have an enormous impact on the day-to-day lives of the American people and enjoy protections other industries do not have. Both Democrats and Republicans agree: the time has come for fairness in the app market.”The Open App Markets Act has also been endorsed by a number of technology and consumer groups, including Consumer Reports, Internet Accountability Project, Public Citizen, Coalition for App Fairness, Color Of Change, News Media Alliance, Public Knowledge, Lincoln Network, Consumer Action for a Strong Economy (CASE), Digital Progress Institute, Electronic Frontier Foundation, American Principles Project, and the American Economic Liberties Project.-30-"
https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-and-lamb-lead-introduction-of-legislation-to-restore-amtrak-riders-legal-rights_protections,"[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – Today, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and U.S. Representative Conor Lamb (D-PA) led their colleagues in introducing bicameral legislation to restore legal rights and protections to Amtrak riders who are currently prevented from seeking justice in the courts and joining together to seek accountability for their claims.Amtrak implemented its forced arbitration and class action ban policy in January 2019, specifically writing it to be “as broad as legally permissible,” including discrimination and any personal injury claims. Under this change, with the purchase of an Amtrak ticket, customers waive their right to sue Amtrak in a U.S. court for any reason. The policy also includes passengers who have tickets bought for them, including minors. Forced arbitration also discourages customers from filing complaints for smaller violations by instituting high fees and extended timelines. Airlines are already prohibited from using mandatory forced arbitration.Amtrak put the policy in place after incidents like the 2015 train derailment in Philadelphia and the 2017 derailment in Washington State, which resulted in multi-million dollar settlements for the victims. Following a derailment of an Amtrak train in Montana last month, several injured passengers have filed lawsuits against Amtrak, which seek to challenge the company’s forced arbitration policy.“This bill will restore vital legal rights to the travelers who are injured on Amtrak trains and seek just redress,” said Blumenthal, member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. “Amtrak’s current forced arbitration and class action ban policies are unjust and unfair. Riders are often unaware they’ve signed away their legal rights with the purchase of a ticket until the worst happens, like so many passengers impacted by the Montana crash discovered first hand. Legal accountability will be a powerful incentive to safer Amtrak practices.”“Requiring forced arbitration agreements unfairly limits consumer rights and protections,” said Lamb, a member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. “Congress needs to take action to restore the legal rights of Amtrak passengers and their families.”The Ending Passenger Rail Forced Arbitration Act is co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Bob Casey (D-PA), and Gary Peters (D-MI), and U.S. Representatives Donald M. Payne, Jr. (D-NJ) and Marilyn Strickland (D-WA).The Ending Passenger Rail Forced Arbitration Act is endorsed by Public Citizen, American Association for Justice (AAJ), National Disability Rights Network (NDRN), and the Rail Passengers Association. “Amtrak receives nearly $2 billion annually in taxpayer dollars, yet shields itself from public scrutiny that an open and neutral court system provides,” said Counsel for Civil Justice and Consumer Rights at Public Citizen Remington A. Gregg. “Forced arbitration clauses are anti-transparency clauses. Amtrak should be prevented from using them. We applaud Sen. Blumenthal and Rep. Lamb for introducing the Ending Passenger Rail Forced Arbitration Act which will ensure that Amtrak puts its customers first and restores their access to justice when harmed.”“Amtrak cannot be allowed to subject its passengers to forced arbitration after injuring or killing them in train derailments, like we saw last month in Montana,” said AAJ CEO Linda Lipsen. “We applaud Senator Blumenthal and Representative Lamb for their continued leadership on behalf of those who seek justice from Amtrak.”“The National Disability Rights Network applauds Congress for protecting the rights of passengers by restricting Amtrak’s forced arbitration clause,” said NDRN Executive Director Curt Decker. “Amtrak’s policies prevent average Americans from bringing necessary lawsuits when things go wrong. In a world where accessibility is often lacking for people with disabilities, litigation is an important tool in upholding their rights; Amtrak’s current policies rob passengers with disabilities of their right to speak up after an accident.”“For millions of Americans, Amtrak is an essential means of transportation,” said Jim Mathews, President & CEO of the Rail Passengers Association. “Whether they live in rural America, a mid-sized city that lost its airport, or on the Northeast Corridor, these passengers rely on Amtrak service to go about their lives and forced arbitration isn’t the right policy. Our members thank Sen. Blumenthal and Rep. Lamb for introducing the Ending Passenger Rail Forced Arbitration Act, which ensures passengers access to a fair process for dispute resolution. We encourage Amtrak to listen to the message Congress is sending and focus on its mission to expand reliable, frequent passenger rail service to more Americans.”The full text of the Senate version of the legislation is available here and the House version of the legislation is available here.-30-"

The Wall Street Journal’s reporting reveals Facebook’s leadership to be focused on a growth-at-all-costs mindset that valued profits over the health and lives of children and teens. When given the opportunity to come clean to us about their knowledge of Instagram’s impact on young users, Facebook provided evasive answers that were misleading and covered up clear evidence of significant harm. We are in touch with a Facebook whistleblower and will use every resource at our disposal to investigate what Facebook knew and when they knew it – including seeking further documents and pursuing witness testimony. The Wall Street Journal’s blockbuster reporting may only be the tip of the iceberg.”In August, Blumenthal and Blackburn wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling on the tech giant to release its internal research on the potentially harmful impact of its platforms – including Instagram Kids – on youth mental health and explain how this research has been used to further promote and market their products to young users.In May, Blumenthal and Blackburn held a hearing on protecting kids online. With children’s screen time surging on popular apps like TikTok, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram, kids are being exposed to safety and privacy issues including data collection, aggressive marketing, and sexual exploitation.-30-"
https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-and-markey-call-for-ftc-investigation-into-teslas-misleading-advertising-of-driving-automation-systems,"“Tesla and Mr. Musk’s repeated overstatements of their vehicle’s capabilities – despite clear and frequent warnings – demonstrate a deeply concerning disregard for the safety of those on the road and require real accountability.”[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – Amid a series of Tesla crashes, U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Edward J. Markey (D-MA), members of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, voiced serious concerns about Tesla’s misleading advertising and marketing of its Autopilot and Full-Self Driving (FSD) features to consumers, and called on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to launch an investigation and take enforcement action.“Tesla’s marketing has repeatedly overstated the capabilities of its vehicles, and these statements increasingly pose a threat to motorists and other users of the road,” wrote the senators to FTC Chair Lina Khan. “Accordingly, we urge you to open an investigation into potentially deceptive and unfair practices in Tesla’s advertising and marketing of its driving automation systems and take appropriate enforcement action to ensure the safety of all drivers on the road.”“[T]here are no fully autonomous vehicles currently available on the market,” the senators continued, stressing the limitations of Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD technology. “Understanding these limitations is essential, for when drivers’ expectations exceed their vehicle’s capabilities, serious and fatal accidents can and do result.” The lawmakers cited specific examples of Tesla’s advertising to consumers in which the company overstates the capabilities of its technology, including a 2019 YouTube video the company posted on its channel, titled “Full Self-Driving” showing a Tesla driving on its own, which has been viewed more than 18 million times.“Tesla drivers listen to these claims and believe their vehicles are equipped to drive themselves – with potentially deadly consequences,” wrote the senators, emphasizing that at least 11 people have died in fatal crashes with Autopilot activated since Tesla introduced the feature in 2015. One California driver was arrested for riding in the backseat of his Tesla while the vehicle was in Autopilot on the highway and pointed to Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s claims about Tesla’s systems as justification for his actions.The full text of the letter can be found here.-30-"
https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-and-dingell-introduce-legislation-requiring-va-to-reimburse-veterans-for-emergency-health-care-claims,"The VA filed court appeal to avoid payout despite two lost court cases ruling it is responsible for payment of veterans’ emergency care claims; Some veterans have been waiting over a decade to receive emergency care reimbursements[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – Today, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and U.S. Representative Debbie Dingell (D-MI) led the introduction of legislation that would mandate the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to reimburse veterans’ emergency health care expenses from non-VA facilities that are not covered by the veteran’s private insurance. This bicameral legislation follows the 2016 Staab v. McDonald and 2019 Wolfe v. Wilkie decisions, both ruling that the VA must reimburse veterans for these emergency medical expenses.“This bill compels the VA to pay for emergency care—as it should have done long ago without a new law,” said Blumenthal. “It’s simple fairness and common sense that emergency care should be covered, at a time when care is most critical, just like other medical treatment. Two separate courts have found the VA to be acting illegally as it continues to deny paying for hundreds of thousands of veterans’ emergency room care. Congress must step in to right this legal and moral failure, ensuring our veterans get the support they deserve.”“No veteran should ever have to worry about whether they can afford costly medical expenses, especially when it comes to an emergency,” said Dingell. “Yet, the VA is currently disregarding court rulings and continuing to deny veterans’ reimbursement claims for any non-VA emergency medical expense. With the Veterans Emergency Care Reimbursement Act, we can address this inexcusable issue head-on and ensure that those who put their lives on the line for us are receiving the proper support and care they deserve through the VA.”Hundreds of thousands of veterans apply each year to the VA for reimbursement of emergency medical care expenses at non-VA facilities. The VA has always reimbursed emergency care expenses incurred by veterans who do not have health insurance.  However, for over a decade the VA has refused to pay for emergency care expenses if the veterans have other health insurance. This leaves insured veterans on the hook to pay deductibles and coinsurance, which can amount to thousands of dollars for just one episode of care. The legislation has been co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) in the Senate.The legislation is endorsed by the National Veterans Legal Services Program (NVLSP), Paralyzed Veterans of America, and America’s Warrior Partnership.“We are grateful for the commitment and efforts of Senators Blumenthal and Rep. Dingell and Members of Congress to introduce this bill to right a terrible wrong for the hundreds of thousands of veterans who have endured needless financial hardships because of the VA’s illegal treatment of their emergency reimbursement claims,” said NVLSP Executive Director Paul Wright. The full text of the Senate legislation can be found here. The House introduced a similar version of the legislation.-30-"
https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-blackburn-and-klobuchar-introduce-bipartisan-antitrust-legislation-to-promote-app-store-competition,"Apple & Google have gatekeeper control of the multi-billion dollar app economy, stifling competition & disadvantaging consumers[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) introduced the Open App Markets Act, which would set fair, clear, and enforceable rules to protect competition and strengthen consumer protections within the app market. Two companies, Google and Apple, have gatekeeper control of the two dominant mobile operating systems and their app stores that allow them to exclusively dictate the terms of the app market, inhibiting competition and restricting consumer choice. “This legislation will tear down coercive anticompetitive walls in the app economy, giving consumers more choices and smaller startup tech companies a fighting chance,” said Blumenthal. “For years, Apple and Google have squashed competitors and kept consumers in the dark—pocketing hefty windfalls while acting as supposedly benevolent gatekeepers of this multi-billion dollar market. I’m proud to partner with Senators Blackburn and Klobuchar in this breakthrough blow against Big Tech bullying. This bipartisan bill will help break these tech giants’ ironclad grip, open the app economy to new competitors, and give mobile users more control over their own devices.”  “Big Tech giants are forcing their own app stores on users at the expense of innovative start-ups,” said Blackburn. “Apple and Google want to prevent developers and consumers from using third-party app stores that would threaten their bottom line. Their anticompetitive conduct is a direct affront to a free and fair marketplace. Senator Blumenthal, Klobuchar, I are committed to ensuring U.S. consumers and small businesses are not punished by Big Tech dominance.”“Competition is critical to protecting small businesses and consumers, spurring innovation, and promoting economic equity. But as mobile technologies have become essential to our daily lives, it has become clear that a few gatekeepers control the app marketplace, wielding incredible power over which apps consumers can access. This raises serious competition concerns,” said Klobuchar. “By establishing new rules for app stores, this legislation levels the playing field and is an important step forward in ensuring an innovative and competitive app marketplace.”Mobile devices are central to consumers’ economic, social, and civic lives, and the mobile app market is a significant part of the digital economy. In 2020 alone, U.S. consumers spent nearly $33 billion in mobile app stores, downloading 13.4 billion apps.According to numerous reports, including testimony provided in a Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee hearing held in April and chaired by Klobuchar, both Apple and Google have appeared to use their powerful gatekeeper control to stifle competition in the app store market. For example, Apple has prevented the creation of third-party app stores on iPhones, required that apps exclusively use their own expensive payment system, and penalized app developers for telling users about discounted offers. These strict terms close off avenues of competition and drive up prices for consumers. Startups also face serious challenges when Big Tech gatekeepers are able to prioritize their own apps to the disadvantage of others, make use of competitors’ confidential business information, and block developers from using features on a consumers’ phone.   The Open App Markets Act would protect developers’ rights to tell consumers about lower prices and offer competitive pricing; protect sideloading of apps; open up competitive avenues for startup apps, third party app stores, and payment services; make it possible for developers to offer new experiences that take advantage of consumer device features; give consumers more control over their devices; prevent app stores from disadvantaging developers; and set safeguards to continue to protect privacy, security, and safety of consumers.The Open App Markets Act has been endorsed by a number of technology and consumer groups, including Consumer Reports, Internet Accountability Project, Public Citizen, Coalition for App Fairness, Color Of Change, News Media Alliance, Public Knowledge, Lincoln Network, Consumer Action for a Strong Economy (CASE), Digital Progress Institute, Electronic Frontier Foundation, American Principles Project, and the American Economic Liberties Project.“The targeted market rules proposed in this legislation will help create an app ecosystem that is fairer and more competitive, and will enable unfettered innovation by all companies – big and small – to the benefit of consumers,” said Sumit Sharma, Senior Researcher, Technology Competition at Consumer Reports. “The legislation is crucial as smartphones have become central to our digital ecosystem, and apps are increasingly the primary mode for consumers to access online services.”“There’s no doubt the fight against Big Tech is a battle of David versus Goliath,” said Mike Davis, Founder and President, Internet Accountability Project. “The Internet Accountability Project applauds Sens. Blackburn, Blumenthal, and Klobuchar for their bipartisan leadership. The Open App Markets Act takes a serious crack at breaking up Big Tech monopolies and increasing competition and innovation, all while protecting user privacy. Startups should have a fighting chance against monopolists, and this legislation takes an important step toward ending the crushing dominance of Big Tech.”“The power of large app stores to extract enormous profits is a direct result of the anticompetitive and unfair way in which the stores are operated and controlled,” said Alex Harman, Competition Policy Advocate at Public Citizen. “This bipartisan legislation will open up the app stores to more competition, protect small app developers, and lower prices for consumers.” “Since launching CAF, we have worked toward creating a fairer and more competitive app marketplace for both developers and consumers,” Meghan DiMuzio, Executive Director, Coalition for App Fairness. “The bipartisan Open App Markets Act is a step towards holding big tech companies accountable for practices that stifle competition for developers in the U.S. and around the world. CAF is proud to stand with Senators Blumenthal, Blackburn, and Klobuchar and we thank them for their courageous and visionary leadership on this important issue.”“It is past due Big Tech companies like Apple and Google are forced to loosen their stranglehold on small businesses,” said Arisha Hatch, vice president of Color Of Change. “Monopolized digital industries drain any opportunity for small business owners and only centralize power to the already massive tech corporations — and congressional legislation is our greatest tool to combat them. The Open App Markets Act is the kind of legislation necessary to ensure greater protections for small and medium sized developers, especially those who are Black and people of color. Color Of Change commends Senators Blumenthal, Blackburn, and Klobuchar for challenging Big Tech’s widespread power and implementing the effective legislation that will guarantee greater opportunity for Black developers and their communities.”“The News Media Alliance supports competition in the distribution of content,” said David Chavern, President and CEO, News Media Alliance. “We applaud Senators Blackburn, Blumenthal, and Klobuchar for their leadership in removing roadblocks and unnecessary fees associated with apps that allow news publishers to disseminate and monetize quality journalism.”“Users expect their mobile devices to keep them protected and their personal data safe, but the same practices intended to protect users can also be used to restrict fair competition,” said John Bergmayer, Legal Director at Public Knowledge. “The Open App Markets Act will ensure fairness for both users and developers without forcing security or privacy compromises, resulting in greater consumer choices and lower prices in the app ecosystem.”“The proliferation of digital walled gardens has led to a range of new challenges to free speech, competition, and human rights. Yet, many recent proposals for tech regulations have been punitive and heavy-handed. Such an approach threatens to weaken the American innovation ecosystem, ultimately increasing costs and reducing options for consumers,” said Zach Graves, Head of Policy, Lincoln Network. “The Open App Markets Act offers a better way forward, taking a light-touch regulatory approach to increase market competition and empower consumers with more options (and to vote with their feet). While all such regulations have tradeoffs, I believe this legislation strikes the right balance, allocating appropriate exemptions for privacy and security, and avoiding overly-cumbersome design mandates. Under this law, consumers will be more free to choose their digital world.”“Mobile apps are a driving force in bringing new technologies into our digital economy while generating billions of dollars in GDP,” said Gerard Scimeca, Chairman, CASE. “Through this important piece of legislation, Senators Blackburn, Blumenthal, and Klobuchar have taken an enormous step forward in working to ensure that the mobile app market is open, fair, and not beholden to anti-competitive actions or incentives. If passed into law, the Open App Markets Act will play a major role in securing America's continued leadership in digital innovation that benefits all consumers and every sector of our economy.”“The Open App Markets Act represents a thoughtful and pragmatic approach to facilitate equity in the app economy,” said Joel Thayer, President, Digital Progress Institute. “This Act would provide small-business developers with the appropriate leverage to challenge large app store platforms’ often mercurial standards and forced taxes on their innovative products. The Digital Progress Institute welcomes this much needed and bipartisan reform to the tech ecosystem.”“Senators Blumenthal, Blackburn, and Klobuchar recognize that independent 3rd party developers are being restricted in anti-competitive ways that impact what users pay for video games and other software,” said Ernesto Falcon, Senior Legislative Counsel at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “The Open App Markets Act will put a stop to these practices, which will lower the costs for both developers and their customers by setting forth common sense competition policy for the industry.”“A healthy free market requires open and fair competition,” said Jon Schweppe, director of policy and government affairs, American Principles Project. “Unfortunately, Big Tech companies have rigged the game by engaging in anti-competitive practices that restrict the ability for innovators and entrepreneurs to challenge their market dominance. This not only distorts the free market at large, but it harms consumers directly. The Open App Markets Act gets to the heart of the problem with the app store market: Google and Apple have leveraged their market power to prevent any of their competitors from achieving a foothold, resulting in higher prices and a lack of choices for consumers. Sen. Blackburn deserves a great deal of credit for taking on this challenging issue and doing so in a bipartisan manner. American Principles Project is proud to support the bill.”“I applaud Senator Blackburn, Senator Blumenthal, and Senator Klobuchar for their leadership in working to rein in Big Tech,” said Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Commissioner Brendan Carr. “The gatekeeper power that corporate behemoths now exercise over the app economy is harming consumers and competition. This legislation is a thoughtful way to eliminate those harms while promoting innovation.”“We applaud Sen. Blumenthal and his co-sponsors for introducing this important measure to break the power of app store gatekeepers,” said Economic Liberties’ Director of State and Local Policy Pat Garofalo. “It’s an important step in the effort to rein in the power of Big Tech corporations and ensure access to markets for American entrepreneurs and innovators. Dominant gatekeepers like Apple and Google are able to use their outsized power to extract enormous fees from small- and mid-sized businesses, with the ever-present threat of severing those businesses from their own customers. The set of rights laid out in this bill – including payment systems freedom, protections from retaliation, and giving consumers the ability to access alternative app stores – are vital to creating fairer commerce online.”The full text of the Senate bill can be found here.-30-"
https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-and-schakowsky-lead-bicameral-road-to-zero-resolution-calling-for-an-end-to-traffic-deaths,"Despite fewer cars on the road during COVID-19 pandemic, traffic deaths have jumped 7.2 percent in the last year—the largest projected number of fatalities in more than a decade[WASHINGTON, DC] – With traffic deaths on the rise, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and U.S. Representative Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) led their Congressional colleagues in introducing the Road to Zero resolution today in support of progress to eliminate traffic deaths. The resolution expresses a commitment to advancing policies to end roadway fatalities by 2050 and supports efforts to address transportation safety disparities and inequities.“We must act to prevent crashes that tragically take far too many Americans’ lives each day,” said Blumenthal. “By committing to enact proven, commonsense road safety policies, this resolution charts the course to reduce traffic deaths to zero by 2050. I am proud to pledge my support for this important lifesaving effort with Congresswoman Schakowsky and making our roads safer for every pedestrian, biker, and driver across the country.”“Our country is in the midst of an auto safety crisis, one that we have the power to stop in its tracks,” said Schakowsky. “Tens of thousands of lives are lost on our roadways each year. Enough is enough. We must commit to ending these unnecessary deaths and injuries by 2050. This resolution makes that commitment and calls on the Department of Transportation to use the tools at its disposal to prioritize transportation safety. All road users—drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and bicyclists—deserve to be safe on our nation’s roads.”Although Americans drove less in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, recent preliminary reports from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) show that 38,680 people died in preventable traffic crashes last year – up 7.2 percent or nearly 2,600 more than in 2019 and representing the largest projected number of fatalities since 2007. About 100 people die every day on the country’s roads, with traffic crashes being the leading cause of death for Americans ages one to 25.Studies have shown that traffic incident risk is unevenly distributed, with much higher pedestrian fatality deaths among older adults, people of color, and people walking in low-income communities where there are fewer sidewalks, marked crosswalks, and a lack of safe street design. A 2018 report from the RAND Corporation found that the U.S. can reach the goal of zero traffic deaths by 2050 through prioritizing safety, and implementing proven policies and strategies.The resolution has also been cosponsored by U.S. Senators Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Angus King (I-ME), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), and U.S. Representatives Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Bobby Rush (D-IL), John Garamendi (D-CA), Albio Sires (D-NJ), and Grace Napolitano (D-CA).The resolution has been endorsed by the National Safety Council, Consumer Reports, Vision Zero Network, and Families for Safe Streets.“No other preventable cause of deaths and severe injuries is so overlooked and implicitly condoned as the 40,000 traffic fatalities each year in this country,” said Leah Shahum, Director of Vision Zero Network. “This must — and can — change. We’re encouraged that the new resolution to reduce traffic fatalities to zero by 2050 is a sign of stepped-up Federal leadership to put proven Vision Zero strategies in place, including designing roadways for safety over speed and investing more funding in safety priorities, especially for those walking and biking.”“Tragically, a person is more likely to lose their life on the road today than they were before the pandemic,” said Lorraine Martin, president and CEO of the National Safety Council and chair of the Road to Zero Coalition. “We need a national commitment to achieving zero traffic deaths — which is precisely what Sen. Blumenthal and Rep. Jan Schakowsky’s resolution represents. We applaud their bold leadership as we work towards ‘zero.’” “Every traffic death is more than a number. Each has a bereft family and a heartbroken community. October 8th will mark eight years since I lost my 12-year-old son Sammy. He was in 8th grade and just trying to get from school to soccer practice. This should not be a deadly act,” said Amy Cohen, Co-Founder of Families for Safe Streets. “Every one of us in FSS has lost a family member or suffered a life-altering injury. We are so grateful to Senator Blumenthal and Congresswoman Schakowsky for urging the US to commit to ZeroTrafficDeaths. Taking that first step to a safety-first transportation policy will prevent others from the heartache we have suffered. The US is an outlier — the vast majority of nations like ours have dramatically reduced the number of people killed on their roadways. We have some of the most dangerous roads and most dangerous vehicles in the industrialized world and things are only getting worse. In May, the National Safety Council shared preliminary data indicating a 24% spike in roadway death rates  — the highest in 96 years. We can and we must do better.”“Driving your child back to college is often thought of as a bonding moment as your “baby” blossoms into a burgeoning young adult  — not a deadly act that ends two lives in an instant. On October 15, 2018, my sister Leslie and her 19-year-old daughter Sophie were making the 100-mile drive together when a tanker truck pulled onto the dark highway ahead of them and their car plowed into the underside of the 18-wheeler, ending Sophie and Leslie’s lives in an instant,” said Cathy Bell-Forman of Bloomfield, Connecticut. “This would never have happened if our country was committed to eliminating traffic deaths on our roadways. I have been fighting since her death for a small legislative change to require trucks to be fully illuminated and even that small change has not yet been made. If only the US had prioritized safety sooner and put in place the proven solutions to save lives, my kind, generous sister and her smart, bubbly daughter would still be alive.”The full text of the Senate resolution can be found here.

This bicameral, bipartisan legislation would expand the highly successful peer specialist support program to all Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers over the next five years, prioritizing expansion to rural areas, areas not near an active military installation, and the hiring of peer specialists that reflect the racial and ethnic demographics of the veteran population.  By harnessing peer-to-peer relationships and applying their own lived experience, peer counseling specialists play a vital role in combatting risks of veteran suicide and treating mental health conditions. These specialists support fellow veterans and encourage recovery by helping them access health services and navigate the VA health care system, while also teaching coping and positive health-affirming behaviors.“This bill builds on the success of the peer specialist program by connecting more veterans to life-saving mental health and support resources,” said Blumenthal. “Through shared experience, peer counselors form meaningful and lasting relationships with veterans, empowering and assisting them as they transition into civilian life. Expanding this program to every VA medical center across the country would make this critical resource available to more veterans in need, significantly bolstering the fight against veteran suicide.”“Less than half of returning veterans who need mental health treatment end up receiving it, according to the National Council for Mental Wellbeing,” said Blunt. “Peer specialists – with their shared experience - are effective in reducing the stigma that can discourage our nation’s heroes from getting the care they need. This bicameral and bipartisan bill will improve mental health treatment for the men and women who put themselves in harm’s way to keep our nation safe.”In 2017, Blumenthal and Blunt introduced the Veteran Partners’ Efforts to Enhance Reintegration Act (Veteran PEER Act) to establish peer specialist programs. The bill became a part of the VA MISSION Act, which called for the establishment of the program at no fewer than 30 locations. The Veteran Peer Specialist Act would amend the VA MISSION Act and expand the peer specialist program to all VA medical centers.“Veterans deserve world-class medical support after serving our country. This bipartisan, bicameral bill builds on the program we established in the 2018 VA MISSION Act by permanently expanding access to veterans' the best guide to care: a fellow veteran,” said Peters. “I urge the House and Senate to support this legislation immediately to make sure our nation's veterans receive the many benefits peer support networks offer.”“Veterans seeking mental health services deserve the best support we have to offer, and working with a fellow veteran who has had similar experiences, and dealt with similar struggles, can be an enormous help,” said Allred. “Veterans helping veterans is always a great foundation to build upon, and this bill will help hire Peer Specialists at VA’s around the country. I thank my fellow cosponsors and I am proud to be working on this bipartisan bill to help improve mental health services for our veterans.”“Military service is forever service,” said Mann. “That’s why it’s so important to connect our military veterans to the support resources and networks they need. The Veteran Peer Specialist Act is long overdue and is the right tool for our nation’s most deserving heroes. I look forward to its swift passage in both the U.S. House and Senate.”The Veteran Peer Specialist Act has been endorsed by a number of veterans and health organizations, including the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, Military Order of the Purple Heart, Well Being Trust, Mental Health America, National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, and National Council for Mental Wellbeing.“One of the most exciting things about this legislation is that it enables veteran peer specialists to engage with veterans in ways that promote recovery and empowerment by meeting them at what is often their first point of entry into the VA health care system,” stated Michael Pollock, Chief Executive Officer for the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance. “It has the potential to develop veterans as leaders, joining forces with the health care team resulting in better overall health and wellness.”The Senate version of the legislation can be found here.

https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-fischer-and-markey-introduce-bill-to-protect-consumers-from-keyless-car-carbon-monoxide-risks,"[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – Today, U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Deb Fischer (R-NE), and Edward J. Markey (D-MA), members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, introduced legislation to address the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning associated with keyless ignition technology in vehicles. The bipartisan Stop CO Poisoning Exposures (SCOPE) Act requires the Secretary of the Department of Transportation (DOT) to finalize a rule that cars automatically shut off after a period of time to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. This bill would authorize DOT to establish different periods after which a vehicle would have to shut off, as different vehicles emit carbon monoxide at different rates. “This bipartisan bill requires that DOT protect Americans from fatal risks of carbon monoxide poisoning associated with keyless ignitions,” Blumenthal said. “With keyless ignitions now standard in the vast majority of new cars sold, this safeguard cannot wait any longer. Further delay will have more devastating consequences—heartbreak too many families have already suffered.”“Americans with keyless ignition vehicles can accidentally leave their car running, resulting in carbon monoxide poisoning,” Fischer said. “Two years ago, the community of Bellevue, Nebraska, experienced the loss of Thomas and Ann MacKinnon when this happened to them. In response, I have worked with the MacKinnons’ daughter, Sharon Shore, on this important legislation. It will ensure these vehicles automatically shut off after a period of time to prevent these tragedies from occurring in the future.”“We must ensure that novel transportation technologies help eradicate the auto safety challenges of the 20th century, not pose additional dangers in the 21st century,” Markey said. “With keyless ignitions now standard for most automobiles sold in the United States today -- and deaths attributable to keyless ignitions mounting -- it’s time for the Department of Transportation to set safety standards to protect American drivers from deadly carbon monoxide poisoning.”Keyless ignitions increase the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning with drivers inadvertently exiting the vehicle while it is in park but not shutting down the vehicle. A vehicle left running in an attached garage can quickly fill living spaces with lethal levels of carbon monoxide. Keyless ignitions are now standard in over half of the 17 million new vehicles sold annually in the United States.A 2018 The New York Times investigation found at least 28 deaths and 45 injuries since 2006 tied to carbon monoxide poisoning caused by vehicles with keyless ignitions inadvertently left idling.In 2011, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a draft rule to address keyless ignition risks, but the agency has not taken action since. Following The New York Times report, Blumenthal and Markey wrote NHSTA Deputy Administrator Heidi King in May of 2018 demanding the agency finalize and implement its rule. The full text of the Blumenthal-Markey letter is available here.As NHTSA has failed to finalize its rule, some automakers, including General Motors and Ford, have taken proactive steps to respond to these hazards, implementing additional safety features like auto shut-off systems to prevent CO poisoning. Without a final federal rule, most auto manufacturers have not addressed the various risks posed by keyless ignition technology.The SCOPE Act has been endorsed by Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, Center for Auto Safety, Consumer Reports, KidsAndCars.org, and Safety Research & Strategies. “Technical loopholes in the current ignition regulation have resulted in keyless ignition designs that lack the safety features found in vehicles with traditional keys, allowing the engine to continue to run even when driver exits the vehicle with the key fob,” said Sean Kane, President of Safety Research & Strategies. “Today’s quiet engines and hybrid models that alternate between gasoline and electric modes add to the problem, because drivers don’t have a clear indication an engine may be on. Since 2012, some automakers have implemented an automatic engine idle shutdown in their keyless ignition vehicles. The SCOPE Act will bring a much-needed update to the safety standard, ensuring all keyless vehicles have a timed engine shut-off feature to prevent carbon monoxide poisonings.”“Technology has and can solve many dangers and difficulties with motor vehicles. However, it can also create unintended problems,” said Cathy Chase, President of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. “Such is the case with keyless ignition systems leading to carbon monoxide poisoning. Forgetting to shut your car off should not be lethal. The Stop CO Poisoning Exposures (SCOPE) Act solves this problem and Congress should swiftly enact it. Thank you, Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Deb Fischer (R-NE) and Ed Markey (D-MA) for your leadership to end this preventable hazard.”“The technology exists to prevent carbon monoxide poisonings that can happen when people forget to turn off their car,” said William Wallace, manager of safety policy for Consumer Reports. “The SCOPE Act can help stop these terrible tragedies in the future. Consumer Reports supports the bill because it would ensure safety systems to prevent CO poisoning come standard on new cars, and that they work as they're supposed to.”Full text of the legislation can be found here.-30-"
https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-markey-and-warren-introduce-bill-to-protect-car-buyers-from-unsafe-used-cars,"The Used Car Safety Recall Repair Act would close a safety loophole that allows car dealers to sell used cars with defective brakes, loss of steering, exploding Takata airbags, and other known safety defects[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) introduced the Used Car Safety Recall Repair Act today to ensure used vehicles with open safety recalls are repaired before they are sold, leased, or loaned to consumers. The bill requires car dealers to repair any outstanding safety recalls in used cars prior to selling, leasing, or loaning them to consumers. Current federal law does not prohibit car dealers from selling cars with outstanding recalls despite the significant risks posed to the safety of everyone on the road. The Used Car Safety Recall Repair Act addresses this glaring gap in consumer protection that confuses buyers who believe they are purchasing a vehicle with safety assurances, and threatens public safety.“This bill will ensure that car dealers repair dangerous and defective used cars before they drive on our roads,” said Blumenthal. “Americans deserve peace of mind that they are buying safe cars from car dealers, yet too many used cars today are sold or leased with known and unrepaired safety issues. This measure will close this unacceptable safety loophole, and protect drivers and the public from hazardous cars.”“All cars – whether they are brand new or used – need to be safe before they leave the lot,” said Markey. “I am pleased to work with Senator Blumenthal on this important legislation that will make sure unrepaired cars subject to an outstanding recall are not on our roads. Closing this loophole is a critical step toward improving safety for drivers, passengers, and pedestrians.""More than 40 million used vehicles are bought in the United States each year, a rate more than double new car sales. People with lower incomes, communities of color, and people living in disadvantaged communities frequently become victims of unscrupulous sales practices when they purchase a used car from car dealers. In recent years, safety recall defects have included catching fire, defective brakes, loss of steering, and exploding Takata airbags. Under current law, auto dealers are able to sell used cars with these and other open recalls to unsuspecting consumers.The Used Car Safety Recall Repair Act would close this safety loophole, and prevent the sale of used vehicles with safety defects by prohibiting auto dealers from selling, leasing, or loaning vehicles with unrepaired open recalls to consumers. To ensure that open recalls are repaired, the bill would enable auto dealers to sell recalled vehicles to other auto dealers who have the ability to fix the defects at wholesale prices. The legislation would also establish a new reimbursement program to hold auto manufacturers accountable if they fail to provide auto dealers with the parts to repair safety defects within 60 days.The Used Car Safety Recall Repair Act is supported by a number of auto safety and consumer groups, including Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, Consumer Federation of America, Center for Auto Safety, Consumer Reports, Consumer Action, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, MASSPIRG, U.S.PIRG, Safety Research and Strategies, The Trauma Foundation, Public Citizen, and Americans for Financial Reform.""Consumers who shop for used cars at licensed auto dealerships shouldn't have to worry that the dealer is deliberately selling them a hazardous car without bothering to get free repairs done to fix deadly safety recall defects,"" said Rosemary Shahan, President of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety.“Vehicles are only recalled for two reasons – a safety defect or a violation of a federal safety regulation. The practice of selling these dangerous vehicles without first fixing obvious and identified safety hazards unacceptably shifts the burden from manufacturers and used car sellers onto the party least equipped to address the danger – the consumer. Senator Blumenthal’s Used Car Safety Recall Repair Act incentivizes manufacturers to get recall repairs completed quickly and protects everyone on the road by closing the federal loophole permitting the sale of unrepaired recalled used cars,” said Jason Levine, Executive Director of the Center for Auto Safety.""As the recent buyer of a used car, the safety of this market has been top of mind for me,” said Cathy Chase, President of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. “Most consumers might understandably assume that car dealers are prohibited by federal law from selling cars that are under recall. This is true for new cars but not for used cars, unless they are being sold by a rental car company. This inequity is absolutely unacceptable and should compel Congress to swiftly take action on the Used Car Safety Recall Repair Act. This commonsense bill requires auto dealers to repair dangerous safety recall defects in all used cars they sell, lease, or loan before they reach consumers. Families that rely upon the affordability of used cars should not have to wonder if the vehicles they purchase from a car dealer contain ‘ticking timebombs’ in the form of airbags that may explode, engines that may catch on fire, or other dangerous safety defects. We commend Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Ed Markey (D-MA), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) for their leadership and commitment to equity and safety.”“Three out of four car buyers, buy used vehicles. Thanks to Senators Blumenthal, Markey, and Warren, these consumers, who may not be able to afford to buy new, will be protected from vehicles with dangerous recalls. No product should be sold with a known defect, especially an automobile, and Senator Blumenthal’s Used Car Safety Recall Act will save lives,” said Jack Gillis, Consumer Federation of America Executive Director and CEO.The full text of the Senate legislation can be found here.-30-"
https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-and-shaheen-introduce-legislation-to-reduce-pfas-exposure-among-servicemembers_military-families,"Exposure to items containing PFAS has been linked to cancer, liver damage, asthma, and other serious long-term health conditions[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – Today, U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) introduced legislation to reduce exposure of servicemembers and their families to harmful PFAS chemicals. The PFAS Free Military Purchasing Act prohibits the Department of Defense from procuring, purchasing, and selling items that contain per- and poly- fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), dangerous and toxic chemicals commonly found in many everyday items like food service ware, carpets and rugs, clothing, and cosmetics. PFAS exposure has been linked to a number of serious health conditions, including cancer, liver damage, decreased fertility, and increased risk of asthma and thyroid disease.“This bill will help protect the health of our armed forces from highly hazardous PFAS chemicals,” said Blumenthal. “These persistent and pervasive toxins are in cookware, furniture, toothpaste, and many other everyday items, putting members of our military and their families needlessly at risk. With PFAS-free products widely available, DOD should lead the way in making the switch to healthier alternatives for the sake of our servicemembers—and pave the way for the rest of the country to follow suit.” “New Hampshire service members and veterans know all too well the alarming health implications tied to PFAS exposure. We know these harmful chemicals are not only in our water supplies, but also everyday items. It’s unacceptable that taxpayer dollars are being spent on household products that expose our military members and their families to these toxic chemicals,” said Shaheen. “It’s past time we require the Department of Defense to purchase safer, PFAS-free alternatives for our service members so they can use everyday products like cleaning supplies and food packaging without worrying about their personal health. I’m proud to join Senator Blumenthal in this effort to incentivize the Pentagon to protect our military families by banning the purchase of products with well-documented health risks.”The items covered by this bill would include non-stick cookware and food service ware for use in galleys or dining facilities, food packaging materials, furniture and floor waxes, carpeting, rugs, curtains, upholstered furniture, personal care items, dental floss, toothpaste, sunscreen, umbrellas, luggage and bags, ski wax, car wax and car window treatment, cleaning products, and shoes and clothing for which PFAS treatment is not currently necessary for an essential function.The PFAS Free Military Purchasing Act is endorsed by the Environmental Working Group and the Green Science Policy Institute.“Service members risk everything to keep us safe. We should do everything we can to keep them safe as well,” said Scott Faber, Environmental Working Group’s Vice President for Government Affairs. “We applaud Senator Blumenthal and Senator Shaheen for introducing legislation to phase PFAS out of everyday products procured or purchased by the DOD. There’s no reason toxic forever chemicals should be in the products our service members take into their homes.”“The PFAS Free Military Purchasing Act will protect military men and women from the harm of PFAS in products they are exposed to every day ­in furniture, curtains, food packaging and even toothpaste and dental floss,” said Arlene Blum PhD who leads the Green Science Policy Institute. “And it will prevent contamination of our land and water, protecting all of us from these harmful forever chemicals.”The full text of the Senate legislation can be found here.  -30-"
https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-and-markey-call-for-in-depth-federal-investigation-recommendations-for-automated-driving_driving-assistance-system-improvements-after-deadly-tesla-crash,"[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – After a deadly Tesla crash in Texas on Saturday, U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Edward J. Markey (D-MA), members of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, called on federal investigators to conduct a thorough probe into the crash, and to develop recommendations for how automated driving and driving assistance systems like Tesla’s Autopilot can be improved. According to initial reports, no one was behind the wheel of the Tesla vehicle that crashed in Texas on Saturday, killing two men. Following the crash, Tesla CEO Elon Musk Tweeted that the vehicle’s Autopilot was not enabled, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have each launched an investigation.“While automated driving and driver assistance systems – like the Autopilot feature on Tesla cars – can help prevent injurious and fatal accidents, they must be implemented strategically and safely,” wrote the Senators to NHTSA Acting Administrator Steven Cliff and NTSB. “The most recent Tesla crash is the latest in a rash of accidents – the 28th – that NHTSA is investigating involving a Tesla car. We fear safety concerns involving these vehicles are becoming a pattern, which is incredibly worrisome and deserves your undivided attention.”In calling for an in-depth federal investigation, the lawmakers pointed out previous discord surrounding the Tesla Autopilot, writing: “In the past, NHTSA and the NTSB have disagreed over the culpability of Tesla’s Autopilot in fatal crashes. Tesla has also been criticized for misrepresenting the capabilities of their vehicles’ automated driving and driver assistance systems, giving drivers a false sense of security. In addition, previous incidents have raised concerning questions regarding whether Tesla’s Autopilot system has sufficient safeguards to prevent drivers from disengaging from the road. It is therefore imperative that your report determine the exact cause of this latest accident to better inform our laws around advancements in driving technology and prevent future fatal accidents.”The full text of the letter can be found here and below.Dear Acting Administrator Cliff,            We write to you in light of the fatal accident involving a 2019 Tesla Model S in Spring, Texas, on April 17, 2021. We are encouraged to see the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) so quickly open investigations into the deadly crash. We implore you to conduct a thorough investigation of the accident and request that your reports include recommendations on corrective actions that can be implemented to prevent future such accidents from occurring.            In 2019, more than 36,000 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes.[1] While automated driving and driver assistance systems – like the Autopilot feature on Tesla cars – can help prevent injurious and fatal accidents, they must be implemented strategically and safely. The most recent Tesla crash is the latest in a rash of accidents – the 28th – that NHTSA is investigating involving a Tesla car.[2] We fear safety concerns involving these vehicles are becoming a pattern, which is incredibly worrisome and deserves your undivided attention.            We are particularly concerned by conflicting reports about the operation of the vehicle involved in this most recent crash. Shortly after the accident, police preliminarily determined that there was nobody in the vehicle’s driver seat.[3] On Twitter, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk disputed that Autopilot was engaged.[4] In the past, NHTSA and the NTSB have disagreed over the culpability of Tesla’s Autopilot in fatal crashes.[5] Tesla has also been criticized for misrepresenting the capabilities of their vehicles’ automated driving and driver assistance systems, giving drivers a false sense of security.[6] In addition, previous incidents have raised concerning questions regarding whether Tesla’s Autopilot system has sufficient safeguards to prevent drivers from disengaging from the road.[7] It is therefore imperative that your report determine the exact cause of this latest accident to better inform our laws around advancements in driving technology and prevent future fatal accidents.            Our roadways must be safe for all people – drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. We strongly urge you to conduct a complete investigation into Saturday’s fatal Tesla vehicle crash and develop recommendations for improving automated driving and driver assistance systems.

https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-and-smith-lead-introduction-of-legislation-to-stop-sexual-harassment-in-stem,"[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Tina Smith (D-MN) introduced the Combating Sexual Harassment in Science Act today to improve the understanding of factors contributing to sexual harassment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, examine impacts of harassment on individuals and policies to reduce it, and spur interagency efforts to mitigate this harassment.“This bill directly confronts the persistent and pervasive culture of sexual harassment in STEM,” said Blumenthal. “Harassment and discrimination rob talented individuals of brilliant careers and deprive our country of their great minds. With deep gender inequality in STEM fields, we must make it easier for women and other underrepresented groups to join and thrive in these industries. I’m proud to spearhead this effort with Senator Smith and ensure we put a stop to unacceptable harassment and discrimination in STEM.”“This sad truth is clear: we know that many people pursuing careers in STEM fields have experienced sexual harassment,” said Smith. “We need to put a stop to this, and empower all students to live up to their fullest potential and succeed. I’m introducing the Combating Sexual Harassment in Science Act with my colleague Senator Blumenthal because we cannot look away—we have to address this problem and support all those pursuing, and actively working in, jobs in the STEM field.”This legislation follows a landmark 2018 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, which found that sexual harassment is wide-spread in higher education institutions and contributes to loss of talented, highly-trained individuals in STEM. U.S. Representatives Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX) and Frank Lucas (R-OK) introduced a similar version of the bill in the House last week.Among its provisions, the Combating Sexual Harassment in Science Act would award grants through the National Science Foundation (NSF) to better understand the factors contributing to and consequences of sexual harassment across institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations and to examine interventions to reduce its frequency and impact. The bill would also direct Federal statistical agencies to collect national data on the prevalence, nature, and implications of sexual harassment in institutions of higher education, direct NSF to enter into an agreement with the Academies to update the Academies’ research conduct report to include more detailed data points, and establish an interagency working group chaired by the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to coordinate the efforts of Federal science agencies.The legislation has also been cosponsored by U.S. Senators Jack Reed (D-RI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Alex Padilla (D-CA).“The ongoing culture of sexual harassment in STEM fields is unacceptable. We must directly confront this culture and take action to address it. Tackling gender inequity – and inequity across the board – in our STEM fields is vital to ensuring our success in these areas, and promoting safe and inclusive work and learning environments is key to that goal,” said Van Hollen.“Workplace sexual harassment is a widespread problem that affects too many, and I’ll continue pushing for policies that send a clear message that it will not be tolerated,” said Klobuchar. “I thank Senators Blumenthal and Smith for their work on this bill.”“Sexual harassment has no place in our society. Congress needs to do more to combat sexual harassment in federal programs, colleges and universities, and the workforce, and this bill takes important steps to address the issue through better data collection and research, new resources, and improved coordination,” said Hirono. “I join my colleagues to reintroduce this legislation today because we must actively work to stop sexual harassment everywhere.”“Sexual harassment in the workplace is especially pervasive in male-dominated fields like STEM. Harassment creates a culture of impunity, fear and abuse that far too often results in some of our brightest and most talented minds being driven away from the sciences,” said Shaheen. “This legislation includes common-sense policies to identify and address factors contributing to harassment and ensure our scientific workforce can thrive. Supporting survivors of sexual harassment and violence will always be a top priority for me in the Senate.”“As the #MeToo movement continues to spotlight, sexual harassment remains all too prevalent in the workplace. Too often, women, people of color and non-binary people are forced out of academic work due to this very kind of harassment. This is a travesty on two fronts—it deprives survivors of the careers they should have had and it causes brain drain in critical STEM disciplines, curbing scientific and technological advances,” said Wyden. “Congress must figure out how to stop sexual harassment in STEM, and this bill is the start we need.”“This pandemic has proven how crucial STEM skills are to the future of our country and how important it is to support our STEM workforce,” said Brown. “American innovation in science and technology is made stronger when everyone is able to participate free from discrimination or harassment. This legislation takes important steps toward ensuring more inclusive, safe, and equitable opportunities are afforded to scholars in STEM fields, which were already underrepresented by women and especially women of color, well before the pandemic.”The Combating Sexual Harassment in Science Act has been endorsed by American Educational Research Association, American Mathematical Society, American Physical Society, Society of Women Engineers, and American Geophysical Union.The text of the Senate legislation can be found here and the summary of the bill can be found here.-30-"
https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-schakowsky-and-rush-introduce-legislation-to-bolster-cpscs-power-to-warn-americans-about-dangerous-products-in-the-wake-of-peloton-reports,"The Sunshine in Product Safety Act would repeal CPSC’s regulatory constraints that have allowed companies like Peloton to delay the agency’s public warnings about dangerous products[WASHINGTON, DC] – U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and U.S. Representatives Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) and Bobby L. Rush (D-IL) introduced the Sunshine in Product Safety Act today to strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s (CPSC) ability to communicate vital health and safety information about potentially dangerous products to consumers without risking retaliation by the manufacturer. The bill comes in the wake of alarming reports that Peloton obstructed CPSC’s investigation into the safety of its Peloton Tread+ treadmill after injuries and a child’s death and hindered the Commission from being able to swiftly and adequately warn consumers about this unsafe equipment.“The Sunshine in Product Safety Act puts consumer safety first,” said Blumenthal, Chair of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security. “CPSC must be able to move swiftly to warn Americans when products like the Peloton Tread+ and the Fisher-Price Rock ’n Play Sleeper pose a danger to them and their families. Yet current regulatory constraints allow companies to call the shots on how and when to notify the public about their hazardous products, keeping important safety information from the public. This bill will eliminate these constraints, restoring transparency to product safety for the sake of consumers.”“For too long, Section 6(b) of the Consumer Product Safety Act has severely restricted the CPSC’s ability to promptly warn people about dangerous products, leading to unnecessary deaths and injuries from products such as the Fisher-Price Rock ‘n Play and the Peloton Tread+ treadmill,” said Schakowsky, Chairwoman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce. “It gives manufacturers the power to decide if and when they are held accountable. The Sunshine in Product Safety Act will repeal section 6(b), saving lives and preventing injuries. I am proud to introduce this life-saving bill with my friends and colleagues Senator Blumenthal and Congressman Rush. ““It is wholly unacceptable that under current law, manufacturers can keep consumers in the dark about harmful and hazardous products,” said Rush, a senior member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce. “Simply put, Section 6(b) puts people’s lives at risk. I introduced legislation to amend Section 6(b) last Congress, and I am proud to join my colleagues Senator Blumenthal and Representative Schakowsky this Congress in introducing the Sunshine in Product Safety Act — vital, lifesaving, and commonsense legislation that will bring much-needed daylight to consumers and accountability to manufacturers.”CPSC is an independent federal agency established by Congress in 1972 and tasked with promoting consumer safety, but over the years, its authority has been weakened and funding reduced. In 1981, Congress significantly amended Section 6(b) of the Consumer Product Safety Act to give manufacturers an effective veto over the CPSC’s release of company-related information to the public. The Sunshine in Product Safety Act would repeal Section 6(b) of the Consumer Product Safety Act, and allow CPSC to share critical information about hazardous products quickly.The amended Section 6(b) has led to delays of warnings, no warnings, or releases of generic information that can be confusing, rather than informative, to consumers. For example, when CPSC issued warnings about “inclined infant sleep products,” most consumers did not understand that these warnings were in fact primarily about the ubiquitous and dangerous Fisher-Price Rock ‘n Play Sleeper.Section 6(b) also hinders the release of information that should be accessible to the public consistent with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the agency’s other information disclosure requirements.In the case of the Peloton Tread+, CPSC was unable to alert the public of the 39 reported incidents related to children, pets, and objects getting pulled under the treadmill until a month later. These incidents ranged from mild injury to broken limbs, brain damage, and even death. Some incidents also occurred while the treadmill was being operated and in use by an adult. CPSC was also required to negotiate with Peloton over the wording and timing of the warning alert because of Section 6(b).The Sunshine in Product Safety Act is supported by the Consumer Federation of America, Consumer Reports, Kids In Danger, and Public Citizen.“Section 6(b) keeps consumers in the dark, prevents critical information from being shared with the public that could impact the health and safety of their families, and thwarts the CPSC from fulfilling their mission to protect consumers from unsafe products” said Rachel Weintraub, legislative director and general counsel with Consumer Federation of America. “This bill is necessary to ensure that people have the information they need to make decisions about consumer products they own or are considering purchasing.”“Companies shouldn’t be able to hide safety hazards or have the CPSC seek their permission before warning the public. People expect to hear about it if a product might put them or their families at risk. We strongly urge every member of Congress to support the Sunshine in Product Safety Act and make sure that our laws put people’s safety ahead of corporate profits,” said Oriene Shin, policy counsel for Consumer Reports.“For too long, Section 6(b) of the US Consumer Product Safety Act has stymied efforts to get unsafe products out of homes and get safety information to consumers,” said Nancy Cowles, Executive Director of Kids In Danger. “This week’s warning of hazards with the Peloton Tread+ is the latest evidence of this. But this is the tip of the iceberg. The list of companies counting on 6(b) to hide information from consumers is an arm long and mile wide. We applaud the efforts of Senator Blumenthal, and Representatives Jan Schakowsky and Bobby Rush of Illinois in addressing this critical safety issue.”“The corporate secrecy provision in product safety law that is known as Section 6(b) has time and again slowed critical product hazard information from getting to consumers, leading to additional injuries and even lost lives,” said Remington A. Gregg, Counsel for Civil Justice and Consumer Rights at Public Citizen. “The CPSC should have the ability to quickly release timely and specific warnings to best safeguard the public. Unfortunately, 6(b) hampers the CPSC’s ability to do so, and that’s why Public Citizen supports its repeal.”The full text of the Senate legislation can be found here.

https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-and-markey-introduce-bill-to-protect-against-keyless-car-carbon-monoxide_rollaway-risks,"[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Edward J. Markey (D-MA) introduced the Protecting Americans from the Risks of Keyless Ignition Technology (PARK IT) Act today to address the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning and vehicle rollaways associated with keyless ignition technology in vehicles. The legislation requires the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to finalize a rule that vehicles automatically shut off after a period of time to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning, and a rule that sets a performance standard to prevent rollaways.“Basic keyless ignition safety standards—mandated by this bill—are way overdue,” said Blumenthal. “It would force DOT to issue rules that could have avoided injuries and deaths. Preventing carbon monoxide poisonings and rollaway incidents can help save lives.”“The DOT must ensure that novel transportation technologies help eradicate the auto safety challenges of the 20th century, not pose additional dangers in the 21st century,"" said Markey. “With deaths attributable to keyless ignitions mounting, it's time to set safety standards to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning and vehicle rollaways.”Keyless ignitions have been found to increase the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning with drivers unintentionally leaving the vehicle in park but not turning off its engine. A vehicle left running in an attached garage can quickly fill the home with lethal levels of carbon monoxide. Keyless ignitions are now standard in more than half of the 17 million new vehicles sold annually in the United States. A 2018 The New York Times investigation found at least 28 deaths and 45 injuries since 2006 tied to carbon monoxide poisoning caused by vehicles with keyless ignitions inadvertently left idling.Keyless ignitions have also increased the problem of car rollaways. Drivers of vehicles with keyless ignitions can power down a vehicle without putting the vehicle in “park.” This may result in the vehicle rolling away and causing death, injury, or destruction of property. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) Not-In-Traffic Surveillance research has shown that rollaways cause approximately 150 deaths and 2,000 injuries annually. In 2011, NHTSA issued a draft rule to address keyless ignition risks, but it has never been finalized. Following The New York Times report, Blumenthal and U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA) wrote NHSTA Deputy Administrator Heidi King demanding the agency finalize and implement its rule. The full text of that letter is available here.While DOT has failed to finalize a rule, some automakers, including General Motors and Ford, have proactively taken steps to curb these hazards, implementing additional safety features like auto shut-off systems to prevent CO poisoning. Without a final rule, however, most automakers have not addressed the various risks posed by keyless ignition technology.The PARK IT Act has been endorsed by Safety Research and Strategies, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, the Center for Auto Safety, and Consumer Reports.“Modern vehicles present opportunities for improving safety, but the introduction of new features has created hazards that aren’t directly addressed by outdated safety standards,” said Sean Kane, Founder and President of Safety Research and Strategies. “The PARK IT Act will close these loopholes by requiring DOT to update rollaway prevention and engine ignition rules, ensuring all new keyless vehicles prevent unsafe conditions that the regulations were intended to address.”“Vehicle convenience features should not create lethal hazards. Forgetting to turn off a vehicle with a push button start should not lead to carbon monoxide poisoning exposure. Mistakenly neglecting to put a car into the park gear before exiting should not result in a roll-away crash,” said Cathy Chase, President of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. “These are solvable problems and the PARK IT Act addresses them by requiring auto makers to add features to prevent a common mental lapse from becoming an irreversible tragedy. Once again, Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Ed Markey (D-MA) have demonstrated their leadership and dedication to improving safety and consumer protection. It’s time for Congress to advance this sensible legislation.” “New technology in cars should make our lives safer, better, and easier,” said Jason Levine, Executive Director, Center for Auto Safety. “If manufacturers can remove the need for keys to start our cars they can also remove the possibility that our cars will poison us or roll over us when we exit the vehicle, as has already happened far too often. The PARK IT Act is designed to address this problem directly, and hopefully prevent more unnecessary deaths resulting from simple human error.”  “Simple, available automotive features can dramatically reduce the risk of a rollaway or carbon monoxide poisoning. The PARK IT Act would ensure these safeguards work well and are included as standard equipment going forward. Nobody should suffer a preventable death or injury because of poorly designed controls or a memory lapse,” said William Wallace, manager of safety policy for Consumer Reports.The text of the Senate legislation can be found here.-30-"
https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-collins-carper-and-burr-introduce-legislation-to-ban-private-ownership-of-big-cats,"[WASHINGTON, D.C] – U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Susan Collins (R-ME), Tom Carper (D-DE), and Richard Burr (R-NC) are introducing the Big Cat Public Safety Act today to protect public safety and improve animal welfare. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation prohibits the ownership of big cats like lions and tigers, and makes it illegal for exhibitors to allow public contact with cubs.“This bipartisan measure would help stop exploitation of big cats like tigers and lions, and reduce safety risks,” said Blumenthal. “My Big Cat Public Safety Act would prohibit private ownership of these beautiful but powerful predators, which deserve to live in the wild. They should never be pets, even as cubs, kept in captivity dangerously for entertainment. I’m thankful for the groundswell of public support for this bill and look forward to working with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to ensure it becomes law.”“Big cats like lions, tigers, and cheetahs belong in their natural habitats, not in the hands of private owners where they are too often subject to cruelty or improper care,” said Collins. “Our bipartisan bill would prohibit the private ownership of big cats, which threatens the safety of the animals and the public and harms conservation efforts. I have long advocated for policies that improve the welfare of animals, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.”“I’m pleased to join Senators Blumenthal, Burr, and Collins in introducing the Big Cat Public Safety Act to address the treatment of privately-owned tigers and other big cats in our country,” said Carper. “This legislation is a win-win. It would prevent big cats from living in inhumane conditions and protect the public from the safety implications of these beautiful creatures being kept as pets.”Private ownership of big cats raises significant public safety, animal welfare, and conservation concerns. It is estimated that thousands of big cats – including lions, tigers, leopards, cheetahs, jaguars, and cougars – are privately owned and held captive in insecure and unsafe conditions. Cub-handling attractions and petting zoos cause irreparable harm to the cubs, which are often separated from their mothers at an extremely young age, and pose a danger to humans, who may be bitten or scratched. There have been more than 700 incidents in the United States involving big cats, including hundreds of human injuries, maulings and deaths.The Netflix series “Tiger King” released in March 2020 greatly raised public awareness of the rampant animal welfare abuses and public safety issues involved in private ownership of big cats. The series showed the abysmal conditions big cats including tigers, lions, and leopards, as well as their cubs, live in throughout the United States, and the immense risks private ownership of these animals poses for the individuals who keep them, the general public, and the animals themselves.The Big Cat Public Safety Act would prohibit the possession of big cats by unlicensed individuals. This bill also restricts direct contact between the public and big cats, including cubs.The legislation is endorsed by numerous animal welfare, conservation, and law enforcement organizations, including the Association of Zoos & Aquariums, National Sheriffs’ Association, Fraternal Order of Police, Animal Welfare Institute, International Fund for Animal Welfare, The Humane Society Legislative Fund, The Humane Society of the United States, Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association, World Wildlife Fund, Endangered Species Coalition, Natural Resources Defense Council, Animal Legal Defense Fund, Big Cat Rescue, and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.The text of the Senate legislation is available here. A similar version of the bill was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in January by U.S. Representatives Mike Quigley (D-IL) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA).-30-"
https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-and-hayes-lead-legislation-to-bring-relief-to-veterans-harmed-in-palomares-nuclear-disaster,"The bill would ensure the more than 1,600 veterans exposed to plutonium while responding to the 1966 nuclear accident in Palomares, Spain get access to VA benefits & health care[Washington, DC] – U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and U.S. Representative Jahana Hayes (D-CT) introduced the bicameral Palomares Veterans Act today to remove barriers to benefits and compensation for the veterans who responded to the 1966 nuclear accident in Palomares, Spain. Many of the 1,600 servicemembers were sent to the site without protective clothing or warning of potential dangers, and were subjected to dangerous levels of radiation.The Palomares Veterans Act would amend current law to include the cleanup of Palomares as a “radiation risk activity.” This would provide Palomares veterans with disability compensation. As many Palomares veterans have passed away over the years, this legislation would also make surviving spouses and their children eligible for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation – a tax-free monetary benefit paid to eligible survivors of veterans whose death resulted from a service-related injury or disease. This would ensure that Palomares veterans exposed to radiation during their service and their families are afforded the health care and benefits they need and deserve.“This bill is urgently needed to bring long-overdue relief to Palomares veterans and their loved ones,” said Blumenthal. “The nuclear disaster in Palomares caused untold suffering and harm to the servicemembers sent in to clean up radioactive material without adequate protective gear or warning of severe health risks. Yet fifty-five years on, the VA still hasn’t recognized radiation risks at Palomares, cutting off benefits and health care for these deserving veterans. They are aging and this cannot wait any longer. We must honor their selfless sacrifice, and enact the Palomares Veterans Act as soon as possible.”“Failing to recognize the sacrifice of Palomares veterans is a breach of our responsibility to service members and veterans. This critical, commonsense legislation works to address this issue. I remain committed to fighting for veterans suffering from all forms of toxic exposure, preventing generations of future veterans from the same fate, and ensuring all veterans have accessible and affordable health care,” said Hayes.In January 1966, a U.S. Air Force B-52 bomber collided with a U.S. Air Force KC-135 tanker aircraft over the Spanish village of Palomares, resulting in one of the largest nuclear disasters in history and causing radiation exposure in approximately 1,600 U.S. airmen who responded to the crash. These airmen were sent to respond to this nuclear accident with little to no protective clothing and were not warned of any potential dangers. They were ordered to clear contaminated crops, shovel tainted soil into burn pits, and consume the local water and food – placing them in direct contact with large amounts of plutonium. Declassified reports from the Atomic Energy Commission show more than 3 billion micrograms of plutonium were released following the crash. Even one microgram of plutonium is considered harmful to the human body—exposure to 3 billion micrograms of plutonium raises significant concerns of toxic exposure in Palomares veterans.Many of the airmen who participated in the cleanup operation are suffering from health conditions that are likely the result of their close contact with radioactive plutonium dust. However, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) does not list Palomares as a radiation-risk activity under current regulations that presume that radiation-exposed veterans with certain conditions are entitled to disability benefits. The VA continues to rely on flawed methodology and data provided by the Air Force that assigns Palomares veterans radiation dose estimates too low to find that their conditions are more likely radiogenic than not. The Air Force’s methodology for assigning radiation exposure estimates after the cleanup operation did not follow scientific protocol and has been determined unreliable—grave errors this legislation seeks to correct.In December 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims found that the VA had not fulfilled its legal responsibility to determine whether the method it uses to assess Palomares veterans’ radiation exposure is scientifically sound and demanded that the VA reexamine this policy. The lead appellant in the case is Retired Chief Master Sergeant Victor Skaar who argues the VA has unjustifiably excluded Palomares from its list of “radiation-risk activities,” and used scientifically unsound methodology to deny Skaar’s disability benefits claims based on exposure to ionizing radiation. Skaar is the lead appellant in a proposed class action of approximately 1,600 Palomares veterans and is represented by the Veterans Legal Services Clinic at Yale Law School.“Palomares veterans, including Retired Chief Master Sergeant Victor Skaar, have been fighting for recognition from the VA and the military for their sacrifices for years. More than fifty years after the event, the Palomares Veterans Act will be a groundbreaking step forward in supporting these veterans and guaranteeing them recognition for their service. Senator Blumenthal has been a persistent advocate for these veterans over the years, and we are grateful for his dedication to improving the lives of Palomares veterans, their survivors, and our client, Mr. Skaar,” said Lauren Lin, Yale's Veterans Legal Services Clinic.The bill has been endorsed by a number of veterans organizations, including the National Association of Atomic Veterans (NAAV), Vietnam Veterans of America, Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium (TBDC), and Military Veterans Advocacy.“NAAV is pleased Senator Blumenthal and Congresswoman Hayes are leading the mission to make sure the Palomares, Spain Broken Arrow cleanup veterans receive the healthcare they have earned though their valiant service to their country,” said NAAV National Commander Keith Kiefer.“The veterans of the 1966 Palomares nuclear disaster have waited over half a century for recognition of their radiation-connected illnesses,” said US Air Force Veteran and Vietnam Veterans of America National President John Rowan. “Until now, their appeals to the VA have been in vain. Vietnam Veterans of America has fought for the VA to recognize and appropriately compensate and treat all wounds, disabilities, and illnesses resulting from military service – including toxic wounds caused by exposure to chemicals and radiation. VVA is proud to support Senator Blumenthal and Congresswoman Hayes in their introduction of the Palomares Veterans Act of 2021, and we urge swift passage of this important legislation which will allow Palomares veterans the long-overdue presumption of service connection for their radiogenic health conditions.”The Senate legislation is also cosponsored by U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA).

https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-and-davis-introduce-bicameral-legislation-to-provide-permanent-funding-for-amtrak,"[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and U.S. Representative Danny Davis (D-IL) introduced the Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund Act today to provide permanent funding for Amtrak. The bicameral legislation would create a dedicated funding stream to help Amtrak invest in major improvement projects, increase passenger rail’s efficiency, and help provide safer, more reliable service. Intercity passenger rail currently relies on the often unpredictable and limited annual appropriations process for funding, making it difficult to plan long-term, comprehensive investments needed to improve the system. The bill is being introduced ahead of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee’s Wednesday hearing on transportation infrastructure. Over the next several months, Congress will consider legislation to reauthorize surface transportation programs, including Amtrak operations.“This bill envisions the long-term, steady funding commitment to our nation’s intercity passenger rail system necessary to ensure it is safe and reliable for passengers today and long into the future,” said Blumenthal. “Every other critical mode of transportation infrastructure in our country has a dedicated funding stream—except for passenger rail. Thanks to this dedicated funding, Amtrak would be able to continually invest in and improve operations. This action is long overdue and this bill should be immediately advanced to ensure the safety of the traveling public.”  “Today, passenger rail represents an opportunity for economic revival, cleaner infrastructure and more efficient travel; it also provides an adequate solution to ground and airport traffic congestion while incorporating rural America into a national transportation system,” said Davis. “Given the status of our nation’s infrastructure, this bill will provide resources to sustaining passenger rail with a dedicated funding stream.”Currently, intercity passenger rail is the only major type of transportation without a dedicated funding stream. The Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund Act would establish a new federal Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund and provide approximately $5.4 billion to that fund annually in grants for repairs, trip time optimizing investments, improving service, modernizing the fleet, and other needs. Forty percent would be reserved in the Northeast Corridor (Washington-New York-Boston) and 60 percent would be reserved for the National Network (Amtrak’s State-Supported and Long-Distance service lines).The legislation is also cosponsored by U.S. Representatives Bobby Rush (D-IL) and Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) in the House. The full text of the Senate legislation can be found here and the bill summary can be found here. A similar version of the bill was introduced in the House.The Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund Act is endorsed by Amtrak, Rail Passengers Association, National League of Cities, and National Disability Rights Network (NDRN).“An intercity passenger rail trust fund would be a game changer for America and for Amtrak,” said Amtrak CEO Bill Flynn. “Nearly every mode of transportation already has a trust fund except for intercity passenger rail. Providing dedicated and predictable funding to Amtrak would help us increase efficiency and improve planning, helping us advance major bridge and tunnel projects and provide energy efficient transportation to more customers, including underserved communities across the nation. We thank Senator Blumenthal and Congressman Davis for their introduction of this important bicameral legislation and urge Congress to consider its passage.”“The Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund Act provides the predictable, dedicated funding required to drive the next great expansion in the U.S. passenger rail network,” said Jim Mathews, President and CEO of the Rail Passengers Association. “If Americans are ever to have access to a world class transportation system, we need to take seriously the problem of how this country funds the creation of modern, efficient passenger rail services; that is just what this bill does. We applaud Senator Blumenthal and Representative Davis for the ambition on display in this legislation, and we stand ready to work with them to pass this proposal into law.”“America’s cities benefit from a robust intercity and commuter rail network that connects our regions, and the Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund Act will give rail the same dependable financing tool that Congress provides already to roads and transit,” said Clarence Anthony, Executive Director and CEO of the National League of Cities. “The National League of Cities thanks Senator Blumenthal and Representative Davis for their leadership in moving forward this common-sense rail proposal.”“Amtrak is a critical form of transportation for millions of Americans with disabilities,” said NDRN Executive Director Curt Decker. “But many Amtrak trains and stations remain inaccessible to people with disabilities. The National Disability Rights Network supports the establishment of a dedicated funding source for Amtrak so they can begin to address these architectural and other accessibility barriers.”-30-"
https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-and-himes-lead-introduction-of-bicameral-legislation-to-close-dangerous-loophole-to-protect-domestic-abuse-survivors,"The U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to consider the Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act this week as part of its reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, landmark legislation designed to support and protect survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault[WASHINGTON, DC] – U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and U.S. Representative Jim Himes (D-CT) led their Congressional colleagues in introducing strongly-supported bicameral legislation to protect domestic violence survivors from gun violence. The Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act is narrowly crafted to close loopholes that allow domestic abusers to legally obtain weapons. The bill is named in memory of Lori Jackson, an Oxford, Connecticut mother of two who was tragically shot and killed by her estranged husband, who had legally obtained a handgun even though he was subject to a temporary restraining order. The U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to take up the legislation this week as part of its reauthorization of the landmark Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).“Strengthening protective orders to keep guns out of the hands of domestic violence abusers will save lives – and could have saved Lori Jackson’s,” said Blumenthal. “When a gun is available, domestic violence is five times more likely to turn deadly for women. Congress must close this dangerous loophole for the sake of domestic violence survivors and end the senseless cycle of gun violence.”“Passing the Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act into law will save lives,” said Himes. “Lori’s death might have been prevented. Women who are the victims of intimate partner violence need laws that keep guns out of the hands of their abusers, or we will see this kind of tragedy repeated over and over. The bill we’re introducing today expands protections in a way that puts domestic abuse victims’ safety first and will mean fewer guns in the hands of dangerous abusers.”“It’s hard to imagine what a family goes through when something like this happens,” said Merry Jackson, Lori Jackson’s mother.  “It never goes away, it’s with you forever. But if you could save another family and kids from losing their mom, it would mean the world to me.”The Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act would close dangerous loopholes in federal law, thereby protecting millions of Americans. Current federal law protects domestic violence survivors from gun violence by preventing their abusers from purchasing or possessing a firearm – but only once the court has issued a permanent restraining order. This leaves survivors unprotected exactly when they are in the most danger: when a domestic abuser first learns his or her victim has left and only a temporary restraining order is in place. Further, the current definition of “intimate partner” used to prohibit individuals convicted of domestic violence from purchasing or possessing a firearm includes spouses, former spouses, people with a child in common, and cohabitants. However, there are many survivors of dating violence who were never married, do not live with their abuser, and have no children.This bill would restrict those under temporary restraining order from purchasing or possessing a firearm, and would extend protections to domestic violence survivors who have been abused by their dating partners. The bill’s provisions are a component of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, landmark legislation designed to support and protect survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault and scheduled to be considered by the U.S. House of Representatives this week.U.S. Senators Chris Murphy (D-CT), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Bob Casey (D-PA), Chris Coons (D-DE), Patty Murray (D-WA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) are cosponsoring the bill in the Senate. The full text of the Senate legislation can be found here. U.S. Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) is cosponsoring the House version of this legislation.“Domestic violence impacts one in four women nationwide, and we’ve got to do more to protect them,” said Murphy. “Leaving an abuser is often fraught with danger for a survivor of domestic violence, and the Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act ensures that women are protected during that critical period, when their abuser may be under a temporary, rather than permanent, restraining order. This is lifesaving legislation, and with the uptick of gun purchases and heightened risk of domestic violence during the pandemic, it is all the more urgent that we get this done.”“Lori Jackson, a mother of two, was a day away from obtaining a permanent restraining order against her abusive husband when a loophole allowed her abuser to purchase a firearm, which he would later use to murder her,” said Durbin. “I am proud to once again support the Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act, which would close this loophole and restrict those with temporary restraining orders from purchasing a firearm.”“Giving domestic abusers access to guns is a deadly combination,” said Feinstein. “A woman is 500 percent more likely to be killed if a gun is present during a domestic violence situation. With the surge in domestic violence during the pandemic, it’s past time to close this loophole and prevent abusers under temporary restraining orders from legally possessing guns.”“Allowing domestic abusers to own a lethal weapon threatens a survivor’s life and day-to-day sense of safety,” said Hassan. “The Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act closes a dangerous loophole that currently allows abusers to buy and possess a gun. I will continue working with my colleagues to pass commonsense gun safety measures like this one that will help keep our communities safe and prevent more senseless acts of gun violence.”“Gun sales in the United States have surged to record heights since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic last March, and we know that periods of crisis and financial stress only increase the likelihood of domestic violence,” said Markey. “I am proud to co-sponsor the Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act with Senator Blumenthal. If a person has a temporary restraining order, they should not have access to a gun. This legislation will save lives and is a commonsense approach to public safety.”“Congress needs to take more steps to protect people who have experienced domestic violence,” said Smith. “This legislation will prevent a domestic abuser who is subject to a temporary restraining order from buying or possessing a firearm. It’s one of the many steps we should take to support and empower individuals who have experienced domestic violence.”“Preventing domestic abusers from accessing firearms should not be a controversial concept. It’s a common-sense measure to keep survivors and their families out of harm’s way and make our communities safer,” said Shaheen. “This legislation would help save lives by helping to keep firearms out of the hands of those who wish to do harm. It’s time for Congress to get this done and amend the law to provide survivors with the protection they need and deserve.”“There’s no excuse for gaps in federal law that expose domestic violence victims to gun violence,” said Whitehouse. “I’m glad to cosponsor this important bill to help protect millions of survivors.”“As a former prosecutor, I have seen firsthand how victims of domestic violence too often live in fear not only for their own lives, but also the lives of their loved ones. That is why I have made protecting these victims one of my top priorities in the Senate,” said Klobuchar. “This commonsense legislation will prevent abusive partners from accessing guns – an important step to ensure victims’ safety. We can never stop working on behalf of women, children, and families everywhere to end domestic violence.”“Domestic violence is all too common across this nation, and every survivor deserves to feel safe and protected,” said Duckworth. “This means closing the senseless loopholes that allow abusers with temporary restraining orders to legally access firearms. We must do more to ensure the safety of survivors and support these necessary protections, and I’m proud to join Senator Blumenthal in helping introduce this vital legislation.”“Back in 2018, Oregon closed the ‘boyfriend loophole,’ protecting domestic abuse survivors from gun violence at the hands of their abusers. Domestic abuse survivors in every single state deserve the same level of protection as Oregonians,” said Wyden. “Congress must swiftly pass this needed public safety measure to help keep our most vulnerable safe.”“We need to close a loophole that allows easy access of guns for domestic abusers who shouldn’t have them,” said Baldwin. “This legislation will protect domestic violence survivors whose lives are too often taken by gun violence.”“We know that a gun in the hands of an abusive partner is a deadly combination,” said Menendez. “Yet while federal laws are intended to help protect victims of domestic violence, dangerous loopholes allow these abusers to buy and keep firearms even while under a temporary restraining order.  Survivors of domestic violence do not have another moment to waste before we act. Throughout the pandemic, firearm sales have surged. We must do everything in our power to keep guns out of the hands of violent abusers, protect survivors and save lives.”“Domestic violence is a public health crisis in this country, and the failure of Congress to pass commonsense gun violence prevention legislation has made such a crisis even deadlier,” said Casey. “In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic that has caused an increase in reports of domestic violence, we must act now to pass The Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act and close the loophole that allows abusers to obtain weapons before another life is lost.”“I am proud to join Senator Blumenthal to reintroduce the Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act,” said Coons. “No abuser should have access to firearms, and no survivor of domestic violence should live with that fear. This bill will take critical steps to protect survivors by restricting those under temporary restraining orders from purchasing a firearm.”“The alarming rise of domestic violence during this pandemic—particularly for women of color, for whom the crisis is even more dire—has made it all the more urgent that we close the dangerous loophole that allows abusers and stalkers to obtain firearms,” said Murray. “We owe it to women and families across the country—and to Lori Jackson and her family—to make this common-sense reform. I’m proud to join Senator Blumenthal to introduce this critical bill and I’ll keep fighting in the Senate to strengthen protections for domestic violence survivors and ensure they have the resources they need to stay safe, obtain justice, and heal.”“In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, our country is in the middle of another public health crisis: the gun violence epidemic that is tearing our communities apart,” said Warren. “Congress has a duty to make this country safer by enacting strong gun violence prevention laws, and that includes common-sense laws like The Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act, which closes dangerous loopholes that allow domestic abusers to obtain firearms.”“Domestic abusers should not be able to purchase a gun,” said Gillibrand. “Under current law, domestic abusers with temporary restraining orders can still purchase or possess a firearm, putting survivors in danger. The Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act is designed to close dangerous loopholes that allow abusers to legally obtain weapons and strengthen protections for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault.”The legislation is supported by a number of advocacy and support groups, including National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, Everytown for Gun Safety, Giffords, Brady, Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, Newtown Action Alliance, Sandy Hook Promise, and the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence (CCADV).“Armed domestic abusers pose a unique danger to their victims and their communities. An estimated 4.5 million American women alive today have been threatened by an abuser with a firearm; 1 million have either been shot or shot at. An abuser’s possession of a firearm is correlated with increased severity of domestic violence and with increased prevalence of stalking,” said President and CEO of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence Ruth M. Glenn. “When a male abuser has access to a firearm, the likelihood that he will murder a female intimate partner increases by 400%. The Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act is critical to keeping guns out of the hands of adjudicated abusers. It will minimize risk and save lives.""“Disarming domestic abusers saves lives. But, due to deadly loopholes in our federal laws, there’s nothing stopping abusive dating partners and people with temporary restraining orders from buying or possessing a firearm, even though the presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation makes it five times more likely that a woman will be murdered,” said founder of Moms Demand Action Shannon Watts. “We applaud Senator Blumenthal for his unwavering leadership on this issue, and we urge his colleagues to join him in fighting to close these deadly loopholes for good.""“Lori Jackson’s story is a tragic reminder of the unique threat that firearms pose to individuals in situations of intimate partner violence, especially in the high-risk period when a victim is taking the courageous step of leaving their abuser,” said Brady President Kris Brown. “Risk of homicide increases by nearly 500 percent when a firearm is in a home where intimate partner violence is taking place - a risk that disproportionately affects women. When half of women killed by intimate partners were killed by dating partners, this bill is a common-sense remedy to this clear and present threat, protecting victims of abuse regardless of marital status or when they seek a temporary restraining order from an active abuser. Brady is grateful to Sen. Blumenthal for championing this lifesaving bill.”""This bill will save lives by bridging the gap between our laws and the lived realities of millions of people confronting domestic violence,"" said Director of Federal Affairs for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence Dakota Jablon. ""Intimate partner violence and gun violence are inextricably linked public health crises — domestic violence is five times more likely to be deadly if the perpetrator has access to a gun. CSGV thanks Senator Blumenthal for his leadership in expanding these lifesaving protections by introducing the Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Protection Act, and we look forward to seeing this bill become law.""“More guns were sold in 2020 than any other year. Amid the dangerous surge in gun sales during the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a safety warning on its website for the victims of domestic violence. We agree with the DOJ that increased stress and financial uncertainty during the pandemic coupled with more guns in the homes will result in increased risk for the domestic violence victims. In America, domestic violence victims are five times more likely to be killed when the abusers have access to guns. Congress must pass Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act now to keep guns away from abusers to save lives, particularly during this prolonged unprecedented pandemic,” said Chairwoman of Newtown Action Alliance Po Murray.“The Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act is a commonsense law that will help protect families from violence in times of crisis. Gun violence is preventable when we know the warning signs, including domestic violence, and put in place proven safety laws to stop a tragedy before it happens,” said Mark Barden, co-founder and managing director of Sandy Hook Promise, and father of Daniel who was killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary tragedy. “We thank Senator Blumenthal for introducing this legislation that will keep more families safe.”“This measure provides comprehensive protection for victims of domestic violence at the absolute most dangerous time,” said CCADV Director of Public Policy & Communications Liza Andrews. “Domestic violence and access to firearms is a deadly combination and this is never more true than when a victim is taking steps to end an abusive relationship. It is during this time more than ever when they need protection from firearms and that is what this law will provide if passed. We thank Senators Blumenthal and Murphy and the entire Connecticut delegation for their ongoing leadership on this matter.”-30-"

The Supporting Early-Career Researchers Act would create a new postdoctoral fellowship program at the National Science Foundation (NSF) to prevent the loss of research talent due to job market disruptions caused by the economic decline during and after the pandemic.“This bill creates a new NSF postdoctoral fellowship program to support the next generation of STEM talent,” said Blumenthal. “STEM researchers who are just starting out in their careers, especially women and minority groups traditionally underrepresented in this field, have been hit hard by COVID-related lab closures, funding shortages, and lost job opportunities. Through this program, Congress can support talented scientists and continue to invest in American innovation. This is a win-win and I encourage my colleagues to join this effort.”The Supporting Early-Career Researchers Act is also co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Chris Coons (D-DE). A similar bill was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in January by House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX) and Ranking Member Frank Lucas (R-OK).“The pandemic has disrupted everyday life and made it even more difficult for early career researchers pursuing STEM fields - especially for women and minority researchers who already faced substantial barriers in these fields,” said Hirono. “This bill will create essential opportunities at the National Science Foundation so that the next generation of scientists can continue to advance in their careers.”“Scientific research is crucial to spurring innovation that ultimately creates jobs, drives our economy, and saves lives. We cannot allow the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic downturn to slow the pipeline of up-and-coming researchers, particularly at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other Minority-Serving Institutions, who have been most negatively impacted by the fallout from the pandemic. This legislation will help ensure that we don’t fall behind and that the United States continues to lead the world in research and development,” said Van Hollen.“This pandemic has proven how crucial STEM skills are to the future of our country – but many of our young scientists’ careers have been adversely affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Brown. “In times of crisis, we have to make sure that equitable opportunities are afforded to postdoctoral scholars in STEM fields, which were already woefully underrepresented by women and especially women of color, well before the pandemic. This bill does that. ”“I’m proud to join Senator Blumenthal in introducing the Supporting Early-Career Researchers Act,” said Coons, co-chair of the HBCU Caucus. “This bill will help talented young scientists struggling to find work during the pandemic secure research positions and support America’s leadership in scientific innovation.”The bill has been endorsed by the Association of American Universities, the Council of Graduate Schools, the American Mathematical Society, the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities, and the National Postdoctoral Association.The full text of the legislation can be found here.-30-"
https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-leads-introduction-of-legislation-opening-the-courthouse-doors-to-consumers-workers,"[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – Today, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) led a group of 39 senators in introducing legislation to stop the use of unfair forced arbitration clauses, which are widely used to limit Americans’ access to justice. The FAIR (Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal) Act would eliminate forced arbitration clauses in consumer, antitrust, employment, and civil rights cases, and would allow consumers and workers to freely choose arbitration after a dispute occurs.“Forced arbitration is unfair and un-American – and during a global pandemic, it’s also unsafe. Workers forced into a rigged arbitration system have lost one of the most powerful tools they have to hold employers accountable for gambling with their safety: access to justice,” Blumenthal said. “But workers aren’t the only ones at risk – nearly every American been stripped of their basic right to justice, whether they know it or not. Nursing homes have forced arbitration agreements. Cell phone and cable contracts have forced arbitration agreements.”“One of the fundamental principles of our American democracy is that everyone gets their day in court. Forced arbitration deprives Americans of that basic right. The Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act simply rights that basic wrong.”Forced arbitration clauses restrict Americans’ access to justice by stripping consumers and workers of their right to go to court. Instead, consumers and workers are forced into an unfair arbitration system where corporations can write the rules; everything can be done in secret, without public rulings; discovery can be limited, making it hard for consumers to get the evidence they need to prove their case; and there’s no meaningful judicial review, so consumers and employees are often unable to appeal a decision even if the arbitrator gets it wrong. The FAIR Act is co-sponsored in the Senate by: U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA), U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI), U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-MN), U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM), U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH), U.S. Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR), U.S. Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI), U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA), U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-NV), U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), U.S. Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ), U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT), U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-DE), U.S. Senator Gary Peters (D-MI), U.S. Senator Jackie Rosen (D-NV), U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), U.S. Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA), U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-DE), U.S. Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO), U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-CA), U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), U.S. Senator Raphael Warnock (D-GA), and U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff (D-GA).A companion measure was introduced in the House of Representatives in February by U.S. Representative Hank Johnson (GA-04), Chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet. Johnson announced bill’s introduction at a hearing on “Justice Restored: Ending Forced Arbitration and Protecting Fundamental Rights” in the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law.

This legislation would establish a “presumption of service connection” for the veterans who served at Karshi-Khanabad Air Base (K2) in Uzbekistan and who have since been diagnosed with toxic exposure-related illnesses and diseases, requiring the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide health care and benefits. “This bill will be a lifeline for the veterans who were exposed to dangerous toxins in the glowing ponds and black goo reported at K2,” said Blumenthal. “We must honor the commitment we make to our servicemembers when we send them to war and ensure these deserving veterans get the treatment they urgently need. The strong evidence of K2 veterans suffering from cancers and other illnesses at high rates is a moral mandate to act. The lives of hundreds—and potentially thousands—of veterans are at stake and the VA cannot waste any more time to make good on its promise to treat our nation’s bravest. I’m proud to lead this important effort alongside Senator Baldwin and Representatives Lynch and Green.”“The Pentagon has known for years that our U.S. troops were exposed to cancer-causing toxins while serving in Uzbekistan and it’s simply wrong for the VA to deny them health care and disability benefits. The VA has taken a similar approach in the past, delaying recognition and compensation for American veterans exposed to toxic substances like Agent Orange in Vietnam, and with military burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan, while veterans became sick and died. We can’t let that happen again,” said Baldwin. “Our legislation does right by those who served at K2 and were exposed to health risks. We have a commitment to these troops and we need to keep it.”“Almost two decades ago, our K2 heroes and their families risked everything to defend our country following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks,” said Lynch, Chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee’s Subcommittee on National Security whose Subcommittee investigation led to the release of declassified DOD documents detailing K2 veterans’ exposure to toxins. “Despite clear evidence uncovered by the National Security Subcommittee that K2 veterans were exposed to cancer-causing hazards, the VA continues to reject their claims for service-connected disability benefits. Our veterans and their families deserve better. Today’s bill is an important step toward rectifying this injustice. I thank Congressman Mark Green and Senators Richard Blumenthal and Tammy Baldwin for their leadership on this critical issue.”“It is shameful that the Department of Veterans Affairs has not yet acknowledged a service connection between deployment to K2 Air Base and toxic-exposure related illnesses,” said Green. “Our K2 veterans fought for us, now it’s time to fight for them. Our bill requires the VA to acknowledge a causal relationship between deployment to the base and the rare cancers and other serious illnesses our veterans are facing nearly two decades later. This is a significant step forward in the fight for justice and ensures that those who served at the base can receive the treatment they need. America’s K2 veterans put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms. It’s long past time we do what’s right and give them the respect and medical care they deserve.”As many as 15,000 U.S. servicemembers deployed to K2 Air Base—an old Soviet military site leased to the U.S. from the Uzbek government between 2001 and 2005—to support military operations into northern Afghanistan following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Recent media reports and declassified Department of Defense (DOD) documents released by the House Oversight and Reform Committee’s Subcommittee on National Security indicate that K2 servicemembers were exposed to multiple cancer-causing toxic chemicals and radiological hazards during their deployments. These toxins include hazardous petrochemicals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), depleted uranium, burn pits, and elevated levels of tetrachloroethylene.According to a September 2004 health assessment, the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine found that, “the potential for daily contact with radiation exists for up to 100% of the assigned units” at the K2 base. In April 2020, the VA announced that it would study illnesses among K2 veterans including cancers, but results from the study are not expected for at least 18 months.The K2 Veterans Care Act would create a “presumption of service connection” for illnesses associated with toxic exposures at K2. This presumption of service connection would require the VA to provide health care and disability benefits to any K2 veterans who presents diseases associated with jet fuel, VOCs, particulate matter, depleted uranium, asbestos, and lead-based paint—all of which were toxins found at K2.The legislation has been endorsed by Wounded Warrior Project, Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), Disabled Veterans of America (DAV), and the Stronghold Freedom Foundation.“Many veterans who served at the Karshi Khanabad (K2) base have developed serious health issues due to exposure to toxicants,” said Wounded Warrior Project Vice President of Government Affairs Jose Ramos. “The K2 Veterans Care Act of 2020 will provide these veterans the hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care they need and deserve. We thank Senators Blumenthal and Baldwin for introducing this bill and look forward to working with them to ensure its passage in the Senate.”“The veterans who deployed to Karshi-Khanabad Air Base (K2) were exposed to dangerous substances while serving our country,” said Director of VFW’s National Legislative Service Pat Murray. “Thousands of troops worked and slept in dangerous conditions every day and they are suffering illnesses because of their service. The VFW supports this proposal and looks forward to its swift passage so our K2 veterans can begin to receive the care and benefits they rightfully deserve.”“We know that the thousands of veterans who served at Karshi-Khanabad (K2) Air Base in Uzbekistan were exposed to toxins, burn pits and depleted uranium; however, many have been denied health care and benefits for diseases or conditions related to those exposures,” said DAV Deputy National Legislative Director for Benefits Shane Liermann. “DAV fully supports the K2 Veterans Care Act, as it would provide health care eligibility and establish a framework for presumptive diseases that could lead to benefits for these veterans. We thank Senator Blumenthal for his leadership and his commitment to the men and women who served, especially those whose service has led to such serious disabilities.”“The Stronghold Freedom Foundation gladly endorses and supports the introduction of the K2 Veterans Care Act of 2021. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the very first US servicemembers arriving at that far-flung and toxic base. This legislation will finally provide K2 veterans, their families, and their survivors with the recognition and care they earned those many years ago. We are grateful for Senator Blumenthal's leadership on K2 and look forward to working with lawmakers as this bill becomes law.”The Senate legislation has also been cosponsored by U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). The House version of this legislation currently has 58 cosponsors.The full text of the Senate legislation can be found here and the full text of the House legislation can be found here.-30-"
https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-calls-on-facebook-and-twitter-to-stop-spread-of-antivax-disinformation-about-covid-19-vaccine-targeting-pregnant-women,"“Compounding a profound tragedy, these abusive accounts have singled out women who have endured miscarriages, despicably blaming them for the loss, and wrongly linking them to their vaccination.”[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) called on Facebook and Twitter to put a stop to the social media harassment and COVID-19 vaccine disinformation campaigns by antivax groups targeting expectant mothers and women who have experienced miscarriages. Recent reporting revealed that mothers who have posted about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine on social media have experienced abuse and harassment by strangers or groups spreading conspiracy theories about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine.“Time and again, Facebook and its peers have moved far too slow in responding to the targeted harassment and promotion of destructive conspiracy theories against women and people of color. These mothers, through raising awareness to the vaccine and setting an example for the community, are doing an immense public service and lovingly protecting their infants,” wrote Blumenthal in a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. A similar letter was also sent to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. “Health officials across the country are vigilantly working to reassure the public that vaccines are safe and to achieve widespread immunity to save lives. Each piece of misinformation, each person bullied for doing the right thing, is a setback in our effort to end this costly pandemic.”Blumenthal pointed out that despite Facebook’s February 8 announcement that the company was “expanding the list of false claims we will remove to include additional debunked claims about COVID-19 and vaccines,” accounts with thousands of followers and coordinated groups continue to be active and promote vaccine misinformation and conspiracy theories. Blumenthal called on Facebook to swiftly make good on its promises, saying: “if Facebook fails to follow through on these policies with real enforcement, then these destructive campaigns of disinformation will continue - with catastrophic costs for children’s lives and to public health.”The full text of the letter to Facebook can be found here and below. The letter to Twitter is available here.Dear Mr. Zuckerberg,I write with alarm about harassment on Facebook and Instagram of expectant mothers and women that have suffered miscarriages by groups and accounts promoting conspiracy theories and disinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine. Facebook must be willing to meet its commitments to stop health misinformation with forceful and effective action, and I write to request information about what steps it has taken to stop this horrific and destructive abuse.According to heart-breaking stories documented by The Daily Beast, mothers that have posted on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine have been flooded with abuse and harassed by strangers from ‘antivax’ circles.[1] For example, when Candice Cody, an anesthesiologist and former Survivor contestant, tweeted in December about being vaccinated while pregnant – encouraging mothers not to be afraid – she was inundated with obscene messages and false information across platforms. Compounding a profound tragedy, these abusive accounts have singled out women who have endured miscarriages, despicably blaming them for the loss, and wrongly linking them to their vaccination.Such disinformation is clearly coordinated, often through private groups and public pages that scour social media for targets and anecdotes for feeding their campaign. One Instagram account, in operation since December with over 100,000 followers, continues to promote misinformation and misleading anecdotes about vaccine safety and the effectiveness of facemasks. These accounts and groups, on both Facebook and Twitter, have also become a launching point for swarms of believers to prey on mothers to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Despite a clear pattern of violating platform policies, these accounts are still active, with large numbers of followers and are easily findable.Time and again, Facebook and its peers have moved far too slow in responding to the targeted harassment and promotion of destructive conspiracy theories against women and people of color. These mothers, through raising awareness to the vaccine and setting an example for the community, are doing an immense public service and lovingly protecting their infants. They are also acting responsibly: there is no evidence that any COVID-19 vaccine is unsafe for pregnant women and mothers, and, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, at least 20,000 pregnant women have been vaccinated without complication.[2] On the other hand, there is immense evidence that pregnant women are at an increased risk for severe illness or death due to COVID-19.[3]Health officials across the country are vigilantly working to reassure the public that vaccines are safe and to achieve widespread immunity to save lives. Each piece of misinformation, each person bullied for doing the right thing, is a setback in our effort to end this costly pandemic. I welcome Facebook’s February 8th announcement that it was “expanding the list of false claims we will remove to include additional debunked claims about COVID-19 and vaccines,” including false claims that vaccines are toxic or dangerous.[4] However, if Facebook fails to follow through on these policies with real enforcement, then these destructive campaigns of disinformation will continue - with catastrophic costs for children’s lives and to public health.Given the urgency of the vaccination efforts, I respectfully request answers to the following questions by February 28th:1.)   What specific steps has Facebook taken to enforce its policies against ‘antivax’ groups, content, and accounts since its announcement that it would remove false claims about COVID-19 vaccines, including the removal or demotion of groups and accounts?2.)   Does Facebook consider the harassment and singling out with disinformation against expectant mothers and women that have suffered a miscarriage to be a violation of its terms of service? 3.)   What enforcement actions does Facebook intend to take against accounts and groups involved in campaigns of abuse against these women?  Does Facebook ban those accounts that have engaged in such harassment, or does it allow for multiple infractions before shutting down these accounts?4.)   Why has Facebook failed to remove accounts identified by The Daily Beast as singling out and preying on women who have been vaccinated?5.)   How does Facebook enforce its COVID-19 policies against accounts that focus on creating ‘vaccine hesitancy,’ such as those systemically cherry picking or distorting information, or exploiting anecdotal cases to deter vaccinations?6.)   What steps is Facebook taking to proactively find private Facebook Groups and identify key accounts used to coordinate disinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines?Thank you for your attention to these important issues. I look forward to your response.Sincerely,-30-[1] Emily Shugerman, “Anti-Vaxers Wage Cruel War on Pregnant Women who get COVID Shot,” Daily Beast, February 16, 2021, https://www.thedailybeast.com/anti-vaxxers-wage-cruel-war-on-pregnant-women-who-get-covid-shot.[2] “Fauci: 20,000 pregnant women have had COVID vaccine without complications,” Axios, February 11, 2021, https://www.axios.com/fauci-pregnant-women-covid-19-vaccine-39c9e299-b14c-4d7d-9e9d-1b7444251302.html.[3] Centers for Disease Control, “Pregnancy, Breastfeeding, and Caring for Newborns,” https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html (accessed February18, 2021).[4] Guy Rosen, “An Update on Our Work to Keep People Informed and Limit Misinformation About COVID-19,” Facebook, February 8, 2021, https://about.fb.com/news/2020/04/covid-19-misinfo-update/#removing-more-false-claims."
https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-cantwell-markey-introduce-legislation-to-ensure-transportation-worker-safety-amid-covid-19-pandemic,"The Essential Transportation Employee Safety Act would build upon President Biden’s Executive Order, federally mandating masks on certain modes of transportation[WASHINGTON, DC] – U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Edward J. Markey (D-MA), members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, introduced the Essential Transportation Employee Safety Act today to address workplace safety for essential transportation workers. The legislation – endorsed by the country’s leading transportation labor unions – would prioritize coronavirus testing for transportation workers, and ensure employers implement critical health and safety requirements to keep their workforce safe.The bill would also expand upon President Joe Biden’s recent Executive Order and codify a federal mask mandate on certain modes of transportation during the pandemic, including airplanes, trains, and city and state public transportation.“Frontline transportation workers must have safe working conditions amid the pandemic,” said Blumenthal. “These workers are tirelessly serving our public on the roads, railways, and in the skies, and must have priority access to testing, personal protective equipment, and a safe workplace. This bill would also make wearing a mask on passenger transportation the law, protecting the traveling public and transportation workers during the pandemic and building on President Biden’s recent Executive Order. I am proud to introduce this bill with Chair Cantwell and Senator Markey to put in place strong health and safety standards, and give transportation workers the critical tools they need to do their jobs safely.”“Throughout the pandemic we’ve seen how important the transportation sector is to delivering supplies to fight COVID-19 and helping our economy,” said Cantwell. “Our frontline transportation workers have worked tirelessly to keep America running, and we’ve seen as our dock workers and others have suffered increased infection rates of COVID how delivery of goods and products is threatened. We need to do more for these workers. I’m proud to cosponsor this legislation with Senator Blumenthal and Senator Markey to require transportation companies follow CDC recommendations on cleaning and get PPE to our frontline workers.”“The coronavirus pandemic places a unique burden on the American workforce,” said Markey. “While millions of Americans are sheltering at home to protect public health, essential workers continue to report to work at increased risk to themselves and their families. In particular, transportation workers are providing vital services that the rest of our economy relies on to keep moving. These heroes deserve priority access to coronavirus testing, personal protective equipment on the job, and strong safety rules. That’s why I am proud to join Senator Blumenthal and Chair Cantwell in introducing this critical legislation.”The Essential Transportation Employee Safety Act would require the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to support the efforts of state and local governments to provide for priority testing of transportation workers. It would also implement personal protective equipment and disinfection and sanitization requirements for owners and operators of equipment or facilities used by certain transportation employers.The full text of the legislation can be found here and the bill summary can be found here.The Essential Transportation Employee Safety Act is endorsed by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the Transportation Trades Department–AFL-CIO (TTD), which represents thirty-three transportation labor unions, including the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), the Association of Flight Attendants–CWA (AFA-CWA), and the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU).“Throughout the course of this pandemic, America’s transportation workers have rightly been celebrated as frontline heroes for their dedication and fearlessness in the face of danger,” said International Brotherhood of Teamsters General President James Hoffa. “The American people now fully recognize the essential role that the transportation workforce plays in keeping our stores stocked, our hospitals fully supplied, and our vaccine distribution sites up and running. The Essential Transportation Employee Safety Act enacts enforceable standards by which employers must abide in order to protect the safety and wellbeing of these dedicated workers. From sanitation standards on shared equipment to a mask mandate for passengers, the protections outlined in this bill will make a real difference in the lives of transportation workers. I thank Senators Blumenthal, Cantwell, and Markey for introducing this critical legislation, and look forward to working with them to see that these protections become enshrined in law.”“From bus drivers to pilots, the working people who serve on the frontlines of our transportation system risk their health and wellbeing daily as they see us through the COVID-19 crisis. In return, we have an obligation to keep them safe from this virus and treat them with the dignity and respect they deserve,” said secretary-treasurer of the 33 union Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO (TTD) Greg Regan. “The Essential Transportation Employee Safety Act will establish the strong federal mandates that are needed to ensure the safety of this critical workforce.”“Pilots are ready to welcome more passengers back onboard our planes and make that ‘cleared for takeoff’ announcement – and this bill will help ensure we all have a smooth flight,” said ALPA President, Capt. Joe DePete. “Along with the recent implementation of the federal mask mandate, the Essential Transportation Employee Act will help restore confidence in the transportation system and turn the American economy around. ALPA applauds Senators Blumenthal, Cantwell, and Markey for their efforts to enhance workplace safety for essential transportation workers.”“The TWU appreciates the efforts of Senators Blumenthal, Cantwell, and Markey in their fight on behalf of transport workers,” said TWU President John Samuelsen. “As we mourn our brothers and sisters that we have tragically lost to this virus, our members have nevertheless shown up to work every day for the past year at great personal risk. There is no question that transport workers deserve priority testing and other safety measures in this bill that will allow our members to safely perform their essential work. This is a step our country must take if we want to recover from this pandemic.”“One year ago, Flight Attendants called for a coordinated, robust, enforceable plan to keep workers safe and stop the virus from becoming a pandemic,"" said Sara Nelson, Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, representing nearly 50,000 Flight Attendants at 17 airlines. ""We applaud the leadership of Senators Blumenthal, Markey, and Cantwell who introduced this legislation last year. We must take swift and decisive action to pass and implement this and other measures to contain and defeat the virus and restore our industry and economy."" -30-"
https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-murphy-and-delauro-introduce-safe-gun-storage-legislation,"Ethan’s Law, named in honor of Guilford teen Ethan Song, would create federal requirements for safe gun storage and strong penalties for any violations[WASHINGTON, DC] – U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) and U.S. Representative Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) led a group of nine Members of Congress in introducing Ethan’s Law. This legislation will create federal requirements for safe gun storage and establish strong penalties for any violations. The bill is named in honor of Ethan Song, a teenager from Guilford, Connecticut, who was tragically killed on January 31, 2018 – almost exactly three years ago – after accidentally shooting himself with an unsecured gun in a neighbor’s home. Blumenthal, Murphy, and DeLauro unveiled the legislation during a virtual news conference earlier today with Ethan Song’s parents, Kristin and Mike Song.“Requiring safe firearm storage is a simple, straightforward step that will save lives,” Blumenthal said. “Ethan Song was killed tragically and needlessly because of an unsecured gun, but his parents Kristin and Mike turned their grief into powerful advocacy to save others. We can prevent other families from the heartbreak the Song family has endured by passing the commonsense Ethan’s Law and mandating gun owners to store their firearms responsibly.”“Far too many lives have been lost due to children getting access to a weapon that’s not securely stored. That has to change. I’m proud to join my friends Senator Blumenthal and Congresswoman DeLauro in reintroducing this legislation to honor Ethan Song’s life. ‘Ethan’s Law’ was enacted in Connecticut and has proven that it works. It’s now time for the Congress to do the same,” Murphy said.“If basic safety measures and consequences had been codified into law, Ethan Song’s tragic death could have been prevented,” DeLauro said. “In fact, thousands of lives every year could be saved. Just one month and a few days into 2021, there have been 14 unintentional shootings by children, resulting in four deaths and 11 injuries. These tragedies are preventable, and the Congress has a duty to pass legislation that protects our children from senseless and accidental violence. Mike and Kristin Song turned their own personal tragedy into a crusade to protect children. Ethan’s Law will protect families – both those who own guns and those who do not. Mike and Kristin, you made your voices heard at the state level in Connecticut, and now we must follow your lead on the federal level.”""In the time it takes you to take a breath, my beautiful boy was killed. In the time it takes you to take a breath, the gun that killed my beautiful boy could have been secured,” Kristin Song said. “Since Ethan's death on January 31, 2018, more than 8,700 children have joined Ethan in heaven, and their families have joined my family down the path of tears. There is no hidden agenda behind Ethan's Law. The sole purpose is simple—to keep kids safe.""An estimated 4.6 million American minors live in a household with at least one loaded and unlocked gun. Every day, an estimated eight children and teens are injured or killed due to an unsafely stored firearm. Under Ethan’s Law, gun owners would be required to secure their firearms in a “secure gun storage or safety device” if a minor is likely to gain access to the firearm without permission, or if a resident of the dwelling cannot legally possess a firearm. The bill also includes incentives for states to pass, and enforce their own safe gun storage laws.The Connecticut General Assembly passed Ethan’s Law in May of 2019, led by State Representative Sean Scanlon and State Senator Christine Cohen, and it was signed by Governor Ned Lamont in June 2019. Although other states have laws requiring the safe storage of firearms, they are inconsistent and sometimes difficult to enforce.In addition to Blumenthal, Murphy, and DeLauro the legislation was cosponsored in the Senate by U.S. Senators Edward J. Markey (D-MA) and Bob Casey (D-PA) and in the House by U.S. Representatives John Larson (D-CT), Joe Courtney (D-CT), Jim Himes (D-CT), and Jahana Hayes (D-CT). The text of the Senate legislation can be found here. “Far too many lives are lost each year to gun-related incidents,” Larson said. “Deaths due to improper gun storage are preventable, and Ethan’s Law would ensure there is a federal standard for safe gun storage. Connecticut has already passed this initiative, and I am proud to join Congresswoman DeLauro and Ethan’s parents in this effort, on the federal level, to prevent other families from experiencing this tragic loss.”“I was proud to join the Song family, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, and my colleagues today to honor the life of Ethan Song,” Courtney said. “Our Connecticut delegation is United to advance this legislation in the same manner that the Connecticut General Assembly did in 2019 when they passed Ethan’s Law. This bill is commonsense, and it could help save lives. I urge the rest of my colleagues in the House to join us and ensure its swift passage.”“Passing Ethan’s Law on the federal level will reduce accidents and theft involving firearms,” Himes said. “The majority of gun owners and non-gun owners across the country support safe storage laws. We in Connecticut know this, which is why Ethan’s Law passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in the Connecticut House of Representatives and the State Senate. It’s time for Congress to realize that we have the backing of the American people to enact firearm safety legislation to protect our families and communities and finally act.”“Thank you to the Song family, and to my colleagues, for their tireless work on this critical legislation. Connecticut is no stranger to gun violence. But in the wake of tragedy, Connecticut has led the way in implementing commonsense gun violence prevention laws and closing loopholes that leave children and families vulnerable. It is time the federal government follow our state’s lead,” Hayes said. “Congress has a moral imperative to ensure that no family has to worry about their children having access to a gun and that all firearms are secured properly. I will continue to work to advance Ethan’s Law, and advocate for laws to prevent violence across the country.”-30-"
