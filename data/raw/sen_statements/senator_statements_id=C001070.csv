As supporters of legislation that would establish an outbound investment screen, the signatories are pushing for President Biden to issue an Executive Order to protect American workers and advance U.S. national and economic security interests.“When we cede our manufacturing power and technological know-how to foreign adversaries, we are hurting our economy, our global competitiveness, American workers, industry and national security. Government action on this front is long overdue to address the scope and magnitude of these serious risks we face as a country,” the members of Congress wrote.The National Critical Capabilities Defense Act would establish an interagency outbound investment review committee in order to better understand the vulnerabilities created in U.S. supply chains as private industries continue to offshore critical capabilities to China and other foreign adversaries.Full text of the letter is below and a signed PDF is HERE.The Honorable Joseph R. BidenPresident of the United StatesThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NWWashington, DC 20500Dear President Biden:We write to you as the bipartisan and bicameral supporters of the National Critical Capabilities Defense Act (S. 1854 and H.R. 6323). We championed this legislation to enhance visibility on supply chain vulnerabilities and to prevent the offshoring of critical production capacity and intellectual property to our foreign adversaries, including the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the Russian Federation, that threatens American workers and our national security. Through input and support received from stakeholders and your Administration, the sponsors are revising this bill to help the U.S. government strengthen national security and ensure the resilience of our critical supply chains through increased transparency and oversight over outbound investments.We appreciate your Administration’s support for our efforts. While we believe that this revised legislation provides the U.S. with the strongest foundation to compete in a global economy, American workers, businesses and our national security cannot afford to wait. As deliberations continue in Congress, we urge your Administration to move forward with executive action—which can then be bolstered by statutory provisions—to safeguard our national security and supply chain resiliency on outbound investments to foreign adversaries. This is how the oversight of inbound foreign investment was initially established—Executive Order.This is an effort we have long supported and advocated for as lawmakers. Such action should include robust stakeholder engagement and congressional input and oversight from the committees of jurisdiction to provide certainty and clarity for all involved.The pandemic shined a spotlight on just how exposed U.S. supply chains are and the severe cost of relying on foreign adversaries for our Nation’s critical capabilities. The PRC, for example, has an egregious track record of promoting intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer. While this unsettling trend is not new, we know action is needed to address vulnerabilities for many sectors of our economy so that we can advance U.S. national and economic security interests.When we cede our manufacturing power and technological know-how to foreign adversaries, we are hurting our economy, our global competitiveness, American workers, industry and national security. Government action on this front is long overdue to address the scope and magnitude of these serious risks we face as a country.Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to working with the Administration to safeguard our Nation’s critical capabilities. We hope that you will keep us updated about the Administration’s proposals on this important effort as they are being developed."

During the hearing, the Senators highlighted the passage of their bipartisan Stop Senior Scams Act, which directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to create a federal advisory council charged with improving education and training efforts so that businesses and financial institutions can better identify and prevent scams. In one week, the FTC will convene its first meeting of the federal advisory council.“While predatory scams have existed for decades, the pandemic has exacerbated this issue, as fraudsters preyed on fear and uncertainty surrounding the virus to scam seniors out of their hard-earned savings. As scammers get smarter, it is vital that we combat this from all sides—from businesses and banks preventing scams in real time to seniors educating themselves with the annual Fraud Book. We must continue to arm older adults with the information they need to protect themselves from scammers, and root out and prevent these scams before they happen,” said Chairman Casey.“Scams targeting our nation’s seniors — many of whom live on fixed incomes — are truly evil. Our bipartisan Fraud Book aims to stop these heinous crimes before they occur by providing meaningful resources to those working to protect themselves and their loved ones. I am thankful for Mrs. Fehler’s courage to share her story at today’s hearing and am confident that, by working together, we can help other seniors just like her and stop scammers in their tracks,” said Ranking Member Scott.Chairman Casey invited Aurelia Costigan, a scam survivor from Pittsburgh, PA. Aurelia was called by a scammer posing as a representative from her bank who convinced her to download Zelle and scammed her out of $1,800. She testified, “It takes me a long time to earn money like that. I’m on Social Security, I have to save my money. Because sometimes your car breaks down or a medical expense comes up…I thought I was never going to get that money back. But thankfully, maybe a month or so later, my bank was able to get my money back – the full $1,800…But I know not everyone has that experience. These scammers get away with this every single day. Elderly people like myself, we are always the trusting type of people. But now, I tell people: don’t give absolutely any information about yourself to anyone on the telephone. I tell my friends and family my story as a warning. I tell them to be careful. I hope that we can do something so that this doesn’t happen to someone else.”Ranking Member Scott invited Mrs. Polly Fehler, a retired Air Force officer and Registered Nurse, to speak about the computer scam which robbed her of $20,000. She testified, “After suffering through this scam, I was alone and depressed, even losing my spirit to live. For days I sat alone and hated myself for what happened; at times, not getting out of bed. I thought I lost all faith in God. I opted out of all community and church activities, committees, and leadership roles. I couldn’t function as the person I had been. I am here today because I’m a survivor. God is giving me the strength to reclaim my life! I hope we can prevent others from falling into this unmatched misery, saving others from falling into the darkness that comes with losing your self-worth and retirement savings in a click.”The 2022 Fraud Book can be found in English here and in Spanish here.Read more about the Stop Senior Scams Act here."

Currently, thousands of people with disabilities are being paid less than the minimum wage—most of those workers have intellectual or developmental disabilities—and some can be paid as little as a few cents an hour. The Subminimum Wage to Competitive Integrated Employment (SWTCIE) pilot program will provide five-year grant awards for states to help employers transition to paying competitive, fair wages to people with disabilities. Senator Casey led the fight to include funding for this pilot program in the FY21 federal spending bill. The Pennsylvania Office of Vocational Rehabilitation will receive $13 million to begin phasing out subminimum wage jobs for Pennsylvanians with disabilities.“Many people with disabilities are being paid below the minimum wage without the possibility of gaining new skills or moving to a job that pays a higher wage. This is incompatible with the promise of our Nation: to provide every American with the opportunity to earn fair wages and achieve financial independence,” said Senator Casey. “This funding will begin to phase out subminimum wage employment in 14 states while protecting the jobs of people with disabilities, but in order to truly end this discriminatory practice, Congress needs to pass my legislation to stop this problem at its root.”Senator Casey’s bipartisan Transformation to Competitive Integrated Employment Act (TCIEA) would prohibit the U.S. Secretary of Labor from issuing the certificates that allow employers to pay employees below the minimum wage and would phase out the use of subminimum wage practices for all employers over five years. It would provide grants to states or employers, supporting employers transitioning to a business model that pays at least minimum wage to workers with disabilities and continue to provide services to workers with disabilities, particularly to those who need more support in the workplace.According to the Department of Labor, an estimated 100,000 people in the United States are paid subminimum wage. A 2020 U.S. Commission on Civil Rights report found that between 2017 and 2018, the average wage of a person with a disability working under such certificates was only $3.34 per hour—less than half of the federal minimum wage.SWTCIE grants will be awarded to state vocational rehabilitation agencies for a transition to competitive employment and integrated workplaces:"

This funding will supplement the $67 million awarded to Pennsylvania for its Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds in fiscal year 2022. The funding will be used help communities access safe, clean water, repair aging pipes, collect and treat wastewater and build resiliency in the face of extreme weather events—which have become increasingly common as the climate crisis continues.“All communities deserve access to clean, safe water. This funding will expand access to clean drinking water, invest in projects that collect and treat wastewater to protect public health and improve water resources for all to enjoy. Investments like these are particularly important because they reach many families who have historically been marginalized. And, as we continue to face the worsening effects of the climate crisis, this investment will mean increased resiliency in the face of unpredictable weather patterns like floods and hurricanes,” said Senator Casey.The funding will go to PENNVEST and will advance the Biden Administration’s Justice40 initiative, which aims to deliver at least 40 percent of the benefits of certain federal programs to underserved communities, advancing environmental justice."

The site will be renovated to offer a co-working space, commercial tenant space and other services to support small businesses and stimulate entrepreneurship in the community. The funding will also help rehabilitate the interior of the building to host a “brewstillery” that will bring tourism to the area.Senator Casey announced $400,000 for the renovation in community project funding through Fiscal Year 2022 Appropriations bills. Senator Casey advocated for this funding and visited Oil City earlier this year.“This funding for the historic Oil City National Bank building is an investment in the people of Oil City and Venango County and the tourism industry of the region. I was proud to advocate for the Venango County Economic Development Authority to receive this $3.2 million grant, as well as $400,000 in community project funding earlier this year, to help the people of Oil City and Venango County build the future they’ve been working toward,” said Senator Casey.The historic Oil City National Bank is a formerly blighted building constructed in 1926 in the Northside Business District. The $3.2 million comes from the American Rescue Plan’s Travel, Tourism and Outdoor Recreation program, designed to accelerate the recovery of communities that rely on the travel, tourism and outdoor recreation sectors. The EDA grant will be matched with $796,785 in local funds and is expected to create more than 20 jobs."

September 15 marks Major League Baseball’s annual Roberto Clemente Day as well as the start of National Hispanic Heritage Month. Ahead of the 50th anniversary of Clemente’s 3,000th regular season hit on September 30, the congressional resolution formally recognizes Clemente’s immense legacy on and off the field and his work as a prominent Afro-Latino baseball player who had to overcome racial and linguistic discrimination.“Roberto Clemente left an indelible mark on the city of Pittsburgh, Major League Baseball and the countless people he inspired over the course of his tragically short life and career,” said Senator Casey. “Half a century after his greatest accomplishment on the baseball field, this resolution honors his legacy as a legendary Pittsburgh Pirate whose athletic skills were matched only by his commitment to humanitarian work and his tenacity in the face of discrimination.”“Roberto Clemente was a giant amongst Boricuas, athletes, and civil rights advocates. He forever transformed the game of baseball and relentlessly advocated for Latinos and people of color in his native Puerto Rico and everywhere else,” said Senator Menendez. “I’m proud to join my colleague Senator Casey in recognizing the 50th anniversary since Clemente’s 3000th hit, capturing his legacy and historic career on the baseball field for this and future generations.”“Roberto Clemente’s phenomenal baseball career was only upstaged by the noble and selfless life he lived off the field,” said Senator Toomey. “During the off-season, Clemente spent his time in his beloved Puerto Rico doing charity work, and he lost his life while flying to help people in Nicaragua after a deadly earthquake. To this day, Clemente remains an idol to Latin American ballplayers and fans everywhere. With this resolution, on Roberto Clemente Day, the U.S. Senate recognizes Clemente’s incredible life and legacy.”“Roberto Clemente is one of our sport’s greatest humanitarians. His Hall of Fame career on the field combined with his generosity away from it has left an indelible legacy in our game. As we celebrate Roberto Clemente Day today, his philanthropic impact continues to inspire our players who are giving back to their communities in extraordinary ways,” said Baseball Commissioner Robert D. Manfred, Jr. “Roberto Clemente’s passion for baseball and humanity burn brightly almost half a century after his tragic passing,” said Josh Rawitch, President of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. “In 1973, Clemente became the first Latino American player elected to the Hall of Fame. Since then, 17 Latino stars have followed in his footsteps to Cooperstown – with many more set to join him in bronze immortality in the years to come. His legacy continues to inspire millions of players and fans alike throughout the Caribbean and around the world, and we are proud to celebrate his work on and off the field every day at the Hall of Fame.”The resolution honors Clemente both as an athlete and as a humanitarian, recognizing his ongoing, widespread impact and legacy. He was a 15-time MLB All Star, a 12-time Gold Glove winner, a four-time NL batting champion and two-time World Series Champion. Off the field, Clemente spent his off seasons travelling to Latin America to donate food, clothing and baseball equipment to families and children in need. He was also enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserves, where he earned the rank Private First Class. After his untimely death, he became the first Latino Hall of Famer in league history.Read the resolution here."
https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-pushes-for-information-from-state-nursing-home-inspectors-amidst-staffing-shortages-widespread-inspection-delays,"Some state survey agencies have reported vacancy rates of up to 50 percent among inspection staff, affecting agencies’ ability to carry out oversight work to protect the health and safety of nursing home residentsWashington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) is pushing for information on how staffing shortages at state survey agencies are affecting their ability to ensure the health and safety of residents at long-term care facilities. Senator Casey is sending a letter to survey agencies in all 50 states as well as Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico after reports from federal watchdogs repeatedly link staffing shortages at survey agencies with failures to conduct timely, high-quality nursing home surveys. The Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) issued a report in January identifying “staffing shortages as a root cause of State survey performance problems.” As of mid-August, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data show that nearly 30 percent of the national total of nursing homes are overdue for these standard surveys.“State survey agencies are integral to ensuring the health and safety of Americans reliant on our Nation’s health care providers, ranging from hospitals to nursing homes to intermediate care facilities and more. These agencies play a particularly important role in oversight of the country’s more than 15,000 nursing homes, enforcing federal standards related to medical care, adequate staffing and safeguarding residents from abuse and neglect, among others. By conducting comprehensive inspections, known as standard surveys, every 15 months and promptly investigating complaints, state surveyors are the eyes and ears ensuring quality care is delivered,” wrote Senator Casey.Current and former state survey agency officials have reported challenges hiring and retaining surveyors, which affects the frequency and quality of nursing home surveys, as local governments experience broader challenges attracting and retaining workers. In order to fulfill the annual requirements, states have used stopgap measures including hiring contract inspectors at high costs, encouraging overtime for surveyors and sending surveyors outside their regular regions. As such, Senator Casey is seeking details from states on how the availability and experience of surveyors affect their ability to carry out oversight responsibilities, data regarding turnover among agency staff as well as information on how rising salaries in the nursing profession affect hiring and retention.Senator Casey secured a one-time $100 million funding boost for nursing home oversight in the CARES Act of March 2020, the first increase for nursing home oversight since fiscal year 2014. In August 2021, he introduced the Nursing Home Improvement and Accountability Act, which would address gaps in staffing, transparency, accountability and oversight of long-term care facilities. The legislation would further increase funding for nursing home surveys to improve oversight processes and hire, train, and retain surveyors, a provision the Biden Administration adopted in its fiscal year 2023 budget request.Read the letters to state survey agencies here and below.September 12, 2022Dear Director,State survey agencies are integral to ensuring the health and safety of Americans reliant on our Nation’s health care providers, ranging from hospitals to nursing homes to intermediate care facilities and more. These agencies play a particularly important role in oversight of the country’s more than 15,000 nursing homes, enforcing federal standards related to medical care, adequate staffing and safeguarding residents from abuse and neglect, among others. By conducting comprehensive inspections, known as standard surveys, every 15 months and promptly investigating complaints, state surveyors are the eyes and ears ensuring quality care is delivered. Given their critical role, I am requesting information related to your agency’s staffing needs as the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging (Aging Committee) seeks to better understand the scope and severity of staffing shortages affecting state survey agencies’ ability to carry out their work.The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) have repeatedly linked survey agency staffing shortages with failures to conduct timely, high quality nursing home surveys.  Most recently, a January OIG report identified “staffing shortages as a root cause of State survey performance problems,” adding that “many of the staffing shortages occur in States with widespread nurse shortages and that these States have difficulty attracting and retaining nurses to conduct surveys.” Similarly, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found in a report this year that “states have difficulty finding qualified surveyors,” and survey agencies “may not have adequate capacity or resources to fulfill all their responsibilities.” In addition, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recently informed my office that “many states have reported shortages that impact their ability to respond timely to complaints and recertification surveys,” an issue exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.Current and former state survey agency officials across our Nation report challenges with hiring and retaining surveyors, particularly nurses who make up the majority of their workforce, leading to high turnover. These challenges come as recent news reports have highlighted the broader challenges state and local governments have experienced attracting and retaining workers. Survey agency officials repeatedly voiced concerns regarding state and federal budget shortfalls and difficulty offering competitive wages in a highly competitive health care market. Over the last decade nursing salaries have increased 21 percent and survey agencies have been unable to keep up. These concerns are consistent with those states have communicated to the OIG in recent years and, based on briefings with states, appear to have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Drained by physically and emotionally demanding work, agency officials have said that the pandemic led many surveyors to find new health care jobs, leave the field or retire, further worsening vacancy rates.In the face of staffing shortages now ranging up to 50 percent of budgeted positions, states are employing different measures to meet Federal requirements for survey timeliness. Stopgap measures include hiring contract inspectors, often at high cost; encouraging surveyors to work overtime; hiring retired annuitants to cover staffing gaps and sending surveyors outside their regular regions to cover shortfalls, requiring additional travel. State officials and outside observers have expressed concern that a strained workforce is not well-suited to carry out the critical work survey agencies perform, leaving nursing home residents at greater risk. Recognizing these and other challenges, I secured $100 million of additional funding for survey and certification activities to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in nursing homes. I also have advocated to increase funding for survey agencies going forward, which President Biden adopted in his FY2023 budget request.At the same time, workloads have increased substantially, with the number of inspections in response to reported complaints increasing from 47,000 in 2011 to 71,000 in 2018, a trend that has continued during the pandemic. The OIG issued a report last year that found 71 percent of nursing homes nationally had gone at least 16 months without a standard survey as of May 31, 2021, with backlogs of nursing homes surveyed ranging from 22 percent to 96 percent by state. As of mid-August, CMS data show that 4,500 nursing homes (29.8 percent of the national total) are overdue for annual standard surveys.Given these issues, the Aging Committee seeks information from survey agencies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and I ask that you please answer the questions and other requests that follow. Please note that references to “previous five calendar years” mean full-year 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and year-to-date 2022; “previous five fiscal years” means your state’s fiscal years for FY2018, FY2019, FY2020, FY2021 and FY2022.Please provide the above requested information, documents and data no later than October 28, 2022. "

The project will also relocate and construct a new modernized gate complex and relocate an existing maintenance facility. The funding comes from an INFRA grant from the Department of Transportation. “The Port of Philadelphia is a critical link in our Nation’s supply chains,” said Senator Casey. “By increasing capacity at the Port, we’re allowing more commerce to flow through Philadelphia, getting goods to families more efficiently and supporting local jobs. This is another example of how the Biden Administration is delivering on its promise to invest in our infrastructure and strengthen our economy.”In June 2021, the Port of Philadelphia received a $49,000,000 INFRA grant to develop a new multi-use berth at the Southport Terminal, which will allow larger ships to dock at the port. Both INFRA grants will allow the Port of Philadelphia to increase its capacity, supporting the entire region’s economy."
https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-colleagues-push-for-better-consumer-protections-for-users-of-peer-to-peer-payment-apps,"Senators note concerning trend of seniors losing money using applications like Zelle, Cash App, Venmo and PayPal and lack of consumer protections for peer-to-peer scam victimsWashington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) is leading a letter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), pushing the agency to better protect users of peer-to-peer payment applications (P2P apps) from scams. As P2P apps like Venmo, Cash App, PayPal or Zelle have become more popular, scammers are increasingly targeting older adults on P2P platforms. Currently, banks are only required to compensate consumers who lost money to a scam for payments they didn’t authorize, making it difficult for many seniors who authorized a payment to a scammer posing as their bank.U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) joined Senator Casey in sending the letter.As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Aging, Senator Casey held a hearing in September 2021 about scams that particularly affect older adults. Witnesses testified that there are aren’t enough common-sense consumer protections available to older adults using P2P apps and that scams involving these platforms disproportionately affect communities of color.“Particularly for older adults with lower incomes, losing even a few hundred dollars can be devastating. Given the increased prevalence of P2P fraud against older adults, we encourage the CFPB to move forward in issuing this guidance to provide better tools to protect themselves and their families,” wrote the Senators.  According to the FTC, P2P apps are popular with scammers because of the ease with which consumers can make payments to individuals they have never met on P2P platforms, facilitating quick purchasing decisions. The FTC has also found that older adults are increasingly using payment apps or services and, in 2020 alone, older adults reported $10 million in losses associated with complaints related to “payment apps and services.”Read the letter to CFPB here and below.September 1, 2022The Honorable Rohit ChopraDirector Consumer Financial Protection Bureau1700 G Street NWWashington, DC 20552Dear Director Chopra:The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is considering guidance to better protect users of peer-to-peer payment applications (P2P apps) such as Venmo, Cash App, PayPal and Zelle. Last year, the Senate Special Committee on Aging convened a hearing in which it received testimony about the rise of P2P apps being used as vehicles for fraud against older adults. Witnesses testified that there are too few common-sense consumer protections available to older adults using P2P apps and that scams involving these platforms appear to disproportionately affect communities of color. Particularly for older adults with lower incomes, losing even a few hundred dollars can be devastating. Given the increased prevalence of P2P fraud against older adults, we encourage the CFPB to move forward in issuing this guidance to provide better tools to protect themselves and their families.According to Federal Trade Commission (FTC) testimony, older adults are increasingly using payment apps or services. The number of P2P-related complaints the FTC received tripled from 2019 to 2020, according to testimony to the Aging Committee. The FTC further testified that older adults reported $10 million in losses associated with complaints related to “payment apps and services” in 2020 alone. The upward trend continued in 2021, with the FTC receiving 41,900 consumer complaints regarding payment apps and services through the first nine months of the year, 12 percent of which were reported by adults ages 60 and older. The median amount reported lost during that time also grew from $240 in 2019 to $395 in 2021. Noting that the top five categories of loss were online shopping, business imposters, romance scams, miscellaneous investments and fake check scams, the FTC summarized why P2P apps are gaining favor with scammers:…the ease with which consumers may make payments to individuals they have never met on P2P platforms facilitates quick purchasing decisions. Scammers are very good at what they do and seek out payment methods where they can gain access to funds quickly, and remain as anonymous as possible, making it difficult to track them down.The FTC’s testimony further noted the potentially disparate racial impact of scams involving P2P apps, stating that “people living in majority Black communities filed more reports indicating the payment method was a payment service or app than people living in Latino or white communities.”An attorney with the National Consumer Law Center (NCLC) singled out the increasing prevalence of P2P apps in fraud schemes against older adults, stating “more protections are needed to give consumers a fighting chance to recover money transferred to scammers,” and that “the warnings provided by the payment apps are simply not enough to protect consumers.” The NCLC attorney noted that when improper payment does occur, current practices to recover funds include P2P apps simply asking “the financial institutions or scammers that received the funds to voluntarily return them.” Citing a recent AARP survey, she further stated that most consumers “incorrectly assumed that their payments would be protected if there was an error or fraud associated with the transaction.”The testimony to the Aging Committee makes clear that more can and should be done to protect older adults and other consumers from scams involving P2P apps. The Journal’s reporting suggests that the CFPB is currently considering guidance to broaden the definition of unauthorized transactions, shifting some of the burden of these losses away from consumers to banks and P2P apps, the latter of which can hold consumers’ payments in uninsured accounts. We are encouraged that CFPB’s reported considerations appear to be in line with the data, concerns and recommendations raised during the Aging Committee’s frauds and scams hearing. The NCLC’s testimony recommended that P2P apps conduct more extensive investigations when fraud occurs, prioritize fraud prevention and remediation and make customer service timelier and more accessible. These recommendations are particularly relevant in light of reports that your agency, the FTC and multiple state Attorneys General are investigating issues facing P2P app users such as debt collection practices and the way consumer complaints are handled. Taken together, these steps would better protect older adults who are increasingly targeted by scammers using P2P apps. We encourage you to move forward with the guidance under consideration, keeping in mind the disproportionate effect that frauds and scams have on communities of color and people with Limited English Proficiency.Thank you for your ongoing attention to better protecting older adults and other consumers affected by frauds and scams."

The funding will be used to strengthen and expand the Collaborative’s trailblazing work in Southwestern PA promoting economic development through the region’s robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) sectors. The EDA grant will fund projects that will help small, medium and family-owned businesses adopt new technologies, train workers for family-sustaining careers and support entrepreneurs who will contribute to the growing field. The projects are estimated to create or retain 12,000 jobs in Southwestern PA and generate $335 million in direct regional GDP.“The Southwestern Pennsylvania New Economy Collaborative is an embodiment of the spirit of the entire Pittsburgh region,” said Senator Bob Casey. “When Southwestern Pennsylvania was knocked down, they didn’t wait for someone else to pick them back up. They reinvented themselves to become leaders in technology and winning the Build Back Better Regional Challenge will allow workers and small and family-owned businesses to take advantage of the region’s robotics and AI industries to modernize their own businesses and keep them growing in a 21st century economy. By working together to invest in the region, the Collaborative’s efforts are going to support thousands of jobs and generate hundreds of millions of dollars of new economic prosperity across Southwestern Pennsylvania.” The Southwestern Pennsylvania New Economy Collaborative is a coalition of regional governments, workforce agencies, labor unions, educational and research institutions, economic development and community organizations and businesses—all dedicated to growing economic opportunity across all 11 counties in the Southwestern Pennsylvania New Economy Coalition. As a region of coal- and power-impacted communities, Southwestern PA has suffered economically from the shift away from coal production. This transition, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, has created a significant need for workforce development to give workers the skills needed to succeed in other industries. Southwestern Pennsylvania New Economy Collaborative is dedicated to ensuring 55% of the Collaborative’s benefits—including jobs created and GDP—go towards the 10 counties outside of Allegheny County, fueling rural economic growth and building career pathways for traditionally under-represented communities.The Southwestern Pennsylvania New Economy Collaborative’s newly-funded projects will:In October 2021, Senator Casey advocated for the Southwestern Pennsylvania New Economy Collaborative to receive this historic funding. He announced the Collaborative’s award of $500,000 for their placement as a finalist in the Build Back Better Regional Challenge in December 2021. The Build Back Better Regional Challenge is a competitive federal grant program that invests in regional coalitions to drive inclusive economic growth and support community-led economic development and job creation."
https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-doyle-announce-113-million-for-hill-district-infrastructure,"RAISE Grant Will Fund ‘New Pathways to Equity’ Project to Improve Centre AvenueWashington, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) and U.S. Representative Mike Doyle (D-PA) announced that the City of Pittsburgh received $11,320,000 in funding for the “New Pathways to Equity” project to invest in human-focused infrastructure in the Hill District. The funding comes from a Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability & Equity (RAISE) Grant, funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.With this funding, the city will make construction improvements to the public right-of-way in the Hill District, particularly on Centre Avenue. Improvements will include the reconstruction of intersections, street corridors and city steps as well as the installation of traffic calming measures, sidewalks and green infrastructure. The “New Pathways to Equity” project is crucial to the revitalization of the neighborhood.“The Hill District is a vibrant community that for too long has been disconnected from the rest of the City of Pittsburgh,” said Senator Casey. “This grant, made possible by the infrastructure law, will make Centre Avenue safer and more accessible to drivers, public transit users, pedestrians and all residents of Pittsburgh. This project will bring more businesses, customers and workers to the Hill District, boosting the neighborhood’s economic strength.”“This grant is the culmination of years of hard work to invest in the revitalization of the Hill District,” Congressman Doyle said. “This project will provide safer streets, better transit, and improved accessibility in the Hill District. Along with the federal funding we secured to reconnect downtown and the Hill District with the I-579 Cap Project, this grant will ensure that we are investing in the middle and upper Hill District equitably. I worked persistently with Mayor Gainey and County Executive Fitzgerald to secure this funding – including arranging a meeting with the Mayor and Secretary Buttigieg earlier this year to stress the importance of this project – and I believe that the combination of unified advocacy and project merit won this grant for Pittsburgh. This project also bolsters the City’s Avenues of Hope project to work with local and minority business owners to invest in historically marginalized corridors throughout the City, a project for which I secured $2 million in Congressionally Directed Spending in Fiscal Year 2022.”“We were glad to support this important project that will improve the quality of life for residents in the Hill District,” said County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. “Through continued investment in the neighborhood, we are improving infrastructure, mobility and access for those who live there, but also for those who come to eat, shop and visit.” “This grant is not just an investment into essential infrastructure, it is also an investment in correcting long standing harms that have isolated the Hill from Downtown,"" said Mayor Ed Gainey. ""Designing solutions and getting them funded required a true community partnership, and this is an example of the kind of ambitious reinvestment in our city that can happen when we all work towards a common purpose and shared goal.”“This award will have a multi-generational impact in the Hill District neighborhood,” said Marimba Milliones, President & CEO, Hill Community Development Corporation. “Our infrastructure is in serious need of upgrading and this grant will support critical improvements to key corridors.  We thank Senator Bob Casey, Congressman Doyle and Mayor Gainey for working to deliver these funds for the benefit of the Hill District’s residents and businesses.  We are also hopeful that these funds can be leveraged to secure additional state and local resources.” "
https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-applauds-senate-passage-of-inflation-reduction-act-historic-bill-to-lower-costs-for-families-and-tackle-climate-crisis,"Legislation will lower prescription drug and health care costs and create clean energy jobs, while reducing the deficitBill includes Casey provision to ensure health and disability benefits for coal miners as well as Casey provisions to manufacture in America, especially in energy communitiesCasey: “As families across Pennsylvania and the Nation are being squeezed by inflation, Democrats are tackling this problem head on.”Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) is announcing that Senate Democrats passed the historic Inflation Reduction Act to lower health care and prescription drug costs for families and older adults, ensure American manufacturing is at the forefront of clean energy industry, reduce energy costs while tackling the climate crisis, and slash the deficit by making big corporations pay their fair share. Senator Casey fought for the inclusion of provisions to lower prescription drug costs for low-income seniors and people with disabilities, to give a bonus to new clean energy investments made with American materials and to those situated in former coal communities; as well as his provisions to keep the Black Lung Trust Fund solvent so that coal miners and their families across Pennsylvania can continue to access the life-sustaining health and disability benefits they deserve.Senator Casey released the following statement on the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act:“As families across Pennsylvania and the Nation are being squeezed by inflation, Democrats are tackling this problem head on. The Inflation Reduction Act will lower health care and energy costs for families while creating well-paying jobs to transition the U.S. to clean energy and tackle the climate crisis. It’s a fiscally responsible bill that will bring down our national debt by ensuring profitable corporations start paying their fair share, just as American families have been doing all along.“It costs a lot of money to be sick in America. Many people are just one medical emergency away from bankruptcy, while other families and seniors are slowly draining their savings to pay for lifesaving prescription drugs. In the American Rescue Plan, Democrats made Marketplace health care plans more affordable; this legislation extends those subsidies for another three years. For the first time, Medicare will be able to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices and annual out-of-pocket costs will be capped at $2,000. I’m proud to say this legislation also includes a provision I fought for to ensure low-income seniors and people with disabilities are able to afford their medications. These are commonsense solutions that build on the promise of the Affordable Care Act and ensure families don’t have to choose between their health and their bank accounts.“We’re currently living in a moment when once-in-a-lifetime storms are happening every couple of months. Severe weather conditions are now the norm. While hurricane remnants are flooding the Vine Street Expressway in Philadelphia, out west states are on fire and lakes are disappearing in the worst drought in a millennium. It’s well past time we take bold action to address the climate crisis. This legislation is the most ambitious climate bill the Senate has ever passed. It will lower costs for Americans at the gas pump and on their electricity bills. It will shore up the U.S.’s place as a clean energy producer and reduce our greenhouse emissions by 40% by 2030, while investing in the coal communities that powered our nation for generations. Better yet, we’re going to create 9 million well-paying jobs in the next decade to get this done. I successfully fought to include a provision that will promote the creation of family-supporting clean manufacturing jobs here in the U.S. rather than in competitors like China, because we don’t have to choose between green energy and our workers. “Over the past year, President Biden and the Democratic Congress have made transformational investments in the U.S. economy and American workers. Between the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and now the Inflation Reduction Act, Democrats have passed legislation that will boost the economy and create jobs in our infrastructure, supply chain, domestic manufacturing and clean energy sectors. President Biden’s agenda is delivering for Pennsylvania.”The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) includes provisions that will lower health care and prescriptions drug costs, invest in clean energy and reduce carbon emissions and the national deficit, while creating and sustaining millions of jobs for Americans.For the first time, Medicare will be able to negotiate directly for the price of prescription drugs to make high-priced and high-use prescription drugs more affordable for the more than 63 million people with Medicare. The Inflation Reduction Act will also cap Medicare Part D patients’ out-of-pocket costs at $2,000 per year, with the option to break that amount into affordable monthly payments. It also institutes a new provision to impose penalties on drug companies who hike up prices in Medicare above the rate of inflation.The IRA also includes several policies that will improve access to and affordability of medications for seniors and people with disabilities. In addition to capping annual out-of-pocket costs, the IRA creates a $35 a month cap for insulin products under Part D, and expands cost-sharing assistance for low-income people with Medicare, a provision Senator Casey championed through his Lowering Medicare Premiums and Prescription Drug Costs Act. The IRA will also make eligible vaccines free for seniors with Medicare Part D.The American Rescue Plan, passed by Democrats in 2021, expanded subsidies to provide more Americans with affordable health care through the Affordable Care Act. Because of these enhanced premium tax credits, the average family of four with a household income of $75,000 is saving around $248 per month. The IRA extends the enhanced subsidies until 2025, protecting affordable health care for millions of Americans. It also extends the American Rescue Plan provision that allows many low-income families to receive a subsidy to cover the full value of their premiums and prevents families from falling off a financial cliff as their income rises. Combined, these policies have dropped the uninsured rate to a historical low over the last two years, and their extension will prevent an estimated 3.4 million Americans from losing their health coverage.The IRA is the single biggest climate investment in U.S. history. This ambitious piece of legislation will put the U.S. on a path to reduce emissions by 40 percent by 2030 while lowering American families’ energy costs at the gas pump and on their electricity bills. In doing so, this bill will create thousands of good-paying union jobs and revitalize the U.S. manufacturing base. Senator Casey passed a provision to incentivize clean energy deployment and manufacturing in “energy communities,” areas whose economies and jobs are or were dependent on the coal, oil or natural gas energy sectors. Senator Casey’s tax credit will not only provide a bridge for energy workers and communities as we transition to a clean energy economy, but it prioritizes the workforce that is more than capable of being at the forefront of our Nation’s clean energy economy. This bill invests in American-made energy and manufacturing. The IRA includes Senator Casey’s amendments that will require some clean energy projects to meet strict domestic content standards to receive tax credits. Further, all clean energy projects will receive a 10% bonus tax credit for meeting domestic content standards. Senator Casey’s provisions ensure that the U.S. is developing and manufacturing clean energy here at home. The IRA also includes tax credits to accelerate U.S. manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and critical minerals processing as well as a $7,500 credit for purchasing a new electric or hydrogen vehicle that was made in North America. These investments must be made with high wage and labor standards as well as domestic content and apprenticeship training requirements, ensuring that American workers and their families benefit from these provisions. The bill will grow a skilled workforce that provides good-paying union jobs as the clean energy industry grows. The IRA provides $9 billion in consumer home energy rebate programs, to electrify home appliances and for energy efficient retrofits, as well as 10 or more years of consumer tax credits to make homes energy efficient and make heat pumps, rooftop solar and electric HVAC more affordable.A permanent extension of Senator Casey’s Black Lung Benefits Disability Trust Fund Solvency Act is included in the IRA that would ensure that the trust fund stays permanently solvent so coal miners suffering from black lung disease and their families have reliable access to the quality medical care they need. By restoring the Black Lung excise tax, the Black Lung Trust Fund can continue to pay out benefits to former miners and their families. Without revenue from this tax, the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund faces insolvency at a time when the nationwide prevalence of black lung is increasing.The IRA invests more than $20 billion to support climate-smart agricultural practices and $5 billion for forest resilience and conservation efforts. Pennsylvania farmers and foresters will be able to benefit from the significant infusion of funds for a slew of U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Department of the Interior (DOI) conservation programs, which Senator Casey has championed.The Inflation Reduction Act raises $739 billion without raising any taxes on people making less than $400,000 per year. Just over a third of this revenue comes from savings on government spending on prescription drugs, while the rest will come from ensuring wealthy tax cheats and the biggest corporations pay their fair share of taxes. The IRA is estimated to create more than 9 million good jobs over the next decade—an average of nearly 1 million jobs each year. "
https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-portman-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-invest-in-childrens-mental-health,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Chair of the Senate HELP Subcommittee on Children and Families, and Rob Portman (R-OH) introduced bipartisan legislation – Investing in Kids’ Mental Health Now Act (S.4747) – to address growing concerns surrounding children’s mental health in the United States. To help address the severe toll that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on children’s mental health, the bill provides pediatric mental health care providers with additional resources – a one-year Medicaid funding increase through an enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentages (FMAP). Pediatric mental, emotional, and behavioral health care providers serving Medicaid patients in participating states will have access to this funding. “For many young people navigating mental health or substance use disorders, the pandemic exacerbated the everyday challenges they face. We owe it to our children to ensure they’re getting the mental health care they need as they navigate childhood and adolescence. This bill will break down barriers to mental health for children around the country,” said Senator Casey. “We have a duty to ensure that our nation’s children have the necessary resources to address any mental, emotional, or behavior issues they may experience,” said Senator Portman. “I am pleased to introduce this bipartisan legislation with Senator Casey, to address this gap in pediatric mental health funding, and hope my colleagues in the Senate will join us in this effort.” “It is hard to overstate the magnitude of the pediatric mental health crisis or the importance of Senator Casey’s leadership in finding real solutions.  The Investing in Kids’ Mental Health Now Act will provide crucial support to providers across the pediatric behavioral health workforce and help our children access the full continuum of care that they need to thrive.  On behalf of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, thank you to Senators Casey and Portman for introducing this essential piece of bipartisan legislation,” said Tami D. Benton, MD, Psychiatrist-in-Chief, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “Senators Portman and Casey’s leadership on the bipartisan bill provides a significant step toward the critical investments needed for pediatric mental health and for the specially trained caregivers who support their health and well-being,” said Amy Wimpey Knight, president of Children’s Hospital Association. “The magnitude of the youth mental health crisis requires renewed attention, and we must make purposeful investments in resources to provide life-changing and life-saving care to children and their families. We urge Congress to follow the senators’ leadership and take meaningful action for our children and youth.” In addition, within one year of enactment, the legislation directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to: Text of the bill can be found here.

After holding up this bill because they were mad about unrelated legislation, Senate Republicans finally came to their senses and stopped blocking legislation to take care of veterans who were exposed to burn pits or Agent Orange during their military service. This legislation is an historic win for veterans and our country, and it will save lives. We will never be able to fully repay our servicemembers and their families for their sacrifice, but we can, and we must, take care of them now,” said Senator Casey.The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT (Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics) Act would greatly expand access to health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to all veterans exposed to toxic substances during their time in the military. The Senate passed the original bill on June 16 by a vote of 84 – 14. After a procedural objection required another Senate vote, more than half of Senate Republicans switched their votes from ‘yes’ to ‘no’ and blocked the bill from passing, following the announcement of an unrelated legislative deal. Senator Casey held a virtual press conference on August 1 with Pennsylvania veterans calling for immediate passage of the Honoring our PACT Act. The Senate passed the bill on August 2 by a vote of 86-11.Senator Casey is a cosponsor of the VA WISE Act, which has three sections included in the PACT Act. These provisions will improve recruitment and retention of health care and human resources professionals at rural VA facilities, enabling quality care for those toxic-exposed veterans newly eligible under the PACT Act. Senator Casey previously cosponsored the Open Burn Pit Registry Act of 2011 (S.1798), the Burn Pits Accountability Act of 2019 (S. 191) and the Health Care for Burn Pit Veterans Act (S. 3451). In 2019, Senator Casey cosponsored the Blue Water Navy Veterans Act (S. 1195) to ensure that veterans exposed to Agent Orange while stationed on ships during the Vietnam War would receive presumptive coverage for related health effects. The Burn Pits Accountability Act was included in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to examine the health effects of servicemembers’ and veterans’ exposure to open burn pits and other toxic airborne chemicals, integrating evaluations into routine health exams. The Honoring Our PACT Act is a culmination of these previous efforts."

Senator Casey is calling for the Department of Labor to factor in these technologies as the Administration works to improve workplace safety and rights, including studying the impact on workers’ physical and mental health.“The implementation of novel technologies to track, monitor, manage and discipline workers is growing due to an imbalance of power in the workplace and a lack of legal protections or regulatory restrictions on these behaviors,” wrote Senator Casey. “Without oversight, more and more intrusive technologies will be implemented in the workplace. It is incumbent on the Department of Labor to stay at the forefront of these issues on behalf of workers and to monitor and regulate workplace privacy and technology issues before they become the norm.”In the letter, Senator Casey outlines disturbing examples of how workers are being penalized by surveillance and productivity technologies. Workers who use the bathroom or pump breast milk are seeing lower productivity scores due to the constant monitoring during those short breaks. Employers are also using these technologies to violate, monitor or preempt workers’ right to organize. Additionally, Amazon workers are being fired by bots and are left with few options to dispute the decision or speak to a human manager to understand how the decision was reached. Senator Casey called on the Department of Labor to be on forefront of creating responsible policies to protect workers from these emerging technologies.Full text of the letter is below and the PDF can be found HERE.August 26, 2022The Honorable Marty WalshSecretary of LaborU.S. Department of Labor200 Constitution Avenue, NWWashington, DC 20210Dear Secretary Walsh:I write to urge the Department of Labor to consider the largely unchecked spread of invasive and exploitative workplace surveillance and technologies across the United States. The implementation of novel technologies to track, monitor, manage and discipline workers is growing due to an imbalance of power in the workplace and a lack of legal protections or regulatory restrictions on these behaviors. Without oversight, more and more intrusive technologies will be implemented in the workplace. It is incumbent on the Department of Labor to stay at the forefront of these issues on behalf of workers and to monitor and regulate workplace privacy and technology issues before they become the norm.Presently, there is little oversight, accountability or transparency over how emerging workplace technologies and monitoring are impacting workers across the labor market. Decisions are being made solely by employers without consultation or input from workers. Workers deserve a seat at the table when policies and decisions are being made that impact their workplaces and privacy in such a significant way. Employers are not required to disclose how and what data is being collected on employees. In fact, a growing share of this is being handled by third-party vendors with little disclosure as to how and where these companies are handling worker data and ensuring it is securely stored.Further, the increased reliance on algorithms and automated systems have left many workers with limited insight into how these systems are being used to make employment and wage decisions, including on workers’ performance and productivity.[1] The constant monitoring even occurs when workers take short breaks, such as to use the bathroom or pump breast milk[2], which counts as idle time that lowers their productivity scores and puts them at risk of being disciplined. Alarmingly, employers are using these technologies to violate, monitor or preempt their workers’ right to organize.Some workers are now even managed primarily or entirely by algorithms and automated systems which can make employment decisions with little or no meaningful human oversight. There are reports of Amazon workers being senselessly fired via email by bots.[3] Likewise, many so called “gig economy” workers are primarily managed by algorithms, which determine the pay, ratings and tasks they are offered. Workers disciplined or terminated by these systems are often left with few options to dispute these decisions or engage with a human manager to understand how these decisions were made. Warehouse and e-commerce workers, in particular, are being subjected to novel and high-risk technologies without impact assessments on their potential effects on wages, job quality and physical and mental health. Novel and high-risk technologies, including but not limited to facial and emotional recognition, biometric monitoring, wearables, productivity management systems and algorithm-driven employee performance systems, should be studied so that we can better understand how these could cause injury or affect workers’ mental health. While the role of technology to make workplaces safer is important, we need a holistic approach to consider their effects.Emerging workplace technologies, privacy and surveillance should be treated as a new facet of protecting worker safety and rights. Given the unprecedented nature of these technologies and the historic imbalance in power between workers and their employers, I am especially concerned about the potential impacts on our most vulnerable workers and how this could worsen inequality and discrimination in the labor market and across the economy.On August 11th, the Federal Trade Commission announced its intent to “crack down on harmful commercial surveillance” with potential rulemaking on commercial surveillance and lax data security practices for consumers.[4] I encourage the Department of Labor to undergo a similar, interagency process for the unique issues and challenges that workers face in the workplace on these issues. I would also be interested to hear from you what authorities or resources the Department might need to be able to tackle these issues.I commend the Biden-Harris Administration for being a champion for working men and women and their rights in the workplace. Under your leadership, the Department of Labor has been fulfilling its promise to foster and promote the welfare of workers across the country. I believe that these issues align with the Biden-Administration's agenda to lift up the rights and dignity of workers and create forward-looking labor policy to anticipate evolving workplace needs.Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to working with the Department of Labor to craft responsible, forward-looking labor policy that means all workers, everywhere, have a reasonable right to privacy and protections in the workplace.[1] https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/14/business/worker-productivity-tracking.html[2] https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/amazon-didnt-give-workers-breaks-pump-breast-milk-lawsuit-2022-08-01/[3] https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-06-28/fired-by-bot-amazon-turns-to-machine-managers-and-workers-are-losing-out[4] https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/08/ftc-explores-rules-cracking-down-commercial-surveillance-lax-data-security-practices"
https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-cancelling-student-debt-will-ease-the-burden-for-millions-of-americans,"Biden Administration is announcing cancellation of $10,000 of student debt for low- to middle-income borrowers; up to $20,000 for students who received Pell GrantsWashington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement on President Biden’s announcement to cancel $10,000 of student debt for people making less than $125,000 a year. Borrowers who received Pell Grants are eligible for up to an additional $10,000 of forgiveness. President Biden also announced that the pause on federal student loan repayments will be extended for one final time through December 31, 2022. Additionally, President Biden is taking steps to make the student loan system more manageable for current and future borrowers by cutting monthly payments in half for undergraduate loans and holding schools accountable when they hike up prices.“Today, President Biden eased the burden for millions of Americans who are struggling under the weight of their student debt. This will give them the freedom to invest in their future, buy a home, or take a risk and start a business.  It’s an important first step forward in helping borrowers saddled with student debt. Moving forward, we must work to lower the skyrocketing costs of college so that future students are able to get an education without signing up for a lifetime of debt.” Since 1980, the total cost of both four-year public and four-year private college has nearly tripled, even after accounting for inflation. Federal support has not kept up: Pell Grants once covered nearly 80 percent of the cost of a four-year public college degree for students from working families, but now only cover a third.President Biden has also previously announced student debt forgiveness or cancellation for 1.3 million students who were cheated or defrauded by shady for-profit colleges. He has worked to improve the troubled Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program by offering a waiver for some students who were mistakenly in the wrong payment plan to receive credit for past payments. Senator Casey has urged for the extension of this waiver until July 2023. So far, more than 175,000 people in the PSLF program have had their loans forgiven by the Biden Administration. Senator Casey also worked with Governor Wolf to provide relief for Pennsylvanians in the PSLF program by no longer requiring them to pay income tax on their loan forgiveness.More information about President Biden’s loan forgiveness announcement can be found here."
https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-colleagues-push-to-reclassify-marc-fogels-case-as-wrongfully-detained,"Marc Fogel, a U.S. citizen, was given a disproportionate 14-year sentence in Russia despite low-level offenseSenators call out harsh sentencing of Mr. Fogel as political ploy by Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian regimeWashington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) is leading a bipartisan coalition of Senators to push for the reclassification of Marc Fogel’s case as “wrongfully detained” under the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act. Mr. Fogel, a U.S. citizen and resident of Oakmont, Pennsylvania, is currently imprisoned in Russia and was recently sentenced to 14 years at a maximum-security penal colony for possession of less than an ounce of medical marijuana. The Senators are sending a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, urging the U.S. State Department to reclassify Mr. Fogel’s case so he can receive the level of support awarded to political prisoners and eventually secure his freedom.Senator Casey was joined by U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Jon Tester (D-MT), Steve Daines (R-MT), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) and Tim Kaine (D-VA) in sending the letter to Secretary Blinken.“Mr. Fogel’s recent 14-year sentence to a maximum-security penal colony for possession of less than an ounce of medical marijuana can only be understood as a political ploy by Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian regime. Mr. Fogel, a 61-year-old with severe medical conditions, has already been detained for a year. The United States cannot stand by as Mr. Fogel wastes away in a Russian hard labor camp,” wrote the Senators.The Senators also wrote, “We strongly urge the State Department to shift its strategy given the realities of Marc Fogel’s situation and act immediately to designate him as ‘wrongfully detained.’ Such a designation will provide the warranted level of support to Marc Fogel's family after a year of communication with Mr. Fogel only via mail and, most importantly, will require the U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs to secure Mr. Fogel's freedom.  We cannot allow Mr. Fogel to be used as a political pawn by Vladimir Putin.”Marc Fogel is a resident of Oakmont, Pennsylvania and has served as an international educator for 35 years. He was detained in Russia in August 2021 for possession of 17 grams of marijuana, prescribed by a doctor for his chronic pain.The Senators point out that Mr. Fogel meets six of the eleven criteria to be designated “wrongfully detained” as established in the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act, including the criterion that his detainment is being used substantially to influence U.S. policy. The Senators also note that Mr. Fogel’s disproportionate 14-year sentence for possession of 17 grams of marijuana is most comparable to sentences handed down to serious drug traffickers, like that of Guido Guillermo Walters, who received 15 years in Russian prison for the contraband and sale of more than 105,000 grams of cocaine. The Levinson criteria confirm that Mr. Fogel is being held as a political prisoner, thus requiring the reclassification of his case as “wrongfully detained.”Read the letter to Secretary Blinken here and below.The Honorable Antony Blinken   Secretary of State  U.S. Department of State  2201 C Street NW   Washington, D.C. 20520Dear Secretary Blinken:We write with grave concern for the safety of Mr. Marc Fogel, a U.S. citizen currently imprisoned in Russia, and urge you to designate him as “wrongfully detained” under the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act. Mr. Fogel's recent 14-year sentence to a maximum-security penal colony for possession of less than an ounce of medical marijuana can only be understood as a political ploy by Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian regime. Mr. Fogel, a 61-year-old with severe medical conditions, has already been detained for a year. The United States cannot stand by as Mr. Fogel wastes away in a Russian hard labor camp.Marc Fogel has served as an international educator for 35 years in Malaysia, Mexico, Colombia, Oman, Venezuela and, for the last nine years, in Russia. Students and parents from all these countries, including former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, have celebrated Mr. Fogel's infectious teaching style. In August 2021, Mr. Fogel was flying back to Russia to teach at the Anglo-American School in Moscow, which educates the children of American and other international diplomats, for one last year before retirement.Mr. Fogel has lived with chronic pain for decades. He has undergone three back surgeries, a spinal fusion, a hip replacement and two knee surgeries that have failed to remedy the pain and left him with a permanent limp. In 2021, a doctor recommended medical marijuana as an opioid alternative to treat his chronic pain.Though Mr. Fogel did violate Russian law by bringing 17 grams of marijuana to the country, his sentence is grossly disproportionate to similar cases. As Russian lawyers have pointed out, the most common sentence in similar cases is five years of probation. Drug traffickers who have committed much worse offenses have received shorter sentences. For example, in 2019 Alexander Grigoriev received an eight-year sentence from the same Khimkinsky court for contraband and possession of 1,500 grams of various narcotics. Sentences similar to Mr. Fogel’s are typically reserved for serious drug traffickers like Guido Guillermo Walters, who received 15 years in 2018 for the contraband and sale of more than 105,000 grams of cocaine.These extreme sentences are also levied by Russian courts in cases of politically motivated prosecutions, such as that of Israeli-American backpacker, Naama Issachar; Women’s National Basketball Association player, Brittney Griner; and Marc Fogel. In the case of Ms. Issachar, who was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years for possession of nine grams of marijuana, the Israeli government negotiated her release. The State Department is currently attempting to negotiate the release of Ms. Griner, who was recently sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in prison for carrying vape cartridges and less than a gram of cannabis into Russia. Marc Fogel’s case warrants the same degree of political attention and diplomatic intervention.   To avoid turning the case into a “political football” and in the hopes that the Moscow court would give Mr. Fogel a reasonable sentence, Mr. Fogel’s family decided to not seek media attention during his pretrial detention. Unfortunately, this low-profile strategy has failed. Mr. Fogel has spent a year detained without any oversight of his medical treatments and, on June 16, 2022, he was sentenced to 14 years in a Russian penal colony.While we understand the State Department has previously requested Mr. Fogel’s release on humanitarian grounds due to his poor medical condition, we strongly urge that the Administration to escalate Mr. Fogel’s case by designating him as “wrongfully detained.” Based on the statute governing such cases, the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act, Marc Fogel meets six of the 11 established criteria to be designated “wrongfully detained.”While Ms. Griner was only recently sentenced, the Khimkinsky court sentenced Mr. Fogel more than 60 days ago, and there are reports that the court could adjudicate his appeal any day now. After that appeal, the Russian government will transfer Mr. Fogel from his current detention center to a penal colony, notorious for harsh labor requirements and treatment of prisoners. According to a State Department 2021 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Russia, “conditions in prisons and detention centers... were often harsh and life threatening. Overcrowding, abuse by guards and inmates, limited access to health care, food shortages, and inadequate sanitation were common.” Mr. Fogel's medical conditions will very likely worsen in such circumstances. According to Mr. Fogel's family, “he will not survive this [sentence].” We strongly urge the State Department to shift its strategy given the realities of Marc Fogel’s situation and act immediately to designate him as “wrongfully detained.” Such a designation will provide the warranted level of support to Marc Fogel's family after a year of communication with Mr. Fogel only via mail and, most importantly, will require the U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs to secure Mr. Fogel's freedom.  We cannot allow Mr. Fogel to be used as a political pawn by Vladimir Putin.Thank you for your swift consideration of our request. We look forward to your response."

Chairman Casey also discussed his bipartisan ABLE Age Adjustment Act, which would provide 6.2 million additional Americans, including more than one million veterans, the opportunity to open an ABLE account and save for the future by extending access to people who acquired their disability between 26 and 46 years of age.Approximately 1 out of 4 adults in the U.S. has a disability. People with disabilities across the Nation have half the rate of workforce participation as the non-disabled population and are more than twice as likely to be living in poverty compared to the general population. There are almost 120,000 ABLE account holders in the United States— these accounts contain over $1.1 billion in assets for an average account size of nearly $9,300.“Today, I was honored to hear from three Pennsylvanians who are using their ABLE accounts to fulfill their dreams, as well as another who is unable to save with ABLE due to the age at which she acquired her disability,” said Chairman Casey. “In creating ABLE, we knocked down a barrier that people with disabilities face as they work to improve their lives. When we see a federal program working for Americans, we should do everything we can to ensure as many people as possible can benefit from it. That’s why I’ve introduced the bipartisan ABLE Age Adjustment Act to build on the success of the ABLE Act.” Senator Casey’s ABLE Act, signed into law in 2014, makes it possible for people who acquired their disability before turning 26 to save money without risking loss of their federal disability benefits.During the hearing, Chairman Casey heard from Brenda Dare, community advocate and artist; Colton Vazquez, Welcome Director at Open Up Pittsburgh; and Andrew Duch, advocate, on how saving with ABLE accounts have allowed them to save and fulfill their goals. Casey also heard from Carrie L. Bach, Director of MCO Operations and Business Intelligence at Voices for Independence, who advocated for the need to expand ABLE for people who acquire their disability after age 26. Senator Casey’s ABLE Age Adjustment Act would make it possible for allow Carrie Bach and people like her to open ABLE accounts and save.Read more about the ABLE Age Adjustment Act here. "

The funding will go towards improving bus charging capacity at SEPTA’s bus facilities and supporting SEPTA’s transition to fully zero-emission vehicles.“The infrastructure law is already improving public transit across Pennsylvania by providing dedicated funds to important projects that will support service and reduce harmful emissions,” said Senator Casey. “In Philadelphia and its suburbs, thousands of riders rely on SEPTA to get to work and school, to connect with family and friends. When Pennsylvanians can’t rely on public transportation to get to work, our entire region suffers. This funding will not only help SEPTA improve its busing system, it will also fulfill two major goals of the infrastructure law—creating jobs while tackling the climate crisis.”This funding comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Low-No Grant Program and Grants for Buses and Bus Facilities Competitive Program, the purpose of which is to invest in bus and bus facilities improvement projects, including replacing, rehabilitating, purchasing or leasing buses or related equipment, and rehabilitating, purchasing, constructing or leasing bus-related facilities. The Low-No Program provides funding for the transition of the Nation’s transit vehicles to the lowest polluting and most energy efficient transit vehicles."

Chairman Casey was joined by Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee; Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), Ranking Member of the Senate Health; and Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Mike Braun (R-IN), both members of the Senate Special Committee on Aging.Chairman Casey’s letter to GAO is the latest in a series of bipartisan efforts he has led to ensure effective federal oversight and enforcement of the mandated Section 508 requirements. Chairman Casey recently led a letter to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), urging the agency to improve VA web accessibility for disabled veterans, and to the Department of Justice (DOJ), demanding long-overdue information on web accessibility across the federal government. He called on DOJ to restart the government-wide reports evaluating the accessibility of federal technology. These reports have not been issued since 2012, despite a requirement in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act that they be completed every two years.“Recent congressional oversight leaves us concerned about the federal government’s efforts to meet its legal obligations to ensure that its electronic and information technology, including websites, is accessible for people with disabilities. Accessibility challenges appear to exist across the government, raising important questions about the effectiveness of accountability mechanisms intended to monitor the accessibility of federal technology and whether they are being properly carried out,” the Senators wrote. “Given these concerns, we ask the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to examine how the federal government is complying with laws requiring the availability of accessible technology and how it evaluates whether legal requirements are being met.”Below is a timeline of Chairman Casey’s work on the issue of federal government web accessibility: March 2020: Senator Casey introduced the bipartisan Department of Veterans Affairs Website Accessibility Act alongside Senator Moran and Representative Luria directing the VA to report to Congress regarding the accessibility of VA websites to people with disabilities. December 2020: Senator Casey’s Department of Veterans Affairs Website Accessibility Act became law (P.L. 116-213). January 2021: Senator Casey sent a letter to then-VA Secretary Robert Wilkie to confirm the VA was taking steps to implement the VA Website Accessibility Act and ensuring robust enforcement of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act after reports that the agency was not meeting standards of accessibility established by those laws. April 2021: Senator Casey sent a letter following up on concerns on VA website accessibility with VA Secretary McDonough.  September 2021: VA transmitted a report to Congress regarding Section 508 compliance.  March 2022: Senator Casey received responses from VA to questions from his April 2021 letter. June 2022: Senator Casey led a bipartisan, bicameral group of committee leaders in sending a letter to U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Denis McDonough urging the agency to improve VA website accessibility for disabled veterans.

Full text of the letter is below.August 11, 2022The Honorable Eugene L. Dodaro Comptroller General of the United States United States Government Accountability Office 441 G Street NW Washington, D.C., 20548 Dear Mr. Dodaro: Recent congressional oversight leaves us concerned about the federal government’s efforts to meet its legal obligations to ensure that its electronic and information technology, including websites, is accessible for people with disabilities. Accessibility challenges appear to exist across the government, raising important questions about the effectiveness of accountability mechanisms intended to monitor the accessibility of federal technology and whether they are being properly carried out. Given these concerns, we ask the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to examine how the federal government is complying with laws requiring the availability of accessible technology and how it evaluates whether legal requirements are being met.For nearly a quarter century, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 has required the government to make its electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities.[1] Accessibility is important to a broad swath of taxpayers who rely every day on information and services provided by the federal government. About 26 percent of the American public has a disability and disabilities are more common among individuals over the age of 65, a rapidly growing segment of our Nation’s population.[2] As such, Section 508 compliance is critical to ensuring a sizable share of the American public, including individuals with disabilities and seniors, can access government information and technology.Despite the long-standing requirements of Section 508, recent oversight of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has identified significant accessibility gaps, raising questions about whether similar shortcomings exist across the federal government. The Department of Veterans Affairs Website Accessibility Act of 2019[3] required VA to produce a report to Congress on the department’s compliance with Section 508 requirements. That report found that only 8 percent of VA’s internet sites and 6 percent of its intranet sites are fully compliant with Section 508.[4]  We are concerned that VA’s lack of compliance with Section 508 may extend to other federal departments and agencies. While there is little available information, third party reports suggest that Section 508 shortcomings do occur in other federal departments and agencies. For instance, a 2021 report found that the homepages for 30 percent of the most popular federal websites were not fully accessible. Nearly half of those sites (48 percent) failed an accessibility test on at least one of their three most popular sub-pages. Further, one-third of popular federal websites lacked easily discoverable contact information to report accessibility issues.[5] Anecdotal evidence similarly suggests ongoing accessibility barriers. For example, experts from the National Association of the Deaf describe how early COVID-19 videos from the Department of Health and Human Services sometimes lacked proper captioning and were not available in American Sign Language.  Both legal requirements and government-wide guidance require departments and agencies to conduct certain types of accessibility oversight and enforcement. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is required by law to submit a report to the President and Congress every two years with information and recommendations on Section 508 compliance.[6] However, DOJ has not issued these statutorily required biennial reports since 2012, a concern recently raised in a bipartisan letter to the Attorney General.[7] And while the Office of Management and Budget requires 24 agencies to assess and report their compliance with Section 508’s standards twice a year, the information collected through this process is not made public.[8] The lack of public reporting and accountability leaves Congress and taxpayers without adequate information about the rate of compliance with disability access requirements across government websites and other information technology.Given the importance of accessible technology for universal access to government information, we ask GAO to assess Section 508 oversight efforts and compliance across the federal government. Specifically, we would like GAO to answer the following questions:  Thank you for your attention to this important matter. [1] 29 U.S.C. §794d; Section 508 was added to the Rehabilitation Act in 1986, at which time it included non-binding standards for accessible government electronic and information technology.

The funding comes from a Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability & Equity (RAISE) Grant, funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.“This is a huge investment for the City of Philadelphia, especially communities that have historically been left out of infrastructure investments,” said Senator Casey. “By making these roads safer for drivers and pedestrians alike, we are making neighborhoods across Philadelphia safer places to live, work and play. This funding, made possible by the infrastructure law, will advance Philly’s Vision Zero goal of eliminating traffic-related deaths altogether. Simply put, this money will save lives.”“We thank the Biden-Harris Administration, Secretary Buttigieg, Senator Casey, Rep. Evans, Rep. Scanlon, and Rep. Boyle for their work in bringing much needed improvements to neighborhoods in Philadelphia through the RAISE grant. This grant will fund the Great Streets PHL program which shows that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is delivering on critical investments to communities that have long seen disinvestment,” said Mayor Jim Kenney. “This program will bring traffic safety and other significant upgrades to streets throughout our city, where residents can see and benefit from it, right where they live. It will also help create good-paying jobs for Philadelphians, especially those too often underrepresented in transportation and construction.”Each corridor is designated as a Vision Zero traffic safety priority and is listed on the City’s High Injury Network, which identifies the most dangerous roads in Philadelphia. In 2020, over 150 people died due to traffic crashes across the entire city.The funding will make improvements along seven high-crash corridors:"
https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-klobuchar-blumenthal-bill-to-prevent-furniture-tip-over-injury-and-death-passes-commerce-committee,"Since 2000, more than 460 U.S. children have died from tip-overs Washington, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) announced that the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee passed their bipartisan Stop Tip-overs of Unstable, Risky Dressers on Youth (STURDY) Act, legislation to prevent furniture tip-overs resulting in injury or death, and is headed to the floor for consideration by the full Senate. The bill would change the stability standard for manufacturers of clothing storage units from voluntary to mandatory—requiring companies to ensure their products are tested for safety and stability before being sold. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), tip-overs cause an average of 25,500 emergency room-treated injuries each year as children are crushed, trapped or struck by furniture, TVs and appliances. The bill, as marked up, has broad support from Parents Against Tip-overs, IKEA, the American Home Furnishings Alliance (AHFA) and other consumer, manufacturing and industry groups, and received bipartisan support in Committee. U.S. Representative Jan Schakowsky (D-IL-09) introduced the House companion to the bill.“Our children’s safety is non-negotiable. Because of inadequate safety standards and testing for furniture tip-overs, families have had to endure unimaginable tragedy and loss. My STURDY Act would implement much-needed reforms to make homes safer for children. I am proud to see this legislation pass out of committee and I will work with my colleagues to get it to the President’s desk quickly,” said Senator Casey.“No family should live in fear that their child could be severely injured or even killed by preventable accidents,” said Klobuchar. “By strengthening our furniture safety standards, the STURDY Act will help protect more children from the risks of furniture tip-overs. Now that this bill has advanced through the Senate Commerce Committee with bipartisan support, I look forward to it passing the full Senate and being signed into law.”“Today’s committee vote is an important step forward in preventing deadly furniture tip-overs that can be tragic for children and their families,” said Blumenthal. “By establishing a process to finalize mandatory furniture stability requirements, the STURDY Act will protect millions of American households from dangerously-designed furniture, and curtail hundreds of needless injuries and deaths. As Chair of the Consumer Protection Subcommittee, I’m proud to have joined my colleagues in introducing and negotiating this legislation and I look forward to continuing to fight for its passage in the Senate.”According to a report by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, tip-overs cause an average of 25,500 emergency room-treated injuries each year, with 44 percent of that number involving children who are crushed, trapped or struck by furniture, TVs and appliances. Product instability that leads to a tip-over incident can be caused or affected by an unstable dresser design such as a small base and top heavy, use on a sloped or unstable surface such as carpet, not using a restraint device or using a defective tip-over restraint device, heavy objects placed on top of a dresser such as a TV, or multiple dresser drawers open simultaneously. The bill also requires rigorous testing measures for furniture, simulation of real-world use and warning requirements based on the most up-to-date safety standards.Read more about the STURDY Act here. "
https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-announces-support-for-womens-health-protection-act,"Washington, D.C. – Today U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement on the Senate’s upcoming vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act:“This week, I will again vote yes to advance debate on the Women’s Health Protection Act and I will support the bill if there is a vote on final passage in the future.“In the nearly three months since the Senate last voted on the Women’s Health Protection Act, the circumstances around the entire debate on abortion have changed. In light of the leaked Supreme Court decision draft overturning Roe v. Wade, and subsequent reports that Republicans in the U.S. House and Senate will introduce legislation to enact a nationwide six-week ban, the real question of the moment is: do you support a categorical ban on abortion?  During my time in public office, I have never voted for—nor do I support—such a ban."""
https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-1-in-5-facilities-on-poor-performing-nursing-homes-list-overdue-for-inspections,"Casey letter requests information on delays in inspections for nursing homes, urges more transparency for residents and their familiesWashington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA), Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, raised concerns about the timeliness of inspections at the Nation’s poorest performing nursing homes in a letter sent to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure. The letter, which detailed disturbing instances of sub-standard care collected from inspection reports, requested information on the lag in surveys at nursing homes in a program for poor-performing facilities.The nursing homes Senator Casey reviewed are in the Special Focus Facility (SFF) program and are required by law to be surveyed every 6 months. The review found that as of the end of February 2022, 1 in 5 nursing homes in the SFF program were overdue for inspections based on CMS inspection reports. Senator Casey requested information about how CMS will bolster the SFF program to ensure consistent oversight over these nursing homes and timely and transparent reporting of data for consumers.“Conducting regular standard surveys of SFF participants is an important means of ensuring safety, accountability and compliance with Federal law,” Senator Casey wrote. “These delays would be concerning on their own but also are not isolated to recent months: Aging Committee staff identified multiple examples of SFF participants that went long periods without these statutorily required inspections.”“The standard survey delays for SFF participants have taken place at a time when HHS’s independent watchdog has warned of states falling behind on nursing home inspections generally,” Casey added. “The inspection data and persistent deficiencies, coupled with the [Office of Inspector General’s] recent reports, leave me concerned about the timeliness, consistency and effectiveness of SFF program oversight and the wellbeing of residents in those facilities.”Nursing homes in the SFF program “substantially fail” to meet the required care standards and resident protections afforded by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In March 2021, Senator Casey introduced the bipartisan Nursing Home Reform Modernization Act, which would expand the SFF program to ensure that all of the facilities nominated as candidates for the program—more than 400 nursing homes—can receive adequate oversight and enforcement, as well as resources to improve quality of care. During his State of the Union address, President Biden called on Congress and the Administration to prioritize these quality improvement initiatives outlined in the Administration’s plan to improve nursing home quality and safety.In 2019, CMS began publishing the names of more than 400 low-performing nursing homes that are candidates for enhanced oversight in the SFF program in response to bipartisan oversight led by Senator Casey and Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA), who released a groundbreaking report on the SFF program earlier that year.Throughout the pandemic, Senator Casey led efforts in the U.S. Congress to combat the COVID-19 tragedy unfolding in our Nation’s nursing homes. Senator Casey led multiple oversight initiatives, calling on the federal government to release data on case counts and deaths among residents and later on COVID-19 vaccination rates in nursing homes. These successful initiatives led to the publication of data sets that shed light on the true extent of the crisis and gave families needed transparency regarding the pace of vaccinations among residents and staff. Further, Senator Casey’s leadership led to the successful passage of legislation bringing oversight resources to bear in nursing homes as part of the bipartisan CARES Act in 2020, and through the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021 to invest in “strike teams” to ensure adequate staffing in nursing homes affected by COVID-19 outbreaks.Read the letter to CMS here. May 9, 2022The Honorable Chiquita Brooks-LaSureAdministratorCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services200 Independence Avenue, S.W.Washington, DC 20201 Dear Administrator Brooks-LaSure,I write with concern about the timeliness of surveys conducted at nursing homes in the Special Focus Facility (SFF) program and seek information about how these low-performing facilities will be overseen as the White House’s recently announced plans to overhaul the program are implemented. A review of standard surveys conducted at nursing homes in the SFF program appears to show that many of these facilities are not being surveyed as frequently as required by law. These apparent survey delays among SFF participants are part of a larger backlog the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) has identified as a concern. I appreciate the White House’s attention to the SFF program following my bipartisan efforts with Senator Toomey to improve program transparency through oversight and expand the program’s reach through legislation. I am also aware that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) recently issued guidance to address the backlog of inspections at SFF participants and nursing homes generally. In addition to the Biden Administration’s efforts to strengthen the SFF program, I seek assurance that current survey requirements are being met and transparent information about these facilities is maximized for residents, their families and the public.Conducting regular standard surveys of SFF participants is an important means of ensuring safety, accountability and compliance with Federal law. Nursing homes in the SFF program are subject to standard surveys every six months, whereas nursing homes outside the SFF program are typically subject to standard surveys every 15 months. Representing less than 1 percent of all nursing homes, SFF participants “substantially fail” to meet the required care standards and resident protections afforded by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. There also are approximately 400 SFF “candidates” that do not receive additional oversight due to limited resources at CMS, despite being indistinguishable from SFF participants in terms of their qualifications for enhanced oversight. Like all nursing homes, SFF participants and SFF candidates also are subject to “abbreviated surveys” for complaints and infection control, which take place between standard surveys and are narrower in focus. The statutory survey requirements coupled with CMS’s publicly identifying SFF participants and SFF candidates help residents and their families make better informed choices about their care.Aging Committee staff conducted a review that found 15 nursing homes in the SFF program had gone six months or longer without a standard survey as of CMS’s February 23, 2022 program report. Spread across 14 states, these nursing homes represent 22 percent of the 63 facilities in the SFF program that were subject to more frequent inspections at the time. Four of the facilities had gone at least seven months without a standard survey; three more had gone eight months without a standard survey, according to the program report.These delays would be concerning on their own but also are not isolated to recent months: Aging Committee staff identified multiple examples of SFF participants that went long periods without these statutorily required inspections. These delays took place after CMS allowed states to restart standard surveys in August 2020, following restrictions put in place early in the COVID-19 pandemic. In Florida, a SFF participant went 12 months with no standard survey from September 2020 to September 2021. In California, one SFF participant did not have a standard survey for more than 10 months after the CMS survey restrictions were lifted. And in Georgia, the state’s two SFFs went without standard surveys for 9 months and 10 months, respectively.Nursing homes that go long periods between standard surveys can accumulate deficiencies in the absence of regular oversight. One Missouri SFF participant that has been in the program for three-and-a-half years provides an illustrative example. The most recent standard survey was conducted in July 2021, the first since September 2019, and 11 months after CMS lifted its survey restrictions. The September 2019 survey identified six deficiencies while the July 2021 survey identified 20—more than twice the state and national average—including failing to document resident falls and failing to timely provide blood cancer medication to a resident. In the intervening time, a March 2021 survey conducted in response to a complaint detailed how a resident was found injured in “an unoccupied room on an unoccupied hall, with the door shut.” The facility’s social worker, who only learned of the fall when they overheard coworkers “gossiping” two days later, reported that “[t]he resident looked bad, had a cut under one eye, a bruise on the forehead and what appeared as possible rug burn to his/her nose and cheek.” The nursing home was cited for failing to ensure the resident, who also had been hit with an office binder by a staff member in an incident captured on a security camera and investigated in October 2020, was kept free from abuse and neglect.In another instance, one Minnesota SFF participant with a pattern of abuse and neglect deficiencies was not subject to a standard survey until June 2021—10 months after CMS reinstated them. The facility had been cited for five deficiencies related to the prevention and reporting of abuse and neglect in 2019 and 2020, including several in its most recent standard survey in November 2019. The November 2019 standard survey detailed three residents who had been harmed by the nursing home’s practices, including a resident who was hospitalized and died “when the facility failed to monitor for ongoing rectal bleeding.” When the June 2021 standard survey was conducted, the nursing home was cited for failing to timely report suspected abuse and neglect to proper authorities.Finally, an infection control survey described how an Ohio SFF participant failed to take appropriate measures against the spread of COVID-19, such as providing protective equipment, ensure that it was used correctly, and screen facility staff. The January 2021 survey reported that 23 of the facility’s 25 residents tested positive for COVID-19 and one was admitted to an intensive care unit. The nursing home, which entered the SFF program in January 2021, was not subject to a standard survey until May 2021, nine months after CMS lifted its standard survey restrictions. Its most recent standard survey was conducted in March 2019.I am concerned that similar survey delays identified by recent OIG reports may leave residents at risk at the 400-plus SFF candidates. Senator Toomey and I introduced the Nursing Home Reform Modernization Act, S. 782, last year to enhance accountability at SFF participant and candidate facilities and provide them with on-site consultation to facilitate improvement and enhance quality of care. In addition to continuing to push to get that legislation passed into law, I plan to closely track the Biden Administration’s implementation of the White House’s proposals to extend the reach and impact of the SFF program.The standard survey delays for SFF participants have taken place at a time when HHS’s independent watchdog has warned of states falling behind on nursing home inspections generally. The OIG has reported that backlogs of inspections have persisted since CMS suspended standard surveys in response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020 to August 2020 in favor of concentrating on infection control and complaint surveys. The OIG issued a report last year that found 71 percent of nursing homes nationally had gone at least 16 months without a standard survey as of May 31, 2021, with backlogs of nursing homes surveyed ranging from 22 percent to 96 percent by state. In a recent briefing, the OIG informed Aging Committee staff that while survey backlogs nationally were trending in the right direction, as of mid-February, 45 percent of facilities had gone 16 months or more without a standard survey, according to data on the CMS website. The OIG’s concerns regarding survey timeliness predate the pandemic. For example, in a recent report identifying 28 states that repeatedly missed CMS’s performance goals for nursing home oversight between FY2015 and FY2018, the OIG found that 41 percent of “performance measures that States failed to meet were the result of States not conducting high-priority complaint surveys or standard surveys within required timeframes.” The OIG noted “staffing shortages as a root cause of State survey performance problems,” and issued several recommendations to CMS intended to improve its monitoring of state survey programs.The inspection data and persistent deficiencies, coupled with the OIG’s recent reports, leave me concerned about the timeliness, consistency and effectiveness of SFF program oversight and the wellbeing of residents in those facilities. In order to ensure everything possible is being done to protect residents living in these nursing homes, please respond to the following questions not later than June 6, 2022."

Casey. “I applaud the decision to utilize the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust to provide millions of dollars in food assistance to support vulnerable countries feeling this pain. We have to continue to meet the challenge of worldwide hunger head on and work to prevent the devastating impact of hunger and malnutrition around the globe.”“The consequences of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are being felt around the world as countries that relied on Russia and Ukraine for food are now facing widespread hunger,” said Sen. Moran. “Feeding hungry people is – most importantly – the morally right thing to do and will foster goodwill and political stability in countries facing famine, hunger and starvation.”The Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust was created to purchase U.S. commodities to respond to unanticipated food crises abroad. Secretary Vilsack announced the food assistance will be going to Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen.On January 24, Senators Casey and Moran led a bipartisan group of senators in urging the USDA and USAID to release resources within the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust.

The Rural Hospital Support Act would extend and update federal programs to ensure these hospitals can stay fiscally solvent.“Every American deserves reliable access to health care,” said Senator Casey. “Rural hospitals can be the difference between life and death in many parts of the U.S. Often, a rural hospital means not only safe, dependable access to health care and emergency health needs, but economic safety and stability for an entire community. This legislation takes an important step to maintain that lifeline, especially for older adults and lower income Americans. I will continue to work to bring federal funding to rural communities and make sure older Americans have the health care support they need no matter where they live.”“These programs bring a lot of value for rural residents and taxpayers,” Grassley said. “Small, rural hospitals offer good-quality health care at a cost that compares well with urban hospitals’ cost.

https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-toomey-announce-nominations-of-jacqueline-romero-and-jerry-karam-as-us-attorneys-for-eastern-and-middle-districts,"Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA) and Pat Toomey (R-PA) are announcing that President Biden has nominated Jacqueline Romero as U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and Jerry Karam as U.S. Attorney in the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Since 2011, Senators Casey and Toomey have worked together to recommend U.S. Attorney candidates to the White House with the intelligence, legal experience, independence and unquestioned honesty and integrity necessary to serve the Commonwealth. “Today President Biden nominated two highly qualified people to serve the Commonwealth as United States Attorneys—Jacqueline Romero to serve in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and Jerry Karam to serve in the Middle District of Pennsylvania,” said Senator Casey. “U.S. Attorneys serve a vital role in keeping our communities safe, upholding the rule of law and protecting the independence and integrity of the Department of Justice. For over two decades, Ms. Romero has dedicated her career to public service, including the past 16 years as an Assistant United States Attorney in Philadelphia. She brings a breadth of experience and an historic perspective to this role as the first woman nominated to lead that office. Mr. Karam has spent his career fighting for equal justice for all Pennsylvanians. He’s practiced in the Middle District since 1987, including a decade as the Chief Public Defender of Lackawanna County. As evidenced by their extensive legal careers, Ms. Romero and Mr. Karam will bring important leadership and independence to these critical roles, as well as a strong commitment to the safety of our communities and equal justice for all. I urge the Senate to confirm them quickly.” “President Biden has selected two strong candidates to serve as U.S. Attorneys in the Commonwealth. Jerry Karam’s experience and commitment to the law have long served the Commonwealth, and his nomination to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania is well deserved. Having served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney already in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Jacqueline Romero is well suited to lead the office. Her academic and legal background will similarly benefit the Commonwealth as she works to uphold our laws. I am confident both Karam and Romero will continue to be assets in defending the rule of law in Pennsylvania,” said Senator Toomey. Jacqueline C. Romero is an Assistant United States Attorney in the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, where she has served since 2006. Ms. Romero is the Civil Rights Coordinator for the District, and she also serves as a member of the Philadelphia/Newark Regional Medicare Fraud Strike Force. Since 2012, she has been a member of the Federal Reentry Court program and received the 2018 Clifford Scott Green Bill of Rights Award for her dedication to this program. Ms. Romero worked with the United States Department of Justice as Trial Attorney in the Commercial Litigation Branch from 1998 to 2000. She also served as Senior Counsel to the United States Mint from 2000 to 2006 and as Litigation Associate with the law firm of Lowenstein Sandler LLP from 1998 to 2000. She is a past President of the Hispanic Bar Association of Pennsylvania and was an Adjunct Professor of Civil Procedure in the Trial Advocacy Program at Temple University Beasley School of Law from 2017 to 2021. Ms. Romero received her J.D. from Rutgers Law School in 1996 and her B.A. from the College of New Jersey in 1993.Gerard M. Karam is a partner in the Scranton, Pennsylvania law firm of Mazzoni Karam Petorak and Valvano.  His practice has focused on complex civil and criminal litigation including representing businesses and individuals facing governmental inquiries, civil rights claims and federal housing matters. Mr. Karam served as Chief Public Defender of Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania from 1993 to 2003.  He was an Assistant Public Defender in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania from 1991 to 1993. Mr. Karam, a former President of the Lackawanna Bar Association, received his J.D. from Loyola University School of Law in 1987 and his B.S. from Saint Joseph’s University in 1984. "
https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-markey-van-hollen-blumenthal-duckworth-urge-department-of-transportation-to-make-infrastructure-investments-accessible-for-seniors-people-with-disabilities,"Senators urge Department of Transportation to prioritize seniors and people with disabilities by ensuring all new infrastructure investments follow American Disability Act requirementsWashington, D.C. – Thanks to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), communities across the country are seeing historic investments in local transportation, from upgrades to public transit to airport rehabilitation. As funding is disseminated for various infrastructure projects, U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Ed Markey (D-MA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) are urging U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to ensure that these investments make travel accessible for older adults and people with disabilities. The Senators sent a letter to Secretary Buttigieg emphasizing that all new start construction projects must be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)—the landmark civil rights law prohibiting discrimination against people with disabilities in all areas of public life—and the Rehabilitation Act, which prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in programs conducted by federal agencies or receiving federal funding.“As DOT prepares to distribute $1 trillion to communities to make our infrastructure more efficient, greener and safer, we can also ensure that facilities and transportation systems are built and renovated to serve everyone, including the 61 million Americans with disabilities. The significant investments in IIJA present an ideal opportunity to make our transit systems, which have historically excluded older adults and people with disabilities, compliant with the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act,” wrote the Senators.The Senators also noted the opportunity and need to increase hiring, promotion and retention of people with disabilities in the infrastructure workforce. They wrote, “We also ask every employer issued IIJA funds commit to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs’ goal of employing at least 7 percent of their workforce with people who have disabilities and that every contract, grant and cooperative agreement include a provision that recipients shall consult with local disability stakeholders to ensure projects result in accessible facilities.”In addition to $617 million for Pennsylvania public transportation projects from the infrastructure law, Pennsylvania communities will be able to compete for a $1.75 billion grant program to improve accessibility at rail stations thanks to Senator Casey’s All Station Accessibility Program (ASAP) Act, a version of which was incorporated into the infrastructure law. Senator Casey has also introduced legislation to make public transportation more accessible for college students.Read the letter to Secretary Buttigieg here. April 22, 2022The Honorable Pete Buttigieg SecretaryU.S. Department of Transportation 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE Washington, D.C. 20590 Dear Secretary Buttigieg:Thank you for your ongoing work to implement the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and for the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) efforts to revitalize U.S. infrastructure. The IIJA will build on this Administration’s efforts to modernize existing transportation systems, while also creating sustainable systems that will serve our Nation for decades. As the DOT continues to implement the law’s investments, we ask you to ensure that any infrastructure investments work to make travel accessible for everyone, especially older adults and people with disabilities, by assuring that all new start construction projects are compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act. We also ask every employer issued IIJA funds commit to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs’ goal of employing at least 7 percent of their workforce with people who have disabilities and that every contract, grant and cooperative agreement include a provision that recipients shall consult with local disability stakeholders to ensure projects result in accessible facilities.As DOT prepares to distribute $1 trillion to communities to make our infrastructure more efficient, greener and safer, we can also ensure that facilities and transportation systems are built and renovated to serve everyone, including the 61 million Americans with disabilities. The significant investments in IIJA present an ideal opportunity to make our transit systems, which have historically excluded older adults and people with disabilities, compliant with the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. New roadways and sidewalks can be constructed in ways that are safe for older adults, who make up 20 percent of all pedestrian deaths. New transit stations and airports can be constructed and retrofitted in compliance with the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. While the IIJA committed some dedicated funding for accessibility through programs such as the All Stations Accessibility Program, the broader spirit of inclusive construction should be incorporated into the Department’s implementation procedures.This historic investment in the country’s infrastructure is also a historic opportunity to make our physical infrastructure accessible to people with disabilities and to increase the hiring, promotion and retention of people with disabilities in the infrastructure workforce. As notices of funding opportunities, contracts and grants related to IIJA are being prepared and disseminated, we ask:The work of rebuilding our roads, bridges, rails and airports as well as expanding green technology is long overdue. We applaud the Administration’s undertaking of this momentous task. The inclusion of older adults and people with disabilities in the planning and implementation of this once-in-a-generation investment will ensure that all Americans benefit from this investment. Thank you for your attention to our requests. Please respond by May 16th."

The funding, made possible by the new Carbon Reduction Program (CRP) created by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), will be used to help states reduce carbon emissions from the transportation sector, including new infrastructure to support electrification of vehicles and projects to construct Bus Rapid Transit corridors. Pennsylvania has already received $50,892,693 of this IIJA carbon reduction funding for 2022.“This funding is a positive step towards decreasing carbon emissions, thanks to the Biden Administration and the infrastructure law. By investing in new projects to reduce pollution on our Nation’s highways, we can ease the burden on our planet, lower costs for families and create infrastructure jobs. I will continue to bring infrastructure funding home to Pennsylvania and advance projects to combat the climate crisis,” said Senator Casey.In 2018, the transportation sector accounted for 25 percent of all Pennsylvania greenhouse gas emissions and the Commonwealth was responsible for approximately 269 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent being emitted into the atmosphere. Under the CRP, states will use funding to develop and implement carbon reduction strategies to address congestion pricing, public transportation projects, off-road trail development and deployment of alternative fuel vehicles."

The funding, from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will be used to repair dams—helping with flood prevention and watershed restoration in the region. The funding flows through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service and will be contracted out in the near future.“Dams in Schuylkill and Snyder Counties prevent flooding and protect Pennsylvania’s natural resources and watershed lands,” said Senator Casey. “This funding, made possible by the infrastructure law, will begin the process to repair these dams before disaster strikes. For too long, critical infrastructure needs in our rural communities have not gotten the investments and attention they deserve. The infrastructure law is finally changing that.” In Schuylkill County, the funding will go towards efforts to repair five dams (PA-422, 422A, 423, 424 and 425) on the Little Schuylkill River. Four out of five of the dams are in Pennsylvania’s top 25 dams for Failure Index. The dams were constructed between 1962 and 1968 with 50-year project lives. In Snyder County, one dam (PA-637) will be rehabilitated to meet current criteria for a high hazard dam and to extend the dam’s service life. The dam provides flood damage reduction benefits to properties downstream. The Schuylkill County dams and the Snyder County dam can be found on Senator Casey’s Investing in the Commonwealth Map."

These incidents are emblematic of the unrelenting scourge of gun violence affecting our families, children and communities every single day.“Last week President Biden took an important step in combatting this epidemic by cracking down on ghost guns, but there is still much work that must be done. In addition to further executive action, it is well past time for Congress to take the necessary steps to end the gun violence plaguing our Nation. We must pass commonsense gun violence prevention measures, including universal background checks, and Congress must also invest further in evidence-based Community Violence Intervention programs to help address the root causes of this violence, as well as enhance access to resources for survivors of gun violence.“Gun violence has taken too many lives and destroyed too many families. We owe it to them to finally act.”"
https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-brown-urge-fda-action-on-recalled-baby-formula,"Reports of illness related to infant formula came five months before Abbott decided to recallWashington, D.C. – Following multiple reports of illness and death linked to recalled infant formula manufactured by Abbott Nutrition, U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) sent a letter to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Robert Califf to request information on the FDA’s actions and plans to investigate these reports and to prevent other infants from falling ill. Because of this recall, parents are now facing shortages of baby formula. The Senators requested information on the current status of the FDA’s investigation into the contaminated infant formula, steps the agency is taking to make sure there is enough infant formula on the shelves despite the shortage and work the FDA is doing to provide information to families and caregivers affected by the recall and contaminated products. They are also seeking information about the FDA’s interactions with Abbott Nutrition prior to the recall and pressing the FDA to explain the apparent delay in their response following initial reports of infant illness.“As you are aware, the FDA is responsible for overseeing manufacturers of infant formulas. Parents, caregivers, and the greater public rely upon the FDA to ensure infant formula on the shelves in our grocery stores and food pantries is safe to consume and supports healthy growth. It is unacceptable that FDA was made aware of complaints and positive cases related to the Abbott Nutrition facility months before Abbott finally issued its voluntary recall of potentially contaminated infant formula, yet failed to alert the public, immediately initiate an inspection, or demand Abbott issue an immediate recall of these infant formula products,” wrote the Senators. They also wrote, “Although the FDA typically inspects infant formula manufacturing sites annually, we understand that no such inspection of Abbott Nutrition’s Sturgis facility was conducted in 2020. How has the COVID-19 pandemic and public health emergency impacted the FDA’s ability to oversee and ensure the safety of infant formula? Did you make a remote records request? Would any authorities have enabled more effective FDA oversight and facilitated the FDA’s ability to meet its obligations?”Powdered infant formula manufactured at Abbott Nutrition’s facility in Sturgis, Michigan was recalled in February due to reports of possible bacterial contamination affecting Similac, Alimentum and EleCare powdered formulas. Parents and caregivers who want to check if their powdered formula is part of the recall can do so at the company’s website here, and can learn more about the recall at the FDA’s website here.Read the letter to Commissioner Califf here. April 8, 2022The Honorable Robert Califf, M.D. CommissionerFood and Drug AdministrationU.S. Department of Health and Human Services 10903 New Hampshire AveSilver Spring, MD 20993 Dear Commissioner Califf:We write today to express our concern about the recent recall of powdered infant formula manufactured at Abbott Nutrition’s facility in Sturgis, Michigan due to reports of bacterial contamination affecting Similac, Alimentum and EleCare powdered formulas, and to request information on the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) plans to investigate these illnesses and deaths and prevent other infants from falling ill. A parent should never have to worry about whether the food they feed their child is safe, let alone deadly, and we are heartbroken by news that infections linked to these products may have contributed to at least four infant hospitalizations and the tragic deaths of two of these babies.We were alarmed to learn that reports of adverse events linked to the recalled infant formula were reported as early as September 2021, nearly five months prior to Abbott Nutrition’s decision to initiate a recall. This delay was unacceptable; for nearly half a year, potentially contaminated product remained on store shelves and in baby bottles, subjecting unsuspecting families to unacceptable risk. Earlier actions to issue a recall and provide information to consumers could have prevented the subsequent three known cases, including two deaths in Ohio, reported in connection with the recalled products or limited quantity of recalled product and resulting shortages. The deaths of these two infants is tragic and unacceptable, and should never have happened.In addition to our deep concerns over the health risks to infants that the potential contamination and delayed action have caused, we are alarmed by the challenges families now face in securing safe infant formula with which to feed children reliant on this important source of nutrition. Reports over shortages at grocery stores and food pantries due to supply chain issues preceded the current recall, which has exacerbated the already-dire situation and left parents and caregivers scrambling to secure infant formula or quickly identify alternative products.While many infant formulas are interchangeable from a health or regulatory perspective, parents of infants who rely on formula to supplement breastmilk or as a sole source of nutrition find that in practice, infants often prefer certain formulations. Additionally, some infants develop allergies or sensitivities that require the use of specific formulas to ensure the infant’s continued health and growth; at least one of the products associated with the Sturgis facility was a specialized formula for babies with low iron deficiencies. Furthermore, infant formula is expensive, and the sudden drop in supply caused by the recall is likely to drive up prices even further. The prospect of finding a new formula as a result of the recall has posed a logistical, financial and emotional burden for families across the U.S.As you are aware, the FDA is responsible for overseeing manufacturers of infant formulas. Parents, caregivers, and the greater public rely upon the FDA to ensure infant formula on the shelves in our grocery stores and food pantries is safe to consume and supports growth. It is unacceptable that FDA was made aware of complaints and positive cases related to the Abbott Nutrition facility months before Abbott finally issued its voluntary recall of potentially contaminated infant formula, yet failed to alert the public, immediately initiate an inspection, or demand Abbott issue an immediate recall of these infant formula products.Better understanding the actions of and authorities utilized by the FDA in this troubling situation will help us to more quickly address and resolve the current challenge and prevent future detrimental threats to infant health. We respectfully request the FDA’s response to the following questions:We stand ready to assist the FDA to help protect our most vulnerable population—infants and newborns—from illness or death as a result of ingesting contaminated formula."

For the first time in our Nation’s history, a Black woman will take her seat on our highest court. This distinction is long overdue, but it could not go to a more deserving, well-qualified judge. Rising up to overcome so many barriers, Judge Jackson’s story—and her family’s story—is truly an American story of hard work, sacrifice and commitment to excellence. Her unparalleled professional credentials and the breadth of her legal experiences equal or exceed any nominee in recent history. What’s more, her brilliance and dedication to the rule of law are matched by her graciousness and warmth.“At its core, our court system, more so than any other institution, is dedicated to the idea that everyone deserves a fair shot at justice and no one is above the law. From her time as a public defender to her tenure on the federal bench, Judge Jackson has long fought to make this ideal a reality. No Supreme Court Justice has ever served as a public defender, until now. Judge Jackson is uniquely positioned to uphold ‘equal justice under law,’ words inscribed on the front of the Supreme Court itself. She understands that our legal system can only work when it protects all Americans; she has lived a commitment to equal justice.“Today is a good day for America. Judge Jackson’s confirmation to the Supreme Court is an inspiration for future generations, particularly young Black women and girls. Make no mistake, we have a long way to go to make our institutions reflect the diversity of our Nation. For too long, we’ve come up short. But today, we took an historic step forward. I was honored to vote to confirm Judge Jackson to our highest court and I have no doubt she will help realize our highest ideal of equal justice under the law.”"

The funding, administrated by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), will allow for infrastructure upgrades and new projects in both urban and rural areas, as well as funding to improve access to transit for seniors and people with disabilities.“From our biggest cities to our rural communities, Pennsylvanians across the Commonwealth rely on public transportation every day,” said Senator Casey. “Thanks to the infrastructure law, Pennsylvania’s public transit systems will see more than $617 million in a single year to provide faster, safer and more convenient service to their communities. This funding will be used to upgrade vehicles, improve facilities and make public transportation more accessible for seniors and people with disabilities.”In addition to this funding, Pennsylvania communities will be able to compete for a $1.75 billion grant program to improve accessibility at rail stations thanks to Senator Casey’s All Station Accessibility Program (ASAP) Act, a version of which was incorporated into the infrastructure law. Senator Casey has also introduced legislation to make public transportation more accessible for college students.The first portion of this funding was announced in February 2022, as the allotment of the first 4.5 months of FY22. Now that Congress has passed a federal spending bill, Pennsylvania’s total funding for FY22 is $617 million. The funding comes from numerous FTA grant programs, including the Urbanized Area Formula Program, State of Good Repair Formula Program, Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities, Rural Area Formula grants and state safety oversight. Below is a breakdown of the funding of some urbanized areas in the Commonwealth. Additional funding will flow to the state and to smaller communities. "

I’m proud to introduce this legislation with Senator Heinrich to invest in American ingenuity while improving the health of our communities and combatting the climate crisis.” “The severe droughts, record storms, and raging wildfires we are witnessing – let alone ice shelves collapsing in East Antarctica - should be clear indicators that we need to ramp up our ability to decarbonize industries that are major contributors to the climate crisis. Having the right technologies to tackle this challenge will be critical. That’s why I’m partnering up with my colleagues to introduce legislation to get the wheels moving on technologies that will help us decarbonize industries like steel, cement, and maritime shipping, and boost American jobs,” said Heinrich, member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.U.S. Representative Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) is leading companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.“This legislation will turbocharge transformative pollution-reducing technologies for the industrial sector and quickly bring them to market, ensuring we support breakthroughs for this especially hard-to-decarbonize sector of our economy through grants and loans. I’m proud to have led the passage of this initiative in the House of Representatives through the America COMPETES Act. And I thank my colleagues in the Senate for their work to get this important legislation past the finish line,” said Castor. The First Three Act would establish a new program at the U.S. Department of Energy to co-fund the first three commercial applications of industrial technologies that innovatively reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, this program would:The First Three Act has received support from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy and U.S. Steel.“U. S. Steel is a leader in both producing steel that is 100% mined, melted and made in the USA, and last April being the first American-headquartered steel producer to set a net-zero carbon goal for 2050. For the industrial sector to achieve the 2050 goal, we need partners in the federal and state government to successfully deploy cutting-edge, low-carbon technologies at production scale. There is a race to decarbonize and governments in Belgium, Canada, France, Spain and China are acting boldly and investing to reduce steelmaking’s carbon footprint. The First Three Act would boost American competitiveness and jumpstart decarbonization technologies in the industrial sector. The legislation will advance climate goals and ensure a more resilient domestic supply chain for U.S. manufacturing,” said Richard Fruehauf, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer of the United States Steel Corporation.“One of the most effective ways that Congress can reduce the large greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the industrial sector and make it less vulnerable to gas and oil price spikes, is by supporting companies’ investments in transformative industrial technologies,” said Steven Nadel, Executive Director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). “Senator Heinrich’s First Three Act would kickstart change by funding the first three installations at production scale of innovative technologies that decarbonize industrial processes and further U.S. leadership in these technologies. An ACEEE analysis found that this legislation could reduce U.S. GHG emissions by more than one billion metric tons over several decades – a reduction equivalent to the current combined annual emissions of California and Texas. ACEEE strongly supports this legislation and its counterpart in the House of Representatives introduced by Representative Kathy Castor.” Read more about the First Three Act here."

This bill would extend U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) school meal flexibilities from June 30, 2022 to September 30, 2023. USDA requested this authority be extended in the fiscal year 2023 spending bill.“For many families across Pennsylvania, access to school meals is vital to prevent children from going hungry. Ensuring all kids across the country have reliable access to nutritious meals is one of the most important things we can do to invest in the future of our Nation’s leaders and workers—when children have a healthy start in life, they are better able to learn and grow. I urge my colleagues to support passage of the Support Kids Not Red Tape Act to give school and summer feeding sites the flexibility they need to serve millions of children who need access to meals,” said Senator Casey.School food providers are struggling due to supply chain shortages and price spikes, as well as more expensive program costs over the last two years. Failure to extend the waiver would  impact Pennsylvania’s food and agricultural industry, as it would mean fewer dollars spent with PA growers and vendors companies who produce and process foods used in school meal programs.A broad spectrum of groups sent in letters to Congress to extend the child nutrition waiver authority.

https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-holds-hearing-on-preventing-home-tragedies-for-seniors-children,"Unintentional home injuries cause more than 30,000 deaths in the United States every yearWashington, D.C. - On Thursday, March 31, U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging Chairman Bob Casey (D-PA) held a hearing entitled, “Preventing Tragedies and Promoting Safe, Accessible, and Affordable Homes,” which examined best practices to keep older adults and children safe from accidental and preventable injuries at home. Senator Casey highlighted his bipartisan legislation to prevent consumer-related deaths, the STURDY Act, which would create a mandatory stability standard for furniture by requiring rigorous testing measures to ensure chests, bureaus, drawers and dressers are manufactured with stability and safety in mind.Senator Casey is also a cosponsor of the Preventative Home Visit Act, which would help thousands more older adults prioritize their safety and prevent in-home safety hazards. This bill would provide coverage from Medicare for in-home visits by qualified health care professionals who can identify health and safety risks. Though Americans over the age of 65 only account for 16 percent of the population, they make up 71 percent of consumer-related deaths annually.                                                                                                     “We must do more to prevent tragedies caused by unintentional home injuries,” said Chairman Casey. “Children and seniors are especially vulnerable to these injuries, which can be incredibly costly and, in some cases, deadly. There is no reason for any family to endure this unspeakable loss. My STURDY Act would save lives and keep families safe from harm by establishing a simple, commonsense requirement—companies must ensure their products are tested for safety before being sold. I will work to pass this legislation to help stop the hundreds of preventable injuries and deaths each year from falling furniture and give peace of mind to families and seniors.”Chairman Casey invited Janet McGee, the Director of Parents Against Tip-overs, to testify at the hearing about her experience losing her son, Ted, to a furniture tip-over incident. Janet testified, “While I thought Ted’s death was a completely isolated incident, I learned shortly after his death that he was not alone. His dresser didn’t meet the safety standard for clothing storage units, and worse yet, it didn’t have to because it’s a voluntary standard. Thousands of children, adults, and seniors are sent to the ER every year from tip-over related incidents. And sadly, over 570 people have died from tip-overs in the last 2 decades. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, 82% of these fatalities were children and 14% were seniors… So today I come before you to ask for your support in passing the STURDY Act. This piece of legislation would require these gaps between real world use and current testing to be accounted for and would finally make this safety standard mandatory. ”Read more about the STURDY Act here."

The Senators introduced companion legislation, which passed the Senate in October 2021 that would designate the new United States Courthouse in Harrisburg as the “Sylvia H. Rambo United States Courthouse.” The bill will now go to the President for his signature. The courthouse is expected to open later this year.Since her tenure as chief judge, Judge Rambo has advocated tirelessly for the planning, construction and funding of the new federal courthouse building in Harrisburg.“After a trailblazing career and her personal involvement to bring a new federal courthouse to Harrisburg, there is no better way to honor Judge Rambo than naming this courthouse after her. She continues to be an inspiration to women across the Commonwealth, the Third Circuit and the Nation. Today we are one step closer to making this dedication official and I urge President Biden to swiftly sign it into law,” said Senator Casey.“Judge Rambo’s trailblazing legacy has inspired generations of Pennsylvanians. Today, as the bill to name the U.S. Courthouse in Harrisburg after her heads to the president’s desk for signing, we are one step closer to ensuring her service to Pennsylvania and the nation is always revered. I appreciate the leadership of Senator Casey and Representatives Perry, Wild, Fitzpatrick, Cartwright, Keller, and Reschenthaler in helping make this a reality,” said Senator Toomey.Biography:Sylvia Rambo is a Senior Judge for the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. She was appointed to the federal bench by President Carter in 1979. In 1992, she became the first woman to serve as Chief Judge of the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Previously, she served on the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County from 1976-1978. Judge Rambo received her B.A. from Dickinson College and her J.D. from the Dickinson School of Law."

The Commonwealth’s formula allocation of Weatherization Assistance Program funding has increased by ten-fold, from $18 million to $186 million, in just one year. This funding will pay for retrofitting for thousands of low-incomes homes to make them more energy efficient while lowering utility bills.“This is a commonsense program that makes homes safer, healthier and more energy efficient—all while slashing families’ energy bills,” said Senator Casey. “Thanks to the infrastructure law, Pennsylvania’s formula funding is increasing ten-fold in just one year. With this funding, we’re going to help more families than ever before, particularly those who live in communities that are disproportionately impacted by high energy costs. This is another example how the Biden Administration is working to lower costs for families and ease the burden on our planet.” The Department of Energy will provide funding across the country, after which states work with local agencies, including non-profits and local governments, to deliver services. Low-income households typically spend almost 14 percent of total annual income versus 3 percent for other households on energy costs. With this funding, states can provide modifications like installing insulation, updating heating and cooling systems and upgrading electrical appliances to contribute to less energy usage and cheaper energy bills. The Weatherization Assistance Program has served over seven million households since 1976 and has delivered an average of $372 in annual energy savings for American families."
https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-colleagues-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-clean-up-water-pollution-from-abandoned-mines,"Across PA, 1.4 million people live within one mile of an abandoned mine siteWashington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA) and Mike Braun (R-IN) introduced the Safeguarding Treatment for the Restoration of Ecosystems from Abandoned Mines (STREAM) Act (S. 3957) with U.S. Representatives Matt Cartwright (D-PA-8) and David McKinley (R-WV-1). Acid mine drainage (AMD)—the release of highly acidic water from abandoned mines— is one of the largest sources of water pollution throughout the country and threatens the health and safety of Americans living near abandoned mine lands. This legislation would allow states and tribes to set aside a portion of the abandoned mine land funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Job Act to treat AMD specifically, reducing long-term water pollution and investing in the economic health of their communities.“Thanks to the infrastructure law, historic coal-mining regions will receive billions to reclaim abandoned mine lands. Still, addressing acid mine drainage remains out of reach for many states, representing a significant financial burden due to the high, ongoing costs associated with operating and maintaining AMD treatment facilities. Without the certainty that funding will be available to cover these long-term costs, states will be unlikely to make the necessary investments to restore our vital waterways. This legislation will provide financial certainty for states, enabling them to clean up water pollution and in doing so, improve property values, restore fishing and recreation opportunities, create long-term jobs and support local economies that rely on a clean water supply. I will work to get this legislation passed to ensure Pennsylvania families have access to clean water—a right that is guaranteed by the Pennsylvania Constitution,” said Senator Casey.“Indiana is one of the top coal producing states so it’s important that abandoned mine lands are reclaimed to their full potential and that safety and environmental hazards are addressed. I am introducing the STREAM Act with Sen. Casey so states can continue to build and maintain AMD treatment systems for polluted water,” said Sen. Mike Braun.“Orange-colored acid mine drainage kills fish and other wildlife in thousands of miles of streams and rivers in Pennsylvania,” said Congressman Matt Cartwright. “The legislation Senator Casey and I are proposing will allow us to tap into billions of dollars in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to operate and maintain drainage treatment systems.  The result will be recreational and economic restoration of our waterways.”“Acid mine drainage from abandoned mines has contaminated creeks and rivers across West Virginia, and remediation can require ongoing treatment of that impaired water to ensure the long-term protection and restoration. This bill provides States with the flexibility to set aside AML funding specifically for long-term water treatment so that West Virginia can take full advantage of the funding from the hard infrastructure bill,” said Rep. McKinley.The Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Program, the primary funding source to address AML sites, authorizes states to set aside up to 30 percent of their annual AML grant to accrue interest and cover the long-term costs of acid mine drainage treatment facilities. The infrastructure law provides an additional $11.3 billion for the AML trust fund for use by states. However, the infrastructure law does not allow the same kind of set-aside provision for AMD treatment as the AML Reclamation Program. Without this authority to set aside a portion of the additional funding, states will not be able to access the resources they need to mitigate the damage from acid mine drainage.The STREAM Act would authorize states to set aside up to 30 percent of their annual AML grant from the infrastructure law into an account for treatment of acid mine drainage and require annual reporting on the use and amount of funds set aside for acid mine drainage abatement.Read more about the STREAM Act here."

Once construction is complete, large cargo ships will be able to move through the Emsworth Lock and Dam system more reliably and efficiently, relieving landside congestion and facilitating timely delivery of goods. The funding is in addition to the $857 million for the Montgomery Lock and Dam announced in January 2022.“Southwestern Pennsylvania’s inland waterways play a vital role in moving commerce, creating and sustaining jobs and spurring economic growth throughout the region,” said Senator Casey. “Thanks to the infrastructure law, the Army Corps of Engineers will be able to begin construction on two vital lock and dam systems on the Upper Ohio river. This investment will help strengthen our domestic supply chain and ensure that shippers can reliably deliver and take cargo from Pittsburgh to the rest of the world.”"
https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-statement-on-president-bidens-fy-2023-budget,"Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) released the following statement today on President Biden’s FY 2023 budget:“President Biden’s budget demonstrates his clear commitment to children, families, seniors, veterans and workers. Since the start of his Administration, President Biden and Democrats in Congress have put cash in people’s pockets, lifted millions of children out of poverty and created 7.4 million new jobs. This budget builds on that progress by lowering costs for families while lowering the deficit by ensuring billionaires pay their fair share.“The President’s budget includes vital funding to strengthen the Nation’s supply chains, which would help ease the pressures on families’ budgets, grow the economy and create jobs. The budget also invests in clean energy and addresses the climate crisis, building on the historic investments made possible by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Additionally, President Biden has included a 20 percent increase in funding for veterans, paying back what is due to those who have risked their lives for the country.“The last two years were incredibly difficult for many; not only for those on the front lines of the pandemic, but also the countless number of people forced into isolation. President Biden recognized this unspoken crisis by investing in funding to support Americans struggling with mental illness and substance abuse, which were exacerbated by the pandemic. These reforms, as well as the $82 billion for the Department of Health and Human Services to prepare for pandemics, will be crucial to help Americans recover and prevent future public health crises.“This budget is a strong reflection of President Biden’s values and I will work with my colleagues to make it a reality and deliver for working families across Pennsylvania and the Nation.""President Biden’s budget includes a number of Senator Casey’s priorities, including increased funding for special education and students with disabilities and doubling funding for Title I schools, which primarily service low-income communities. The President’s budget increases funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), an effort Senator Casey leads in the Senate every year. Pennsylvania researchers successfully compete for over $2.5 billion in grants and other funding from the NIH each year—advancing scientific knowledge and human health while supporting jobs across the Commonwealth. The President’s budget also invests in programs for seniors and people with disabilities, including public transportation for older Pennsylvanians, nursing home oversight, modernization of senior centers and increased access to technology. President Biden’s budget also makes investments in affordable housing as well as rural communities, including funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission and high-speed internet for rural communities.The President’s budget also recommends making the Adoption Tax Credit fully refundable, as proposed by Senator Casey in his Adoption Tax Credit Refundability Act, which would ease the burdens that come along with adoption for low-income families."

In their letter, they cited a lack of quality data and data sharing as barriers that can hinder vaccination rates, creating an inability to assess trends and conduct outreach to people who have not yet been vaccinated.“The American Rescue Plan Act guaranteed Medicaid beneficiaries’ access to COVID-19 vaccinations without out-of-pocket costs. As Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging and Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, we want to ensure every effort is made to ease vaccine access to these beneficiaries,” the Senators wrote. “Therefore, we request that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conduct a study exploring factors contributing to lower COVID-19 vaccination rates for Medicaid enrollees versus the general public and identify barriers limiting state Medicaid programs’ access to state immunization registries.” In their letter, the Senators emphasized the need for this study due to Medicaid’s importance for communities of color and low-wage workers. People of color are more likely to rely on Medicaid for health insurance and are also disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Further, one study estimated 5 million front-line workers are enrolled in Medicaid, meaning essential workers at  higher risk of exposure are less likely to be immunized. The Senators requested that GAO identify how states have used data to improve vaccination rates among these core groups. In addition, to the extent that states have invested time and money in overcoming data barriers to track COVID-19 vaccinations, Senators Casey and Wyden are seeking to ensure that those new systems endure. The Senators noted that these investments in better data sharing have the potential to help states address other public health concerns, prioritize health equity, lower health costs and prepare for future pandemics. March 25, 2022The Honorable Eugene L. DodaroComptroller GeneralUnited States Government Accountability Office441 G St. NWWashington, D.C. 20548Dear Mr. Dodaro:We write regarding concerns that COVID-19 vaccination rates among Medicaid beneficiaries remain lower than rates for the general population. Recent reports have identified administrative and technological barriers that block or limit access to data that would help Medicaid programs identify and reach out to individuals who remain unvaccinated against this terrible disease. We are concerned that these data barriers may be impeding efforts to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates and address persistent health inequities exacerbated by the pandemic, particularly among communities of color and people with limited incomes who have been disproportionately affected by this disease.The American Rescue Plan Act guaranteed Medicaid beneficiaries’ access to COVID-19 vaccinations without out-of-pocket costs.[1] As Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging and Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, we want to ensure every effort is made to ease vaccine access to these beneficiaries. Therefore, we request that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conduct a study exploring factors contributing to lower COVID-19 vaccination rates for Medicaid enrollees versus the general public, and identify barriers limiting state Medicaid programs’ access to state immunization registries. In so doing, GAO should seek to review how these issues—including health inequities experienced by communities of color and low-wage workers who disproportionately receive Medicaid coverage—may contribute to low vaccination rates among Medicaid beneficiaries. Recent press reports have highlighted how Medicaid enrollees continue to be vaccinated for COVID-19 at significantly lower rates than the general population—even in states with high overall vaccination rates. For example, an article published by Kaiser Health News in August noted that 49 percent of California’s Medicaid enrollees ages 12 and over were at least partly vaccinated for COVD-19 compared with 74 percent for Californians overall. The article also noted significant disparities in other states, including a 33 percentage point difference in vaccination rates between Medicaid enrollees and the general population in both Florida and Louisiana.[2] Similarly, in October, Roll Call reported disparities in several states, including Idaho (reporting a 40 percentage point difference in COVID-19 vaccination rates among Medicaid beneficiaries and the general population), Virginia (34 percentage points) and West Virginia (28 percentage points).[3] Furthermore, a December report by Duke University researchers noted a 15-20 percent difference nationally between Medicaid beneficiaries and people enrolled with other forms of health coverage.[4] These variations have been attributed to a variety of factors, including economic barriers, such as a lack of access to transportation, child care and sick leave. Surveys also indicate lower-income Americans report higher rates of vaccine hesitancy overall.[5] Most recently, Kaiser Health News reported last month that Medicaid vaccination rates across the Nation remain “far lower… than the general population despite vigorous outreach efforts by government officials and private organizations to get low-income people inoculated.”[6]In addition, administrative and technological barriers at the state level may undermine state Medicaid programs’ efforts to identify which enrollees are vaccinated and which are not, limiting the ability of these programs to assess trends, conduct outreach and increase vaccination rates.[7] These barriers may include insufficient data-sharing across state Medicaid programs and other programs, including Immunization Information Systems (IIS), confidential databases that record when an individual has received a dose of vaccine.[8] Instances in which Medicaid programs have been granted timely access to these systems have been particularly helpful during the pandemic because of the widespread use of mass vaccination sites, many of which have not collected insurance information. This type of data sharing can be impeded by legal, regulatory and technological barriers, partly due to silos that often separate Medicaid programs from IIS and other data systems within states.[9] Effective data sharing may also be hampered by outdated or incompatible technology, lack of geographic specificity[10] and limited or irregular access to data. As a result, we understand that a number of state Medicaid programs may not have full access to vaccination data of beneficiaries. Further, to the extent states have overcome data barriers, we want to ensure the time and money spent standing up these systems endure, given the clear benefits of improving public health, prioritizing health equity, lowering costs for Medicaid and being better prepared for future pandemics.The lack of data can hinder a state’s ability to assess and address health disparities that contribute to low vaccination rates among Medicaid beneficiaries. For example, in a report seeking to advance the use of data to address health equity shortfalls, Grantmakers in Health found that implementation of IIS vary “from system to system, with major implications for completeness and quality,” and that “race and ethnicity data were available for only 62%” of COVID-19 vaccine recipients as of October 2021.[11] As recently as March 2022, race or ethnicity data remained unavailable for 26 percent of individuals who had received at least one dose of a vaccine for COVID-19.[12] Duke University’s researchers stated that good data is necessary to “monitor progress, identify disparities, and facilitate outreach” to address vaccination disparities that persist across the Medicaid program.[13] A lack of good data hurts our ability to get shots in arms, which can prolong the pandemic and put high risk groups in even greater danger.Barriers to vaccinating Medicaid enrollees are particularly troubling given the program’s importance for persons of color and low-wage workers. According to one analysis, an estimated 5 million front-line workers are enrolled in Medicaid, making that program a “crucial source of coverage” for individuals who have risked exposure to COVID-19 in order to maintain our Nation’s economy, including the health care system and other critical services.[14] Meanwhile, the Kaiser Family Foundation details a higher level of Medicaid enrollment among Black people (33 percent), Hispanics (30 percent) and American Indian/Alaskan Natives (34 percent) compared to the general population (21 percent).[15] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has similarly noted that persons of color are disproportionately represented among COVID-19 cases.[16] Addressing the disparity in vaccination status for Medicaid enrollees and ensuring greater data sharing among different programs is therefore vital for protecting essential workers and for addressing health equity concerns related to the pandemic.In order to better understand the issues that contribute to persistent disparities in COVID-19 vaccination rates among Medicaid beneficiaries and the data barriers interfering with the ability of Medicaid programs to improve outreach and address existing health inequalities, we request the GAO to conduct a study that addresses the following questions:Thank you for your attention to this important matter. If you or your staff need additional information, please contact Doug Hartman with the Aging Committee staff and Melissa Dickerson with the Senate Finance Committee."

In March of 1968, just days before he was killed, he said the following, ‘We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice.’ Through all of his activism and his tireless dedication to fighting both legal and systemic racism, he forever changed America. The Civil Rights Act. The Voting Rights Act. A paradigm shift in public consciousness on racial equality. None of this would have been possible without Dr. King’s sacrifices for a more just society. “So today and every day, we celebrate his legacy, but we must also recognize that he was a man committed to action. This moment must be a time of action. In 2021, we’ve seen an avalanche of voter suppression legislation all across the Nation in state after state. These bills are aimed at denying Black Americans, young people, people with disabilities and so many other Americans their right to vote. Make no mistake about it, this will make it harder for all Americans to have a voice in their government. Our entire democracy is at stake.“At this moment, I’m working in the Senate to restore the Voting Rights Act and enact basic protections for voting rights at the federal level through the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. We have work to do, but we know what we’re up against and we know that we must act now. That’s why I also believe we must amend the Senate rules so that no partisan minority can deprive millions of Americans of their fundamental right to vote. So as we honor Dr. King on this solemn day, I am determined to pass comprehensive voting rights legislation and to advance the cause of justice.”"

Studies have demonstrated that community health workers can identify and address the specific health needs of their communities, promote healthy behavior and reduce hospitalization. The Building a Sustainable Workforce for Healthy Communities Act would reauthorize a competitive grant program to support state and local governments, tribal organizations and community-based organizations in expanding community health worker programs.“Investing in the health care workforce has never been so vital,” said Senator Casey. “The pandemic highlighted inequities in health care that long preceded it and exacerbated the public health and economic crises we are currently experiencing. Community health workers are uniquely suited to understanding the needs of a community and reducing health risks. By investing in our health care workforce, we can put the country on the road to economic recovery.”“With the current labor shortages facing our communities, we must continue to invest in the future of our health care workforce,” said Senator Tillis. “Our communities need more support, proper resources, and access to necessary health care. I am proud to introduce this commonsense legislation that will do just that, ensuring we are recruiting, training, and retaining qualified frontline health care professionals.”“Community health workers play a vital role promoting health in their communities,” said Senator Smith. “This bill will help empower community health workers to promote optimal health outcomes for populations in medically underserved communities, taking an important step forward in advancing health equity and closing health disparities.”“Community health workers serve an important role, particularly in areas with shortages of health providers. They are patient advocates—providing care, education, resources, follow-up, and so much more,” said Senator Murkowski. “As we continue to grapple with COVID-19 and health care provider shortages, this grant program would help communities ensure community health worker services are able to continue and expand.”Grant funding would be used to recruit and train community health workers who understand the needs of the community and support outreach to underserved communities and those requiring additional assistance during a public health emergency. These health care workers would promote positive health behaviors and improve access to services supporting physical and mental health, such as childcare, housing, education, nutrition and employment.Read more about the Building a Sustainable Workforce for Healthy Communities Act here."

Pennsylvania will continue to receive additional bridge funding for four additional years as well as be able to compete for billions in additional funding dedicated to bridge and highway infrastructure. Over the next five years, Pennsylvania is expected to receive a total of $1.6 billion for bridges in formula funding alone. Pennsylvania has 3,353 bridges in poor condition, making Pennsylvania the state with the second highest number of bridges in poor condition in the country.“For a long time, Pennsylvanians have had to make do with driving over thousands of bridges in poor condition. Now, I am proud to say that this year alone, hundreds of millions of dollars will go towards repairing and upgrading those bridges, which are so vital to the Commonwealth. This investment will better connect communities, stimulate job growth across Pennsylvania and make commutes to work and school much safer. Thanks to the Infrastructure Law, we can expect billions of dollars more that will strengthen our communities and our economy,” said Senator Casey.The Bridge Formula Program (BFP), as established in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, is the largest bridge formula program in American history – dedicating $26.5 billion to states over the five years of the law and $825 million for Tribal transportation facilities."
https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-statement-on-january-6-anniversary,"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) is releasing a statement on the anniversary of the January 6, 2021 insurrection:“January 6, 2021 was one of the darkest days in our Nation’s history. After months of lying about the election and stoking baseless conspiracy theories, the former President encouraged a mob of thousands of armed insurrectionists to attack the United States Capitol in order to overturn the results of a free and fair election and keep himself in power. He even turned them against his own Vice President, such that they chanted ‘Hang Mike Pence’ in the halls of Congress. The former President’s incitement of violent extremists led to at least five deaths and injuries to nearly 140 members of law enforcement. Countless more continue to carry emotional scars from that day. Even after the violent attack, a group of Republicans in the House and the Senate continued to perpetuate the Big Lie by voting to overturn the will of Pennsylvanians later that evening.“Instead of accountability and remorse, members of the Republican Party continue to undermine our elections and our democratic principles. Republican officials across the country have embraced the former President’s Big Lie by introducing and enacting an unprecedented number of voter suppression measures and politicizing nonpartisan election administration functions. If we do not restore and strengthen voter protections nationwide, a future authoritarian could succeed where the former President and his insurrectionists failed. To live up to our national ideals and fortify our elections against partisan subversion, the Senate has an obligation to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, two commonsense bills which would improve access to the ballot, protect our democracy and restore the full strength of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.“The strength of our republic was tested one year ago, and it remains under attack. In order to preserve our democracy, we must protect our elections and ensure all Americans have a voice in their government.”"

First Focus, a national bipartisan children’s advocacy organization, grants this award to the top 120 members of Congress who work to represent children in legislation. This is the 10th year Senator Casey has earned the distinction.“As Americans, it is our solemn obligation to help families ensure every child has the support and freedom they need to reach their full potential. I am grateful to receive this honor from First Focus, a strong advocate for the needs of American children and families. I will continue to fight to advance legislation that will help our Nation’s young people grow and learn so that we may fulfill the promise of opportunity for every child,” said Senator Casey.As the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Children and Families, Senator Casey is at the forefront of children’s advocacy in Congress. In 2020, he announced a detailed legislative proposal to give children a fair shot to achieve the future they deserve, the Five Freedoms for America’s Children. This plan identifies five basic freedoms that our society must guarantee to our Nation's children, and recommends policy changes to ensure those freedoms for all children: the freedom to be healthy, the freedom to be economically secure, the freedom to learn, the freedom to be safe from harm and the freedom from hunger. Senator Casey also introduced the Child Poverty Reduction Act of 2020, which would set a national goal of reducing child poverty by half in 10 years, and the Scarlett’s Sunshine on Sudden Unexpected Death Act, which was enacted to strengthen efforts to investigate and collect information when a young infant or child dies."

This funding will support the continuation of the Upper Ohio Navigation Project, which involves the construction of new navigational locks at the Emsworth, Dashields, and Montgomery (EDM) locks and dams on the Ohio River. These structures sit downstream from the Port of Pittsburgh and the poor condition of the EDM locks frequently causes costly interruptions to shipping traffic, hurting regional businesses and putting family-sustaining jobs at risk.“The construction of the Upper Ohio Navigation Project is essential for the continued viability of our inland waterway system and Pennsylvania’s economic revitalization,” said Senator Casey. “I am pleased that this funding has been allocated to the region and I will continue to fight for the infrastructure needs of Western Pennsylvania and the Commonwealth.”The Port of Pittsburgh handles more than 35 million tons of cargo each year, including significant quantities of petroleum products, processed metal, grain, construction equipment, chemicals and coal. In May 2020, Senator Casey advocated in appropriations requests for funding for additional preconstruction and design that must be performed before project construction can begin. Senator Casey has been advocating for the Upper Ohio Navigation Project since 2007, when he pushed for a study of it."

While shocking, yesterday’s events were entirely foreseeable. They were the direct result of President Trump’s lies about the integrity of our most recent election, and his frequent incitements to violence. For weeks, the President has lied about his decisive defeat, promoting wild conspiracy theories about unsubstantiated fraud and encouraging this insurrection. But he didn’t do it alone. President Trump was aided and abetted every step of the way by a multitude of Republicans in both the House and Senate who, after four years of enabling his authoritarian tendencies, yesterday sought to invalidate the will of the very people they serve. These members of Congress, along with President Trump, are responsible for this direct assault on our democracy and on our Nation’s Capitol Building. Their collective actions and words put lives at risk, and struck at the heart of our most fundamental democratic principles.President Trump is a threat to our domestic and national security. It is self-evident that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. I call on Vice President Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and begin the process of removing the powers of the presidency from Donald Trump.

https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-evans-push-to-support-victims-of-gun-violence-,"Legislation Would Help Victims Of Gun Violence Identify And Access Resources To Meet Their Needs Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) and U.S. Representative Dwight Evans (D-PA-03) are introducing the Resources for Victims of Gun Violence Act. This legislation would establish an interagency Advisory Council to gather and disseminate information about the resources, programs and benefits that can help victims of gun violence—including survivors and the families, classmates, coworkers and other associates of individuals affected by gun violence. More than 100 Americans die from gun violence each day and over 230 more are wounded.“We can’t stop pushing for the common-sense measures that will help prevent gun violence from happening,” said Senator Casey. “But we must also acknowledge the reality of this public health epidemic and make sure that survivors, families, friends and caregivers have the support they need to recover from gun violence and manage their longer-term needs. This bill would connect gun violence victims with the resources, programs and benefits that can help them. Gun violence is a uniquely American problem and we must address the millions of Americans who have been affected by this issue and have struggled for too long.”Congressman Evans said, “I have voted for and continue to support passing legislation to reduce gun violence, like universal background checks for gun buyers and closing the Charleston loophole. We must also help the victims and survivors— often they don’t know where to turn or what resources are available to them, which is why Senator Casey and I are reintroducing the Resources for Victims of Gun Violence Act.”“Gun violence destroys lives,” said Aleida Garcia, based in Philadelphia, whose son, Alejandro Rojas Garcia, was shot and killed on January 24, 2015. “Often survivors of gun violence don't know where to turn for support. Senator Casey's bill would provide a bridge to resources for survivors, grieving families and communities on their long journey of healing.”58 percent of American adults, including 68 percent of Black and Hispanic Americans, are survivors of gun violence, either experiencing gun violence themselves or caring for someone who has experienced gun violence in their lives. Victims of gun violence experience persistent mental health problems, including post-traumatic stress, depression, self-harm, anxiety and substance abuse. Further, this public health epidemic has only increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, with surging gun sales putting children, victims of domestic abuse and communities of color at an even greater risk of gun violence.U.S. Senators Ed Markey (D-MA), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Tina Smith (D-MN), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) cosponsored the legislation.

https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-cortez-masto-and-rep-susie-lee-introduce-bill-to-support-state-medicaid-programs-during-an-economic-crisis_,"Bill Would Increase Medicaid Funding for Americans Experiencing Unemployment Due to COVID-19Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) and U.S. Representative Susie Lee (D-NV-03) are introducing the Coronavirus Medicaid Response Act. This legislation would respond to the increased need for health care during the public health and economic crisis by creating a quicker and more responsive process for supporting state Medicaid programs. It would address fluctuating demand in states for Medicaid by automatically connecting the Medicaid Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) to state unemployment levels, so that additional federal aid would ebb and flow with a state’s economy.“For more than 50 years, the Medicaid program has played a vital role in providing health coverage to low-income Americans and serving as a safety net for those who lose health insurance due to job loss. Due to the economic crisis caused by COVID-19, millions of Americans who are unemployed are turning to Medicaid for health care coverage—placing more pressure on already strained state budgets,” said Senator Casey. “The Coronavirus Medicaid Response Act would guarantee an increase in federal Medicaid funding during an economic downturn, giving states reliability when planning their budgets and protecting health coverage for people with Medicaid during difficult times.”“Many Nevadans who are still out of work as a result of the coronavirus pandemic are relying on Medicaid to keep them and their families covered,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “We need to be doing everything we can to support this vital program, and an important step is to ensure that states in crisis can automatically access Medicaid resources and funding without delays or political maneuvering. Medicaid provides a lifeline for so many in Nevada, and I’m proud to cosponsor this bill to improve its responsiveness during challenging times.”“With unemployment levels through the roof at a time when families need health care the most, we must ensure that we’re adequately funding Medicaid,” said Rep. Lee. “When it comes to funding a vital service like Medicaid, we can’t start from scratch each time a crisis hits. We need to be prepared. This bill will create a quicker and more responsive process for supporting state Medicaid programs by automatically connecting Medicaid funding to state unemployment levels, so that federal aid would ebb and flow with a state’s economy. This is especially critical for states like Nevada, where our economy has been ravaged by the pandemic.”“Medicaid is the backbone of the American health care system, covering one in five people and allowing millions to receive long-term care, mental health services, substance abuse treatment and much more,” said AFSCME President Lee Saunders. “But when the nation faces a joint health and economic crisis like the current one, job and revenue loss causes Medicaid funding to shrivel at exactly the moments when the program is needed most. Sen. Casey’s, Cortez Masto’s and Rep. Lee’s legislation, by automatically triggering increases in federal Medicaid investments any time state unemployment rates rise to a certain level, would help the nation recover from this pandemic and enhance the health security of working families even in the worst of times.”“The Coronavirus Medicaid Response Act is an important piece of legislation that would have the triple benefit of helping to lessen the severity of recessions, improve health coverage and prevent damaging cuts to education and other priorities. It extends a bipartisan approach to expanding federal support for Medicaid in economic downturns that was pursued by President Bush and President Obama and has been supported by economists across the political spectrum, making it a permanent feature of our economic policy going forward,” said Jason Furman, Former Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, Professor of the Practice of Economic Policy at Harvard Kennedy School and the Department of Economics at Harvard University.In order to ensure accuracy, a state’s FMAP increase would be calculated based on Local Area Unemployment Statistics collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and modified based on prospective and retrospective analysis. The Center on Budget on Policy Priorities (CBPP) estimates that if this bill were enacted during a downturn, Pennsylvania would receive approximately $2 billion and Nevada would receive about $215 million in additional Medicaid funding per quarter.The Coronavirus Medicaid Response Act is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D-CO), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Mark Warner (D-VA), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Tina Smith (D-MN), Gary Peters (D-MI), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Jon Tester (D-MT), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Angus King (I-ME) Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and Tom Carper (D-DE).The Coronavirus Medicaid Response Act is cosponsored by U.S. Representatives Steven Horsford (D-NV-04), Juan Vargas (D-CA-51), Raúl M.

https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-klobuchar-blumenthal-rep-schakowsky-introduce-bipartisan-bicameral-bill-to-protect-children-from-falling-furniture-,"Since 2000, More Than 460 Children Have Died from Tip-OversWashington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) introduced the Stop Tip-overs of Unstable, Risky Dressers on Youth (STURDY) Act. The bipartisan, bicameral bill would change the stability standard for manufacturers of clothing storage units from voluntary to mandatory—requiring companies to ensure their products are tested for safety and stability before being sold. According to a recent report by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), tip-overs cause an average of 25,500 emergency room-treated injuries each year as children are crushed, trapped or struck by furniture, TVs and appliances. U.S. Representative Jan Schakowsky (D-IL-09) introduced the House companion to the bill.“Inadequate safety standards and testing for furniture tip-overs puts our Nation’s children in danger of serious injury or even death,” said Senator Casey. “This bill would help protect kids by directing the CPSC to establish a stronger, mandatory stability standard to prevent kids from being injured or killed by tip-overs of chests, dressers and bureaus. Congress must quickly to pass this legislation to help stop the hundreds of preventable injuries and even deaths each year from falling furniture.”“No family should live in fear that their child could be severely injured or even killed by a preventable accident,” said Senator Klobuchar. “Companies must take steps to stabilize their furniture, and the STURDY Act will implement stronger standards across the board to help protect more children from the risks of furniture tip-overs.”“As kids spend more time at home due to the pandemic, unanchored or top-heavy furniture poses a greater than ever risk. The STURDY Act would enact strong furniture stability standards to prevent deadly tip-overs and protect children. The furniture industry has been allowed to self-regulate for too long – and with tragic consequences, as a child is injured by tipped furniture every 17 minutes. As Chair of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, I will continue to work tirelessly to ensure this bill passes Congress so that no more families are forced to grieve the preventable death of their child,” said Senator Blumenthal.“As parents juggle supervising their children while working from home during the ongoing pandemic, families deserve peace of mind that their furniture is safe. Sadly, current voluntary furniture stability standards are inadequate, and unstable furniture continues to be a top hidden household hazard. Every 46 minutes, a child is injured in a tip-over incident. Between 2000 and 2019, tip-over incidents have been linked to more than 460 child fatalities. I'm proud to be reintroducing the STURDY Act with Senator Casey to protect children from these preventable dangers and spare families from these painful situations resulting simply from a piece of furniture,” said Congresswoman Schakowsky.“Every Senator should support the STURDY Act because it’s a straightforward, data-driven, and necessary bill that would save children’s lives. Passing this legislation is the single fastest and most effective way to get strong safety rules in place to prevent furniture tip-over tragedies. Hundreds of children have already died from tip-over incidents; not one more family should suffer the preventable loss of a child from this long-known hidden hazard,” said Gabe Knight, Policy Analyst with Consumer Reports.“Consumers expect that furniture in their home is stable and will not harm them or their children. Unfortunately, too many unstable dressers have posed serious risks to children. The STURDY Act is so important because it requires a strong mandatory rule to ensure the stability of our furniture,” said Rachel Weintraub, Legislative Director and General Counsel of Consumer Federation of America. “The STURDY Act will prevent tragedies and save lives.”“The STURDY Act will save lives by assuring that new dressers will be stable,” said Nancy Cowles, executive director of Kids In Danger (KID). “This legislation is crucial to stop the continuing heartbreak of tip-over deaths. We urge Congress to quickly pass the STURDY Act.”“Passing the STURDY Act is imperative to the safety of young children across the nation. Despite more than 16 years of educating parents and caregivers about the dangers of furniture tip-over and the importance of anchoring furniture, only about 1/4 of Americans actually anchor their furniture. A voluntary standards process for furniture safety that is now 20 years old has not changed the fact that an average of 11 children are rushed to the ER every day when a dresser/clothing storage unit falls on them. The STURDY Act would greatly reduce these statistics and save lives,” said Kimberly Amato, Founding Member of Parents Against Tip-overs, Mom to Meghan.“Senators Casey, Klobuchar, Blumenthal and Congresswoman Schakowsky understand the importance of robust product safety rules that protect our families from potential injury and death. We hope that Congress will quickly pass the STURDY Act,” said Remington A. Gregg, counsel for civil justice and consumer rights at Public Citizen.Product instability that can lead to a tip-over incident can be caused or affected by an unstable dresser design such as small base and top heavy, use on a sloped or unstable surface such as carpet, not using a restraint device or using a defective tip-over restraint device, heavy objects placed on top of a dresser such as a TV, or multiple dresser drawers open simultaneously. The bill also requires rigorous testing measures for furniture and to simulate real-world use and provides warning requirements based on the most up-to-date safety standards.The STURDY Act is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Edward Markey (D-MA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) and Chris Coons (D-DE).

https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-statement-following-senate-trial,"Today, Senator Casey released a statement following the Senate trial of former President Trump:“This past week, the House Managers put forward a compelling case based upon irrefutable facts against the former President of the United States. For months after the election, we all witnessed the former President’s “Big Lie” when he repeatedly claimed—without any evidence—that the 2020 general election was stolen from him. This lie was roundly dismissed by more than 60 judges across the Nation—including in Pennsylvania. After losing in federal and state courts, he then tried to pressure state and local elections officials to overturn the election, and even attempted to pressure his Vice President to violate the Vice President’s Constitutional duty. After repeatedly failing to overturn the election, the former President summoned his mob of insurrectionists to Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021 for one more attack on American democracy. He invited them. He incited them. And he directed them to the Capitol to prevent Congress from conducting its constitutional obligation to count the presidential electoral votes. This case was not merely about the former President’s speech on January 6. This was about a pattern of conduct. It was about the former President’s autocratic leadership and calls for political violence throughout his presidency. It was about a President who regularly condoned or encouraged violence at political rallies against protestors and members of the press. It was about a President who once bragged: “I have the tough people [supporting me], but they don’t play it tough until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad.” There is no way that a reasonable person could dispute that the former President knew exactly what he was doing by perpetuating the “Big Lie,” summoning his crowd of insurrectionists on January 6 and telling them: “[I]f you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” The former President led his supporters to a breaking point and as he had predicted in the past—it was “very bad, very bad.” He did not merely endanger another branch of government and the presidential line of succession. His actions led to at least five deaths, injuries to nearly 140 members of law enforcement and untold collateral damage resulting from the carnage of that day. He endangered the lives of countless Congressional staffers and employees, members of the press and members of Congress. He put a target on the back of his own Vice President and his Vice President’s family. And he has shown no remorse for any of it.  The former President attacked the foundational principles of our democracy and the peaceful transfer of power. He violated his oath of office and he committed a high crime against our Constitution. I voted to convict the former President in the most bipartisan presidential impeachment proceedings in our Nation’s history.”"
https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-murray-and-wyden-introduce-bill-to_reduce-cost-of-child-care-for-middle-class-families--,"Senators: This Policy Will Reduce Child Poverty and Create JobsWashington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Patty Murray (D-WA) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) introduced a bill to expand the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit to help families pay for the costs of child care. The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit Act would also help increase employment rates and the earnings of parents, as well as reduce child poverty. According to the National Women’s Law Center, low income families spend almost one-third of their income on child care. A robust and fully refundable Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit will support working parents, reduce child poverty and could increase net employment by more than 500,000 jobs, according to analysis from the National Academies of Sciences.The COVID-19 pandemic has further illustrated the critical need to help families obtain quality and affordable child care. The Census Bureau and the Federal Reserve found COVID-19 has disrupted child care arrangements for millions of parents; one in five working-age adults cited child care as a reason they were not working, with disproportional impacts falling on women. Access to safe, affordable child care is essential to our economic infrastructure and our Nation’s economic recovery.“In the midst of the economic crisis caused by COVID-19, millions of parents are even more worried about how they are going to pay the rent, put food on the table, keep the heat on or afford the cost of child care,” said Senator Casey. “Expanding the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and making it fully refundable will reduce poverty, create jobs and provide support that will lessen the financial strain that many families are facing. It is critical that we pass this commonsense legislation.”“Families are facing unprecedented struggles in getting quality child care—and this bill will put more money in their pockets so they can afford the child care they need,” said Senator Murray. “I’ll keep fighting to support working families and the child care sector during this crisis, make access to affordable, quality child care a reality for every family, and guarantee livable wages for early educators.”“The COVID-19 pandemic has shined a spotlight on our broken child care system, which has been failing working parents for decades,” said Senator Wyden. “Working parents are on their own and at their breaking points, left to patch together child care arrangement day by day. Our bill would go a long way to giving working parents the resources they need to manage the needs of work and family.”The Child Care and Dependent Credit Enhancement Act would:• Make the full Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit available to most working families: This bill would make the full credit available to families with income under $125,000. The current phase-down of the credit begins at $15,000 of income;• Put more money into a family’s pocket: The bill increases the maximum credit from $1,050 to $4,000 per child (age 0-13), up to $8,000;• Ensure lower income families see a benefit: The bill would make the credit fully refundable to make sure those with the greatest need see a benefit;• Retain the value over time: The bill would index benefits to inflation to ensure they keep up with ever-growing costs; and• The credit fully phases out for incomes above $440,000 a year.In addition to Senators Casey, Murray and Wyden, the following Senators support the bill: Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Jack Reed (D-RI), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Gary Peters (D-MI) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY).Read the bill here."

https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-cassidy-introduce-bipartisan-pregnant-workers-fairness-act-propose-protections-against-workplace-discrimination,"3 out of 4 women entering the workforce will be pregnant and employed at some point in their careersWashington, D.C. – As millions of American women remain in the essential workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Tina Smith (D-MN), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) are introducing the bipartisan Pregnant Workers Fairness Act to protect pregnant workers from workplace discrimination. This legislation, which is closely modeled after the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), would require employers to make reasonable accommodations to allow pregnant workers to continue working safely. It will ensure that employers with 15 or more employees provide reasonable accommodations that are often low-cost or no cost, unless it would pose an undue hardship to the employer. The bill includes protections not already codified in the ADA or the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA).“No one deserves to be shut out of a job due to their pregnancy. Worker health and safety is non-negotiable and we need to make it a priority for everyone,” said Senator Casey. “At a time when women have been forced out of the workforce in unprecedented numbers as a result of the pandemic, this legislation is more important than ever to ensure that we are removing barriers to women’s full and complete participation in the workforce. I urge my colleagues to move this legislation forward so that we can prevent discrimination against the many women in the workforce who are entering motherhood, and ensure that anyone who wants to work can do so safely.”“We need to care for and enable all Americans. This is a double purpose for those pregnant. They contribute to our today and carry our future,” said Dr. Cassidy. “This legislation is therefore, a commitment to our present and our tomorrow as it cares for women who are pregnant and still working.”“Securing equality in the workplace and empowering working families demands meaningful policy change to meet the standards American workers deserve. That’s why I’m glad to join Senator Casey on this legislation to support expectant mothers and their families,” said Senator Shaheen. “The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a critical step forward to end pregnancy discrimination and provide protections for expectant mothers in accessing accommodations at work without fear of retaliation, bias or being unfairly forced out of their jobs. I appreciate the bipartisan determination to move this bill forward and will continue to push lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to join us in this effort.”“Women shouldn’t be at a professional disadvantage or health risk if they become pregnant at some point during their careers,” Senator Capito said. “The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would provide simple, but important accommodations for pregnant women in the workplace that mitigate health risks while keeping their careers on track. West Virginia has been ahead of the game when it comes to this issue, and I’m proud to help introduce this legislation at the federal level to make these commonsense changes for women across the rest of the country.”“Pregnant workers deserve to be treated with dignity and respect in the workplace, and this bill would help ensure they can access reasonable accommodations,” said Senator Smith. “It is a critical step towards truly ending pregnancy discrimination in our workplaces, which threatens women’s economic opportunity and freedom. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is one of the many steps Congress should take to support working families.”“I have heard from many Alaskans about the need to provide for the health of pregnant women. The astonishing truth is that many women are still denied the basic, commonsense accommodations they need at work to ensure a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby. This is not acceptable. No employee should have to choose between keeping a job and their health or the health of their baby—it’s as simple as that. This bill will improve federal law by requiring employers to make reasonable accommodations for expecting and new mothers and ensure that women are not discriminated against simply because of pregnancy or childbirth,” said Senator Murkowski. “I’m proud to promote policies that empower women and support women’s health and the health of their babies.”The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would allow pregnant workers to continue working by ensuring they can have accommodations such as additional bathroom breaks, light duty or a stool to sit on if a worker stands all day. It would prevent them from being forced out on leave or out of their jobs. The bill also prohibits employers from denying employment opportunities to women based on their need for reasonable accommodations due to childbirth or related medical conditions.The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is supported by A Better Balance; American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU); American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO); American Association of University Women (AAUW); American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; Association of Maternal & Child Health Programs; California Women’s Law Center; Equal Rights Advocates; Hadassah; H.R.

https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-ernst-push-to-give-americans-a-clean-slate-seal-records-for-past-low-level-nonviolent-offenses,"The bipartisan, bicameral legislation would remove barriers to employment for millions of Americans, giving folks with past nonviolent and low-level crimes a second chanceWashington, D.C. - During National Reentry Week and “Second Chance” Month, U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) and U.S. House Representatives Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) and Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA-14) are introducing the bipartisan and bicameral Clean Slate Act to give more than 70 million Americans with low-level and nonviolent criminal records a second chance to fully participate in society.The legislation would remove major barriers for many Americans in finding employment, securing housing and accessing education by automatically sealing the federal records of individuals convicted of low-level, nonviolent drug offenses after they successfully complete their sentence.“Automated record sealing is a critical step to help get our economy back on track as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and in the ongoing fight for criminal justice reform. Too many Americans are not given a full and fair second chance because they are burdened by criminal records for nonviolent convictions or arrests that did not result in a conviction,” said Senator Casey. “With nearly half of U.S. children having at least one parent with a criminal record, automatically sealing these records will help us invest in our Nation’s future by ensuring millions of parents with minor criminal histories aren’t prohibited from fully participating in the workforce or finding safe and affordable housing for their families.”“Even after paying their debt to society, oftentimes those who have been charged with low-level, nonviolent misdemeanors face significant barriers to employment, housing, and other necessities. Giving folks a ‘clean slate’ with this bipartisan and bicameral legislation is a commonsense criminal justice reform to offer a second chance to millions, while keeping our communities safe,” said Senator Joni Ernst.“In the digital era, even a minor criminal record can be a life sentence to poverty and joblessness that no judge ever handed down. While most states allow at least some records to be cleared, to allow people to move on with their lives and provide for their families, it’s long past time policymakers brought record-clearing to the federal level. This historic legislation would, for the first time, create a path to clearing federal records by petition, while establishing automatic record-clearance starting with low-level federal drug records—an impactful platform to build on. This legislation could not be more timely or urgently needed, as our nation seeks to recover from the COVID-19 crisis. Workers with records were already facing double-digit unemployment rates pre-pandemic, when the overall unemployment rate was 3 to 4 percent. We’ll never ‘build back better’ if we leave behind 70 million people with criminal records. Removing barriers to employment for workers with records is critical to ensuring a full and equitable recovery,” said Rebecca Vallas, Senior Fellow, Center for American Progress.“People who have paid their debt to society for low-level, nonviolent offenses deserve to be welcomed back into society. This is precisely the goal of the criminal justice system. We want people to pay their debts and amend their lives. Those who do it, should be rewarded and restored—for their good, their families’ good, and in the best interest of our communities and our states. Sealing the records of low-level, nonviolent ex-offenders after they have successfully completed their sentences will help reduce recidivism, strengthen families and communities, and provide a pathway to redemption for people who want to reform their lives,” said Patrick Purtill, Director of Legislative Affairs, Faith and Freedom Coalition.“A criminal record, even for a low-level drug offense, can lead to a lifetime of obstacles, making it hard for people to find meaningful employment and stable housing, to provide for their families and contribute to their communities. The Clean Slate Act would provide a second chance for people who have turned their lives around, and it’s a perfect way to mark Second Chance Month. Criminal justice reform is still an issue where both parties can come together, and we are grateful to Senators Ernst and Casey, and Representatives Blunt Rochester and Reschenthaler, for reaching across the aisle on this critical issue,” said Inimai Chettiar, Justice Action Network, Federal Director.“JPMorgan Chase is committed to giving people with criminal backgrounds a second chance through inclusive hiring and by supporting common sense public policy measures like the Clean Slate Act. Creating a process for clearing low-level nonviolent federal records, and streamlining the process through automation, will help people get their foot in the door, pursue stable career pathways and give back to their communities,” said Heather Higginbottom, President, PolicyCenter, JPMorgan Chase & Co. More than 1 in 3 adults have some form of a criminal record, keeping them from participating in many facets of everyday life as nearly nine in ten employers, four in five landlords and three in five colleges utilize background checks to screen applicants.Currently, the federal government lacks any meaningful way to clear federal criminal records, even for records that might not have resulted in a conviction. The Clean Slate Act aims to address this issue by automatically sealing federal arrest records for individuals not convicted and records for individuals convicted of low-level, nonviolent drug offenses after successfully completing their sentence. It would also establish new procedures to allow individuals to petition a federal district judge to review and potentially seal records for other nonviolent offenses that are not automatically sealed.The Clean Slate Act is endorsed by Americans for Tax Reform, Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, Business Roundtable, Center for American Progress, Code for America, Community Legal Services of Philadelphia, Due Process Institute, Faith and Freedom Coalition, JPMorgan Chase, Justice Action Network, R Street Institute, Responsible Business Initiative and Right on Crime."

https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-introduces-access-to-healthy-food-for-young-children-act,"Washington, D.C. – As the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic increase hunger across the country, the meals provided through child care programs play a significant role in supporting children and families. U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) is introducing the Access to Healthy Food for Young Children Act to make it easier for child care providers to provide nutritious, healthy meals for young children. The bill would improve the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), which serves healthy meals to more than 4.2 million of the Nation’s youngest children in child care centers, day care homes and Head Start.Currently, family child care homes only qualify for area eligibility in areas with 50 percent or more low-income children. The Access to Healthy Food for Young Children Act would reduce the area eligibility test from 50 percent to a 40 percent threshold and open the door for many more children to receive healthy CACFP meals and snacks. It would also allow child care centers and homes the option of serving a fourth meal for children who are in care settings for 8 or more hours.“When children have a healthy start in life, they are better able to learn and grow,” said Senator Casey. “Investing in early childhood nutrition is one of the most important things we can do to invest in the future of our Nation’s leaders and workers, and that is what the Access to Healthy Food for Young Children Act does. This legislation would provide urgently needed nutrition assistance to the many families who are struggling due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as increase CACFP’s effectiveness and ability to provide access to healthy meals and snacks for children in child care.”“We applaud Senator Casey for his efforts to strengthen CACFP. Increasing CACFP participation and the availability of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lower-fat dairy products, and healthy beverages for young children in child care will support their growth and health. This bill would help millions of children in child care access nutritious food,” said Luis Guardia, President, Food Research & Action Center.“We are enormously grateful to Senator Casey for his commitment to CACFP and for his introduction of this bill, which brings long overdue and needed attention to this often overlooked Child Nutrition Program. Through its emphasis on reducing administrative burden, improving access and enhancing nutrition, the bill will greatly impact the healthy development of our country’s youngest and most vulnerable children,” said Robert S.

The legislation would designate the new United States Courthouse in Harrisburg as the “Sylvia H. Rambo United States Courthouse.” The courthouse is expected to open in 2022.Since her tenure as chief judge, Judge Rambo has advocated tirelessly for the planning, construction and funding of the new federal courthouse building in Harrisburg. In June 2018, after Senators Casey and Toomey helped to secure funding for the project, construction on the new courthouse began.“Judge Rambo’s trailblazing career serves as an ongoing inspiration to countless young women across the Commonwealth, the Third Circuit and the entire Nation. Her dedication to the judiciary is unparalleled, and there is no better way to honor her service to our Nation than by naming the new federal courthouse in Harrisburg after her,” said Senator Casey.“As the first woman to serve on both the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas for Cumberland County and on the bench of the Middle District of Pennsylvania, Judge Rambo is a trailblazer,” said Senator Toomey. “During her time on the bench, Judge Rambo has served Pennsylvania with great integrity and distinction. I am proud to introduce this legislation honoring a Pennsylvania public servant with Senator Casey.”Companion legislation was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by U.S. Representative Scott Perry (R-PA-10) and cosponsored by Representatives Susan Wild (D-PA-7), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA-1), Matt Cartwright (D-PA-8), Fred Keller (R-PA-12) and Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA-14).

Previously, she served on the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County from 1976-1978. Judge Rambo received her B.A. from Dickinson College and her J.D. from the Dickinson School of Law."
https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-schumer-murray-brown-rep-lamb-introduce-legislation-to-restore-tax-deduction-for-union-dues,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Patty Murray (D-WA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and colleagues are introducing the Tax Fairness for Workers Act, legislation that would make the tax deduction for union dues above-the-line (available for everyone, even if they don’t itemize deductions) and reinstate the tax deduction for unreimbursed employee expenses. U.S. Representative Conor Lamb (D-PA-17) has introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives.The Center for American Progress highlighted Senator Casey’s and Representative Lamb’s proposal in their report on the top 3 pro-labor tax provisions for the Biden Administration to consider. Stating “The pre-TCJA tax code allowed workers to deduct unreimbursed business expenses, such as union dues and business travel costs, subject to certain limits explained below. However, the TCJA eliminated the deduction for unreimbursed employee expenses. As a result, workers and their unions are now entirely excluded from standard tax benefits, even as those benefits are still being extended to corporations.”“Unions are the backbone of the middle class, supporting workers, wage growth and fair economic conditions. In 2017, Republicans eliminated tax deductions for workers and instead gave massive tax cuts for large, profitable corporations,” said Senator Casey. “This legislation would put money back in the pockets of working families by reinstating deductions for union dues and other unreimbursed employee expenses.”“As our economy recovers from the pandemic it is critical we ensure all Americans can provide for their families. This commonsense bill ensures that our tax code treats workers and union members fairly,” said Congressman Conor Lamb (PA-17).  “Congress must do everything we can to provide the resources and tools that will benefit everyone – not just big corporations – in an effort to move us forward and improve the lives of all working Pennsylvanians.”“Our tax system must support workers and their families, not just corporations and the ultra-rich. Unfortunately, the Trump tax plan stripped workers of a long-standing deduction that helped ensure balance,” said USW International President Tom Conway. “The Tax Fairness for Workers Act reinstates this deduction for union dues, recognizing the need for both collective bargaining and tax benefits for working people.”“Restoring tax deductions for unreimbursed employee expenses and union dues is an important step towards undoing the damage that President Trump and Republicans in Congress did when they passed legislation that gave massive tax cuts to corporations while eliminating provisions that help working families. CWA strongly supports the Tax Fairness for Workers Act and other measures that put working people first and ensure that our tax code supports workers seeking to organize and have a voice on the job,” said Chris Shelton, President of the Communications Workers of America (CWA).“Sen. Casey’s Tax Fairness for Workers Act restores a fair tax code that does not penalize working families for job related expenses. The 2017 tax overhaul The 2017 tax bill eliminated the deduction for unreimbursed expenses workers experience as part of their job. Whether it's travel expenses, uniform and equipment out of pocket expenses or union dues, working families now shoulder this burden while the multinational corporations they work for in many cases pay no taxes through elaborate tax shelters. All we ask is that working families not be penalized for expenses related to their jobs,” said UAW President Rory L.

Junk plans, which can include short-term, limited duration health plans, excepted benefit plans and health sharing ministries, are sold outside of the ACA’s critical consumer protections. As a result, they may leave individuals and families susceptible to exorbitant out-of-pocket health care costs.""Congress must ensure consumers are not being deceived by false advertisements and purchasing junk plans that don't meet their needs,"" said Senator Casey. ""No one should find out that the health insurance they paid their hard-earned money for doesn’t cover them when they need it most.""“The Trump administration expanded junk insurance plans that can deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and don’t have to cover essential services like maternity care, prescription drugs, substance use disorders and emergency room care. It’s time to turn the page,” said Senator Baldwin. “With nearly 30 million Americans diagnosed with COVID-19, we should be working during this pandemic, and after, to expand quality, affordable health care that provides all of the essential benefits of the Affordable Care Act. Junk insurance plans don’t provide guaranteed protections and we need to take action to protect consumers so they don’t get stuck paying thousands of dollars out of pocket when they need health care.”“When someone purchases health insurance coverage, they need to know that their plan will cover them when they need it. Unfortunately, many people have been deceived by online advertising and claims by unscrupulous brokers and agents selling health insurance without the protections of the Affordable Care Act. These ‘junk plans’ are misleading and many times don’t protect people with pre-existing conditions. This bill cracks down on deceptive advertisements and helps ensure American consumers know what type of coverage they are buying,” said Senator Stabenow.In October 2019, Senator Casey released an investigative report about the consumer experience of shopping online for health insurance. The report found that misleading advertisements found on online search engines were diverting individuals to websites that sell junk plans. A follow up, secret shopper investigation from the Government Accountability Office proved that some brokers and agents are enrolling consumers in junk plans by lying about what those plans cover. During their time in office, the Trump Administration took several steps to drive consumers away from comprehensive coverage on the ACA marketplaces and expand enrollment in junk insurance. For example, they slashed funding for outreach and enrollment efforts for ACA plans, and they allowed extended enrollment in short-term, limited duration plans.The Junk Plan Accountability and Disclosure Act would take the following steps to protect consumers:To avoid junk plans and enroll in comprehensive coverage, consumers should take care to enroll in health insurance plans only through an Affordable Care Act marketplace, such as www.pennie.com in Pennsylvania or www.healthcare.gov in states that use the federal website. Recently, President Biden opened a special enrollment period to give consumers extra time to enroll in comprehensive coverage. Pennsylvania has implemented a similar special enrollment period for Pennie, meaning that consumers can enroll in comprehensive coverage until August 15. Recent changes through the American Rescue Plan mean that consumers may receive a larger monthly subsidy for their ACA plan and see lower premiums than in the past.The Junk Plan Accountability and Disclosure Act has been endorsed by a wide range of health care and patient advocacy groups, including Susan G.

The Expanded Coverage for Former Foster Youth Act (S. 709) and the Dosha Joi Immediate Coverage for Former Foster Youth Act (S. 712) would ensure all former foster youth can enroll in Medicaid until age 26. Although the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extended Medicaid coverage until age 26 for former foster youth, there are loopholes that prevent many former foster youth from accessing this coverage. U.S. Representative Karen Bass (D-CA-37) introduced the House companion to both bills.“Many former foster youth have physical, dental and behavioral health care needs that are well beyond those of the general population. While Medicaid provides critical health care coverage for children and youth in foster care, their health needs do not end when they age out of the system at 18,” said Senator Casey. “Congress has an obligation to ensure young adults who have aged out of the foster care system have the same guarantee of health insurance as those who can stay on their parent’s plan until age 26. These bills would help eliminate the challenges that many former foster youth face in accessing Medicaid coverage until age 26. We must do everything we can to support young adults, who have nowhere else to turn, so that they have the opportunity to thrive in adulthood.”“Today marks one year since the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic,” said Representative Karen Bass. “Around that time, it was common to hear that covid-19 would be a great equalizer. The thought was that no one had ever been exposed to the disease before, so everyone was vulnerable. But data gathered over the past year has revealed that to be untrue. One of our most vulnerable populations, young people in the child welfare system, have been impacted disproportionately by this pandemic. These two bills today that I’ve introduced with Senator Casey today help ensure that health care coverage available to most young people in this country are available to young people who are in the child welfare system or have already aged out. I urge my colleagues to join me in standing up for the hundreds of thousands of young people and pass these bills.”The Expanded Coverage for Former Foster Youth Act (S. 709) would strengthen Medicaid coverage to age 26 by extending it to categories of former foster youth who are not currently eligible. For example, it would remove a requirement that former foster youth must have been enrolled in Medicaid while they were in the system in order to qualify for coverage to 26 years old. It would also expand eligibility for Medicaid coverage to 26 to former foster youth who were in the system, but left for a legal guardianship with a kinship caregiver, and those who emancipated from foster care prior to turning 18.The Dosha Joi Immediate Coverage for Former Foster Youth Act (S. 712) addresses the ACA’s ‘foster youth glitch’. The foster youth glitch allows each state to choose whether or not they offer Medicaid to 26 coverage to former foster youth who aged out of the foster care system in a different state. Language based on Senator Casey’s bill, the Health Insurance for Former Foster Youth Act, created a fix for the foster youth glitch when it passed in 2018. Unfortunately, Congress chose to delay implementation of that fix until January 1, 2023. Until that time, states can still choose not to cover former foster youth who age out in another state, and many former foster youth will continue to go without access to critical health care services. For that reason, this bill would immediately implement the fix for the foster youth glitch, ensuring that Medicaid to age 26 coverage is available for all former foster youth in every state when the bill passes. This bill is named after Dosha Joi, (DJay) a former foster youth studying to become a nurse when he died on May 14, 2020 of COVID-19. DJay was an advocate for youth aging out of foster care. His goal was to do as much as possible to help youth aging out of care with mental health, addiction and independent living skills.As a champion for youth in foster care, Senator Casey also recently cosponsored the bipartisan Timely Mental Health for Foster Youth Act, which would provide mandatory mental health screenings for all youth when they enter the foster care system and establish supports that will set them on a path of success.Read more about the Expanded Coverage for Former Foster Youth Act here.Read more about the Immediate Coverage for Former Foster Youth Act here."

Congress needs to do its part now. The House of Representatives has passed comprehensive background check legislation. The Senate should pass these bills, in addition to banning military-style assault weapons, limiting the size of magazines and passing legislation to support survivors of gun violence. We can't allow Republican Senators to prevent the passage of these lifesaving measures by using arcane Senate procedure. It's time to act."""
https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-toomey-introduce-bipartisan-bicameral-legislation-named-after-bucks-county-pilot-to-improve-airplane-safety,"Saracini Enhanced Aviation Safety Act Introduced to Prevent Airplane HijackingWashington, D.C. – Yesterday, U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA) and Pat Toomey (R-PA) introduced the Saracini Enhanced Aviation Safety Act (S.911) to strengthen legislation that would make airplanes less susceptible to hijacking. The legislation is named after a Bucks County resident, Captain Victor Saracini, who piloted United Flight 175 when it was hijacked by terrorists and flown into the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001. Provisions of the Saracini Aviation Act were enacted in 2018 and required the installation of a secondary barrier between the passenger cabin and cockpit door on each new aircraft purchased in the United States. This enhanced bill would mandate that secondary barriers be applied to all passenger airplanes, not only newly manufactured planes. U.S. Representatives Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA-01), Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ-05), André Carson (D-IN-07) and Chris Smith (R-NJ-04) introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives.“The Saracini Aviation Act made air transportation safer for all pilots and passengers,” said Senator Casey. “This ‘enhanced’ version of that legislation is an important step in preventing future disasters by protecting pilots’ cockpit doors during flights in all passenger airplanes. Secondary barriers have been shown to significantly decrease the threat of a hostile takeover of the cockpit. Congress must take up this legislation to step up security in commercial travel and prevent potential hijacking.”“On September 11, 2001, Bucks County native Captain Victor Saracini was piloting United Flight 175 when a group of terrorists hijacked the flight and flew it into the World Trade Center. With the help of Captain Saracini’s wife, Ellen, we enacted legislation requiring secondary barriers to be installed on all new commercial passenger aircraft. But the barriers can’t help protect all commercial travelers if they are not required for commercial aircraft already operating. That is why this legislation requires secondary barriers to be installed on all commercial passenger aircraft – whether new or currently operating. I am grateful for Ellen Saracini’s tireless work to advance this legislation, and am proud to work with Senator Casey in honoring Captain Saracini and protecting the traveling public,” said Senator Toomey.“Ensuring the safety of our nation’s aircraft is paramount to protecting the American public. Congress previously made progress in ensuring that all future commercial aircraft are equipped with secondary barriers, so we must build on that momentum in this 117th Congress and include the same requirement for all existing commercial passenger aircraft,” said Rep. Fitzpatrick. “I am proud to stand with my constituent, Ellen Saracini, along with Senators Casey and Toomey and Representatives Gottheimer, Carson, and Smith as we continue our fight to ensure that the devastating horrors of 9/11 never happen again.”In 2019, Senators Casey and Toomey sent a letter to Department of Transportation (DOT) Secretary Elaine Chao, urging DOT to strictly enforce their legislation. The Senators pushed back against voices in the airline industry that had argued that the Saracini Aviation Act only applied to new “models” of aircraft, when in fact the legislation mandates that secondary barriers be installed on all new aircrafts for commercial passenger air carriers in the United States, not just new types, or models, of aircraft."
https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-colleagues-reintroduce-legislation-to-prevent-hazing-on-college-campuses,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA) and Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) and U.S. Representatives Lucy McBath (D-GA-06) and Steve Stivers (R-OH-15) re-introduced the End All Hazing Act to provide parents and prospective students with better information about universities’ histories of hazing in an effort to increase transparency and accountability in hazing nationwide. The bill would require colleges and universities to post on their websites instances of hazing that took place on campus or within a student organization. Providing this information would improve transparency and assist students in making the best choices for their future.“Hazing is a horrendous act that has absolutely no place in our society. The bipartisan End All Hazing Act is a critical tool that would provide much needed transparency to students and parents about past instances of hazing on college campuses to help prevent families from losing loved ones,” said Senator Casey.“Prospective students and their families should feel safe no matter what school they choose,” said Dr. Cassidy. “By increasing transparency, the bill will ensure that hazing is never swept under the rug.”“We have a duty to ensure that schools are a safe environment for our students. The impacts that hazing has on young people across our country are heartbreaking and unacceptable,” said Rep. McBath. “This bipartisan, bicameral legislation strengthens important national standards for data collection and reporting hazing instances so that students and their families are able to make the best decision to support their educational wellbeing. This step we are taking together represents a vital one to protect the health, safety, and success of students.”“Hazing is an unacceptable and dangerous practice that does not have a place in any student organization that’s mission is to help young people learn and develop,” said Rep. Stivers. “I’m proud to join this bipartisan, bicameral coalition to continue to educate, inform, and ensure that students have the safe learning environment they deserve.”Casey first introduced the End All Hazing Act in October 2019 as a result of the death of Tim Piazza, a Penn State student who died due to hazing at a fraternity event in February 2017.Read the End All Hazing Act here."
