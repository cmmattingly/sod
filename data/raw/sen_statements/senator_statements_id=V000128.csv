https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-brown-colleagues-urge-biden-to-fill-leadership-posts-at-social-security-administration,"Today, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) led over a dozen of their colleagues in a letter to President Biden, urging him to nominate a Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner to serve at the Social Security Administration. The Social Security Administration has been without permanent leadership for over a year, making it difficult to address longstanding challenges that the agency faces in providing service to Americans who rely on these benefits.The Senators write, “Today Social Security covers over 179 million workers, and over 70 million people receive monthly Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits.  More than one out of every six U.S. residents collects Social Security benefits and older Americans make up about four out of every five beneficiaries.  Recent U.S. Census Bureau reports show that Social Security provides over half of the income for older adults, and nearly all of their income for one in four older adults.  Social Security continues to be one of the largest anti-poverty programs in the country, lifting over 22 million Americans out of poverty.”“The Social Security Commissioner is directly responsible for all programs administered by the agency, including state-administered programs directed by SSA. Nominating and confirming a permanent Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner would provide accountable leadership to the agency and reassure the public of SSA’s commitment to supporting the vulnerable populations that rely on its programs,” they continue. The Senators go on to note, “The Social Security Administration’s longstanding labor-management problems worsened under the prior Administration. Under prior leadership, SSA was among the most hostile agencies in the federal government in the way it chose to implement the since-repealed anti-union executive orders from 2018. Employee satisfaction is falling at SSA, and SSA employees report feelings of exhaustion at among the highest rates of any federal agency.  Permanent, Senate-confirmed leadership at the agency will help improve this longstanding challenge for the agency and its employees.”Senators Van Hollen and Brown led the following Senators in the letter: Senators Carper (D-Del.), Padilla (D-Calif.), Baldwin (D-Wis.), Casey (D-Pa.), Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Markey (D-Mass.), Cardin (D-Md.), Murray (D-Wash.), Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Sanders (I-Vt.), Warren (D-Mass.), Schatz (D-Hawaii), Feinstein (D-Calif.), and Blumenthal (D-Conn.).The full text of the letter is available here and below.Dear President Biden,We write today to urge the nomination of a Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner to serve as Senate-confirmed leaders for the Social Security Administration (SSA) and carry out the responsibilities of the agency.Today Social Security covers over 179 million workers, and over 70 million people receive monthly Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits.  More than one out of every six U.S. residents collects Social Security benefits and older Americans make up about four out of every five beneficiaries.  Recent U.S. Census Bureau reports show that Social Security provides over half of the income for older adults, and nearly all of their income for one in four older adults.  Social Security continues to be one of the largest anti-poverty programs in the country, lifting over 22 million Americans out of poverty.  The Social Security Commissioner is directly responsible for all programs administered by the agency, including state-administered programs directed by SSA.

We look forward to considering your nominees for Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner, and working together to improve overall service at the Social Security Administration for the millions of beneficiaries and those who use SSA’s services. "
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-statement-on-the-taiwan-policy-act,"As China takes increasingly aggressive actions against Taiwan, it is vital that we continue to strengthen the U.S.-Taiwanese relationship and ensure Taiwan’s ability to resist Chinese aggression. To accomplish this, we must stay laser-focused on strengthening Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities – consistent with longstanding U.S. policy outlined in the Three Communiqués, the Taiwan Relations Act, and the Six Assurances – so the government of China understands that any attempt to reunify the island by force will fail.While I support many of the useful provisions in the Taiwan Policy Act to help advance that goal, I am concerned about some of the other elements in the bill that risk escalating tensions across the Taiwan Strait without tangibly benefitting Taiwan’s ability to defend itself – concerns the Biden Administration has also expressed. I am grateful for the leadership of Chairman Menendez and my colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in their efforts to address the security of Taiwan and to strengthen our economic relationship with Taiwan, including adding a provision I authored with Senator Ben Sasse to encourage the President to begin negotiating a tax agreement with Taiwan so Taiwanese and U.S. businesses are no longer double-taxed. But, given my overarching concerns on the legislation, I could not support this bill in its current form. Make no mistake: I am deeply committed to working alongside my colleagues in the United States Senate to ensure Taiwan has a greater capacity to defend itself, now and into the future – and I will keep working to achieve that goal.  "
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-cardin-shaheen-rounds-push-for-increased-action-from-pentagon-to-address-pfas-exposure-at-military-installations,"U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin (both D-Md.) joined Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) in sending a letter to Department of Defense (DoD) Secretary Lloyd Austin and White House officials, urging increased funding for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances?(PFAS) testing and remediation, and to improve PFAS-related planning to make use of the higher funding levels Congress is willing to appropriate to address the pervasive issue.  The Senators wrote, in part, “As you know, PFAS chemicals have emerged as widespread contaminants to the drinking water sources of military bases across the country largely due to their presence in aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) used by the military. Members of the military, veterans and civilians who have served at military installations and/or live in the surrounding communities found to have been contaminated with PFAS face health risks related to exposure to PFAS chemicals, as these materials are found in AFFF, in personal protective equipment used by firefighters and in standard consumer products.” The Senators went on to detail the findings of a recent National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report that calls for expanded access to PFAS testing for Americans with a history of exposure to the chemicals and points to health risks such as high cholesterol, decreased fetal and infant growth and increased risks of kidney cancer for those exposed to PFAS. The Senators then continued to detail the robust amount of federal dollars provided by Congress to DoD to accelerate PFAS testing remediation and Congress’ continued willingness to provide additional resources to address the challenges the Department faces due to PFAS exposure. They closed their letter by urging the administration to put greater emphasis on addressing these pollutants. The Senators wrote, “Our service members, military families, veterans and defense communities deserve the Department’s full attention to appropriately address the scope and severity of PFAS contamination. We ask you to honor that responsibility and take the steps necessary to prioritize this hazard impacting our communities.”   In addition to Senators Van Hollen, Cardin, Shaheen, and Rounds, the letter is signed by U.S. Senators Hassan (D-N.H.), Braun (R-Ind.), King (I-Maine), Brown (D-Ohio), Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Warren (D-Mass.), Baldwin (D-Wis.), Peters (D-Mich.), Lujan (D-N.M.), Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Durbin (D-Ill.), Kaine (D-Va.), Bennet (D-Colo.), Sinema (D-Ariz.), Murray (D-Wash.), Feinstein (D-Calif.), Booker (D-N.J.), Warnock (D-Ga.), Padilla (D-Calif.), Casey (D-Pa.), Rosen (D-Nev.), Duckworth (D-Ill.), Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Heinrich (D-N.M.), Kelly (D-Ariz.), Cantwell (D-Wash.), Ossoff (D-Ga.), Stabenow (D-Mich.), Schatz (D-Hawaii), Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Sanders (I-Vt.), Leahy (D-Vt.), Manchin (D-W.Va.), Wyden (D-Ore.), Merkley (D-Ore.), and Markey (D-Mass.).Their letter can be read in full here and below.Dear Secretary Austin:We write with continued concern about the Department of Defense’s (DoD) efforts to address contamination from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Nearly 700 military installations nationwide have known or suspected PFAS contamination, exposing service members and their families, and civilian communities near DoD installations to these toxic chemicals. Given Congress’ continued commitment to provide funding to address PFAS contamination, we respectfully request that the Department similarly prioritize planning and programming for PFAS testing and remediation. As you know, PFAS chemicals have emerged as widespread contaminants to the drinking water sources of military bases across the country largely due to their presence in aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) used by the military. Members of the military, veterans and civilians who have served at military installations and/or live in the surrounding communities found to have been contaminated with PFAS face health risks related to exposure to PFAS chemicals, as these materials are found in AFFF, in personal protective equipment used by firefighters and in standard consumer products. The prevalence of PFAS allows for multiple pathways for exposure. The recently released National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report calls for expanded access to PFAS testing for Americans with a history of exposure to the chemicals and points to health risks such as high cholesterol, decreased fetal and infant growth and increased risks of kidney cancer for those exposed to PFAS. These health concerns pose a significant hazard to the safety of our communities, and individuals either previously or currently exposed to toxic PFAS chemicals, underscoring the urgency of reducing exposure. Over the past six years, Congress has increased funding by $1 billion for the Department to accelerate PFAS testing and remediation, more than doubling the amount requested in the annual budget request during that time frame. As evidenced by the historic $517 million authorization for PFAS-related activities included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022, Congress has indicated a willingness to provide even greater funding to address these challenges. We are, however, concerned that DoD has failed to adequately prepare for additional funding being made available. It is our understanding that one of the major obstacles in the way of Congress putting more resources toward this problem is a lack of planning by the Department on how to execute a higher funding level. Simply put, DoD is not sufficiently prioritizing PFAS testing, remediation and disposal as part of its annual budget process, nor is the Department adequately developing the appropriate plans to utilize even higher funding levels as provided by Congress.DoD has a responsibility to place greater emphasis on addressing these pollutants impacting service members, military families and defense communities. Therefore, we strongly urge the Department to match Congress’ urgency for addressing testing and remediation by developing requirements-based plans, policies, and programs and appropriately increasing DoD’s annual budget requests for PFAS-related activities, including for PFAS destruction. Further, we expect that, as a part of this analysis, the Department will address past planning and programming deficiencies that DoD has claimed limits their ability to execute higher levels of funding, and we request that DoD provide a plan to Congress no later than upon the release of the President’s Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2024 on how the Department is prepared to execute increased funding levels for PFAS-related activities. Finally, we support DoD’s cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency on PFAS, including collaboration on research and testing efforts, and encourage the Department to continue investing in joint efforts to address PFAS.Our service members, military families, veterans and defense communities deserve the Department’s full attention to appropriately address the scope and severity of PFAS contamination. We ask you to honor that responsibility and take the steps necessary to prioritize this hazard impacting our communities.Sincerely,"
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-raskin-join-with-nsa-bethesda-fire-fighters-iaff-leaders-to-highlight-progress-on-efforts-to-improve-base-conditions-build-new-facility,"On Monday, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen and Congressman Jamie Raskin (both D-Md.) joined fire fighters working at Naval Support Activity Bethesda (NSA Bethesda) – the naval installation home to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center – along with International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) General President Edward A. Kelly and National Capital Federal Fire Fighters President Scott Burkhardt Jr. to discuss progress in pushing the Navy to improve the living and working conditions for the fire fighters who serve the base and the surrounding community. The lawmakers and IAFF leadership toured the station and saw first-hand the subpar living conditions that persist within the existing fire station and living quarters – including issues such as water leaks, mold, pest infestation, and a broken exhaust removal system, among others. Following their tour, the group reaffirmed their efforts to push the Navy forward and pointed to a recent confirmation from the Secretary of the Navy that preliminary planning for an entirely new 16,000-square-foot fire station has been completed, at an estimated cost of $22.5 million. This progress follows the letter sent by the Senator and his colleagues pressing for an update on the Navy’s efforts to address the unsafe conditions at the facility and is a crucial step in allowing future funding of the project.Senator Van Hollen and IAFF leadership also highlighted the Fire Station Construction Grants Act, legislation the Senator recently introduced to help build and upgrade fire stations in Maryland and across the country.“The deplorable conditions that persist at the NSA Bethesda firehouse not only endanger our fire fighters – they also make it more difficult for them to protect the Walter Reed complex and the surrounding communities. But with the help of the fire fighters and IAFF, we’ve finally pushed the Navy leadership to commit to a plan to build a brand new fire station fit for the mission of this base that is at the vanguard of military medicine and serves our wounded warriors and thousands of veterans,” said Senator Van Hollen. “I’ll keep working to push the Navy to provide the necessary funds to get this project off the ground, and I am committed to ensuring our fire fighters and first responders and have the tools they need to keep us all safe.”“The firefighters at NSA Bethesda provide an essential public service to the naval base and surrounding community, yet their facilities remain in a state of unacceptable disrepair,” said Rep. Raskin. “These brave public servants regularly put their lives in danger to protect us. They should never feel unsafe in their home station. While I commend Secretary Del Toro for committing to build a new fire station, I urge the Navy to carry out swiftly the interim facility repairs required to keep our firefighters safe today.”“Fire fighters are answering calls today from dilapidated fire stations across the United States. The Walter Reed National Military Medical Center provides world-class medical care to our brave military, yet its fire station is in shambles. Just this summer, a fire fighter there sustained a serious injury when he fell through the floor and required three months of rehabilitation. This injury was preventable; it should not have occurred,” said Edward A. Kelly, president, International Association of Fire Fighters. “The staff at Walter Reed has done everything it can with the resources it has to repair the current station. It is time for the Navy to prioritize the modernization and replacement of this house and others like it at bases around the nation. The IAFF is grateful to Representative Raskin and Senator Van Hollen for their steadfast dedication to fire fighters and their continued efforts to correct the decades of inaction that have left our nation’s fire stations in a failing state.”“IAFF Federal Fire Fighters should not have to worry about falling through the floor of their bunk room. We worry about that when we're in burning buildings. We also shouldn’t have to worry about waterlogged flooring or insect infestations where we live and work, but it’s a reality that our federal fire fighters face every day,” said Scott Burkhardt Jr., president, National Capital Federal Fire Fighters. “The leadership of NSA Bethesda, Walter Reed, and the Commander Navy Region have all express their support for us, but they have been hamstrung by cuts to their budgets and the meddling of their internal affairs. We as fire fighters aren’t asking for more than what the Navy Facilities Engineering Command have told us we’re supposed to be able to expect in our stations. That’s what we’re fighting for, and we’re glad Senator Van Hollen and Congressman Raskin have our backs."" Following the June 28 letter sent to Navy leadership by Senator Van Hollen and his colleagues seeking an update on the status of the firehouse, U.S. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro told the lawmakers that the Navy has completed its preliminary plans for a new 16,000 square-foot fire facility and committed to working to budget funds for its construction. Secretary Del Toro also outlined how the Navy planned to fix many of the immediate safety issues in the existing fire station – where fire fighters are still living – and those plans include replacing damaged floors, installing new doors and frames, and making retrofits to prevent water leaks, among others. Additionally, the Secretary provided an update on the improvements made in two barracks for junior enlisted service members on NSA Bethesda, the conditions of which Senator Van Hollen and his colleagues had also raised concerns about earlier this year. Secretary Del Toro’s letter to Senator Van Hollen and his colleagues can be viewed here, and form outlining the plans for the new fire station can be viewed here.Senator Van Hollen has consistently championed issues important to fire fighters and first responders during his time in the Senate. Last year, as part of the fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, he passed his Federal Firefighter Flexibility and Fairness Act into law. This legislation allows federal fire fighters to trade shifts across pay periods without it affecting their overtime. State and local fire fighters have been able to engage in trade time for many years, and this law extended that right to federal fire fighters. Additionally, last month, Senator Van Hollen introduced the Fire Station Construction Grants Act, a bill that authorizes $1 billion in grants to be administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to help modify, upgrade, and construct fire and EMS department facilities.A member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Van Hollen works each year to secure federal funding for local fire departments and EMS agencies across Maryland to enhance their response capabilities and ability to protect the health and safety of the public and first-responders. So far this year, he has led his Congressional colleagues in announcing over $15.5 million for various agencies around the state."
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/maryland-delegation-members-announce-over-12-million-for-firefighters-in-western-maryland,"Today, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin and Congressmen Jamie B. Raskin and David Trone (all D-Md.) announced $12,108,037.50 in federal funding for Maryland firefighters and first responders in Frederick, Allegany, and Washington Counties. The funding will enhance firefighters’ emergency response capabilities and their ability to protect the health and safety of the public and themselves. It will also support the recruitment and retention of additional firefighters. “Investing in Maryland firefighters and first responders is an investment in the safety of our communities and the well-being of those on the frontlines who are putting themselves at risk to protect the rest of us every day. This federal funding will help expand recruitment for new firefighters and will equip our local fire departments with the tools they need to continue safely providing critical services to Western Marylanders,” said the lawmakers.“We are extremely grateful for the support of Senator Van Hollen and our entire Federal delegation,” said Frederick County Executive Jan Gardner. “This SAFER grant will allow us to improve staffing to keep our community and our firefighters safe.” The federal grants have been awarded as follows:Funding is from the Department of Homeland Security's FY2021 Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program, Fire Prevention and Safety Grant (FPS) program, and Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) awards. The programs are administered by the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration."
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-merkley-colleagues-highlight-environmental-justice-concerns-on-permitting-legislation-need-for-standalone-floor-consideration,"U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) joined Senator Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) alongside Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), and Ben Cardin (D-Md.) in sending a letter to Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressing concerns regarding the impact that the recently released proposal to change the federal permitting process for fossil fuel projects will have on communities of color, frontline communities and other disadvantaged communities. “For many years, siting decisions for big infrastructure projects have essentially prioritized the perceived societal benefits of fossil energy over the very real costs disproportionately borne by communities of color, low-income communities, and others who have traditionally been marginalized,” wrote the Senators. “The result has been the destruction of homes and neighborhoods, lost wealth in those communities, long-lasting health consequences, and premature deaths. Environmental justice advocates are pushing policymakers to remedy our nation’s failure to take the input of environmental justice communities more seriously, but there is far more work for us to do.” The Senators’ letter notes the environmental justice community’s concerns over the proposed reforms and the implications of these permits: “We also share the environmental justice community’s concerns that the proposed reforms could reduce the ability of affected stakeholders and state, federal, and tribal governments from thoroughly analyzing proposed projects and undermine judicial review,” they continued. “Given our country’s history of environmental inequity, any changes to the permitting processes should strengthen—not steamroll over—public participation and add protections for frontline communities.” The Senators concluded by highlighting that such important issues deserve robust debate and consideration separate from the urgent need to pass legislation keeping the government open before September 30th.“The environmental justice community is warranted in their belief that altering policies that shape how energy projects are considered will have profound implications for their health, prosperity, well-being, and overall quality of life. We agree, and believe such important issues should be examined through detailed committee consideration and a robust floor debate separate from the urgent need to see that the government stays open,” they conclude.Full text of the letter can be found  here and follows below:Dear Leader Schumer,We have heard extensive concerns from the environmental justice community regarding the proposed permitting reforms and are writing to convey the importance of those concerns, and to let you know that we share them.For many years, siting decisions for big infrastructure projects have essentially prioritized the perceived societal benefits of fossil energy over the very real costs disproportionately borne by communities of color, low-income communities, and others who have traditionally been marginalized. The result has been the destruction of homes and neighborhoods, lost wealth in those communities, long-lasting health consequences, and premature deaths. Environmental justice advocates are pushing policymakers to remedy our nation’s failure to take the input of environmental justice communities more seriously, but there is far more work for us to do. We share the concerns of frontline communities and communities of color that the proposed permitting reforms take us in the wrong direction.Congressional approval of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, weakening of the National Environmental Policy Act, and weakening of state’s ability to protect water quality under the Clean Water Act will limit public input and lead to additional pollution, disproportionately impacting people who are already facing direct harm. We also share the environmental justice community’s concerns that the proposed reforms could reduce the ability of affected stakeholders and state, federal, and tribal governments from thoroughly analyzing proposed projects and undermine judicial review. Given our country’s history of environmental inequity, any changes to the permitting processes should strengthen—not steamroll over—public participation and add protections for frontline communities.In this Congress, we have made important investments to elevate environmental justice communities, including significantly increasing funding to remediate past harms and resources to ensure that environmental justice communities can share in the benefits from a Just Transition to renewable energy.? In addition to funding, however, transparency and the ability for potentially impacted communities to have prior, informed and meaningful participation and consideration are foundational to providing environmental justice. A number of the proposed permitting reforms would do the exact opposite.? The environmental justice community is warranted in their belief that altering policies that shape how energy projects are considered will have profound implications for their health, prosperity, well-being, and overall quality of life. We agree, and believe such important issues should be examined through detailed committee consideration and a robust floor debate separate from the urgent need to see that the government stays open. We believe our caucus broadly shares the goal of advancing climate justice by remedying past damage done to frontline and low-income communities, and making sure we don’t inflict such damage in the future. We look forward to working with leadership and committees of jurisdiction, and the environmental justice community on these important civil rights priorities. Sincerely,"
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-cardin-and-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-reduce-exposure-to-lead-in-drinking-water-,"On Thursday, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin (both D-Md.) with Senators Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) introduced the Financing Lead Out of Water (FLOW) Act. The FLOW Act would reduce exposure to lead in old water pipes by making it easier for cities and utilities to issue bonds to finance replacement projects.“The use of lead service lines poses a constant threat to the health and safety of our communities, putting the well-being of our most vulnerable — including children and the elderly — at greater risk. This legislation will speed up the lead pipe replacement process and help communities access low-cost financing by cutting red tape that slows down local governments in modernizing our water infrastructure,” said Senator Van Hollen.“Millions of households across America still have lead pipes delivering water to their homes. Access to low-cost financing is a common barrier for local communities in Maryland and elsewhere when considering projects to fully replace lead service lines and protect public health,” said Senator Cardin. “Our bicameral legislation would make it easier for publicly owned water utilities to use tax-exempt bonds to get the lead out of our water infrastructure and provide safe, affordable drinking water.”According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), between 6 to 10 million homes in the U.S. currently have lead water pipes, also known as lead service lines (LSL), that connect the main water line located underground to their home’s internal plumbing system. Although public utilities across the country are replacing their publicly owned lead service lines, replacement projects have moved slowly for privately owned pipes serving residences due to the costly financial responsibility of replacing these lines. The FLOW Act provides an explicit guarantee in the tax code to allow public water utilities to issue tax-exempt bonds to help pay for the removal and replacement of both the publicly- and privately-owned lead service lines, resolving the full scale of the issue for residents in areas with lead pipes. This bill also helps funds for lead pipe replacement from the American Rescue PlanAct and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law make a deeper impact on replacing the nation’s essential water infrastructure.Last week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a record $184 millionare available from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds to repair and improve Maryland’s water infrastructure. This record funding, delivered through Maryland’s Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund Programs, will help communities across the state access clean, safe, and reliable drinking water, prevent flooding, collect and treat wastewater to protect public health, and safeguard vital waterways.  The bill text is available HERE.“Coloradans deserve to know the water they and their children drink is safe,” said Senator Bennet. “This legislation would not only help cut through red tape, but alleviate some of the financial burden that homeowners typically face when replacing their lead pipes. We should learn from the experiences of Denver Water and use innovative financing to help eliminate lead pipes completely across our communities.”“It is vital that every American has access to safe, clean drinking water,” said Senator Booker.“This legislation will reduce financial burdens on homeowners and cut through the administrative challenges localities face to replace the portion of lead service lines that are privately owned. Lead in drinking water is a national public health emergency, and I commend Senator Bennet for his leadership on this issue.”“Families shouldn’t have to worry about whether or not the water coming out of the faucet is safe for their children to drink,” said Senator Brown. “Because of the work we did in the American Rescue Plan and Bipartisan Infrastructure Plan, Ohio communities will be able to replace old pipes, using American-made materials and installed by American workers, and the FLOW Act will ensure that these investments reach even more Ohioans.”“In California, at least 65,000 homes have lead water pipes, a particular danger for children whose brain growth and development can be inhibited. This bill will revise IRS rules to allow public water utilities to help pay to replace these dangerous pipes. We must address this problem now before more children are harmed,” said Senator Feinstein. "
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-warren-pressley-garcia-introduce-bill-to-provide-americans-immediate-access-to-money-in-their-bank-accounts,"Today, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Representatives Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Jesús “Chuy” García (D-Ill.) introduced their Payments Modernization Act, legislation to make Americans’ funds deposited in their bank accounts immediately available for withdrawal. Right now, Americans lose billions of dollars each year in overdraft fees, driving consumers to turn to more costly financial products because of our inefficient payments system. By updating the Expedited Funds Availability Act and requiring financial institutions to recognize funds in real time this bill will improve Americans’ access to their money and support the Federal Reserve’s implementation of its real time payments system, FedNow. “Americans deserve a banking system that works for them. But when deposited funds aren’t immediately available it costs folks time and money – especially in exorbitant overdraft fees. With this legislation, we’re requiring banks to make the dollars Americans deposit in their accounts available to use immediately. This common-sense bill will help Americans better manage their money and will help pave the way for the Fed’s new faster payments system, FedNow,” said Senator Van Hollen. “People living paycheck-to-paycheck shouldn’t have to wait up to five days for a check to clear so that they can pay their rent, cover child care, or pick up groceries,” said Senator Warren. “Our bill would ensure a national, real-time payments system so that families have faster access to the money they earned and don’t have to pay overdraft fees or rely on a shady payday lender to make ends meet.”“Delayed access to payments is just one example of our unjust, tiered financial system that prioritizes financial institutions over consumers. Working families in the Massachusetts 7th and beyond can’t afford to wait days to have their paychecks cleared,” said Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley. “We should be using every tool available to provide relief for consumers and allowing people to access their money in real-time is one way to do just that. I’m glad the Fed is making progress toward implementing a real-time payments system, something I have consistently called for, and I urge Congress to pass our bill so consumers can begin feeling this relief without delay.”“Working families in my district deserve to know that every penny they earn will be available to them as soon as their paychecks are deposited. Families should not have to pay overdraft fees because their money takes days to appear in their bank accounts. The Federal Reserve has a responsibility to ensure working families are not facing economic hardship from unjust systems. It must modernize and establish a reliable and efficient system to make sure people can access their money in real-time, when they need it most,” said Congressman García.“This legislation will save working families billions every year. Giving people access to their own money in real-time will result in fewer overdrafts, payday loans, late fees, interest charges. This legislation will make it less expensive to be poor. America’s antiquated payment system is a driver of income inequality,” said Aaron Klein, Senior Fellow and Carliner Chair in Economic Studies at Brookings Institution.   The lawmakers initially introduced this bill in July 2019 and have since updated it following the Fed’s progress on developing its real time payments system, FedNow. The text of the bill is available here. "

Markey (D-Mass.) alongside Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) in calling to prevent any U.S. security assistance from going to Azerbaijan until Armenia and Azerbaijan reach a permanent, lasting resolution to ensure peace and stability in Nagorno-Karabakh. In their letter, the Senators raise strong concerns that despite statutory limitations on U.S. security assistance to the country, Azerbaijan is benefitting from security assistance as it continues to attack Armenia and ethnic Armenians.“In light of Azerbaijan’s recent and repeated acts of aggression toward Armenia, the United States should cease providing any security assistance to Azerbaijan until Armenia and Azerbaijan reach a permanent and lasting resolution that respects the will of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh,” the Senators wrote to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III. “This requires swift U.S. action to ensure we do not aid and abet Azerbaijan in sparking another large-scale conflagration. Azerbaijan must face the reality that there will never be a military solution that leads to peace and stability in Nagorno-Karabakh.”In their letter, the Senators asked if the Departments of State and Defense intend to continue providing security assistance to Azerbaijan and whether they conducted a recent assessment to verify that the ongoing assistance will not undermine or hamper ongoing efforts to negotiate a peaceful settlement between Armenia and Azerbaijan, or be used for offensive purposes against Armenia. The Senators also asked if either Department assessed whether any units that have received U.S. security assistance have engaged in the recent fighting.  A copy of the letter is available here. "

Implementing TPS would allow Pakistani nationals to remain in the U.S. until Pakistan recovers from this environmental disaster. The ongoing crisis has left many regions of the country uninhabitable and unsafe, caused at least an estimated $10 billion in damage, and contaminated the water supply, spreading an array of waterborne illnesses, including diarrhea, malaria, acute respiratory infections, skin and eye infections, and typhoid. “Granting TPS to Pakistani nationals in need is a small but consequential step that the United States can take to immediately reduce the human suffering caused by this natural disaster and would reaffirm our stance as a global leader committed to humanitarian relief efforts and protections,” wrote the senators. “Should Pakistan officially request TPS designation given the current conditions the country is facing, we urge the Biden administration to prioritize such a request while continuing to monitor ongoing developments and deliberate on the best way to aid the Pakistani community.”In addition to Senators Van Hollen and Gillibrand, the letter to President Biden was also signed by Senators Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), and Tina Smith (D-Minn.). This action is supported by the National Immigration Forum, Asian American Federation (AAF), the Climate Justice Collaborative at the National Partnership for New Americans, Communities United for Status and Protection (CUSP), and South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT).The full text of the letter is available here or below:  Dear President Biden: We write to respectfully urge your Administration to consider designating the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Unprecedented flooding in Pakistan is currently impacting approximately 33 million people and has killed more than 1,500 people, including 536 children. Given the severity of this crisis, the United States must ensure that Pakistani nationals present in the United States are not forced to return to conditions that could imperil their lives. Current conditions in Pakistan represent an ongoing environmental disaster – one of the statutory bases for TPS designation. Extreme flooding has left most regions of the country uninhabitable and unsafe. According to data from the European Space Agency, approximately one-third of Pakistan is underwater. The Indus River is exceeding its capacity, which has led officials to evacuate entire villages in hopes of mitigating further disaster. Half of Pakistan’s municipal districts have declared a “state of calamity” and the country’s National Disaster Management Authority estimates that one in seven Pakistanis has been affected. According to Pakistan’s finance minister, the damage is likely to exceed $10 billion, which is equivalent to 4 percent of the country’s annual gross domestic product. Even as Pakistanis are reeling from the physical destruction caused by the flooding, they are also facing the spread of waterborne illness that this environmental crisis has exacerbated. Tens of thousands have been stricken by diarrhea, malaria, acute respiratory infections (ARI), skin and eye infections, typhoid, and other health issues resulting from contamination of the water supply. While we applaud your Administration’s decision to provide a much needed $30 million in humanitarian assistance and dispatch a USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team, further action is needed to mitigate the harmful effects of this crisis.Forcing Pakistanis to return to a country that is experiencing what U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has called a relentless impact of “epochal” levels of rain and flooding would be a grievous obstruction to relief efforts. It would also risk fueling further displacement, destabilizing the region, and undermining key U.S. national security interests.8 The use and implementation of TPS as a humanitarian tool would provide necessary relief to individuals that are unable to return to their country due to the extraordinary environmental and public health conditions.  Additionally, designating Pakistan for TPS would also contribute to your Administration’s multi-pronged disaster response. It would decrease the strain on Pakistani infrastructure and provide a safe haven for those who cannot return to their homes or whose homes have been destroyed. Should Pakistan officially request TPS designation given the current conditions that the country is facing, we urge you to prioritize such a request and take it into serious consideration while you continue to monitor ongoing developments and deliberate on the best way to aid the Pakistani community. TPS is a small but consequential step that the United States can take to immediately reduce the human suffering caused by this natural disaster and would reaffirm our stance as a global leader committed to humanitarian relief efforts and protections.Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to your timely reply."
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/maryland-congressional-delegation-announces-over-86m-in-federal-funds-for-investments-in-minority-and-underserved-communities,"Today, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin and Congressmen Steny H. Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin and David Trone (all D-Md.) announced  that three Maryland-based community financial institutions will receive a combined $86.6 million from the U.S. Department of the Treasury Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) to help low-income and minority borrowers. Funded through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which was supported by all Democratic members of Team Maryland, these funds are direct, wide-ranging investments in our communities that have been financially underserved and harmed the most during the COVID-19 pandemic.“The economic harm from COVID-19 still lingers across Maryland, especially among minority small businesses and others who were systemically underserved before the pandemic,” the lawmakers said. “We have fought to create an equitable recovery that drives investment, including capital and loans, in our communities with the greatest need. These community financial institutions know the region and are uniquely suited to personalize support for local businesses so they can create jobs and expand economic opportunities for all Marylanders.”The three Maryland-headquartered Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) and Minority Depository Institutions (MDI) receiving funds are: “These investments are designed to support the efforts of community financial institutions to, among other things, provide loans, grants, and forbearance for small and minority-owned businesses and consumers,” according to Treasury. They also include the “development and preservation of affordable housing, and investments in community development projects.”The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the importance of investing in CDFIs and MDIs, key components of the federal government’s effort to deliver capital to underserved small businesses and entrepreneurs. In March, the Senate Small Business & Entrepreneurship Committee, which is chaired by Senator Cardin, released a report finding that set-asides for CDFIs and MDIs in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) ensured that minority-owned, rural, and other underserved small businesses had access to PPP loans. According to the staff report, “The equity-focused policies implemented by Congress and the Biden administration over the lifetime of PPP resulted in a significant improvement in the number and share of loans that were made to minority-owned, women-owned, and other underserved small businesses.” As Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Financial Service and General Government, which funds the Department of the Treasury Emergency Capital Investment Program as well as funding for CDFI and MDI programs, Senator Van Hollen oversaw the increase of these funds in the 2022 appropriations bill. "
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/maryland-congressional-delegation-urges-administration-to-kick-start-new-chesapeake-bay-blue-crab-stock-assessment,"Today, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin and Congressmen Steny H. Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Andy Harris, M.D., Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin and David Trone (all Md.) urged U.S. Department of Commerce leadership to initiate a new benchmark stock assessment for the Chesapeake Bay blue crab population, in line with the recommendations of leading scientists and fisheries managers. Following the lowest-ever blue crab population estimates in this year’s winter dredge survey, the Members of Congress called for expedient action to be undertaken using funding from the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). “The 2022 [winter dredge] survey demonstrates the complexity of the blue crab fishery. This year saw the Bay’s lowest number of crabs observed (227 million crabs) in the survey’s history. Approximately 97 million mature female crabs were estimated to be present in the Bay at the start of the 2022 crabbing season, which is above the abundance threshold of 72.5 million adult females, but well below the target of 196 million,” the Members of Congress write. “While these results suggest that the blue crab population is not depleted relative to the reference points, worryingly, juvenile abundance has not responded to increases in female abundance as expected. Current, comprehensive information is needed to understand this disconnect, as well as to identify and address other factors attributed to the low overall population, including water quality, changes in weather patterns associated with climate change, habitat loss, and predation, including by invasive species such as blue catfish and northern snakehead.” “Sound management of the species is vital to ensure the sustainability of this natural resource, which supports commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries,” the Members affirm. “We write to express our full support for a new benchmark stock assessment, as recommended in the Chesapeake Bay Stock Assessment Committee (CBSAC) 2022 Blue Crab Advisory Report.”The Chesapeake Bay Stock Assessment Committee is an advisory group under the Chesapeake Bay Program’s Sustainable Fisheries Goal Implementation Team. The Maryland DNR, Virginia Marine Resource Commission, and the Potomac River Fisheries Commission each have a representative on this team to discuss fishery policies, including blue crab management. This committee has met each year since 1997 to review the results of annual Chesapeake Bay blue crab surveys and develop management advice for the three jurisdictions, summarized in an annual report. The 2022 Blue Crab Advisory Report released in July included a new recommendation to update the 2011 benchmark stock assessment. "
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-murphy-cassidy-introduce-legislation-to-improve-neurological-health-research,"Today, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), and Bill Cassidy, M.D., (R-La.) introduced legislation to reauthorize the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System (NNCSS) program, which collects data which collects privacy-protected data on neurological conditions to inform research and help advance better treatments and cures.Specifically, the legislation would reauthorize the NNCSS for another five years and increase funding to $10 million starting in FY23 and up to $20 million by FY26. Reauthorization would allow the program to complete its current work on Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson’s and expand to other neurological conditions.“For Americans living with neurological conditions, like Parkinson’s and MS, good data holds the key to advancing innovative treatments and cures. That’s why it’s crucial that we fully fund the NNCSS program for another five years to expand data collection and research capabilities. This legislation will help millions of patients – and families – who are impacted by these conditions each year, as we seek to strengthen our responses to and treatments available for neurological conditions,” said Senator Van Hollen. “The NNCSS is a critical program that helps us better understand neurological conditions like Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson’s Disease, which each impact more than a million Americans and their families. Their research is key to developing more effective treatments and ultimately finding a cure for these horrific diseases. We must continue to support their lifesaving work,” said Senator Murphy.“Hope for cures comes through advances in knowledge. Let’s create that hope,” said Senator Cassidy. “This bill supports research into treatments and cures while protecting patients’ privacy.”“Curing and preventing Parkinson’s means providing researchers with the most robust information about how the disease originates and what potential triggers exist here in the United States. The National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System is a world-class engine that is integral to curing Parkinson’s and other neurological conditions,” said Ted Thompson, JD, senior vice president of The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research. “On behalf of the Parkinson’s community, we call on Congress to reauthorize the NNCSS so that the world’s best and brightest can have access to the data and information they need to cure and, one day, prevent Parkinson’s.  Parkinson’s costs the United States more than $52 billion every year, and that will grow to at least $80 billion in the next 15 years. Investing $10 million in FY 2023 in the NNCSS to be able to eventually offset billions of dollars in the cost for care is a smart investment I hope Congress will support."" “Brain health is crucial to individual health. A key way policymakers can improve brain health is through gathering more data about the incidence and prevalence of neurologic disease,” said Orly Avitzur, MD, MBA, FAAN, President of the American Academy of Neurology. “The National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System has begun to provide critical insights into Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis.  This legislation will ensure this important project continues and has the resources to expand to more neurologic conditions over time. Neurologic diseases cost the United States more than $600 billion each year – we need investments like the NNCSS to provide essential data to researchers to help improve brain health.”“With a new study identifying the annual economic burden of multiple sclerosis (MS) at $85.4 billion, it is more important than ever to provide researchers with accurate and up-to-date data to lead to answers and a cure for MS,” said Bari Talente, executive vice president of advocacy and healthcare access at the National MS Society. “The National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System is positioned to provide crucial information to researchers working to end MS and other neurological diseases. MS activists urge Congress to support the reauthorization and $10 million in federal funding for FY23 of the NNCSS.”This legislation is endorsed by the American Academy of Neurology, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.Text of the bill is available here."

Just days before the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Maria, the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history, Hurricane Fiona ravaged the island with catastrophic flash flooding, unprecedented rainfall, and high-speed winds.  “Governor Pierluisi has formally requested a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto Rico’s municipalities in response to Hurricane Fiona. We strongly urge you to approve this request to ensure Puerto Rico has all the federal resources available to respond to this disaster,” wrote the bicameral group of lawmakers to President Biden.  “Furthermore, 750,000 homes remain without potable water. Bridges have collapsed, roads are blocked with debris, and schools are damaged,” the lawmakers added. “FEMA Public Assistance is urgently needed to begin restoring this vital infrastructure.”In 2017, thousands of lives were lost in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria due to the Trump Administration’s botched response. In 2020, following Hurricane Maria, the island faced destructive earthquakes, requiring more disaster recovery resources. The lawmakers also highlighted how institutions in charge of the electric grid have failed to repair the electrical system, resulting in continued frequent and widespread power outages.  “These events have left Puerto Rico’s critical infrastructure vulnerable to extreme weather. We urge you to help the people of Puerto Rico equitably recover from these multiple disasters and access the federal funding they urgently need,” concluded the lawmakers. Joining Senators Van Hollen and Menendez and Rep. Velázquez in signing the letter were Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), and Senators Richard Blumenthal, (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Representatives Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.-13), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.-14), Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.-02), Val Demings (D-Fla.-10), Darren Soto (D-Fla.-09), Alma Adams (D-N.C.-12), Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.-31), Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.-07), Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon (R-Puerto Rico), Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.-06), Al Green (D-Texas-09), Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.-15), Jesús “Chuy” García (D-Ill.-04), and Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.-03). A copy of the letter can be found HERE and below.Dear President Biden, Governor Pierluisi has formally requested a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto Rico’s municipalities in response to Hurricane Fiona. We strongly urge you to approve this request to ensure Puerto Rico has all the federal resources available to respond to this disaster.Hurricane Fiona devastated the island with catastrophic flash flooding, unprecedented rainfall, and high-speed winds. The hurricane caused an island-wide blackout, leaving over three million residents without power for over twenty-four hours. Furthermore, 750,000 homes remain without potable water. Bridges have collapsed, roads are blocked with debris, and schools are damaged. FEMA Public Assistance is urgently needed to begin restoring this vital infrastructure. In addition, Hurricane Fiona has caused significant flood damage to homes across the island. Many families are now seeking temporary shelter and will require significant aid in order to rebuild their homes. FEMA’s Individual Assistance is critical to assist with these housing costs and other recovery expenses. We thank you for swiftly approving Puerto Rico’s Emergency Declaration this past Sunday.In 2017, thousands of lives were lost in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria due to the butchered government response by the Trump Administration. In 2020, the island faced destructive earthquakes, requiring more disaster recovery resources. Five years since Hurricane Maria, LUMA Energy and the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) have yet to adequately repair the electrical system, resulting in continued frequent and widespread electrical outages. These events have left Puerto Rico’s critical infrastructure vulnerable to extreme weather. We urge you to help the people of Puerto Rico equitably recover from these multiple disasters and access the federal funding they urgently need. Given the damaged infrastructure, we urge you to promptly approve Governor Pierluisi’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto Rico’s municipalities in response to Hurricane Fiona. Sincerely,"

Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin and David Trone (all D-Md.) announced a new federal grant of $800,000 for the restoration of oyster reefs that are vital to the health of the Chesapeake Bay.The new funding for the Maryland Department of Natural Resources comes through NOAA Fisheries to support the placement of spat-on-shell, or oyster larvae, on up to 100 acres of oyster reefs in four Maryland tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. Higher oyster density is expected to lead to increased environmental benefits, such as water filtration and more habitat for fish.“Oysters are restoration engines for the Chesapeake Bay. They play a key role in the Bay’s ecosystem, filtering water and providing habitat for biodiverse aquatic wildlife. This new federal grant will deliver the resources to create 100 acres of oyster reefs, an area equivalent to 75 football fields, that will provide fertile ground for Bay restoration,” said the members.“We look forward to the successful implementation of these restoration projects and are committed to continuing to lead the effort to expand our investment in the health of the Chesapeake Bay.”NOAA Fisheries provides funding and technical support to partners across the country to develop high-quality habitat restoration projects. Funding for the new Maryland project comes through the Community-based Restoration Program, which funds habitat restoration projects focused on supporting sustainable fisheries and recovering Endangered Species Act-listed species."

The Same Day Voter Registration Act would require states to offer same day registration at polling locations on Election Day and during early voting. The Stop Automatically Voiding Eligible Voters Off Their Enlisted Rolls in States (SAVE VOTERS) Act would prohibit states from removing people from their voting rolls unless the state has obtained objective, reliable evidence that a voter is ineligible to vote and establishes notification requirements once a voter is removed. These bills were included as part of the Freedom to Vote Act, voting rights legislation led by Senator Klobuchar and supported by all Democratic Senators.The Same Day Voter Registration Act would: The Same Day Voter Registration Act is led by Senator Klobuchar and cosponsored in addition to Senator Van Hollen by Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Angus King (I-Maine), and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.)The SAVE VOTERS Act would:The Save Voters Act is led by Senator Klobuchar and cosponsored in addition to Senator Van Hollen by Senators Wyden, Markey, Merkley, Warren, Casey, Smith, Blumenthal, Gillibrand, Sanders, Hirono, Booker, Murphy, Kaine, Menendez, and King.Both bills are endorsed by Democracy 21, Transparency International U.S., End Citizens United/Let America Vote Action Fund, Common Cause, Public Citizen, People for the American Way, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, 20/20 Vision DC, Voices for Progress, and League of Women Voters."
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-toomey-release-framework-for-new-russia-sanctions,"Today, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), both members of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, put forward a framework outlining new sanctions legislation to hold Russia accountable for its war against Ukraine. The Senators’ framework provides new sanctions authority to the Administration in its efforts to sever funding to Putin’s war machine. “The U.S. and our allies have taken important steps to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked war against Ukraine, including sanctions that have hit its economy and Putin’s cronies. However, we have yet to effectively cut off funding to Putin’s war machine by diminishing Russia’s revenues from energy sales. That’s why the Biden Administration’s initiative with the G7 to cap the price of Russian oil exports is crucial. In order to successfully enforce the price cap, it’s clear the administration requires new authority from Congress, which is exactly what our framework will provide. By imposing strong secondary sanctions, our framework also provides the administration with the tools needed to hold accountable the financial institutions supporting those countries involved in rampant war profiteering from Russian exports.  “The Ukrainian people have inspired the world in their fight for freedom and independence, and the sanctions framework we’re releasing today is a critical component in helping them defeat Russian aggression,” the Senators said.  The Senators’ framework follows:  Senators Van Hollen and Toomey previously worked together on North Korea sanctions legislation, the Otto Warmbier BRINK Act, which was signed into law in 2019, and legislation sanctioning those responsible for the crackdown on Hong Kong’s autonomy, the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which was signed into law in 2020. "

We will continue to help every student — no matter their zip code — access secure and affordable internet,” said the lawmakers. Awards in this wave of funding include:The American Rescue Plan, which the lawmakers fought to pass, included historic investments in Maryland for broadband infrastructure, education and child care, health care, small businesses, public transit, and more. These investments have delivered significant resources directly to Maryland to help workers, families, and local officials combat COVID-19 and recover from the health and economic impacts of the virus.   "

The resolution designated the week of September 12, 2022 as “National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week.”  Defined as degree-granting institutions where total Hispanic enrollment constitutes no less than 25% of the total enrollment, HSIs play a critical role in educating Hispanic youth and creating economic opportunities for the economies in which these institutions are embedded. HSIs are located in 29 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, with emerging HSIs located in 40 states and the District of Colombia. The resolution is supported by the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU).Joining Senators Van Hollen, Menendez, Padilla, and Cornyn in cosponsoring the resolution are Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Ted Cruz (R-Texas). A copy of the resolution can be found HERE and below.Designating the week beginning on September 12, 2022, as ‘‘National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week’’.Whereas Hispanic-Serving Institutions are degree-granting institutions that have a full-time equivalent under- graduate enrollment of at least 25 percent Hispanic students;Whereas Hispanic-Serving Institutions play an important role in educating many low-income and underserved students and creating opportunities and increasing access to higher education for such students;Whereas, in the 2020-2021 academic year, 559 Hispanic-Serving Institutions operated in the United States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, enrolling more than 3,500,000 Hispanic students, according to the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities and Excelencia in Education;Whereas Hispanic-Serving Institutions are engines of economic mobility and a major contributor to the economic prosperity of the United States;Whereas, according to the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions represent 16 percent of all institutions of higher education, yet serve 30.4 percent of all undergraduate students and 66.1 percent of all Hispanic students;Whereas Hispanic-Serving Institutions are located in 29 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico;Whereas the number of Emerging Hispanic-Serving Institutions, defined as institutions that do not yet meet the threshold of 25 percent Hispanic full-time equivalent enrollment but serve a Hispanic student population of between 15 and 24.9 percent, stands at 393 institutions operating in 38 States and the District of Columbia;Whereas Hispanic-Serving Institutions are actively involved in empowering and improving the communities in which the institutions are located;Whereas Hispanic-Serving Institutions are leading efforts to increase Hispanic participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (commonly known as ‘‘STEM’’);Whereas the top 10 institutions of higher education ranked by Third Way based on the economic mobility of the graduates are Hispanic-Serving Institutions;Whereas celebrating the vast contributions of Hispanic-Serving Institutions to the United States strengthens the culture of the United States; andWhereas the achievements and goals of Hispanic-Serving Institutions deserve national recognition: Now, therefore, be itResolved, That the Senate—(1) recognizes the achievements and goals of Hispanic-Serving Institutions across the United States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico;(2) designates the week beginning on September 12, 2022, as ‘‘National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week’’; and(3) calls on the people of the United States and interested groups to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs to demonstrate support for Hispanic-Serving Institutions in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month."
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-colleagues-urge-biden-administration-to-strengthen-privacy-protections-for-women-seeking-reproductive-health-care,"U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) joined Senator Patty Murray (D-Wash.), and 28 of their colleagues in calling on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to take immediate action to safeguard women’s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially get the health care they need. Specifically, the Senators urged the Biden Administration to strengthen federal privacy protections under the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to broadly restrict providers from sharing patients’ reproductive health information without their explicit consent—particularly with law enforcement or in legal proceedings over accessing abortion care. The push from the Senators comes as legislators and prosecutors across the country have sought to enforce Republicans’ abortion bans by investigating women and doctors for seeking and providing abortion care. “Our nation faces a crisis in access to reproductive health services, and some states have already begun to investigate and punish women seeking abortion care. It is critical that HHS take all available action to fully protect women’s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially seek medical care,” wrote the Senators. In their letter to Secretary Xavier Becerra, the Senators urge HHS to take immediate action to strengthen federal privacy protections under HIPAA, bolster enforcement of the protections, educate providers about their obligations, and ensure patients understand their rights. In June, in the wake of the Dobbs decision, Becerra pledged to work to protect patient and provider privacy.“To safeguard the privacy of women’s personal health care decisions and ensure patients feel safe seeking medical care, including reproductive health care, we urge you to quickly initiate the rulemaking process to strengthen privacy protections for reproductive health information,” urged the Senators. “In particular, HHS should update the HIPAA Privacy Rule to broadly restrict regulated entities from sharing individuals’ reproductive health information without explicit consent, particularly for law enforcement, civil, or criminal proceedings premised on the provision of abortion care.”Since the Dobbs decision, the new patchwork of state abortion bans has caused widespread confusion among health care providers over whether they are required to turn over patients’ health information to state and local law enforcement. This confusion fundamentally threatens women’s health, as patients may delay or avoid seeking the care they need out of fear their sensitive health information could be weaponized against them. In recent weeks, states have investigated and sought to punish patients and providers for seeking and providing abortion care. Joining Senators Van Hollen and Murray in sending the letter were Senators Baldwin (D-Wis.), Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Booker (D-N.J.), Brown (D-Ohio), Cantwell (D-Wash.), Casey (D-Pa.), Duckworth (D-Ill.), Durbin (D-Ill.), Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Heinrich (D-N.M.), Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Hirono (D-Hawaii), Kaine (D-Va.), Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Luján (D-N.M.), Markey (D-Mass.), Menendez (D-N.J.), Merkley (D-Ore.), Padilla (D-Calif.), Reed (D-R.I.), Rosen (D-Nev.), Sanders (I-Vt.), Shaheen (D-N.H.), Smith (D-Minn.), Stabenow (D-Mich.), Warner (D-Va.), Warren (D-Mass.), and Wyden (D-Ore.).Full text of the letter can be found here and below.Dear Secretary Becerra:Since the Supreme Court’s decision to strip away the constitutional right to abortion, patients across the country have lost access to reproductive health care, and providers have scrambled to adapt to the immense confusion, fear, and upheaval this ruling has caused. In some states, legislators and prosecutors have already sought to investigate and punish women seeking abortion care. To protect patients, and their providers, from having their health information weaponized against them, we urge you to take immediate action to strengthen education on and enforcement of federal health privacy protections, and to initiate the rulemaking process to augment privacy protections under Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations. Every day, health care personnel across this nation care for patients who are pregnant or may become pregnant. This care may include anything from an annual check-up to obstetrical visits to emergency care. In order for patients to feel comfortable seeking care, and for health care personnel to provide this care, patients and providers must know that their personal health information, including information about their medical decisions, will be protected. Recognizing this critical need, in 1996, Congress passed HIPAA, which directed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to issue privacy regulations for personal health information. HHS issued corresponding privacy regulations (the “HIPAA Privacy Rule”) in 2000, with several subsequent updates over the years.The Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision has caused widespread confusion among health care providers on health privacy protections, and whether they are required to turn over health information to state and local law enforcement. Stakeholders have told us about providers who have felt uncertain about whether they must turn over personal health information to state and law enforcement officials, including cases where providers believed they had to turn over information when doing so is only permitted—but not required—under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. In other cases, providers did not know that certain disclosures are actually impermissible. Stakeholders have even described clashes between providers and health care system administrators on whether certain information must be shared. Many of these issues seem to arise from misunderstandings of what the HIPAA Privacy Rule requires of regulated entities and their employees.This confusion is likely to grow as state lawmakers continue to implement a patchwork of laws restricting access to abortion and other reproductive health care services. Already, some states have laws in effect criminalizing abortion providers, and some states have enacted laws that penalize anyone who “aids or abets” an abortion, potentially exposing everyone from a referring provider to a receptionist to legal liability. Some state legislators have even proposed to bar women from traveling to another state for abortion care. And even before Dobbs, states had already prosecuted women following their abortions or miscarriages. In many cases, these laws have been used to disproportionately criminalize or surveil women of color for their pregnancy loss.Actions to prohibit abortion access and undermine health privacy are likely to have devastating consequences for women’s health. Out of concern that their reproductive health information may be used against them, women may delay or avoid disclosing a pregnancy or obtaining prenatal care. They may fear initiating treatments for conditions like cancer or arthritis, where treatment could impact a pregnancy, even as health care providers may hesitate to provide them. And women who experience complications from a pregnancy or abortion may avoid seeking desperately needed emergency care, risking devastating health consequences and even death. These concerns are not without justification – in recent years, numerous medical providers have reported women to law enforcement for seeking care following an abortion, a miscarriage, or other pregnancy-related medical issue. HHS has the tools to protect patients and health care providers, even in the wake of this devastating decision. For over twenty years, the HIPAA Privacy Rule has protected the privacy of individuals’ health information, laying out when health information may or may not be shared without a patient’s explicit consent. In addition, the HIPAA Privacy Rule has long recognized that stronger protections may be needed for particularly sensitive health information, such as psychotherapy notes. We commend you for the actions the Department has already taken to clarify privacy protections in the wake of the Dobbs decision, including the issuance of additional guidance on the HIPAA Privacy Rule. However, given the growing likelihood that women’s personal health information may be used against them, HHS must also take proactive steps to strengthen patient privacy protections.To safeguard the privacy of women’s personal health care decisions and ensure patients feel safe seeking medical care, including reproductive health care, we urge you to quickly initiate the rulemaking process to strengthen privacy protections for reproductive health information. In particular, HHS should update the HIPAA Privacy Rule to broadly restrict regulated entities from sharing individuals’ reproductive health information without explicit consent, particularly for law enforcement, civil, or criminal proceedings premised on the provision of abortion care.In addition, while HHS moves forward with the rulemaking process, the Department should take the following steps to improve awareness and enforcement of current privacy protections in the HIPAA Privacy Rule:Our nation faces a crisis in access to reproductive health services, and some states have already begun to investigate and punish women seeking abortion care. It is critical that HHS take all available action to fully protect women’s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially seek medical care. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.Sincerely, "

https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-kaine-colleagues-applaud-house-passage-of-bill-to-protect-merit-based-federal-workforce-system-federal-workers-rights,"Today, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) joined Senator Tim Kaine (D-Va.), along with Senators Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and Ben Cardin (D-Md.), to applaud House passage of the Preventing a Patronage System Act, legislation led by Senator Kaine to prevent any position in the federal civil service from being reclassified outside of merit system principles without the express consent of Congress. The bill would secure the civil service system and safeguard tens of thousands of federal employees from losing job protections and due process rights.  “From protecting our national security to administering Social Security benefits, our civil servants are invaluable to keeping our government running and providing critical services to Americans,” said the senators. “We’re glad to see the House of Representatives pass our bill to protect the merit-based hiring system for our federal workforce, and we’ll be pushing to follow suit in the Senate.”Companion legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.-11). It passed out of the House Committee on Rules on September 13 and passed the full House by a 225-204 vote.The federal workforce is comprised of roughly 2 million federal employees hired on the basis of their acumen. They work each day for the American people — serving in a myriad of capacities to improve this nation and America’s posture abroad, including researching vaccines, helping families in the wake of hurricanes and deadly fires, and inspecting our food to ensure it is safe to eat.On October 21, 2020, President Trump signed Executive Order 13957 creating Schedule F in the excepted government service. The excepted government service is any federal or civil service positions that are not in the competitive service or the Senior Executive Service. This executive order, had it not been repealed by President Biden in January 2021, would have allowed agency heads to reclassify “confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating” positions to a newly created Schedule F category of federal employees that would remove their due process rights and civil service protections. This would have undermined the merit system principles of our federal workforce, by making it easier for any administration to hire political loyalists and fire qualified nonpartisan experts. According to press reports, the Office of Management and Budget under Trump planned to reclassify 88% of its workforce under Schedule F. Trump reportedly plans to reinstate Schedule F immediately if reelected to the presidency, which would allow him to fire up to 50,000 federal workers and replace them with political hires. Currently, new presidents can make about 4,000 political appointments, approximately 1,200 of which must be confirmed by the Senate. Trump’s move could increase the number of political appointments from 4,000 to approximately 50,000.The Preventing a Patronage System Act would prevent any position in the competitive service from being reclassified to Schedule F pursuant to President Trump’s Executive Order signed on October 21, 2020. This would prevent future administrations from creating new employee classifications in order to hire more political loyalists and fire nonpartisan experts."
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-booker-lee-davis-introduce-bill-to-improve-access-to-care-for-americans-with-sickle-cell-disease,"Today, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.), along with U.S. Representatives Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) and Danny Davis (D-Ill.) introduced the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Centers Act, legislation to improve access to care for Americans living with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Approximately 100,000 Americans are currently living with SCD, an inherited blood disorder that causes pain, infection, and stroke. The disease disproportionately affects Black Americans but is also found among people from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. But despite the prevalence of the disease and the need for consistent and coordinated treatment, few patients have access to multidisciplinary care teams. During a press conference on Capitol Hill to announce the new legislation, the lawmakers were joined by SCD patients, health care leaders, and advocates who discussed the importance of making Sickle Cell care more available and accessible through the new legislation. Also in attendance was Kimberley Davis, the mother of John Amara Walters, a member of Senator Van Hollen’s legislative staff who died of complications from SCD last year at the age of 29.The lawmakers’ bill will grow the network of care for SCD by creating a “hub-and-spoke” framework for the delivery of SCD care. The bill establishes a new $535 million annual grant program to provide federal funding opportunities for hospitals with current SCD programs to expand their services to community health and outpatient centers, in order to help address the shortage of comprehensive treatment centers and so patients can access care and other services closer to their homes.“For the tens of thousands of Americans living with Sickle Cell Disease, accessing care can be near-impossible. And the lack of accessible care is not just an inconvenience – for some patients it’s life or death. This gap in care is unacceptable. That’s why we’re introducing this legislation to broaden the reach of existing Sickle Cell centers so we can bring treatment into the countless communities that don’t yet have it,” said Senator Van Hollen. “A new national network of Sickle Cell care would redefine how we treat this disease in the United States – and ensure nobody falls through the cracks. This is the next step forward in a long fight to provide Sickle Cell patients with the services they need, and I’m committed to moving it across the finish line.” “This unprecedented legislation being introduced by Senator Van Hollen today, honoring my and our dear John, will make a measurable difference in the lives of families living with Sickle Cell Disease living in all areas of our nation. It cannot be underestimated how there will be a much more measurable positive trajectory of Sickle Cell Disease care and treatment achieved with these substantive underpinnings in funding and structure of care and support to this large important community. Adults, children, caregivers and families; medical, educational, social and community professionals—the entire Sickle Cell Disease family nationwide—will benefit from a sea of change that benefits all impacted. While we truly miss and long for John’s physical presence here today, his incredible legacy of public service contributions to the good of United States will live on,” said Kimberley Davis.“Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that affects thousands of Americans, disproportionately people of African descent, with devastating outcomes,” Senator Booker said. “Despite being one of the most common genetic blood diseases, Americans with sickle cell disease continue to face barriers when trying to access comprehensive integrative treatment. That is why I am proud to introduce this bicameral legislation that will establish and fund treatment centers across the U.S. as well as vital training and education resources for patients and providers.”“Even though sickle cell disease is the most common inherited blood disorder in the United States,Congress has not introduced a comprehensive and national bill on the disease since the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act of 1972. Over 3 million people in the US have the sickle cell trait, and many are unaware of their status. This includes a large number of African Americans, who are disproportionally affected. Senator Van Hollen, Senator Booker, Rep. Davis and I are working to address this disparity and other inequities and raise awareness among our colleagues.This bill is long overdue, and we won’t stop fighting until it’s on President Biden’s desk for signature,” said Representative Barbara Lee.“Sickle Cell is a disease that currently affects an estimated 100,000 Americans, with an additional 2 million carrying the trait,” said Rep. Davis. “Furthermore, it is a disease that disproportionally impacts the lives of African Americans more so than that of any other ethnic group in the United States. Better treatments and outcomes for patient’s affected by Sickle Cell Disease do not happen by chance. Rather, it comes as a product of the hard work and sacrifice by countless individuals across this great nation. Every day, progress continues to be made toward the advancement of more effective forms of medical care. I know that increased resources for research and clinical trials is the key to developing more effective medication options and a cure for sickle cell disease. As the co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Sickle Cell Disease Caucus, I remain committed to championing the fight for quality, health care that provides a cure for Sickle Cell Warriors and their families.”“The Sickle Cell Disease Association of America is composed of 53 community-based organizations that do the challenging on-the-ground work of caring for sickle cell patients and their families who have been left behind by our health system. With the funding in this bill for the hub-and-spoke model of care, these organizations will be ready to help create a national infrastructure for sickle cell patients to get treatment wherever they are. I want to thank Senator Van Hollen, Senator Booker, Congressman Davis, and Congresswoman Lee for their hard work on the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Centers Act and their dedication to improving care and treatment for our sickle cell warriors,” said Regina Hartfield, President and CEO, Sickle Cell Disease Association of America.“Children's National Hospital and its Comprehensive Sickle Cell Disease Program enthusiastically support the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Centers Act of 2022. We believe this monumental healthcare legislation will benefit thousands of patients living with Sickle Cell Disease in the U.S. The network of 128 Treatment Centers and 110 community-based organizations will significantly mitigate the limited access to Sickle Cell Disease comprehensive care that many patients and families experience locally. The introduction of this legislation is a significant step in closing the health care disparities and addressing the unmet needs of Sickle Cell Disease patients and families,” saidAndrew Campbell, MD, Director, Comprehensive Sickle Cell Disease Program, Children's National Hospital.This bill establishes a National Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Center Grant Program, authorized at $535 million annually, which will enable hospitals that offer SCD specialized care to partner with more accessible community health centers and outpatient centers to implement a hub-and-spoke framework for the delivery of care and treatment of patients with SCD. The medical hubs and spokes would be required to partner with community-based organizations to provide education, outreach, and help coordinate social services for patients. These networks will be equipped to provide patients with: Additionally, the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Centers Act establishes a national coordinating center to work in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to oversee the hub-and-spoke networks as well as collect and distribute data, best practices, and other findings regarding the activities funded by the federal grants.This legislation has been endorsed by Sickle Cell Disease Association of America, American Society of Hematology, Sick Cells, Maryland Sickle Cell Disease Association, Sickle Cell Coalition of Maryland, Johns Hopkins Medicine, Children’s National Hospital, and Loma Linda University Children’s Hospital.“The American Society of Hematology (ASH) applauds Senator Van Hollen for introducing the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Centers Act of 2022, which calls for the establishment of a national network of medical and community-based centers to advance and meet the health care needs of people living with Sickle Cell Disease. As a Society with a long-standing commitment to improving care for individuals living with SCD, we are grateful for Senator Van Hollen’s dedication to addressing the burden of SCD and look forward to continuing to work with the Senator as the bill moves forward,” said ASH President Jane N. Winter, MD, of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine.“MSCDA couldn't be more pleased that the Senator is continuing his support of Sickle Cell Disease with the introduction of this important legislation! This is an exciting time for the Sickle Cell Disease community. Three new therapies have been approved since 2017, more therapies are in various stages of development and curative options such as bone marrow transplants are improving, and gene therapy is very promising. However, without a comprehensive model of care and services being in place, access to, and knowledge of, these advances will not be realized by many. Sen. Van Hollen’s Sickle Cell Treatment Centers Act of 2022 will address the glaring gap in comprehensive care that exists for Sickle Cell Disease. We are pleased to see that the Act would create a system of comprehensive care centers that will be essential to ensuring those living with sickle cell will have access to current and future treatments. We believe that an important aspect of the Act is that it not only will provide access to treatment centers but also to services provided by community based organizations. The Maryland Sickle Cell Disease Association (MSCDA) endorses, without hesitation, The Sickle Cell Treatment Centers Act because it is precisely what the sickle cell community needs right now so that those that those affected by this devastating disorder can have access to the treatments that will allow them to live their lives to their full potential,” said Derek Robertson, MBA, JD, CHC, President of the Maryland Sickle Cell Disease Association. ""You only have to see one child writhing in pain from sickle cell disease, to know what a historic missed opportunity it has been, to not have invested in “care and cure” for this dreadful condition that disproportionally affects the most disadvantaged group of people in the United States. The Sickle Cell Treatment Centers Act has the power to revolutionize access to care and aid in understanding the barriers that have made this disease so unassailable. It will address the unmet need in sickle cell disease care delivery, by supporting sickle cell centers to become centers of excellence, putting the focus on disease prevention and eradication as a unified nationwide network of treatment centers,” said Dr. Akshat Jain of Loma Linda University Children’s Hospital.“The Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Centers Act of 2022 offers a bold, new, system-wide approach to structuring comprehensive care for Sickle Cell Disease. For a community that has lacked full medical and social support, relevant data, and needed auxiliary services for so long, this legislation illustrates what stakeholders might achieve through a collaborative approach with dedicated funding,” said Ashley Valentine, President & Co-founder, Sick Cells. Text of the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Centers Act is here, and a one-page summary is available here. "

The Senators fought to include their proposal, which was initially laid out in their Service to the Fleet Act, legislation they introduced in June. The two Senators had urged Commerce Committee leaders to include the provisions of their legislation in the larger Coast Guard Authorization Act. The measure can now be considered on the floor by the full Senate.“For over 100 years, the Coast Guard Yard has played a critical role in the Coast Guard mission – serving as the core of all its ship-building and repair needs. It not only has been vital in supporting our national security, it’s also a key economic driver in our state, employing thousands of Marylanders directly and supporting additional good-paying, local jobs. That’s why we’ve been fighting for this critical infrastructure investment to modernize the Yard and ensure it can continue delivering for Maryland and our nation for another hundred years,” said Senator Van Hollen. “I was glad to see the Commerce Committee pass our proposal on a bipartisan basis today. This is an important step forward, and we’ll keep pushing to get this crucial investment all the way through Congress and onto President Biden’s desk – because the Yard and its dedicated workforce need a 21st century infrastructure to build and maintain a modern and effective fleet.”“The Coast Guard Yard is an important national asset that we are proud to have located in Curtis Bay, Maryland. Generations of Marylanders have serviced and built the fleets of both the Coast Guard and other branches of our armed services. I have been proud to work with Senator Van Hollen to secure long-overdue infrastructure investments,” said Senator Cardin. “The bipartisan support from the Commerce Committee reflects this important national role, and I look forward to working with members of the committee to move this funding forward.”The Coast Guard Yard has been in operation since 1899 and serves as the U.S. Coast Guard’s only shipbuilding and major repair facility. The Yard employs 2,200 full-time personnel and is a critical national security asset that supports not only the Coast Guard’s fleet but also the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), among other federal government agencies. However, the infrastructure at the Yard was built almost entirely during World War II and is outdated for 21st century operations and future missions.Senators Van Hollen and Cardin introduced the Service to the Fleet Act to provide funding for the Coast Guard to carry out its infrastructure modernization plan for the Yard, which will better equip the Coast Guard to service new classes of larger and more technologically-advanced ships while improving conditions for the workforce. The Yard’s infrastructure modernization plan includes right-sizing facilities, repositioning work sites and project resources, increasing the productive capacity of the various shops, and streamlining transport systems, among other improvements. The Senators then wrote to Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) – the Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, respectively – urging them to include these provisions in the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2022.In addition to providing funding for the Yard, the bipartisan Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2022 will address other infrastructure repair and replacement backlogs, help boost the Coast Guard’s Arctic presence, and crack down on illegal fishing and forced labor, among other national priorities. A section-by-section outline of the legislation is here."

Following her death, my colleagues and I requested an independent investigation led by the United States as well as answers to basic questions around her shooting and a copy of the report produced by the U.S. Security Coordinator. This amendment will ensure that the Senate will receive the USSC report as we requested in July – and I’m glad that it was adopted by the Foreign Relations Committee. I will continue pressing for full accountability and transparency around the death of Shireen – anything less is unacceptable.”  Senator Van Hollen’s amendment was included in the Manager’s package of the Department of State Authorization Act, passed by the Foreign Relations Committee today, and will now head to the floor for consideration before the full Senate. Senator Van Hollen has led two letters calling for answers on the shooting death of Shireen Abu Akleh, which can be found here and here. The text of the Senator’s amendment is below. SEC. 716. REPORT OF SHOOTING OF PALESTINIAN-AMERICAN JOURNALIST IN JENIN. Not later than 14 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives a complete copy, in classified or unclassified format, as appropriate, of the report overseen by the United States Security Coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority regarding the circumstances surrounding the shooting of Shireen Abu Akleh in Jenin on May 11, 2022."
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-cardin-portman-introduce-resolution-to-approve-location-for-a-national-memorial-to-fallen-journalists,"U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) joined in introducing a resolution led by Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) that would authorize placement of the National Memorial to Fallen Journalists between the Voice of America building and the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian. The establishment of the memorial, which was signed into law last Congress, will honor journalists, photographers, and broadcasters killed in the line of duty. The joint resolution on the specific location comes one week after the murder of Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German, who allegedly was killed by the subject of one of his investigations.“Enshrining our nation’s support for a free and vibrant press is essential to the health of our democracy. Thousands of journalists across the globe, our country, and right here at home have lost their lives while upholding the First Amendment, reporting the news, and bringing us the facts,” said Senator Van Hollen. “This memorial will honor the lives of fallen journalists around the world and serve as a tribute to those who were killed here in Maryland at the Capital Gazette shooting – Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen, John McNamara, Rebecca Smith, and Wendi Winters. I will continue fighting to support a free press here and around the globe and to ensure we never forget the dedication of these fallen journalists.”“The National Memorial to Fallen Journalists will honor the lives of those who died reporting the news and supporting the media on behalf of the American people. Just last week, Jeff German was killed for doing his job and reporting the news wherever it led. He is the latest reporter to be a victim,” said Senator Cardin. “Transparency and unbiased journalism are essential in a democracy and this new memorial will be a steadfast symbol of the sacrifice of those who take on this responsibility. The men and women who personify the First Amendment rights granted to every citizen have made our nation stronger.”""A free and open press is essential to our democracy, and I’m pleased to join Senator Cardin in introducing this permanent resolution to authorize placement of the National Memorial to Fallen Journalists,” said Senator Portman. “This memorial will serve as a fitting tribute to the men and women in journalism who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in the defense of the First Amendment.” The resolution approves a location for a commemorative work honoring fallen journalists that will maintain the “commitment of the United States to a free press by honoring the journalists who sacrificed their lives in service to that cause.” The memorial will be located on federal lands in “Area I” as determined by the Secretary of the Interior. Funding for the National Park Service or General Services Administration to construct and maintain the memorial will be provided by the Fallen Journalists Memorial (FJM) Foundation. "

This funding will be awarded to Brooke’s House in Hagerstown through the Appalachian Regional Commission’s INSPIRE competition and will support truck-driving training and wraparound services for women in recovery from substance use.“The opioid epidemic has stolen the lives of too many Marylanders but the graduates from Brooke’s House serve as powerful examples that recovery is possible with the right support. After the death of their own daughter from addiction, Dana and Kevin Simmers founded Brooke’s House – a community-based treatment center that helps women go on to live full and productive lives. This fall, I was fortunate to meet them as well as some of the incredible women who had completed their treatment at Brooke’s House and hear their stories. This federal investment will help Brooke’s House continue to support recovering women and ensure their success. I will keep working alongside Brooke’s House and other community partners to secure federal investments that help provide support and job training for Marylanders in recovery,” said Senator Van Hollen. “Brooke’s House does critical work to both help young women overcome substance use disorders and prepare them to successfully reenter the workforce once in recovery. Their commitment to supporting our communities and battling the ongoing opioid crisis is commendable,” said Senator Cardin. “Team Maryland is proud to secure this funding, which will help Brooke’s House residents smoothly transition into employment through trainings in high-demand skills such as truck driving. I’d like to thank Brooke’s House for all that they do and look forward to our continued partnership.”“I’ve had the honor of working closely with Kevin Simmers and the Brooke’s House family since the beginning, and I couldn’t be more impressed with the impact they’ve made on the lives of their residents and community,” said Congressman David Trone. “This funding will allow Brooke’s House to continue its excellent work to support more women in their recovery and help them succeed through meaningful workforce development. I look forward to continuing to work together to change lives and ending the opioid crisis once and for all.”Brooke’s House provides a community-based, safe, and emotionally supportive living environment for adult women in the early stages of substance abuse recovery. Providing a home-like facility, Brooke’s House ensures state-of-the-art treatment and recovery services and resources to help residents move forward to achieve their dreams of living drug-free and productive lives. Brooke’s House was founded by Kevin and Dana Simmers to honor the life of their daughter, Brooke Simmers, who lost her life to an opioid overdose in 2015."

https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-colleagues-urge-biden-to-provide-student-debt-relief-for-parent-borrowers,"Today, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) led several of his democratic colleagues in a letter to President Biden urging the Administration to provide student debt relief to parent borrowers. Following the President’s historic actions to address student debt, the Senators press the Administration to also expand this relief to parent borrowers who are often left behind as we work to address the crisis as a whole. To help reduce barriers for parent borrowers, the Senators ask the Administration to extend the additional $10,000 in student debt forgiveness to Parent PLUS borrowers whose children were Pell Grant recipients and to ensure improvements to student loan forgiveness programs include Parent PLUS borrowers. Currently, there are over 3.6 million Parent PLUS borrowers owing more than $107 billion – a large percentage of which are parents whose children have received Pell Grants.The Senators write, “We write to urge you to consider Parent PLUS borrowers in any administrative changes and executive actions you undertake to improve the Department of Education’s (Department’s) student loan programs and provide student loan relief. Currently, there are over 3.6 million Parent PLUS borrowers owing more than $107 billion, accounting for about 10% of all student loan debt. Congress created the Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (Parent PLUS) loan program in the 1980 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act to meet demands for increased federal student lending and as a response to families who needed assistance covering their expected family contribution.” “However, the increased access to lending came at a high cost for parent borrowers and their families. The Parent PLUS program has less favorable terms than other types of federal student loan programs, including higher interest rates and origination fees,” they continue. The Senators note, “Recent studies show that an increasing number of Parent PLUS borrowers are among the lowest income families receiving Pell Grants, have among the lowest estimated family contributions (EFCs), and are typically parents of students attending public institutions or Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Parent PLUS loan debt also impacts low-income Black and Latino families disproportionally.”   “We know that this Administration is deeply committed to reducing wealth disparities in our nation by tackling student loan debt for all borrowers, including Parent PLUS borrowers. Thus, we urge you to ensure the additional $10,000 in student debt forgiveness is extended to Parent PLUS borrowers whose children were Pell Grant recipients, granted they meet the same income thresholds established in your student loan cancellation plan,” they stress.  “By reducing barriers to this program for Parent PLUS borrowers and ensuring they are included in debt relief, we will move one step closer to remedying program-wide issues for these borrowers, narrowing the wealth gap, and addressing our country’s student loan debt crisis. We strongly urge the Administration and the Department of Education to incorporate Parent PLUS borrowers in any administrative improvements to federal student loan programs, including the Public Service Loan Forgiveness and Income-Driven Repayment programs, extensions or creation of waivers, and in the implementation of executive actions to provide student debt relief,” the Senators close. Joining Senator Van Hollen on the letter are Senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii). The full text of the letter is available here and below. Dear President Biden: Thank you for extending the pause on federal student loans and your plan to provide student debt cancellation for the millions of Americans in need of immediate relief. This meaningful cancellation will provide relief to 95% of all federal student loan borrowers, changing the lives of millions of Americans held back from financial stability and economic opportunity by the burden of student loan debt. We write to urge you to consider Parent PLUS borrowers in any administrative changes and executive actions you undertake to improve the Department of Education’s (Department’s) student loan programs and provide student loan relief.   Currently, there are over 3.6 million Parent PLUS borrowers owing more than $107 billion, accounting for about 10% of all student loan debt. Congress created the Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (Parent PLUS) loan program in the 1980 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act to meet demands for increased federal student lending and as a response to families who needed assistance covering their expected family contribution. In 1992, Congress removed caps on this type of lending, allowing parents to borrow up to the full cost of attendance and increasing access to higher education opportunities for students with the greatest need.However, the increased access to lending came at a high cost for parent borrowers and their families. The Parent PLUS program has less favorable terms than other types of federal student loan programs, including higher interest rates and origination fees. Under the Higher Education Act, the origination fee for Parent PLUS loans is nearly four times higher than the origination fee for Stafford loans offered by the Department of Education (Department). In addition, the current interest rate for Parent PLUS borrowers is nearly double the interest rate of other types of undergraduate loans offered by the Department, with an astounding cap of 10.5% for these borrowers. High origination fees and high interest rates for Parent PLUS borrowers have forced the lowest income borrowers, Black, Brown, and older borrowers to face difficult tradeoffs in order to keep up with student loan payments, resulting in possible loan default or, in the case for some seniors, offsets in Social Security benefits. Recent studies show that an increasing number of Parent PLUS borrowers are among the lowest income families receiving Pell Grants, have among the lowest estimated family contributions (EFCs), and are typically parents of students attending public institutions or Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Parent PLUS loan debt also impacts low-income Black and Latino families disproportionally. A study based on Department calculations found that, in 2018, about 42% of Black Parent PLUS borrowers and 26% of Latino/a Parent PLUS borrowers had a zero EFC, while only 8% of white Parent PLUS borrowers had a zero EFC. A substantial portion of the children of Parent PLUS borrowers are Pell recipients, including 50% at public colleges and universities, 71% at for-profit colleges, and 80% at HBCUs.Upon graduation, the average Parent PLUS loan debt held by a student’s family member is $30,860. After ten years of repayment, over half of that initial balance remains, due in part to high interest charges each month. Parent PLUS borrowers for students who attended the fifty colleges with highest shares of white undergraduate students owe an average of 47% of their principal over the same time period. For Parent PLUS borrowers whose children attended the fifty colleges with highest shares of Black undergraduate enrollment their remaining balance is higher, owing an average of 96% of their loan principal after ten years of repayment. These disparities in repayment outcomes, coupled with the systematic barriers that Parent PLUS borrowers face in accessing student loan forgiveness programs, if left unaddressed, could exacerbate the racial wealth gap for families across this nation.Parent PLUS borrowers who are disabled, seniors, or approaching retirement are at risk of being pushed into precarious financial circumstances. In 2016, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that 55,200 disabled or retired Parent PLUS borrowers had defaulted on their student loans, and over 13% of those borrowers saw portions of their Social Security benefits garnished as a result. Additionally, more than half of borrowers who had such offsets in fiscal year 2015 were receiving Social Security disability benefits rather than Social Security retirement income. While Parent PLUS loans account for about one in fourteen of all outstanding federal loans, the GAO reports that one in three of the senior borrowers whose Social Security payments were subject to offsets had a Parent PLUS loan at some point in time. Social Security was designed to help Americans achieve the secure retirement they have earned and provide a critical safety-net for people with disabilities who are unable to work. Parent PLUS loans should not force seniors into a difficult retirement and financial vulnerability.Furthermore, Parent PLUS borrowers are met with limited options in regard to federal student loan forgiveness programs. Parent PLUS loans are ineligible for all but one of the Department’s income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which calculate borrowers’ payments based on a percent of discretionary income and family size. Parent PLUS borrowers are only eligible for the income-contingent repayment (ICR) plan, which requires borrowers to pay the highest share of discretionary income of all the IDR plans. Parent PLUS borrowers also face numerous hurdles to qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. To qualify under current law, Parent PLUS borrowers must consolidate their loans into Direct Loans and enroll in the income-driven repayment plan that is the least generous to borrowers. Like all borrowers seeking PSLF, they must also make 120 qualifying monthly payments within 15 days of the due date and certify employment for a qualifying employer for jobs held on or after October 1, 2007. Borrowers are only eligible if they, not their child, are in qualifying employment. The PSLF program is a promise to borrowers who pursue careers in service that the government will support them with loan relief. To fulfil this promise to public servants, we must also recognize student families’ contributions to financing their children’s education through costly Parent PLUS loans.We are pleased to see the pause on federal student loans extended through December 31, 2022 and the Department’s proposed rule to allow eligible borrowers to cap monthly payments on undergraduate loans at 5% of their monthly income – down from 10% today – while shielding more income from repayment and preventing debts from ballooning over time. We especially applaud this Administration’s cancellation of up to $10,000 per borrower making less than $125,000 a year (for an individual) or $250,000 (for married couples and heads of household), and the up to $20,000 for such borrowers who received Pell Grants. We know that this Administration is deeply committed to reducing wealth disparities in our nation by tackling student loan debt for all borrowers, including Parent PLUS borrowers. Thus, we urge you to ensure the additional $10,000 in student debt forgiveness is extended to Parent PLUS borrowers whose children were Pell Grant recipients, granted they meet the same income thresholds established in your student loan cancellation plan. These borrowers demonstrated significant financial need at the time they borrowed the PLUS loan, as evidenced by the fact that their students qualified for Pell Grants based on family income. Like student borrowers who received Pell Grants, these borrowers also face numerous barriers to successful repayment and should receive relief.We appreciate the Administration’s historic efforts to address the past failures of the federal student loan programs and the harm done by institutions and pervasive mismanagement by loan servicers. However, we remain concerned that in some of these actions Parent PLUS borrowers have been left out. The Department’s April 2022 announcement on the forthcoming IDR payment adjustment neglected to specifically address ways that the waiver would address shortcomings of the program for Parent PLUS borrowers. Under the limited PSLF waiver, Parent PLUS loans alone, even if consolidated, are not eligible. Without addressing this group of borrowers, any improvements to these programs will fall short in adequately addressing the multigenerational student loan debt crisis many families are facing. By reducing barriers to this program for Parent PLUS borrowers and ensuring they are included in debt relief, we will move one step closer to remedying program-wide issues for these borrowers, narrowing the wealth gap, and addressing our country’s student loan debt crisis. We strongly urge the Administration and the Department of Education to incorporate Parent PLUS borrowers in any administrative improvements to federal student loan programs, including the Public Service Loan Forgiveness and Income-Driven Repayment programs, extensions or creation of waivers, and in the implementation of executive actions to provide student debt relief. Thank you for your consideration of this request."

Raskin and David Trone (all D-Md.) announced $108,942 in federal funding for the National Park Service to support the reconstruction of portions of the Chesapeake and Ohio National Historical Park and George Washington Memorial Parkway that suffered severe damage due to heavy rains and flooding.“Climate change has already taken a toll on our local roadways and infrastructure. This federal investment will allow for much-needed repairs to Maryland’s transportation network – from our roads to local visitor centers. It will help fix serious damage sustained from extreme flooding in recent years and highlights yet another example of the need to upgrade and rebuild our infrastructure to withstand severe weather events driven by climate change,” the lawmakers said. “That is why Team Maryland fought to pass the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and why we will continue fighting to secure federal funding that bolsters the resilience of communities.” Funding comes through an Emergency Relief program within the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration to repair damaged roads and bridges. The award includes multiple project sites at Chesapeake and Ohio National Historical Park impacting both Maryland and Washington D.C. — Great Falls access road & fee booth, Great Falls Tavern, Pennyfield parking lot and access road, Fletcher's Boathouse Bridge #1, and Fletcher's Boathouse Tunnel — and the south section of the George Washington Memorial Parkway in Alexandria, Virginia."
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-merkley-smith-colleagues-sound-alarm-on-unlawful-charges-for-prep-patients,"Today, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) joined Senators Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Tina Smith (D-Minn.) alongside Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) in a letter to AHIP, the trade association representing health insurance companies. The letter expresses concerns about the continued practice of unlawfully charging individuals for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medication and related care.The Senators' letter follows a Wednesday court ruling that further threatens affordable access to PrEP. As the legal process moves forward, the Senators pressed the health insurance industry to abide by current law to provide medication and ancillary services without charge. “It has been brought to our attention that enrollees in your members’ health plans continue to be charged for necessary medications and ancillary services—including provider consultations and laboratory services—contrary to law and additional federal guidance issued by the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Treasury,” wrote the Senators. “We write to express our deep concern with these erroneous and unlawful charges, and to request additional information on steps that AHIP is taking to ensure that its members adhere to federal law and ensure the PrEP drugs and the full scope of PrEP ancillary services are offered without charge to enrollees.” A 2019 ruling by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) gave PrEP an “A” rating as prevention intervention for people at risk of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This ruling brought PrEP under section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, which requires insurance coverage for services or interventions that have been given an ““A” or “B” rating from the USPSTF. Subsequent guidance, published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in July 2021, further clarified their ruling. Noting that “plans and issuers must cover PrEP consistent with the USPSTF recommendation without cost sharing,” the ruling goes on to clarify that PrEP is not just the medication, but also all of its necessary related services including testing, screening, and provider visits. Despite this ruling and subsequent clarification, individuals are still being wrongly charged out-of-pocket expenses relating to their PrEP care. “In light of this clear guidance from CMS, we are alarmed by continual reports that patients are routinely billed, either for payment-in-full or for cost-sharing practices, related to medically-appropriate medications and essential services,” they continued. “These costs can be daunting. HIV advocates and clinical workers across the county have reported that many patients are unaware that they do not have to pay out-of-pocket for PrEP and ancillary services, assuming that many of these costs are simply necessary for being on PrEP medication.”The Senators’ letter highlights the inequities in PrEP uptake across communities at higher risk for HIV—including Black and Hispanic communities and transgender women—due to limited access to financial resources needed to cover costs of PrEP and associated medical visits and laboratory tests, among other factors. In light of these concerns, the lawmakers ask the following questions and request a response from AHIP within 30 days:The letter is supported by PrEP4ALL, the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, the Center for Health and Democracy, and NMAC.“Unfortunately we have documented dozens of cases of insurers still charging patients out-of-pocket fees for PrEP-related care, a year after CMS and the Department of Labor issued their guidance,” said Kenyon Farrow, Managing Director of Advocacy & Organizing with PrEP4ALL. “Ending the HIV epidemic will require us to ensure everyone with insurance be able to get PrEP services with no cost-sharing, as the rule intended. We applaud Sen. Merkley and Sen. Smith’s tireless advocacy on behalf of patients."" “We appreciate Senators Merkley and Smith’s leadership and all their colleagues desire to ensure that the preventative service provisions of the Affordable Care Act are properly implemented. Private insurers must provide PrEP drugs and associated services without patient cost-sharing. We are receiving too many complaints from PrEP users that this is not always happening. We trust with this letter insurers will ensure full compliance,” said Carl Schmid, Executive Director of the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute.“While appalling, it’s sadly not shocking to see Big Health Insurance wrongfully billing enrollees for medications and ancillary services as part of a PrEP regimen to prevent HIV, despite crystal clear guidance from the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury not to do so,” said Wendell Potter, President of the Center for Health and Democracy. “We’re grateful for the leadership of Senators Merkley and Smith for sending this letter, underscoring their understanding of the effectiveness of PrEP and their compassion for those at risk and their families.”Full text of the letter can be found here and follows below:Dear Mr. Eyles We write today regarding recent reports of patients across the country receiving bills and charges from AHIP members for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drugs that prevent HIV, along with necessary ancillary services, as part of the PrEP regimen. It has been brought to our attention that enrollees in your members’ health plans continue to be charged for necessary medications and ancillary services—including provider consultations and laboratory services—contrary to law and additional federal guidance issued by the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Treasury. We write to express our deep concern with these erroneous and unlawful charges, and to request additional information on steps that AHIP is taking to ensure that its members adhere to federal law and ensure the PrEP drugs and the full scope of PrEP ancillary services are offered without charge to enrollees. As you know, a 2019 ruling by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) gave PrEP an “A” rating as a prevention intervention for people at risk of HIV infection. The Public Health Services Act (PHS Act) section 2713 states that non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered group or individual health insurance coverage must provide coverage for, and must not impose any cost-sharing requirements, for services or interventions that have been given an “A” or “B” rating by the USPSTF.While this statutory requirement for payers remains the law of the land, the requirement has been further clarified in additional federal guidance, including in those issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Indeed, in a July 2021 document published by CMS, the agency noted that “plans and issuers must cover PrEP consistent with the USPSTF recommendation without cost-sharing…” In its recommendation, the USPTF cites guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), stating that PrEP is a comprehensive intervention comprised of antiretroviral medication in addition to essential support services.Indeed, CMS continued on to clarify that PrEP is not just the medication, but includes the full scope of essential medical services associated with the PrEP regimen, explicitly citing initial clinical assessments and ongoing monitoring of patients including HIV testing; hepatitis B and C testing; creatinine testing; sexually-transmitted infection (STI) testing and counseling, and other services essential to the efficacy of the PrEP regimen as outlined by the CDC guidelines for PrEP. In light of this clear guidance from CMS, we are alarmed by continual reports that patients are routinely billed, either for payment-in-full or for cost-sharing practices, related to medically-appropriate medications and essential services. These costs can be daunting. HIV advocates and clinical workers across the county have reported that many patients are unaware that they do not have to pay out-of-pocket for PrEP and ancillary services, assuming that many of these costs are simply necessary for being on PrEP medication. In some cases, these patients can pay over $1,000 per year when federal law states that they should pay nothing. Consumers who attempt to challenge these illegal cost sharing charges with their plans routinely find that claims are turned over to collections, causing anxiety and stress, and in many cases, prompting individuals to discontinue PrEP.The impact of these costs on patient access and public health more generally cannot be understated. Multiple academic studies have indicated that associated costs—including the costs of ancillary services—present a barrier to PrEP access in the United States, despite its incredible effectiveness of reducing the risk of HIV acquisition. Inequities in PrEP uptake persist across communities at higher risk for HIV—including Black and Hispanic communities and transgender women—because of limited access to financial resources to cover costs of PrEP and associated medical visits and laboratory tests, among other factors.While we recognize that partnerships with laboratories and health care providers, including accurate billing and coding, may present challenges, the statutory language of the PHSA section 2713  is clear in indicating that issuers, and issuers alone, are legally required to be compliant with providing coverage for PrEP, including the full scope of necessary related services, without cost-sharing. In light of these concerns, and the role we request responses to the following questions within 30 days of receipt of this letter: Thank you again for your attention to this pressing matter impacting public health in our country. "

The bipartisan TICKER Act aims to protect American investors from risky investments in Variable Interest Entities (VIE), which was one of the key recommendations of the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission in their latest report to Congress. Senator Chris Van Hollen said, “Following the passage of my Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, the SEC is already taking action to help ensure Chinese companies operating on US markets are held to the same standards as other foreign companies, in order to better protect American investors. This legislation will go a step further by ensuring investors are aware of particularly risky foreign companies that leave investors without any legal recourse or direct ownership interests, and ensure they have the tools necessary to make informed decisions about their holdings."" Senator Rick Scott said, “Every day, American investors unknowingly invest their hard-earned dollars in entities linked to, owned or controlled by the Communist Chinese regime. These investments carry enormous risks and could result in massive but completely preventable losses. Passing the TICKER Act will ensure that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) uses its resources and authority to protect both U.S. investors and American financial markets, and creates greater transparency regarding the grave risks posed by entities linked to Communist China.”Within 180 days after becoming law, the TICKER Act would require the Securities and Exchange Commission to make clear to investors the potential high risk for investments in VIEs linked to foreign companies, including those based in the People’s Republic of China, by: "

This Administration has faced significant challenges in this work, including the numerous discriminatory policies enacted by the previous administration, the implications of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the need to evacuate over 70,000 Afghans through Operation Allies Welcome.”“Through your leadership of this interagency effort, we urge you to rapidly adjudicate refugee cases, in particular family reunification cases; to prioritize the implementation of reforms outlined in Executive Order 14013; and to collaborate substantively with Congress and with the refugee resettlement agencies to increase the pace of this work.” The senators include more than a dozen questions seeking more details on processing capacity of the USRAP, as the consultation process for the FY23 Presidential Determination begins.The full letter is available here. “The current Administration has taken important steps to rebuild the USRAP. But thousands of refugees have been waiting their turn for years, and for some time is running out. They’ve lost years that they could have spent rebuilding their lives and enriching our communities. Instead, they wait, they struggle, and try not to lose hope. As the world only gets more dangerous for religious minorities, political activists, women leaders, and others who face persecution, we call on the Administration to aim high with an FY23 admissions goal of 200,000. We look to our champions in Congress to provide resources to achieve this target. Now is the moment for the U.S. to reclaim its position as a leader in refugee resettlement,” said Melanie Nezer, Senior Vice President of Global Public Affairs, HIAS.""The need to rebuild and strengthen the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program has never been greater. As we face the worst refugee crisis in history, the United States has a moral obligation to invest in our capacity to welcome and make the necessary improvements to increase refugee arrivals,"" said Meredith Owen, Director of Policy and Advocacy at Church World Service. ""CWS calls on the administration to meaningfully consult with Congress and set the FY 2023 refugee admissions goal of 200,000, in line with global need. before September 30th.

This grant is funded by the American Rescue Plan.This project will support construction of laboratory and office space to assist small, tech-based businesses as they work to grow and create new jobs and economic opportunities. The EDA investment will be matched with $1.2 million in local funds and is expected to create or retain more than 320 jobs and generate $125 million in private investment, according to grantee estimates.“This federal grant from the American Rescue Plan will help high tech start-ups get off the ground and spur job growth, innovation and greater prosperity in Western Maryland,” said Senator Chris Van Hollen. “I will continue working to bring federal investments to our state to expand economic opportunity and promote good-paying jobs for Marylanders.”“President Biden is committed to ensuring that our communities are provided with the resources they need to diversify and grow their economies,” said Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “This EDA investment will provide a place for scientists and entrepreneurs to develop new industries and create good-paying jobs for the people of Maryland.”“The Economic Development Administration plays an important role in supporting locally-developed strategies designed to stimulate American innovation and entrepreneurial activity,” said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development Alejandra Y. Castillo. “This project will bolster the diversification of Frederick’s economy, leading to new, good-paying jobs.”“Frederick is a beautiful place to live, work and grow, and the Frederick Innovative Technology Center, Inc. is an important contributor to the local economy’s expansion. I have toured its facilities and seen its effectiveness in action, and have been impressed by the determination and ingenuity of the small businesses that are getting their starts there,” said Senator Ben Cardin. “These new federal investments will spur the creation of hundreds of new jobs and attract significant private investment, exactly what we in Congress envisioned when passing the American Rescue Plan.”“I proudly voted for the American Rescue Plan knowing full well the benefits it would bring Marylanders, including bolstering our local economies and creating jobs,” said Congressman David Trone (MD-06). “With this grant from the Department of Commerce, the Frederick community will help drive scientific innovation and solidify our nation’s technological competitiveness on a national scale. Without a doubt, the American Rescue Plan continues to deliver for hardworking American families across the state, and I’m glad we could bring this impactful investment to our small businesses right here in Maryland’s Sixth District.”This project is funded under EDA’s American Rescue Plan Economic Adjustment Assistance Program, which makes $500 million in Economic Adjustment Assistance grants available to American communities. The Economic Adjustment Assistance program is EDA’s most flexible program, and grants made under this program will help hundreds of communities across the nation plan, build, innovate, and put people back to work through construction or non-construction projects designed to meet local needs. Effective May 26, 2022, EDA has officially closed all of its American Rescue Plan programs for applications. The $3 billion program funding will be awarded on a rolling basis through September 30, 2022."
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-cardin-booker-urge-cdc-and-hhs-to-monitor-and-address-racial-disparities-in-monkeypox-virus-response,"U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin (both D-Md.) joined Senator Cory Booker (D-N.J.) in urging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to track and address racial disparities in the nation’s public health response to the monkeypox virus (MPV).  “Similar to the COVID-19 outbreak, the U.S. monkeypox outbreak is disproportionately affecting Black and Latino Americans,” wrote the Senators in a letter to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. “At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, limited data/reporting on cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and tests disaggregated by race or ethnicity made it difficult to assess its implications across communities….Over time, federal, state and local data showed that the majority of COVID-19 cases and fatalities affected people of color, with most illnesses and deaths occurring in regions with higher percentages of Black and Latino populations.” “The devastating racial and ethnic disparities during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic underscored the underlying social, economic, and health inequality that has long existed within our health care system due to racial and discriminatory systemic and structural barriers, and the disparities began to narrow with targeted education, outreach, and resource distribution,” continued the Senators. The Senators highlighted that existing racial disparities and inequities in health outcomes and health care continue to be seen with the spread of MPV across the country. As of the end of July, Black and Latino people accounted for 26% and 32% of MPV cases with known race and ethnicity information, respectively. Public health experts have expressed concern over the fact that white men appear to be receiving a disproportionately higher share of the MPV vaccine nationally which is undermining efforts to safeguard communities that are more susceptible and have less access to medical resources. “Lack of racially and ethnically disaggregated data on both diagnosis and treatment of MPV will exacerbate existing health disparities and result in the loss of lives in vulnerable communities,” highlighted the Senators. The Senators noted that “Limited state data that is available shows that we are headed towards a concerning trend.” A report issued by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services shows that although 70% of MPV cases are in Black men, Black North Carolinians have received less than a quarter of the vaccinations so far. Similar trends are cited in the letter for New Jersey, Atlanta metro area, and Chicago. “Vaccine access must be equitable, even in the face of high demand,” urged the Senators. “Any federal targeted response and aid must not inadvertently stigmatize the ongoing public health crisis, but there should be intentional outreach to get resources to impacted communities. The implementation of a rapid and efficient vaccination program is essential to containing and eradicating MPV in communities across the United States. Collecting quality data is crucial to direct our vaccination and testing in the proper directions.”In addition to Senators Van Hollen, Cardin, and Booker, the letter was cosigned by Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Dr. Rev. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.).Full text of the letter can be found here and below. Dear Secretary Becerra and Director Walensky,According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are 16,603 confirmed cases of monkeypox virus (MPV) with more cases expected as the virus continues to spread. Recent data emerging from some states and localities closely tracking MPV indicate significant racial disparities in infections. We know that your agencies are deeply committed to reducing racial disparities in our nation’s health care system. For that reason, we urge you to monitor and address racial disparities in our nation’s response to the MPV public health emergency to ensure our state and local health officials can lead informed responses and best direct resources to those in need.Similar to the COVID-19 outbreak, the U.S. monkeypox outbreak is disproportionately affecting Black and Latino Americans. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, limited data/reporting on cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and tests disaggregated by race or ethnicity made it difficult to assess its implications across communities and focus on response and relief activities. Over time, federal, state, and local data showed that the majority of COVID-19 cases and fatalities affected people of color, with most illnesses and deaths occurring in regions with higher percentages of Black and Latino populations. Furthermore, vaccination rates initially lagged among these same communities. The devastating racial and ethnic disparities during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic underscored the underlying social, economic, and health inequality that has long existed within our health care system due to racial and discriminatory systematic and structural barriers, and the disparities began to narrow with targeted education, outreach, and resource distribution.Existing racial disparities and inequities in health outcomes and health care access often mean that the nation's response to preventing and mitigating the harms of monkeypox will not be felt equally in every community. The same is true of the spread of MPV across the country, as of the end of July, Black people made up 26% of MPV cases with known race and ethnicity information, and Latino people made up 32% of all cases. Currently, the CDC does not independently collect demographic data on MPV vaccine uptake, relying on state and local health departments, many of which aren't reporting or collecting data. Public health experts worry that the fact that white men appear to be receiving a disproportionately higher share of the MPV vaccine nationally is undermining efforts to safeguard communities that are more susceptible and have less access to medical resources. Lack of racially and ethnically disaggregated data on both diagnosis and treatment of MPV will exacerbate existing health disparities and result in the loss of lives in vulnerable communities.Given that currently available data is incomplete because not all states report racial and ethnic data, we cannot accurately gauge the extent of the disparities. However, the limited state data that is available shows that we are headed towards a concerning trend. On August 10, 2022, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services released a report of the state's monkeypox data, including how many vaccines have been administered across the state since July. This data shows that while 70% of cases are in Black men, Black North Carolinians have received less than a quarter of the vaccinations so far. In Chicago, 59% of Chicagoans are Black or Latino, but only 18% of MPV vaccines went to Black or Latino Chicagoans. In the Atlanta metro area at least 54% of doses have gone to white people, but the overwhelming majority of cases have been among Black people. In New Jersey, the week of August 15th, for the first time, the state Department of Health posted data which shows that white people have received a disproportionate share of the vaccines, compared to the number of infected individuals, while Latino and Black people have received less.Experts fear that the virus may spread and become entrenched if we fail to roll-out a comprehensive public health response to halt the MPV outbreak. Vaccine access must be equitable, even in the face of high demand. Any federal targeted response and aid must not inadvertently stigmatize the ongoing public health crisis, but there should be intentional outreach to get resources to impacted communities. The implementation of a rapid and efficient vaccination program is essential to containing and eradicating MPV in communities across the United States. Collecting quality data is crucial to direct our vaccination and testing in the proper directions.We appreciate the actions taken by the Biden administration, including the activation of the CDC's Emergency Operations Center, the designation of a Federal Emergency Management Agency official as the primary coordinator for the MPV response and assignment of a CDC official as deputy, and the declaration of the ongoing spread of MPV in the United States as a public health emergency. Additionally, we are glad that the CDC has launched its Data Modernization Initiative to improve gaps in public health data collection over the next several years. As the number of monkeypox cases in the United States continues to grow, we urge you to continue your efforts to enhance data collection and to take any additional necessary steps to ensure that all Americans have the access they need to diagnosis and treatment. We appreciate your consideration of this urgent matter.  Sincerely,"

This agreement is a necessary step to ensure that for the first time ever – pursuant to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, authored by Senators Van Hollen and Kennedy – Chinese companies operating on U.S. markets are held to the same standards as other foreign companies, reducing risk for American investors.“Foreign companies operating on U.S. markets should be held to the same standards across the board. That’s why I introduced – and worked to pass into law – our Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act to require that all foreign companies tapping into U.S. capital markets comply with rules designed to protect investors in those markets – including retirees, parents building their child’s college funds, and many others. I applaud today’s action by the PCAOB – achieving the crucial first step of getting the Chinese government to agree to these requirements – which for the first time will ensure all companies operating in U.S. markets are held to the same audit standards. Moving forward we must closely monitor China’s compliance to the agreement – we’ll be watching what they do, not just what they say.” "

But now, thanks to these executive actions by President Biden, millions of Americans from a wide array of backgrounds will receive badly needed relief. I applaud these actions and will keep working to pass long-term solutions to fix the student loan crisis, make college more affordable, and ensure all Americans can secure a better economic future.”"
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-colleagues-call-on-biden-administration-to-extend-pslf-waiver-deadline,"U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) joined Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), alongside U.S. Representatives John Sarbanes (D-Md.-03), Joe Courtney (D-Conn.-02), Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.-05), and Kathy Manning (D-N.C.-06), in urging U.S. Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to extend the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) waiver deadline until at least July 1, 2023, when the Department’s proposed rules to improve and expand federal student debt relief programs, including PSLF, are currently on track to take effect. Extending the waiver would help ensure more public servants are able to benefit from the historic waiver that has already resulted in over $9 billion in forgiveness for more than 146,000 public servants and more than 1 million borrowers receiving, on average, one additional year of credit toward PSLF. The extension would also help the agency minimize confusion among borrowers while it conducts a one-time account adjustment later this year and finalizes its proposed PSLF rule.“The PSLF waiver announced by the Department last October was designed to ‘overhaul’ the PSLF program and ‘make it live up to its promise’ by allowing ‘all payments by student borrowers to count toward PSLF, regardless of loan program or payment plan,’” wrote the lawmakers to Secretary Cardona. “To date, the waiver has been overwhelmingly successful in reducing barriers for borrowers to receive PSLF relief—accounting for almost all (89%) of the borrowers who have received forgiveness through the PSLF program through June 30, 2022.”The lawmakers pointed out that data makes it clear that only a fraction of the public servants who are eligible for PSLF have utilized the current waiver. As of the end of June, the Department only has information from 1.3 million PSLF borrowers with eligible employment and positive loan balances, compared to the 9 million public service workers that the Student Borrower Protection Center identified earlier this year who could potentially be eligible for PSLF.“For many borrowers, the Department’s one-time review to fix forbearance and deferment failures, scheduled for later this year—potentially after October 31, 2022—may be the first time that they learn that certain periods of deferment and forbearance could count toward both income-driven repayment (IDR) and PSLF programs,” added the lawmakers. “…For many public servants, losing access to the PSLF waiver before they are able to benefit from the IDR payment adjustment could prevent them from being able to pursue forgiveness under PSLF.”The lawmakers highlighted how extending the PSLF waiver will also allow more military service members and federal employees to make progress towards achieving loan forgiveness through the PSLF program. Reporting shows that military service members face troubling administrative hurdles in certifying their employment for the PSLF program. By extending the PSLF waiver, more military service members and federal employees can benefit – maximizing the promise of the PSLF waiver.“[W]e also ask that the Department increase its outreach to public servants and borrowers to ensure that they are aware of the waiver and understand eligibility requirements, and correct any misinformation about the waiver being communicated by student loan servicers,” concluded the lawmakers. Joining Senators Van Hollen, Menendez, Murray, Kaine, and Gillibrand in the Senate in signing the letter are Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.)

But it is just that—temporary—and it leaves borrowers in limbo as we wait for new regulations to take effect next year,” said Randi Weingarten, President of American Federation of Teachers. “Let’s be clear, everyone who received the debt relief was promised it. This waiver was a critical step toward healing a broken student loan system that has pauperized a generation. We need to take it one step further and extend it. The people who are benefiting from this moment of relief are the same people who carried us through a pandemic—we need to honor their commitment and extend the deadline for the PSLF waiver.”  “No matter what we look like, where we live, or what’s in our bank accounts, all of us should be able to pursue our dreams at an affordable college or university. But for too long, the cost of college has forced many students and families to forego their education goals or be trapped in a lifetime of debt. When educators are unable to repay their student debt, it means fewer educators in the profession, and more disruptions for their students,” said Becky Pringle, President of the National Education Association. “We are overwhelmingly grateful for the waiver that has allowed thousands of educators to receive the promise of PSLF, but there are simply too many educators who have been left out to end the waiver now. We implore the Biden Administration to keep the promise of PSLF and extend the waiver deadline.” “Public service workers make incredible sacrifices every day to strengthen their communities – and never more so than during the last two and a half years of this pandemic. The least we can do is ease their overwhelming student debt burden, much of which they have incurred while getting the skills and education they need to be better at their essential jobs,” said President Lee Saunders, President of AFSCME. “So many AFSCME members have benefitted from the Biden administration’s temporary waiver that expanded eligibility for loan forgiveness. But we are only scratching the surface of the need. It is time to extend the deadline and give more public service workers the time to learn about the program, apply for loan forgiveness and get the relief they need.”“The Administration's overhaul of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is just hitting its stride--delivering debt relief to educators and healthcare workers who are still reeling from the pandemic and its aftermath,” said Mike Pierce, Executive Director of the Student Borrower Protection Center. “We strongly urge President Biden to listen to Senators Menendez, Murray, Kaine, and Gillibrand, Representatives Sarbanes, Courtney, Hayes, Manning, and more than 100 of their colleagues: keep your promise to cancel student debt for every public service worker who is eligible, no matter how long it takes.”  This effort is supported by 74 outside organizations, including: The School Superintendents Association (AASA), AccessLex Institute, Accountable.us, Alaska Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), American Alliance of Museums, American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare (AASWSW), American Association of University Women (AAUW), American Association of Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC), American Council on Education (ACE), American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees (AFSCME), American Federation of Teachers (AFT), American Psychological Association (APA), Americans for Financial Reform (AFR), Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance , Association of Young Americans (AYA), Association of Oncology Social Work (AOSW), Center for American Progress (CAP), Center for Economic Integrity, Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP), Chicago Foundation for Women (CFW), Civil Service Bar Association, Coalition of Black Trade Unionists (CBTU), Communication Workers of America Union (CWA), Community Service Society of New York, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America (CFA), Council of Graduate Schools (CGS), Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), Equal Justice Works (EJW), Fosterus, Hispanic Federation, Housing and Economic Rights Advocates (HERA), International Association of Firefighters, International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), Jewish Federations of North America, Labor Council for Latin American Advancement (LCLAA), Legal Aid at Work, Loan Assistance Repayment Program of Minnesota, Maine Center for Economic Policy, Maryland Center for Collegiate Financial Wellness, National Action Network Washington Bureau, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), National Association of Social Workers, National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA), National Association of Consumer Advocates, National Association of Deans and Directors of Social Work, National Council of Nonprofits, National Education Association (NEA), National Employment Law Project (NELP), National Military Family Association, National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), National Women's Law Center (NWLC), Network of Jewish Human Service Agencies, New America, New Jersey Citizen Action, New Leaders, New York Legal Assistance Group (NYLAG), Nonprofit Professional Employees Union (NPEU)—IFPTE Local 70, OCA – Asian Pacific American Advocates, ParentsTogether, People's Parity Party, Physician Assistant Education Association (PAEA), Public Law Center, Social Current, Student Borrower Protection Center (SBPC), Student Debt Crisis Center, The Arc of the United States, The Debt Collective, The Education Trust, The Institute for College Access & Success (TICAS), UnidosUS, Virginia Poverty Law Center, Voices for National Service, and Zero Debt Massachusetts.Find a copy of the letter HERE and below.Dear Secretary Cardona: Thank you for your continued efforts to improve the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. As you know, the limited PSLF waiver announced last year has already improved the lives of more than 164,000public servants who have had their student loans forgiven and 1 million who have received an average of one additional year of PSLF credit. Yet, we write today, as we believe that additional action is needed to ensure public servants—who have been on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery—can access the PSLF waiver. Currently, only an estimated 15 percent of the 9 million public service workers with student debt have filed paperwork to track their qualifying payments under PSLF. The Department of Education (Department) will not begin its one-time review of accounts with extended forbearances and incorrectly recorded deferments, which could help borrowers make more progress toward PSLF relief, until later this year—potentially after October 31, 2022. In addition, the Department recently unveiled its sweeping proposed regulations for improving student loan programs, including PSLF—which are currently on track to take effect on July 1, 2023. Thus, we request the Department extend the PSLF waiver deadline until at least July 1, 2023, in order to align with new changes under forthcoming rules and minimize confusion among borrowers. The PSLF waiver announced by the Department last October was designed to “overhaul” the PSLF program and “make it live up to its promise” by allowing “all payments by student borrowers to count toward PSLF, regardless of loan program or payment plan.” To date, the waiver has been overwhelmingly successful in reducing barriers for borrowers to receive PSLF relief—accounting for almost all (89%) of the borrowers who have received forgiveness through the PSLF program through June 30, 2022. Moreover, the limited waiver is also a lifeline for Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) borrowers who, for the first time, have seen their payments acknowledged in the PSLF program. Last summer the Department called the treatment of public servants with FFEL loans “a matter of equity,”6 but a single year of flexibility has not been enough to overcome years of “inaccurate information about eligibility for PSLF or Direct Consolidation Loans, resulting in deceptive acts or practices.”Data indicates that only a fraction of the public servants who are eligible for PSLF have utilized the waiver. As of the end of June, the Department only has information from 1.3 million “cumulative PSLF borrowers with eligible employment and positive loan balance[s],” compared to the 9 million public service workers that the Student Borrower Protection Center identified earlier this year that could potentially be eligible for PSLF. As the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond warns, this could leave millions of public servants at risk of missing out on the benefits of the PSLF waiver and its associated loan forgiveness.  As more than 20 state attorneys general have pointed out, public service workers—particularly those in healthcare and education—continue to face challenges such as burnout and personal sacrifice to keep our nation safe during the pandemic and recovery. For many borrowers, the Department’s one-time review to fix forbearance and deferment failures, scheduled for later this year—potentially after October 31, 2022—may be the first time that they learn that certain periods of deferment and forbearance could count toward both income-driven repayment (IDR) and PSLF programs. These borrowers may qualify for immediate forgiveness—especially given the PSLF waiver—or, at minimum, advance their progress towards PSLF relief. For many public servants, losing access to the PSLF waiver before they are able to benefit from the IDR payment adjustment could prevent them from being able to pursue forgiveness under PSLF.  Importantly, extending the PSLF waiver will also allow more military service members and federal employees to make progress towards PSLF. According to a 2021 report by the Government Accountability Office, 200,000 active-duty military service members have federal student loans—about half of whom have balances over $13,000. Reporting shows that military service members face troubling administrative hurdles in certifying their employment for the purposes of PSLF. The Department is currently working to ensure that all federal agencies or departments “automatically [provide] credit toward PSLF for military service members and federal employees.” These data matches are critical to ensuring that the agency can identify which borrowers are eligible for PSLF and provide them automatic relief. By extending the PSLF waiver, more military service members and federal employees can benefit—maximizing the promise of the PSLF waiver. Since the deadline of October 31, 2022 to qualify for PSLF under the waiver program is rapidly approaching, we ask that the Department extend this deadline in order to ensure that all public servants with federal student loans are able to benefit from this historic waiver. Given the issues stated above, we also ask that the Department increase its outreach to public servants and borrowers to ensure that they are aware of the waiver and understand eligibility requirements, and correct any misinformation about the waiver being communicated by student loan servicers.  Sincerely,"
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/maryland-receives-nearly-1m-grant-created-by-infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act-to-protect-small-businesses-from-cyberattacks,"U.S. U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen and Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship Chair Ben Cardin (both D-Md.) lauded the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) announcement today that the Maryland Department of Commerce has been awarded $930,155 to implement a pilot program to protect the state’s small businesses from cyberthreats. The SBA awarded the funds through the Cybersecurity for Small Business Pilot Program, which was created by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that Congress enacted last year. The grant will allow the Maryland Department of Commerce to provide training, counseling, remediation, and other tailored cybersecurity services to small businesses across the state.“Maryland’s small business community is a core driver of our state’s economy, and we need to do everything we can to help them succeed. That’s why the historic infrastructure modernization law we passed includes this measure to bolster their cybersecurity systems in the face of increasingly complex online threats. This investment is going to help protect Maryland small businesses’ most important assets: their employees and customers,” said Senator Van Hollen.“As ransomware and other cyberattacks become more prevalent, Senate Democrats and the Biden Administration are taking action to expand access to cybersecurity resources for small businesses,” Senator Cardin said. “This grant was created by the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and it will give the State of Maryland the resources necessary to help small businesses identify their vulnerabilities and fortify their defenses against cyberthreats.” Cyberattacks are a growing threat to small businesses. Nearly 9-in-10 small business owners surveyed by the SBA reported that their business was vulnerable to a cyberattack. Small businesses are attractive targets because they have information that cybercriminals want, but they lack the resources to protect themselves from cyberthreats. These cybercrimes are costly. The Federal Bureau of Investigations estimates that in 2021, cybercrimes cost small businesses $2.4 billion."

Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin, and David Trone (all D-Md.) announced $41,765,975 in federal funds to improve and rehabilitate bus systems in Maryland to support the adoption of fuel-efficient technologies, such as low- and zero-emission vehicles.These awards are administered through the Department of Transportation’s Buses and Facilities Program and the Low or No Emissions Program. This funding comes from the $1.47 billion made available to these programs through the fiscal year 2022 funding law, which the lawmakers worked to pass earlier this year, and is authorized by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.“Upgrading our public transportation to be more fuel-efficient will improve Marylanders’ daily commutes, save taxpayer dollars, and reduce air pollution in our communities. That’s why we’re pleased to announce this substantial federal funding to transition Maryland bus systems away from heavily polluting equipment. Our public transportation plays a vital role in keeping our communities connected and our economies strong and upgrading our stations and fleets to accommodate fuel-efficient technologies is the next step in improving our transit infrastructure as we work to combat climate change,” the lawmakers said. “Investing in projects like these that will keep our communities safe while combatting climate change is exactly why we fought to pass the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. We will continue working to secure federal funding for initiatives like this one.”Prior to receiving this funding, the Delegation wrote to U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Buttigieg and Federal Transit Administrator Fernandez in support of these Maryland applications. The grant awardees include:The Grants for Buses and Bus Facilities Competitive Program makes federal resources available to states and directs recipients to replace, rehabilitate and purchase buses and related equipment and to construct bus-related facilities, including by making technological changes or innovations to modify low or no emission vehicles or facilities. Funding is provided through formula allocations and competitive grants. The goal of the Low and No Emission Vehicle Program is to assist transit agencies in their shift to cleaner technologies, supporting the administration’s goal of reducing emissions by 50% by the end of the decade. More information on both programs can be found here."

Having visited the CCBC Dundalk Campus and toured their Transportation Training Center, I’ve seen firsthand how these job training programs open doors of opportunity for veterans and their families while keeping our economy moving, strengthening our supply chains, and improving road safety,” said Senator Van Hollen, a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing, Urban Development, and Related Agencies. “I will keep working in the Senate to invest in workforce development to grow our skilled workforce and bring more job opportunities to the people of our state.”  “Connecting Maryland veterans with the right training for available jobs is one of our highest priorities,” said Senator Cardin. “This latest federal funding works to counter our current trucking worker shortages by providing veterans the opportunity to update their skills to comply with the latest CDL safety guidelines. It’s a win for Maryland veterans and their families, local transportation companies and for our local economy.”“The trucking industry is facing a worsening workforce shortage and these funds will enable our local colleges to meet the challenge head-on,” Congressman Ruppersberger said. “All of the students who benefit from these federal funds will graduate ready for careers they can be proud of, earning livable wages and contributing to our regional economy.”“I am pleased that the Department of Transportation has granted this Federal funding to support the Commercial Driver’s License Programs at the Community Colleges of Wor-Wic and Baltimore County. These awards not only support the local economy, but they also focus on enrolling veterans and their families. CDL drivers are critical in getting supplies across our Nation and this investment in training is essential for both the safety of the vehicle driver as well as all road travelers,” said Congressman Harris.The award includes:Senators Van Hollen and Cardin and Congressman Ruppersberger previously announced more than $120,000 in federal funding to expand the Community College of Baltimore County’s Transportation Training Center program from 18 students to 28 students.These Department of Transportation funds through the Commercial Motor Vehicle Operator Safety Training (CMVOST) Grant Program seek to expand the number of CDL holders to help reduce the severity and number of crashes on U.S. roads involving commercial motor vehicles and to assist current or former members of the U.S. Armed Forces and their spouses to receive training to transition to the CMV operation industry."

The Susquehanna River Rail Bridge is a two-track bridge that carries the Northeast Corridor main line including all Amtrak service, MARC commuter trains, and freight. The new bridge will reduce and eliminate train delays, allow increased train speeds, improve train capacity and safety, and improve the navigation channel for mariners. “Upgrading Maryland’s bridges means shortening Marylanders’ commutes, improving their safety, bolstering reliable freight transportation, and strengthening our supply chains,” said the lawmakers. “This investment is critical to ensuring Marylanders, and the goods they need, get where they need to go safely and on time. We will continue working to deliver federal dollars to update our state’s infrastructure.” This federal funding is through the Federal State Partnership State of Good Repair Grant Program administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak). The lawmakers also fought to pass the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which makes available future funding opportunities through the Bridge Formula Program and the Bridge Investment Program for the construction of this bridge, as well as other bridges across the state that are in desperate need of modernization.   "

However, initial trades set up by 10b5-1 plans often appear to be based on material nonpublic information, and executives can and do modify or cancel their plans in response to inside information to increase their own profits.“While these plans were designed to prevent insider trading, evidence indicates that corporate insiders have misused them to obtain huge windfalls making questionable trades at the expense of ordinary investors.” wrote the lawmakers, “We urge you to consider additional, strong rules that would prevent these abusive practices and protect the integrity of our capital markets, and that you implement them without delay.” A recent report in the Wall Street Journal identified “scores of examples where company insiders adopted a plan when a quarter was nearly complete and sold stock under the plan before that quarter’s results were announced,” and found that “insiders who sold within 60 days reaped $500 million more in profits than they would have if they sold three months later,” indicating that the abuse of 10b5-1 plans is widespread and costly, further underscoring the urgent need for stronger rules.“Corporate insiders cannot be allowed to continue to trade based on insiders’ knowledge with impunity,” wrote the lawmakers. “The SEC must act swiftly to ensure that Rule 10b5-1 is no longer “viewed as a ‘get out-of-jail-free card.’” The lawmakers are also encouraging the SEC to consider strengthening its proposed rule by: “If corporate insiders were willing to profit off of their own failed responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, they will likely continue to exploit safe harbor rules to line their own pockets.” concluded the lawmakers. “The SEC should consider all options to prevent all such abuses and finally level the playing field for ordinary investors.”A copy of the letter can be found here."

In a letter to Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, the Senators applauded the Department’s efforts to provide and expand relief to borrowers whose schools closed or defrauded them, borrowers working in public service, and borrowers who are totally and permanently disabled. The Senators encouraged additional steps to improve the Department’s student debt relief programs and ensure borrowers can access the relief they are owed.“The Department’s proposed rules will help to provide additional relief to struggling borrowers, protect students and taxpayers from fraud and abuse committed by institutions, and ensure our federal student loan program fulfills its promise to put higher education within reach for more students without subjecting them to complex, burdensome, or punitive requirements that make it harder to get the relief they are owed,” wrote the Senators. “This proposal represents an enormous step forward for students and borrowers, and, when finalized, it will help ensure government benefits and programs function as Congress intended.”In their letter, the Senators commended the Biden administration’s proposals to deliver and expand relief for these borrowers—steps Senator Murray and her Democratic colleagues urged the Department to take in a letter last year.They also detailed additional steps the Department should take to strengthen its proposal. In particular, the Senators recommended steps to further strengthen its borrower protection rule, further expand relief for borrowers seeking a closed school discharge and eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, eliminate interest capitalization on all loan types, and further protect students’ right to seek relief in court. The Senators also urged the Department to continue working to fix the income-driven repayment system, crack down on bad actors, and provide as much relief as possible to borrowers.“As the Department works to finalize these regulations, we urge you to build on this progress by strengthening rules in other vital areas, including income-driven repayment and gainful employment,” added the Senators. “We also urge the Department to continue efforts to protect borrowers outside the rulemaking process, including by immediately and efficiently using its current oversight and enforcement authorities to reign in bad actors and provide as much relief as possible to borrowers.”The letter, led by Senator Murray, was signed in addition to Senator Van Hollen by Senators Schumer (D-N.Y.), Baldwin (D-Wis.), Markey (D-Mass.), Wyden (D-Ore.), Reed (D-R.I.), Coons (D-Del.), Hirono (D-Hawaii), Cardin (D-Md.), Warnock (D-Ga.), Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Warren (D-Mass.), Lujan (D-N.M.), Casey (D-Pa.), Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Smith (D-Minn.), Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Padilla (D-Calif.), Brown (D-Ohio), Durbin (D-Ill.), and Rosen (D-Nev.).The Senators’ full letter is available HERE and below:Dear Secretary Cardona: We write in response to the U.S. Department of Education’s (“Department”) proposed rules regarding debt relief for borrowers whose schools closed or defrauded them, borrowers who are totally and permanently disabled, and borrowers who are public service workers. The Biden-Harris Administration’s proposed regulations for student loan discharge programs make tremendous progress in providing and expanding relief to borrowers, and we’re pleased to see Senate Democratic priorities, as outlined in the July 1, 2021, letters on program integrity and debt relief, reflected in this proposal. We applaud the proposal’s improvement and streamlining of student loan relief programs and commend the Department’s efforts to support student loan borrowers.For far too long, students who face a variety of barriers have been cheated by predatory for-profit colleges, denied their day in court due to mandatory arbitration agreements, and denied debt relief because of standards that are impossible to meet. Borrowers have seen their balances balloon due to interest capitalization, they have had their lives altered by sudden college closures, and they have faced burdensome and overly-complicated requirements to access debt relief. This Administration has demonstrated its commitment to helping borrowers access the relief they are entitled to and holding institutions accountable for misconduct, including through this draft rule. This proposal represents an enormous step forward for students and borrowers, and, when finalized, it will help ensure government benefits and programs function as Congress intended. For these reasons, we strongly support the Department’s proposed rules for student loan relief programs. Below, we provide detailed input on each of the draft regulations proposed by the Department. We also urge the Department to continue efforts to protect borrowers outside the rulemaking process, including by immediately and efficiently using its current oversight and enforcement authorities to reign in bad actors and provide as much relief as possible to borrowers. Borrower Defense to RepaymentAfter years of deregulation of the “borrower defense” rule under the previous Administration, which undermined protections for defrauded borrowers and relentlessly denied them relief, we commend the Biden-Harris Administration for reversing course and proposing the strongest borrower defense rule we have ever seen.The previous Administration required borrowers to meet an extremely difficult standard to prove their colleges caused them harm and, as a result, only 7.5 percent of borrower defense claims were estimated to be approved, down from 65 percent under the prior rule. This was so unpopular that Congress—in a bipartisan effort—passed a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn the rule, which was later vetoed by President Donald Trump.We commend your efforts to redress the harms this deregulatory regime caused borrowers—including borrowers from low-income families, first-generation students, students of color, and veterans—who have been targeted and lied to by predatory for-profit institutions. These borrowers deserve to be able to access the loan relief they are entitled to through a fair and streamlined process. Specifically, we strongly support the establishment of a single and streamlined borrower defense standard that better captures the full scope of institutional misconduct relevant for a borrower defense claim. To date, the review process for borrower defense claims has been overly burdensome, with inconsistent regulatory standards depending on loan disbursement date. This has contributed to inequities amongst similarly situated borrowers and lengthy delays in the adjudication of claims, leaving borrowers waiting far too long for relief. The establishment of a single standard with clearer and expanded grounds for borrower defense claims represents a tremendous step forward in protecting consumers and the integrity of the federal financial aid programs. We are also pleased to see that misconduct related to substantial omission of fact and aggressive and deceptive recruitment can serve as a basis for borrower defense under the Department’s draft rule.Additionally, the restoration and strengthening of a group process for borrowers seeking discharge, the establishment of a set timeline for adjudication of both group and individual claims, and the enhanced authorities for the Department to recoup the cost of discharges from predatory institutions are welcome and necessary changes. We support the Department’s approach to establishing a presumption of full discharge in place of the partial relief approach utilized under the last Administration and eliminating the limitations period for borrowers, both of which have created major barriers that have unnecessarily prevented borrowers from accessing the relief to which they are entitled. We remain concerned about the need to protect borrowers from predatory for-profit colleges that are defrauding borrowers at scale and urge you to allow legal assistance organizations, in addition to state attorneys general, to bring forth group claims. Additionally, we encourage you to suspend interest accrual immediately for all borrowers with a pending borrower defense claim. Under the draft regulations, the Department proposes to cease interest accrual for borrowers filing an individual claim only after their claim has been pending for 180 days. Borrowers covered by group claims, meanwhile, would see their interest paused immediately, a distinction that the Department states is based on the premise that not all group members proactively apply for borrower defense. However, no borrower opts into being defrauded or misled by their institution, and no borrower subjected to misconduct should have to see their loan balance balloon while they wait for the Department to take action. We further encourage you to clarify that, if the Secretary reopens a borrower defense application under which a borrower received partial forgiveness, the Secretary may not reduce or rescind previously provided forgiveness. This change would appear to be in alignment with the Department’s intent, given that the preamble states, “a borrower only stands to benefit from the Secretary reopening a borrower defense application that was fully or partially denied.” Lastly, we encourage you to continue to use existing enforcement authorities to hold institutions accountable for engaging in misconduct and wasting taxpayer dollars. We are encouraged by the Department’s ongoing efforts to deliver group discharges of borrower defense claims and look forward to more relief for groups of students who are subject to the same findings of misconduct. Mandatory Pre-dispute Arbitration and Prohibition of Class Action Lawsuits Provisions in Institutions’ Enrollment Agreements As part of its deregulatory agenda, the previous Administration removed restrictions banning the use of pre-dispute arbitration agreements and class action lawsuit waivers, thereby allowing institutions to deny students their day in court by requiring them to give up their rights as a condition of enrollment. Instead, students at these institutions are forced to waive their right to pursue class action lawsuits or are required to resolve disputes through mandatory arbitration proceedings. Furthermore, the outcomes of arbitration proceedings are often kept secret—effectively hiding predatory practices from the public and regulators, including the Department. As outlined in the July 1, 2021, letter from 12 Senate Democrats on program integrity, for-profit colleges have a long track record—unique compared to other sectors of higher education—of imposing these mandatory arbitration agreements and class action lawsuit waivers. For example, a 2016 study examining enrollment contracts from 217 institutions found mandatory arbitration clauses in 98 percent of contracts at for-profit institutions, compared to just seven percent at nonprofits. No public institutions examined in the study required students to settle disputes through arbitration. We applaud the Department’s proposal to reinstate the ban on mandatory arbitration agreements and class action waivers for lawsuits relating to acts or omissions regarding the making of the Federal Direct Loan and the provision of educational services for which such loans are obtained. Since forced arbitration is prevalent in for-profit colleges, the draft proposal to prohibit forced arbitration clauses and class-action waivers will benefit many borrowers attending for-profit colleges. Additionally, the proposal will have a greater impact on Black students who are overrepresented at for-profit schools, by a near 15-percentage point difference, compared to public and private universities. We further commend the collection and public disclosure of arbitral and judicial records related to borrower defense claims. These disclosures will enhance transparency regarding the outcomes of arbitrations, support oversight efforts, and help ensure prospective students and their families have access to information about past instances of institutional fraud and misrepresentation. As you work to finalize the pre-dispute forced arbitration and class action waiver bans, we encourage the Department to make clear that institutions must use the notice language included in the final regulations verbatim and without conditions when providing the required notices to borrowers. We further urge you to clarify the timing of notices sent to borrowers who previously attended institutions that maintained mandatory arbitration and class action waiver requirements. These students should be made aware as quickly as practicable that their rights to pursue claims in court—both as an individual and as part of a class—have been restored. Public Service Loan Forgiveness We commend the Department’s efforts to expand Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) eligibility and codify recent improvements in the consideration of qualifying payments and the application process. As expressed by 23 Senate Democrats in the July 1, 2021, comment letter on debt relief, Senate Democrats support closing holes in PSLF eligibility, removing overly restrictive regulations on qualifying payments, and making it easier for borrowers working in public service to obtain the PSLF forgiveness they are entitled to under the Higher Education Act (HEA).The proposed rule makes critical improvements to the PSLF program by codifying parts of the Biden-Harris Administration’s limited PSLF waiver, which has already resulted in at least $9 billion of forgiveness for more than 146,000 public servants and more than 1 million borrowers receiving, on average, one additional year of credit toward PSLF. Specifically, we applaud allowing more payments to qualify for PSLF including counting payments made prior to consolidation and payments made in multiple installments or outside the 15-day period in current regulations toward PSLF forgiveness. Additionally, the Department’s proposed definition of full-time employment will protect borrowers from being subject to a higher full-time definition set by their employer, ensure eligible borrowers working for multiple employers can obtain relief, and clarify how the Department will calculate the equivalent weekly hours worked for borrowers who are non-tenured instructors.       While we are encouraged by the Department’s necessary proposal to count certain periods of deferment and forbearance toward PSLF, we urge you to count all such periods toward PSLF to reduce unnecessary complexity, address administrative failures by student loan servicers, and fulfill the program’s goal of alleviating the burden of federal student loans for borrowers in public service. Unfortunately, federal investigations have found that student loan servicers have steered borrowers into forbearance, made errors during loan transfers, and failed to advise borrowers about their options to enroll in income-driven repayment plans, under which monthly payments—even if they are $0 payments—count toward PSLF. Borrowers should not lose progress toward forgiveness when a servicer pauses a borrower’s payments to process paperwork, nor should borrowers be penalized for following bad advice from a servicer or experiencing other types of industry misconduct. Under the proposed regulations, the Department contemplates the inclusion of for-profit early childhood education (ECE) employers as qualifying employers for the purposes of PSLF. In response to the Department’s request for comments on this proposal, we support the inclusion of for-profit ECE employers because early childhood educators employed by for-profit ECE employers fundamentally provide a public service to the nation. In addition to providing critical services to educate and care for young children, early childhood educators also play an integral role in supporting working families, businesses and the nation’s economy. According to American Community Survey data, nearly two-thirds of children younger than age six have all parents in the labor force, making access to quality, affordable child care a necessity for working families across the country. Section 455 (m)(3)B)(i) of HEA includes “early childhood education (including licensed or regulated child care, Head Start, and state funded pre-kindergarten)” as part of the statutory definition of a “public service job”, demonstrating Congress’ intent to specifically include the early childhood workforce as eligible for PSLF. The child care sector is a mixed-delivery system that relies at least in part on non-public providers. Additionally, many family child care providers are small businesses with one early childhood educator as both the sole proprietor and sole employee. The vast majority of child care providers are small businesses operating on razor thin profit margins that are usually less than 1 percent.Moreover, when Congress authorized the PSLF program in 2007, the intent was to incentivize employment in public service positions that were presumed to generally have lower wages than other occupations. Today, early childhood educators, who are almost entirely women and 40 percent of whom are women of color—typically earn poverty-level wages despite having highly specialized skills and postsecondary education.Staffing challenges due to inadequate wages for early educators are fueling a nationwide shortage of child care. The inclusion of for-profit early childhood education employers as qualifying employers for PSLF could help recruit and retain highly qualified early educators and strengthen the workforce to ensure that child care remains available to the children and families who need it. The Department should take a multifaceted approach to implement this measure. For example, the Department should collaborate with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to identify methods to collect Employer Identification Numbers (EINs) for Head Start and Early Head Start programs.Additionally, the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act requires states to have in effect licensing requirements applicable to child care services provided within the state. In addition, HHS regulations require each state lead agency to maintain a website with a “localized list of all licensed child care providers” in the state. In turn, HHS operates a national website that links to state databases of child care providers. The Department should consult with HHS on whether and how these state databases may be used to help verify licensed and regulated child care programs. Where practicable, the Department and HHS should automate information-sharing related to qualifying employers and clarify that borrowers working for for-profit ECE employers may pursue the reconsideration process outlined in the proposed rule if they are denied PSLF relief.We also support extending PSLF eligibility to certain self-employed independent contractors who are working on a full-time basis with a qualifying employer, but are not employed directly by the qualifying employer. For example, as noted in the preamble, public defenders and doctors in rural nonprofit hospitals who are independent contractors are not currently eligible for PSLF. Eligibility requirements should be adjusted to account for such types of circumstances particularly in public and nonprofit settings, in which borrowers are providing a public service with a qualifying employer but are not compensated directly by the qualifying employer. Additionally, externally sponsored fellows at not-for-profit organizations and public agencies, such as early career attorneys in public service roles, should be eligible for PSLF. These borrowers are not considered “employees” under the Department’s draft PSLF regulations despite working for a qualifying employer and contributing to the public good. We believe the treatment of contracted fellowships should be distinct from other types of more lucrative, contracted positions in which borrowers may be providing a service to the qualifying employer while being compensated by a non-qualifying employer. In the case of independent contractors, organizations are likely to be willing to sign PSLF forms on their behalf given that they are likely already completing PSLF forms as qualifying employers and often track the number of hours worked for the independent contractors they hire. The Department should clarify the definition of “employee” includes contractors, working for a qualifying employer, who may receive tax forms other than W-2s, including 1099 forms.Relatedly, we support the Department’s ongoing efforts to provide relief to public service workers through the limited PSLF waiver and urge the Department to extend the application deadline for the waiver to align with the implementation of the new changes being made under the Department’s forthcoming rules. Interest CapitalizationAs the Department’s preamble explains, interest capitalization—in which some or all of a borrower’s unpaid interest is added to their principal—can contribute to growing balances, extended time to repayment, and a higher risk of delinquency and default, leading to financial and psychological challenges that hamper successful loan repayment. Furthermore, the Department’s data demonstrate that interest capitalization is particularly harmful for Black borrowers, Pell Grant recipients, borrowers from low-income families, and borrowers who left college without completing a degree or credential. The Department’s proposal to remove interest capitalization where not required by statute represents a vital step in preventing borrowers’ debts from growing over time and reducing racial and socioeconomic disparities in loan repayment outcomes. We applaud the Department’s proposal and encourage you to build on these efforts in the forthcoming regulations for income-driven repayment by eliminating negative amortization on all loan types, as proposed in the July 1, 2021, letter from 23 Senate Democrats on debt relief. We additionally encourage you to remove capitalization when a borrower in the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) repayment plan is determined to no longer have a partial financial hardship, as it is currently required (and maintained in the Department’s draft rules) under 34 CFR 685.209(a)(2)(iv). The Department should also examine whether it is still necessary to maintain language capping the amount of interest capitalized under the alternative repayment plan at 34 CFR 685.208(l)(5), as well as the reference to that provision at 34 CFR 685.202(b)(2), as redesignated by the Department’s draft rules, given the proposed striking of 34 CFR 685.202(b)(4). Total and Permanent Disability DischargesAs outlined in the July 1, 2021, letter from 23 Senate Democrats on debt relief, current regulations have created unnecessary barriers for borrowers who are entitled to a total and permanent disability (TPD) discharge under the HEA. We strongly support the Department’s proposal to expand the types of acceptable documentation and the list of medical professionals who are authorized to certify a borrower’s eligibility for a TPD discharge. We also commend the Department’s proposed changes to expand the categories of borrowers who may qualify for discharge in alignment with congressional intent. Additionally, we support that the Department’s draft rule would make it possible for qualifying borrowers to access a TPD discharge without an application and encourage the Department to automate the TPD process as much as possible wherever the Department can do so. Under the current TPD regulations, borrowers who receive a discharge are subject to a three-year post-discharge monitoring period during which a borrower’s discharged loan is reinstated if their income rises above a certain level or if they subsequently receive a federal student loan or a TEACH Grant. As the Department’s preamble noted, however, many borrowers have had their loans reinstated due to paperwork issues and not because they had earnings above the threshold for reinstatement. We support that the Department has proposed eliminating the three-year income monitoring period as proposed in the July 1, 2021, letter from 23 Senate Democrats on debt relief. This change will remove unnecessary and harmful barriers that have prevented borrowers from getting the much-needed relief that they are entitled to under the law.However, the Department’s draft rules propose to maintain the reinstatement of loans for borrowers who obtain additional loans or TEACH Grants within three years of receiving TPD discharge. During negotiations, non-federal negotiators recommended reducing the three-year monitoring period to one year, but the Department’s preamble stated that they “[had] not been presented with a reason to change our current position on having a three year limitation on borrowers taking out additional title IV loans.” It appears that the Department intends to use loan reinstatement as a deterrent to discourage future borrowing, but in practice, this policy risks imposing a hefty penalty on borrowers who may not understand the consequences of borrowing new loans. This policy may be particularly harmful for borrowers who discover only after re-enrollment that they will not be able to complete their chosen program or secure work in their desired field. We therefore encourage the Department to revisit this issue, to examine the frequency and impact of loan reinstatement due to subsequent borrowing, and to consider shortening the monitoring period to one year, as suggested by non-federal negotiators. This change would provide more certainty to borrowers who receive a TPD discharge and align with the Department’s overarching efforts to bolster borrowers’ access to debt relief and minimize harmful and punitive consequences associated with borrowing.Closed School Discharges The closure of an institution of higher education can have severe and life-altering consequences for enrolled students, even as corporate executives and private equity owners escape accountability, as witnessed during the precipitous closure of ITT Technical Institutes and Corinthian Colleges. It is vital that the Department adopt a robust closed school discharge (CSD) rule and maintain a reliable and straightforward CSD process in order to ensure taxpayers and borrowers are not left paying the price when an institution collapses. As part of this effort, 23 Senate Democrats have called on the Department to reinstate the automatic CSD process and process discharges more quickly; eliminate restrictions that prevent students who transfer from receiving a CSD; and extend the look-back window that allows borrowers who left an institution prior to its official closure to access a CSD.We are encouraged by the Department’s proposals to reinstate automatic closed school discharges and extend the look-back window from 120 to 180 days, with the option for a further extension in exceptional circumstances. We also appreciate and support the clarifications regarding what constitutes an exceptional circumstance, how the Department will identify a school’s closure date, and the definition of a program for purposes of the CSD regulations. However, while we appreciate the Department’s proposal to eliminate provisions that deny a CSD to students who transfer, we are concerned that the Department’s alternative—namely, denying a CSD to students who accept and complete a teach-out plan or agreement—will have similarly harmful consequences. Section 437(c)(1) of the HEA requires that the Secretary of Education discharge the loans received by any student who “is unable to complete the program in which such student is enrolled due to the closure of the institution” and makes no mention of transfers to other institutions. As 23 Senate Democrats pointed out in the July 1, 2021, letter on debt relief, the current regulations denying a CSD to borrowers who transfer to another institution within 3 years of a college’s closure are inconsistent with the statute and should be eliminated. Similarly, the HEA does not condition the receipt of a CSD on the rejection of a teach-out plan or agreement. For this reason, and the reasons outlined below, we urge the Department to eliminate these unnecessary restrictions and adopt regulations consistent with the HEA that provide an automatic CSD for any student who is unable to complete their program due to institutional closure, regardless of whether they subsequently transfer or accept or complete a teach-out plan or agreement. Under the Department’s regulations, a teach-out plan is only required to provide for the “equitable treatment of students” and include general details such as a list of currently enrolled students, academic programs offered by the institutions, and other institutions offering similar programs. A student who accepts a teach-out plan does not have any assurance that they will be able to complete their program, much less that program completion will be possible in a timely fashion and with minimal disruption. It is unclear what the Department intends to accomplish by excluding students who “complete” a teach-out plan, but given that those students are not necessarily provided any pathway to transfer previously earned credits or to continue and complete their programs, it seems contrary to the Department’s stated goals to deny them access to an automatic CSD. Teach-out agreements, meanwhile, are subject to more stringent requirements, but still only provide for a “reasonable opportunity” for program completion and do not ensure that students will be able to transfer all (or even a majority) of their credits or access programs that are reasonably affordable (or even comparably priced). As such, it is unreasonable to assume that all students who accept and complete a teach-out plan or agreement will receive their desired credential in a comparable program of study without suffering the consequences of an institutional closure. Even those students who do complete a comparable program through a teach-out plan or agreement may still experience major disruptions and incur significant costs re-taking coursework that does not transfer. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that students pursuing a teach-out plan or agreement will receive a credential that is of comparable value in the workforce as what they might have received had their original institution not closed, particularly given the reputational damage often associated with the closure of an institution. There is also no guarantee that a credential earned through a teach-out agreement will have the same programmatic accreditation as the student’s original program or that it will fulfill any relevant state licensure requirements.Accordingly, we urge the Department to strike the provisions denying a CSD to students who complete a teach-out plan or agreement, and, to the greatest extent practicable, accelerate the timeframe for providing automatic discharges given that the one-year monitoring period would no longer be necessary. If the Department is unwilling to make that change, we urge you to, at a bare minimum, remove the exclusion of students who complete teach-out plans and limit the exclusion of students who complete teach-out agreements to only those students who actually complete a comparable program within a reasonable amount of time (e.g., one year). The Department could also limit the exclusion to students who are able to transfer most or all of their previously earned credits. When a student takes longer to complete their program, or is unable to transfer most or all of their credits, they incur more costs (in both time and money) at their new institution retaking or completing additional credits and experience fewer benefits from the education they received at their previous institution prior to its closure. Lastly, if the Department does opt to restrict access to a CSD based on subsequent enrollment, it should, to the greatest extent practicable, automate data collection (e.g. by using CIP codes and NSLDS enrollment status) rather than requiring new reporting, which may be particularly challenging once institutions have closed and are no longer tracking students who have left.False Certification Discharges When an institution falsifies a student’s eligibility for Title IV aid, it should be the institution—not the student—who pays the price. However, as the Department’s preamble explains, the current false certification regulations include two sets of eligibility criteria, creating confusion and establishing different standards and processes for false certification discharges depending on when the loans were first disbursed. Additionally, some borrowers who may be eligible may not have received a discharge because of the difficulty in navigating unnecessarily complex requirements. Therefore, we applaud the Department’s proposal to streamline the false certification discharge process by providing one set of regulatory standards covering all false certification discharge claims. We also support the expansion of acceptable documentation, clarification of applicable dates, and creation of a group false certification discharge process included in the draft rules. These proposals represent a significant step forward for students who have been coerced or defrauded by their schools. The Department’s proposed rules will help to provide additional relief to struggling borrowers, protect students and taxpayers from fraud and abuse committed by institutions, and ensure our federal student loan program fulfills its promise to put higher education within reach for more students without subjecting them to complex, burdensome, or punitive requirements that make it harder to get the relief they are owed. As the Department works to finalize these regulations, we urge you to build on this progress by strengthening rules in other vital areas, including income-driven repayment and gainful employment. Thank you for your attention. Sincerely,"

In a letter Thursday to USAID Administrator Samantha Power, Senators Van Hollen and Cardin and Senators Cory A. Booker (D-N.J.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii), Angus S. King, Jr. (I-Maine), Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and Tina Smith (D-Minn.) ask for details on how and when USAID is relaying this vital information, particularly as “the U.S. is the largest donor of bilateral family planning and reproductive health assistance” in the world. “It is imperative that the agency proactively and clearly communicate with in-country partners about the impact of Dobbs on programs funded by U.S. global health assistance. This is to ensure that USAID-funded organizations do not mistakenly believe they must cease providing family planning and reproductive health services due to the Dobbs decision,” the lawmakers wrote. “Given the evidence of poor implementation of U.S. policy related to the Mexico City Policy and reports of overbroad interpretation of the Helms Amendment, USAID must be vigilant to prevent further misinterpretations by organizations and programs funded by U.S. global health assistance from occurring in the future.”  “As we fight to protect access to reproductive rights across the country, the U.S. government must be clear about our commitment to sexual and reproductive health and rights abroad — especially in light of the lingering impact of the harmful global gag rule,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO, Planned Parenthood Federation of America. “It’s critical for in-country partners that receive U.S. global health assistance to know the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade does not hinder the services they can provide. Everyone deserves access to health care, here and globally. Thank you Senator Ben Cardin for your leadership on this important issue.” ""As an economic superpower and the world’s largest donor to global health initiatives, the U.S. exerts a tremendous influence on the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women, girls, and gender-diverse people globally. This influence is evidenced in the long-lasting impacts of the Global Gag Rule,” said Giselle Carino, CEO of Fòs Feminista. “The overturning of abortion rights in the U.S. is a critical moment to ensure that USAID is well positioned to support rather than hinder the advancement of sexual and reproductive justice around the world. We thank Senator Cardin for leading this effort.”“Abortion is health care. Everyone, no matter who, no matter where, must have access. When people don’t have access to abortion, they face greater economic struggles, their children have fewer resources; women, pregnant people and providers can go to jail; many people are forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term; and being pregnant and giving birth is riskier than having an abortion,” said Anu Kumar, Ipas President and CEO. “The devastating impact of overturning Roe v. Wade extends beyond our borders. People, thousands of miles away—who are already adversely affected by US policies like the nearly 50-year-old Helms Amendment and the Mexico City Policy—will be affected. USAID must minimize the global harm of the Dobbs decision by ensuring USAID-funded organizations provide the full range of family planning and reproductive health services, including abortion in countries where it is legal. Access to reproductive health care, including abortion, is a human right.”  The full letter can be found below and at this link.Dear Administrator Power: Thank you for your leadership as we continue to grapple with dynamic development challenges across the globe. On June 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization overturned Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey and held that the right to abortion is no longer protected by the U.S. Constitution. Since the decision was released, there has been widespread confusion regarding the legal status of abortion in the U.S. Given the uncertainty domestically, the influence that this decision has in countries receiving U.S. foreign assistance, and past issues communicating the impact of U.S. policy changes abroad, we urge the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to convey clearly to in-country organizations and partners that the Dobbs decision does not impact the ability to provide a full range of legally authorized family planning and reproductive health services allowed prior to the decision. USAID plays a key role in increasing access to family planning and reproductive health care around the world. Currently, the U.S. is the largest donor of bilateral family planning and reproductive health assistance to increase opportunities for voluntary healthy timing and spacing of pregnancies. Ensuring everyone has access to these services is an essential component of a number of USAID’s policy priorities, including improving maternal and child health, reducing HIV transmission, advancing LGBTQI+ inclusive development, and promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment. These policy priorities are critical to advancing overall global health, political stability, economic development, and environmental sustainability, and are in line with the Biden-Harris administration’s National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality. In addressing USAID’s family planning and reproductive health priorities, a significant challenge USAID faces is ensuring in-country organizations and partners receive timely, accurate information regarding U.S. policy that impacts the services that partner organizations can provide. This challenge has become especially apparent in the context of the implementation and revocation of the Mexico City Policy, also known as the Global Gag Rule (GGR). For example, an April 2022 report based on organizations in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe on the revocation of the Mexico City Policy, found that “the consensus among implementing partners and advocates… was that the [U.S. government]’s communications related to the revocation of GGR were insufficient, and that guidance for implementing the policy change was wholly lacking.” Further, according to a May 2022 GAO report, implementing partners that declined U.S. funding due to the Mexico City Policy highlighted that, despite USAID actions to inform staff and implementing partners, “lingering confusion about the policy continued to reduce collaboration even after its rescission.” Further, the combination of the Mexico City Policy and Helms Amendment has had a chilling effect on USAID grantees, leading to their reluctance to offer abortion services where legally permissible and even to provide information and counseling about all pregnancy options consistent with local law. Current U.S. law, through the Leahy Amendment, specifically allows for the provision of information and counseling about all pregnancy options in programs funded by U.S. foreign assistance. Nevertheless, in 2021, organizers of a USAID-sponsored conference, citing the Helms Amendment language in their contract, canceled a presentation on telemedicine abortion research from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.Considering USAID’s challenges communicating the revocation of the Mexico City Policy and appropriately implementing of the Helms Amendment, it is imperative that the agency proactively and clearly communicate with in-country partners about the impact of Dobbs on programs funded by U.S. global health assistance. This is to ensure that USAID-funded organizations do not mistakenly believe they must cease providing family planning and reproductive health services due to the Dobbs decision. Given the evidence of poor implementation of U.S. policy related to the Mexico City Policy and reports of overbroad interpretation of the Helms Amendment, USAID must be vigilant to prevent further misinterpretations by organizations and programs funded by U.S. global health assistance from occurring in the future. To that end, we request that you respond in writing to the following questions: In addition to a written response, we request a staff briefing on this matter. Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this request. Sincerely,"

Hoyer (all D-Md.) urged the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to extend the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) led by the University of Maryland in collaboration with NASA Goddard. GEDI provides high resolution laser observations of global forests and topography with a mission to provide answers on how deforestation is contributing to climate change. The lawmakers note that extending GEDI is critical so it can complete its data collection and meet its mission to help inform climate change mitigation efforts.  “GEDI is a high-resolution laser that scans and collects data on Earth’s forests and topography from the International Space Station (ISS). GEDI quantifies estimates of carbon stored in Earth’s vegetation by collecting data from canopy structure which models the horizontal and vertical distribution of above-ground biomass. This data improves scientific understanding of habitat viability for biodiversity and ecosystem resilience and provides critical information for land use management to combat deforestation and the spread of destructive wildfires. Data collected from the GEDI mission will be used to evaluate and verify international carbon reporting and will help inform climate change mitigation efforts. GEDI is an important tool in our global response to climate change,” the lawmakers said. “GEDI is scheduled to be de-orbited in 2023. The GEDI mission Principal Investigator and members of the scientific community have requested an extension to allow GEDI to complete its data collection and meet its science requirements. We are supportive of this request and ask that you explore potential options to delay GEDI’s decommissioning so that the mission may conclude its work,” they continued.  The full letter can be read here and below:Dear Administrator Nelson,Thank you for your strong commitment to the future of NASA and to ensuring that our nation remains at the forefront of exploration, discovery, and the sciences. Maryland, as you know, has a long and rich history in support of our nation’s civil space program. The Goddard Space Flight Center was one of NASA’s “founding centers” and is now home to the largest collection of earth scientists in the world. The University of Maryland and NASA have a strong history of joint research activities and mission collaborations in support of space-based science, the earth sciences, and STEM education.The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), led by University of Maryland in collaboration with Goddard, was competitively selected as a NASA Earth Ventures Instrument (EVI) mission in 2014 and launched in 2018. GEDI is a high-resolution laser that scans and collects data on Earth’s forests and topography from the International Space Station (ISS). GEDI quantifies estimates of carbon stored in Earth’s vegetation by collecting data from canopy structure which models the horizontal and vertical distribution of above-ground biomass.

Data collected from the GEDI mission will be used to evaluate and verify international carbon reporting and will help inform climate change mitigation efforts. GEDI is an important tool in our global response to climate change.GEDI completed its two-year Prime Mission in April 2021 and is currently in Extended Operations. In January 2020, ISS changed its orbital altitude which led to reduced resonance and coverage. The ISS reverted to optimal orbital altitude in 2022, but GEDI has been unable to meet its Level 1 science requirements as a result of the prior poor coverage. GEDI is scheduled to be de-orbited in 2023. The GEDI mission Principal Investigator and members of the scientific community have requested an extension to allow GEDI to complete its data collection and meet its science requirements.

Yet this system continues to be strained by the COVID-19 pandemic and underfunded. “MPV testing efforts are currently encountering processing and collection barriers that have led to underreporting of cases and poor data to aid the federal government in directing necessary resources in an appropriate manner,” they continued. “Additionally, as both a prophylaxis and treatment, acquiring and administering vaccines swiftly is crucial to stemming the spread of MPV and protecting all communities across the United States. Finally, clinics and providers are facing additional barriers in clinical services supplies, education for providers to properly identify MPV, vaccines, testing supplies, contact tracing, and community outreach to bolster our public health response to MPV, and ensure that accurate and adequate information is reaching our constituents.” Joining Senators Van Hollen and Merkley on the letter are Senators Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). In reaction to the Senators’ letter, David C. Harvey, Executive Director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, said: “The nation’s sexual health clinics have been managing frontline testing, treatment, and vaccination for monkeypox without adequate resources, staffing, or supplies, blunting the impact of federal efforts to address the outbreak. The success of the national response hinges on whether these clinics get the resources they need to help patients access expanded testing, treatment, and vaccines.”  Full text of the letter can be found here and follows below: Dear Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell: We write today to express concern over the rising number of monkeypox virus (hereon referred to as MPV) cases in the United States, and to urge you to include funding to address this Public Health Emergency (PHE) in any forthcoming legislative package in the 117th Congress. As of August 9, 2022, there have been over 9,492 confirmed MPV/orthopoxvirus cases in the United States from when the first case in the current outbreak was identified on May 18, 2022. The current outbreak in the United States is the largest in the world by case count in the current global outbreak—which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization—and the largest in the nation’s history. As such, the outbreak was declared a national PHE by the Department of Health and Human Services on August 4, 2022. Nevertheless, we recognize that many experts have stated that the current number of cases is likely an undercount due to a gap in provider knowledge, limited access to information and testing, as well as social stigma that may increase reluctance to seek medical care. As the country continues to navigate the MPV PHE, the United States public health system remains on the frontlines in identifying MPV cases, informing Americans about access to vaccines and therapeutics, and connecting our constituents to necessary medical care and resources. A recent survey conducted by the National Coalition of STD Directors of more than 100 clinics nationwide—including Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), reproductive and sexual health clinics, and primary care providers—demonstrates that our country’s health professionals have the willingness and expertise to play a central role in the MPV response, and are already being called upon to do so. However, these care providers are in dire need of additional resources to scale an appropriate response and prevent the spread of the virus.MPV testing efforts are currently encountering processing and collection barriers that have led to underreporting of cases and poor data to aid the federal government in directing necessary resources in an appropriate manner. Additionally, as both a prophylaxis and treatment, acquiring and administering vaccines swiftly is crucial to stemming the spread of MPV and protecting all communities across the United States. Finally, clinics and providers are facing additional barriers in clinical services supplies, education for providers to properly identify MPV, vaccines, testing supplies, contact tracing, and community outreach to bolster our public health response to MPV, and ensure that accurate and adequate information is reaching our constituents. We appreciate the work that Senators Leahy, Murray, and Coons have undertaken to develop and introduce an emergency supplemental funding bill to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other emerging disease that pose a significant threat to public health, and we ask you to include additional funding in any forthcoming legislative package to address the MPV PHE in our communities. Thank you for your attention and partnership in addressing this public health concern.  "
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-statement-on-womens-health-protection-act," Today, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) released the following statement regarding the Senate vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act, legislation to codify the reproductive rights secured in Roe v. Wade:“Right now, the threat to women’s reproductive freedom posed by the Supreme Court and Senate Republicans is more urgent than ever. The Women’s Health Protection Act would guarantee the right to choose nationally, as a matter of law. Without action, women across the country could soon be subject to laws that prevent safe abortions – even in the case of rape and incest – and if Republicans continue to push for a nationwide ban, that right may be threatened even in Maryland, where we have codified Roe v. Wade.“While we did not have the votes to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act today, what we do now have is accountability. This is a central principle of our democracy, and now Americans know where each and every member stands. “This isn’t over. I will fight with everything I’ve got to protect the right to reproductive choice in our nation.”"
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/video-van-hollen-delivers-floor-speech-ahead-of-senate-vote-to-codify-roe-v-wade,"Yesterday evening, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate on the need to protect Americans’ constitutional right to reproductive freedom as the Senate today prepares to vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act, legislation that would codify the protections in Roe v. Wade. The Senate action – and the Senators’ remarks – followed the release of a draft Supreme Court opinion showing the conservative majority on the Court are poised to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, a precedent that has protected legal access to abortion under the Constitution for nearly 50 years. A full transcript of the Senator remarks follows. Video of the Senator’s full remarks can be viewed here and can be downloaded upon request.SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-Md.): Madam President, first, I want to thank my friend and colleague, the Senator from Michigan, for coming to the floor to share his own powerful and personal story and the stories of his constituents about why so many of us are here on the Senate floor this evening. And it's because eight days ago, our country received a terrible wake-up call. A leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court of the United States indicated that a majority of five Justices may be on the verge of overturning the constitutional protections of reproductive freedom set forth in Roe v. Wade. We don't know if this draft opinion will be the final decision. But we do know there's a very high chance that the Supreme Court of the United States will soon blow up 50 years of precedent and strip women of their constitutional right to make choices about their own bodies and their own self-determination. And while the content of this opinion is shocking, it's not totally surprising. This is the premeditated outcome of years – years – of plotting and planning by the right-wing legal movement and the Republican party. Candidate Donald Trump promised the nation he would handpick justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade. On the campaign trail, he even claimed that Roe would be overturned “immediately,” once he assumed office. And he stated on national television that women who receive abortions should be punished. Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans made up their own rules and then broke their own rules in order to play their part in this scheme. First, Senate Republicans refused to even hold a hearing on President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, on the grounds that it was a presidential election year. Four years later, Senate Republicans rushed through one of President Trump's own Supreme Court nominees just weeks before the 2020 election. And in between, Senate Republicans carved out an exception to the Senate filibuster rule so they could push through all three of Trump's anti-choice Supreme Court picks – Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.Each of these nominees raised their right hand before the Senate Judiciary Committee and swore under oath that they respected the weight of judicial precedent. In fact, when Brett Kavanaugh was asked about Roe v. Wade, he pointed to Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which affirmed the core holding in Roe establishing a constitutional right to abortion, and he called the decision in Casey“precedent on precedent” – a double precedent.But, Madam President, let's be very clear, this draft opinion has no respect for judicial precedent. If the draft holds, all three of President Trump's nominees to the Supreme Court – along with some others already on the bench – will have deliberately deceived and defrauded the American public. Right-wing ideologues set out to stack the court with justices ready and willing to overturn Roe v. Wade. Now, this right-wing establishment, this machinery, is on the verge of achieving their goal – even though their win will be a horrible loss for the reputation of the Supreme Court, a horrible loss for the integrity of our Constitution, and most of all a horrible loss for the American people. Madam President, more than half of the women and girls of reproductive age in our country live in states that would likely ban or severely restrict abortion if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. Thirteen states have so-called “trigger laws” that will kick into effect automatically the day Roeis overturned. Nine states have passed laws that were struck down in the past because they violated the protections of Roe, but those laws could come back if Roe v. Wade is overturned. Many of these laws we're talking about are extreme.One “trigger law” in Kentucky would ban all abortions at any point in pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape, no exceptions for incest, or a situation in which a child could be born with a fatal birth defect.Another “trigger law,” in Idaho, would make providing an abortion at any point in pregnancy, and under almost any circumstances, a felony crime punishable by five years in prison. A Texas law that's on the books right now would put doctors in jail or fine them up to $10,000 for prescribing pills for medication abortions through telehealth or the mail for women who are more than seven weeks pregnant.And a law that's been on the books since 1931 in Michigan would snap back into effect, making nearly all abortions at any point in pregnancy a felony. And women who undergo medication abortions would be made felons – even in the case of rape and incest. Just last week, state legislators in the Louisiana House advanced a bill through committee that would allow women who obtain abortions at any time in pregnancy to be prosecuted for murder – for murder. Experts say that this extreme law could also be used to restrict emergency contraception and in vitro fertilization, which is a critical process that helps couples with infertility build their families.Madam President, like many of our colleagues, I've been hearing from my constituents –  my constituents in the State of Maryland – who’ve learned just how dangerous the situation is for women and families across the country. One constituent, named Connie, shared her story of taking emergency contraception after she was attacked and raped by a stranger at the age of 18. She told me about the importance of being able to make that choice about her body and her future, instead of potentially becoming pregnant because of a rape. Today, Connie is a social worker, a therapist, and has a wonderful son. I've received other testimonials from constituents across the State of Maryland who shared their stories and expressed their deep concern and fear about the Court striking down Roe v. Wade. Madam President, if Roe is overturned, women living in states where safe and legal abortion is banned will have to travel away from their homes, away from their communities, away from their families –  simply to exercise control over their own bodies. Those who lack the money or the time will either be forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term or find somebody performing abortions in the shadows in their states – a throwback to the dangerous back-alley abortions. In 1965, eight years before the Roe v. Wade decision, illegal abortion accounted for 17 percent – 17 percent –  of all deaths attributed to pregnancy and childbirth. That past could soon be our present. So, Madam President, you see, this Supreme Court decision doesn't just turn back the clock on precedent, it turns back the clock on public health as it strips women of their reproductive freedoms.And in a world where Roe has been overturned – as you drive across our great country, your rights will change from state to state as you cross each state border. That's the result of taking away a constitutional right. And that's why polling shows the great majority of the American people do not want the Supreme Court to take away the rights under Roe v. Wade. Now, I'm proud to represent a state that has codified a woman's right to reproductive choice. In fact, during my very first campaign for public office, the right to reproductive choice was the defining issue in my election to the Maryland General Assembly. It was another time when there was great fear that a Supreme Court might overturn Roe v. Wade. And so, I ran on the pro-choice ticket. And after I was sworn in – in a matter of months – my colleagues and I passed a bill in 1991 codifying Roe v. Wade as a matter of Maryland state law. But here's the thing – laws like the one we have in Maryland – laws like the one we passed back in 1991, will be on the chopping block if this decades-long right-wing project continues to go according to plan. Because the Republicans' ultimate objective isn't just to overturn Roe v. Wade. It's to enact a federal law passed in this Senate and in the House banning abortion nationwide.Last week, Leader McConnell acknowledged that a national ban on abortion was a real possibility, during an interview with USA Today. That should sound alarm bells all over America. This has been a two-step process. Step number one: strike down the constitutional protections of Roe v. Wade that prohibit elected officials – whether in state legislatures or in Congress – from enacting laws that prohibit or restrict unnecessarily the right to choose. That's step one – seems we're on the verge of that happening. Once you clear the way – step two: enact a federal law in Congress banning abortion everywhere in the country. And we've seen exactly how extreme those laws can be from the state examples I cited earlier. That could happen here if this Republican right-wing project sees its logical end.  That federal law would supersede Maryland's law. If Congress passed that law and it was enacted, state laws like those in Maryland protecting the right to choose in Maryland would be knocked off the books. That's true of other state laws – statutes – that protect a woman's right to choose. No woman in America would be safe to attain a safe and legal abortion if such a national law were enacted.Now, Madam President, everyone should also understand another huge danger posed by the draft. Its flawed logic not only would dismantle the right to an abortion. It could also be used to strip away other rights protected by the Constitution. I've read Justice Alito's draft opinion. I’ve read all 98 pages of it. In this opinion, Justice Alito tries to distinguish – he tries to distinguish this case on abortion from other cases involving other individual rights. Alito claims that this case is special because it involves abortion and the State’s interest in protecting life, while other cases do not. Well, that's obvious on its face. But it misses the bigger danger in Alito's opinion. Because it doesn't change the fact that Justice Alito's reasoning for dismantling the right to obtain an abortion, can be used to dismantle many other rights that we currently take for granted as well. Justice Alito claims that even as you look at the entire Constitution, you cannot find a right to choose for women – that you cannot derive that from the Constitution. In fact, on page five of the draft opinion, Justice Alito writes: “The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision.” And if we follow Justice Alito's flawed logic, the same could be said of a host of other rights that are not specifically named in the Constitution. The Constitution doesn't have the word “contraception” in it. The Constitution doesn't talk about consenting adults engaged in sexual relations. Look, this is the thing – over time the Supreme Court has recognized components of liberty through a close analysis of the Bill of Rights in the 14th Amendment, and that includes the right to use contraception, the right of consenting adults to have sexual relations with who they choose, and the right to marry who you love.These are rights the American people don't want elected officials to take away, whether they're state legislators, or members of the Senate, or the House. But they're all at peril too if the logic of Alito's reasoning is played out. And the terrible irony, the terrible irony here, is those who most claim to oppose government regulations of any kind are now the ones rushing to regulate the most intimate, personal, and private aspects of American life. They say they don't want government having any role in their life, “get out of my way” – except for when it comes to them taking away this right and planning to pass laws that would ban abortion nationally – and as I said, opening the door to go in after other liberties, as well.  So those are the stakes that we're facing as we gather here this evening in anticipation of tomorrow's vote. And that's why we're taking this vote tomorrow. That's why we need to pass the Women's Health Protection Act. But even if we fall short this time, having a vote now is important. It's important to the country. Democracy requires accountability, and it's important that the American people know where each of the Senators stands on this issue. It's a fundamental question. So, Madam President, as we move into November toward the midterm elections, the American people will be watching closely how members of this body vote on this fundamental constitutional question. And they will look to see who voted to strip away constitutional rights and who rose to protect them. And Madam President, I believe that the majority of this country – the overwhelming majority of this country – wants to stand up to protect fundamental liberties in the Constitution of the United States."

For young scientists, especially those from underserved communities, learning in an enriching environment at one of Maryland’s outstanding universities can help progress their academic trajectory or career goals and ultimately develop a more diverse pipeline of Marylanders in the STEM fields. That’s why we continue to fight for resources for programs like these to help expand these unique opportunities for young students as they choose their future careers,” said the lawmakers. These funds are distributed through the Minority University Research and Education Project (MUREP) and are administered through NASA’s Office of STEM Engagement – which Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin and Congressmen Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, and Kweisi Mfume secured an additional $10 million for in the FY22 appropriations legislation. MUREP is designed to help increase the number of students pursuing STEM careers from traditionally underrepresented and underserved communities through pre-college summer programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs)."

https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-cardin-announce-federal-funding-for-bowie-state-university-innovation-programs,"Today, U.S. Senate Appropriations Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee Chair Chris Van Hollen and U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship Chair Ben Cardin and (both D-Md.) announced $4 million in congressionally directed spending to support innovation programs at Bowie State University, the oldest Historically Black College and University (HBCU) in Maryland. The senators secured $3 million for the Bowie Business Innovation Center (Bowie BIC), as well as $1 million for the university to develop a new laboratory for hydroponics research.In addition to the announcement, the senators joined university President Dr. Aminta H. Breaux, Bowie BIC Executive Director Lisa S. Smith, graduates of the Bowie BIC business accelerator programs, entrepreneurs, and regional small business leaders for a listening session about the challenges facing Prince George’s County entrepreneurs and small businesses. The senators also heard from graduates of Bowie BIC’s 8(a) Accelerator Program, who informed the senators about their experience navigating the federal contracting process. “The Bowie Business Innovation Center is a pioneering initiative providing underserved small businesses with the tools they need to succeed and better position them to obtain government contracts. That’s why I was proud to join Senator Cardin in supporting a $3 million federal investment for the BIC within the federal funding bill this year,” said Senator Van Hollen. “With these funds Bowie State will be able to expand services for Marylanders – and the Bowie BIC will help other HBCUs around the country replicate its success. We will keep working to bring more growth opportunities by leveraging federal investments to Bowie State and all of our state’s HBCUs, which play an integral role in opening the doors to opportunity to people across Maryland.”“The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that our nation’s HBCUs are perfectly situated to help connect minorities, women, and other underserved entrepreneurs to the services and resources they need to succeed,” Cardin said. “The $3 million in congressionally directed funding will increase the Bowie Business Innovation Center’s capacity to help underserved entrepreneurs more than ten-fold. The Bowie BIC inspired my UPLIFT Act, which would create a national network of accelerators and incubators on HBCU, MSI, and community college campuses. I remain hopeful that we will pass this legislation to tap into the entrepreneurial spirit that is surging through our communities.”“The $3 million received in federal funding will help to create the Bowie BIC Center of Excellence pilot program that will deliver targeted resources to strengthen HBCUs,” said Aminta Breaux, President of Bowie State University. “The program will also expand the existing work of the only 8(a) Accelerator Program in the country.  We are grateful to Senator Cardin for helping us to secure the necessary funds to ensure continued success. This additional support will allow for the expansion and replication of the Bowie BIC 8(a) Accelerator Program mode through partnerships with other HBCUs. Additionally, we thank Senator Van Hollen for his work in securing $1 million to develop the Laboratory for Hydroponics and Aquaponics Research at Bowie State University.” The new $3 million direct federal funding award to establish the Bowie BIC Center of Excellence for 8(a) Government Contracting at Bowie State University is a historic development,” said Lisa S. Smith, Executive Director of the Bowie BIC, a non-profit business accelerator located at Bowie State University. “We are truly grateful to Senator Cardin and Senator Van Hollen for their work to secure this funding. With this funding, our award-winning 8(a) Accelerator Program can be expanded through the Center of Excellence and become a new resource for HBCU’s in America by helping socially and economically disadvantaged companies participate fully in the U.S Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a) Program and win government contracts that build wealth for the contractors, and bring jobs to their communities.”The award-winning Bowie Business Innovation Center 8(a) Accelerator program—the first in America—is a fast track for helping certified U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) contractors in the SBA 8(a) Business Development program win federal government contracts. Bowie BIC’s 8(a) Accelerator program focuses on the development of a targeted federal capture strategy, mentoring and networking.The senators also secured $1 million in direct funding for the Bowie State University Laboratory for Hydroponics Research to position Bowie State students and researchers at the forefront of cutting-edge research in plant biology and agriculture.Senators Cardin and Van Hollen present check to Bowie BIC Executive Director Lisa Smith and BSU President Aminta Breaux (Photo/BSU)Senators Cardin and Van Hollen pose for photo with Bowie Mayor Tim Adams, Breaux, Smith, and Bowie BIC board members and graduates (Photo/BSU)"

https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-booker-brown-urge-starbucks-ceo-to-support-unionization-efforts,"Today, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) joined Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) in urging Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz to cease efforts to undermine unionization campaigns occurring at the company’s locations, and instead support employee-led union efforts nationwide. In a letter, the Senators detailed the company’s proposal to deny new, expanded benefits to unionized workers, and made clear interfering with workers’ right to organize is an illegal, unfair labor practice. Senator Van Hollen has voiced his support for workers unionizing across the country and their right to organize to improve pay and working conditions, including at a Baltimore Starbucks – the first Starbucks in Maryland to unionize.“We urge you to listen to the voices of your partners who are joining together to create a fairer and safer workplace for all Starbucks employees by voluntarily recognizing unionization efforts and actively pursuing a nationwide agreement to provide coverage for all Starbucks employees,” wrote the Senators. “Your employees have worked throughout the pandemic, keeping communities comforted and caffeinated while fueling strong company profits. Now we urge you to listen to your employees and hear their pleas to improve the company they are dedicated to serving.” The Senators detailed Starbucks’ recent efforts to provide benefits toward only non-unionized employees while consciously excluding union employees and stated that increasing benefits “is doing what the union campaigns have said all along: Starbucks can and should provide better working conditions and benefits for its workers.” Noting that “suggesting publicly that benefits cannot be extended to workers in a union is a bad faith move to undermine contract negotiations with unionized locations,” the Senators called on Schultz to “truly work together with [his] employees by forming collective bargaining agreements…to set new standards in an industry that has become synonymous with driving a race to the bottom in our economy.”In conclusion, the Senators highlighted that “a unionized workforce spurs economic growth, productivity, and reduces rates of turnover” and that “union households have twice the amount of net wealth as non-union households” – a figure that is three and a half times more for Black families and five times more for Hispanic families. The letter was co-signed by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).Throughout his career, Senator Van Hollen has consistently supported workers’ rights:Full text of the letter can be found here and below. Dear Mr. Schultz:We write to express support for workers across the nation who are taking the steps to form unions at many of your stores. Their actions provide an opportunity for Starbucks to be the twenty-first century leader for corporations by once again setting industry standards for what is possible when workers are heard and their rights protected. We urge you to listen to the voices of your partners who are joining together to create a fairer and safer workplace for all Starbucks employees by voluntarily recognizing unionization efforts and actively pursuing a nationwide agreement to provide coverage for all Starbucks employees.  We were pleased by your announcement1 this month to halt the practice of stock buybacks and commit to reinvesting profits into your workforce instead. Your employees have worked throughout the pandemic, keeping communities comforted and caffeinated while fueling strong company profits. Now we urge you to listen to your employees and hear their pleas to improve the company they are dedicated to serving. Starbucks is an American success story, and at this moment you can be the model other corporations look to by partnering with your workers who are risking their livelihoods to demand a voice on the job through a union. However, we are deeply troubled by reports that, on the heels of the stock buyback announcement, Starbucks has taken steps to undermine nation-wide, worker-led union campaigns. Earlier this month , you described new efforts at Starbucks to target benefits toward non-unionized employees while consciously excluding union employees. You suggest that your lawyers have indicated that it would be illegal to increase benefits for workers in a union. We write to underscore that attempts to interfere with workers’ right to organize is an illegal unfair labor practice under Section 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”) by “discriminat[ing] in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization”.First, we note that by offering to increase benefits for your workers, Starbucks is doing what the union campaigns have said all along: Starbucks can and should provide better working conditions and benefits for its workers. It is unfortunate that Starbucks has chosen to do this now seemingly to interfere with the union campaigns, since such action would constitute impermissible interference in a union organizing drive.Second, as you and your lawyers know well, there is nothing keeping Starbucks from offering benefits to workers in a union – the union simply needs to be consulted first. That is the purpose of a union: it gives workers a voice in their workplace. Your comments suggesting that workers in support of union are “colluding with outside union forces” contradicts your goal to “co- creat[e] our future directly as partners.” Your “partners” include more than a thousand workers across 17 states who have, to date, voted in favor of a union. Suggesting publicly that benefits cannot be extended to workers in a union is a bad faith move to undermine contract negotiations with unionized locations. We urge you to, instead, truly work together with your employees by forming collective bargaining agreements to build that future, helping to set new standards in an industry that has become synonymous with driving a race to the bottom in our economy. For over one hundred years, unions have been the driving force behind almost every single improvement in workplace conditions, wages, and overall quality of life for workers from all parts of the economy. The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the lack of protections non-unionized workers endure and the benefits that collective worker voices can achieve. Throughout the pandemic, unions negotiated health and safety measures, paid sick leave, and job preservation. These workers felt more secure speaking out about hazards and therefore contributed to a safer and healthier workplace, which benefits us all.  Empowered workers who have the right to organize for better pay, improved working conditions, and a secure retirement are safer, happier and a part of a better and more productive workplace. We know that a unionized workforce spurs economic growth, productivity and reduces rates of turnover. We also know that union households have twice the amount of net wealth as non-union households – that figure is three-and-half times more for Black families and five times more for Hispanic families . Workers who have called on you to support unionization efforts deserve the company that Starbuck seeks to be, one that is inclusive and built on investing its greatest asset: its workers.Starbucks is a pathbreaking company. As you look to its future, we urge you to remain a national and global leader by setting new standards for employer-worker relationships. This is an opportunity to work together with your workers instead of illegally retaliating against them. It’s a chance to help set standards for not only your 300,000 workers, but for the millions in the food service industry all across the country as well.Sincerely, "
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-klobuchar-grassley-push-for-funding-to-address-avian-influenza-outbreak,"U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) joined Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) in a bipartisan push for more funding to help address the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak. “HPAI has been detected in 32 states across the country and has killed over 36 million birds. Although the virus poses minimal risk to human health, it has serious implications for U.S. poultry producers, rural communities, and our agricultural economy,” the senators wrote to Senate Appropriations Committee leaders. “Given the recent outbreak, the ongoing increase in confirmed HPAI cases, and the likelihood of further spread, we urge the Subcommittee to make funding for the APHIS avian health program a high priority. These funds are critical to continue HPAI response measures.”In addition to Van Hollen, Klobuchar, and Grassley, the letter was also signed by Senators Tom Carper (D-Del.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). The full text of the letter is available HERE and below:Dear Chairman Baldwin and Ranking Member Hoeven:As you prepare the Fiscal Year 2023 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, we request robust funding to address the ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak. Since it was first confirmed in February 2022 in a commercial turkey flock in Indiana, HPAI has been detected in 32 states across the country and has killed over 36 million birds. Although the virus poses minimal risk to human health, it has serious implications for U.S. poultry producers, rural communities, and our agricultural economy.These are the first positive HPAI cases since the 2015 outbreak that killed more than 50 million birds, accounting for 12 percent of the egg laying hen population and 8 percent of the turkey inventory. The Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), in partnership with state and local agencies, has responded quickly and applied the experience gained from the 2015 outbreak to better inform on-the-ground, rapid response efforts. The APHIS avian health program is responsible for avian influenza surveillance, reporting, and control efforts, as well as distributing indemnity payments to affected poultry producers. As the number of confirmed HPAI cases has increased, APHIS has ramped up its action in response, using significant resources to do so.  The President’s budget request for the APHIS avian health program was $65 million for FY 2023, which reflects a small increase from the enacted level of $63 million in FY2021 and 2022. Given the recent outbreak, the ongoing increase in confirmed HPAI cases, and the likelihood of further spread, we urge the Subcommittee to make funding for the APHIS avian health program a high priority. These funds are critical to continue HPAI response measures. Thank you for your consideration of our request."
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-colleagues-seek-to-reauthorize-bipartisan-star-act-to-combat-childhood-cancer,"In an effort to help thousands of children who undergo cancer treatment each year, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) joined Senators Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) in introducing the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research (STAR) Reauthorization Act. This bipartisan legislation would reauthorize the Childhood Cancer STAR Act, the most comprehensive childhood cancer bill ever passed by Congress. This legislation was initially introduced in the House by then-Congressman Van Hollen – it was later passed in 2018.   The STAR Act helps advance pediatric cancer research and child-focused cancer treatments, while also improving childhood cancer surveillance and providing resources for survivors and those impacted by childhood cancer.  Since being signed into law the STAR Act has helped deliver over $120 million to fund promising childhood cancer research and assist patients and families battling cancer. “Far too many families in Maryland and across the country face the nightmare of a child with cancer – and while their stories are all different, all of these mothers, fathers, and children are looking for hope,” said Senator Van Hollen, who introduced the Childhood Cancer STAR Act during his time in the House of Representatives. “That’s why we fought to pass the initial Childhood Cancer STAR Act, and why we’re working to invest in even more research and better treatments. Maryland is proud to be home to both NIH and NCI, and this investment will help them ultimately save lives.”“Reauthoring the STAR Act would mean more help for kids battling cancer.  It will target federal research to ensure the medical community is better equipped to diagnose and treat pediatric cancers and assist young patients and their families.  Renewing the STAR Act will get us closer to the goal of one day curing cancers in children, adolescents, and young adults,” said Senator Reed.  “The Childhood Cancer STAR Act will support cancer research and deliver needed assistance to children with cancer and their families.  It will develop new strategies to help survivors overcome late health effects, such as secondary cancers.” “I was incredibly proud to be part of the passage of the STAR Act in 2018, which has made an important difference in the lives of children with cancer, we well as childhood cancer survivors and their families. Since that time, the legislation has resulted in unprecedented opportunities and funding for childhood cancer research, allowed us to better understand and track the incidence of disease, and improved the quality of life for childhood cancer survivors. This reauthorization will allow these opportunities to continue and bring us closer to a world without childhood cancer,” Senator Capito said.“Cancer is an unimaginable and heartbreaking experience for anyone—particularly for children who are diagnosed and the caregivers who support them in their treatment journey. The STAR Act Reauthorization takes a multifaceted approach to addressing childhood cancer by boosting research efforts, bolstering data collection, and improving the quality of life for all the brave children who’ve survived this awful disease,” said Senator Murkowski. “I’m proud to help introduce a comprehensive childhood cancer bill in an effort to help create a world for future generations where the phrase ‘you have cancer’ doesn’t exist.” There are over one hundred different subtypes of childhood cancers.  Most new cancer diagnoses in children are for leukemia (28.1%) and brain/CNS cancers (26.5%), while malignant epithelial neoplasms and melanomas (23.3%) and brain/CNS cancers (21.9%) are top cancers for adolescents, according to Children’s Cancer Cause. Childhood cancer research has progressed in recent years, but after accidents, cancer is still the second leading cause of death in children ages 1 to 14, according to the American Cancer Society. Health experts estimate that nearly 10,500 children in the United States under the age of 15 will be diagnosed with cancer in 2022.As a longtime champion of solutions to tackle childhood cancer, last Spring, the Senator met with President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and a bipartisan group of Congressional lawmakers to discuss the future of fighting cancer, Alzheimer’s, and other diseases in the United States. The Senator later joined President Biden to reignite the Cancer Moonshot and establish a new agency, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, or ARPA-H, to better prevent, detect, and diagnose cancer to save lives.U.S. Representatives Michael McCaul (R-Texas), Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), and Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), are introducing companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. Summary: The Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research (STAR) Reauthorization Act of 2022 would: "

In their letter to the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, the senators also ask for $1 billion to continue to increase U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Conservation Operations to help ensure farmers, ranchers, and foresters can be part of the climate solution.“Recognizing the importance of land-based solutions in combating climate change, it is necessary to continue federal investments in United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) conservation programs,” wrote the senators. “We need strong investments in USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) staff and resources to support farmers, ranchers and foresters to help mitigate and adapt to climate change.”In the recent FY22 omnibus spending bill, the Senate passed $904 million for NRCS Conservation Operations. The NRCS staff help implement several Farm Bill conservation programs that are critical to helping farmers, foresters, and ranchers conserve land and water, protect water quality, and improve soil health. The senators continued: “As producers face growing productivity and environmental challenges such as droughts, wildfires, and floods, these programs help build resiliency and support the economic viability of family farms. These programs also help producers implement climate-smart conservation practices and enhance productivity. Maintaining full mandatory funding, as authorized in the 2018 Farm Bill, will keep working farms and ranches productive and benefit the environment.”In addition to Van Hollen, Bennet, Stabenow, and Coons, this letter is signed by U.S. Senators Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Angus King (I-Maine), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Tina Smith (D-Minn.). The text of the letter is available HERE and below.Dear Chair Baldwin and Ranking Member Hoeven:Thank you for your work to fully fund Farm Bill conservation programs and increase Conservation Operations in the fiscal year (FY) 2022 omnibus appropriations bill. As your subcommittee considers its FY 2023 appropriations bill, we write to request that you support full mandatory funding for Farm Bill conservation programs and continue to increase Conservation Operations by providing it $1 billion.  Earlier this month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its Sixth Assessment Report, which provides an updated global assessment of climate change mitigation progress and pledges, and examines the sources of global emissions. The IPCC report makes clear that land-based mitigation measures in the agriculture, forestry, and other land use sectors represent some of the most important options currently available for large-scale emissions reductions and also removal and storage of carbon dioxide at scale.  Recognizing the importance of land-based solutions in combating climate change, it is necessary to continue federal investments in United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) conservation programs. We need strong investments in USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) staff and resources to support farmers, ranchers and foresters to help mitigate and adapt to climate change. NRCS staff help implement a number of Farm Bill conservation programs like the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP), Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP), and Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP). These programs are critical to helping farmers, foresters, and ranchers conserve land and water, protect water quality, and improve soil health. As producers face growing productivity and environmental challenges such as droughts, wildfires, and floods, these programs help build resiliency and support the economic viability of family farms. These programs also help producers implement climate-smart conservation practices and enhance productivity. Maintaining full mandatory funding, as authorized in the 2018 Farm Bill, will keep working farms and ranches productive and benefit the environment. NRCS field staff are invaluable resources for farmers and ranchers across the country, providing direct technical assistance and planning support for those interested in enrolling in the aforementioned programs. USDA’s ability to deliver conservation programs depends heavily on this on-the-ground technical assistance, or conservation technical assistance (CTA). CTA provides landowners with unique, location-specific solutions so farmers and ranchers can implement conservation practices on their lands, while providing accountability to ensure maximum return on the public investment. It is critical that NRCS offices are well-staffed to best serve our country’s producers and foresters so that we may better mitigate and adapt to climate change. Less than adequate funding for technical assistance and staffing would severely limit farmers and ranchers’ abilities to build soil health, protect water quality, create and maintain habitat for threatened, endangered, or economically important fish and wildlife, and prepare for and manage drought and flooding.Again, we urge you to fully fund Farm Bill conservation programs and increase funding for Conservation Operations to $1 billion so our farmers, ranchers, and foresters can be part of the climate solution. Sincerely,"
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-and-cardin-urge-sba-to-process-pending-eidl-applications-using-available-funds,"Today, U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government Chair Chris Van Hollen and U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship Chair Ben Cardin (both D-Md.)  sent a letter to U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Isabella Casillas Guzman urging the agency to process pending COVID Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Program applications using available funds.Last week, the SBA announced that the deadline for existing borrowers to submit applications for loan modifications, rehearings, and appeals would by May 6. Yesterday, May 5, the SBA alerted the borrowers that the agency would no longer be accepting applications—one day ahead of its own deadline—due to a lack of funding. By the SBA’s own admission, there may still be funding available for transfer to the program to meet demand.The senators urged the SBA to use its transfer authority to accommodate borrowers who want to submit for a modification, rehearing, or appeal. The senators wrote, “By prematurely shutting down the program, the agency appears to have prioritized its own administrative needs over those of the thousands of borrowers that await decisions on their applications. Furthermore, it has done so in a way that has needlessly confused borrowers and raised expectations..”The senators continued, “… if funding does indeed remain available that could be transferred under the authority of the IIJA to serve borrowers in the EIDL loan program, SBA should exercise that authority immediately so that pending applications for modifications, rehearings and appeals can be processed and funded.”You can read the full letter here or below: Dear Administrator Guzman: We are writing to express disappointment in the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) decision to close down the COVID EIDL program ahead of the May 6th deadline that it announced to borrowers last week. This decision is particularly confounding when, by the agency’s own admission, additional funding remains available for transfer to the EIDL program under the authority of section 90006(b)(2)(A) of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). By prematurely shutting down the program, the agency appears to have prioritized its own administrative needs over those of the thousands of borrowers that await decisions on their applications. Furthermore, it has done so in a way that has needlessly confused borrowers and raised expectations.Over the past week, SBA sent notifications encouraging existing borrowers to apply before the program closed on May 6th.  By announcing that the program was out of funds on May 5th, prior to the application deadline, the SBA has misled thousands of struggling small businesses into believing that funding for EIDL loans would be available.  Furthermore, if funding does indeed remain available that could be transferred under the authority of the IIJA to serve borrowers in the EIDL loan program, SBA should exercise that authority immediately so that pending applications for modifications, rehearings and appeals can be processed and funded.The administration’s request in the President’s Budget for $320 million in transfer authority from the EIDL Targeted Advance program has not been approved by Congress, and it is not within the administration’s authority to prejudge Congress’s intent by setting aside funding for program administration when eligible small businesses have yet to be served. Considering that SBA transferred $500 million to its administrative account less than two months ago under separate authority in section 90006(b)(2)(B) of the IIJA, the decision to refuse to tap funding that could be used to keep the EIDL program operational is that much harder to comprehend.We expect your agency to take swift action to make all available funding accessible to eligible applicants immediately and look forward to your prompt response.  Sincerely,"
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/05/06/2022/van-hollen-sullivan-recognize-us-foreign-service-day,"U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), co-founders of the bipartisan Senate Foreign Service Caucus, announced they will introduce a resolution celebrating May 6, 2022, as “Foreign Service Day.” The day recognizes the men and women who have served, or are presently serving, in the Foreign Service of the United States and honors the members of the Foreign Service who have given their lives in the line of duty. Foreign Service Day has been celebrated on the first Friday in May for generations. 2022 marks 98 years since the establishment of the Foreign Service in 1924.Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) also co-sponsored the resolution.This year’s “Foreign Service Day” also commemorates six months since the Foreign Service Families Act passed in the Senate. The bill—authored by Senators Van Hollen and Sullivan—was signed into law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act on December 27, 2021. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.) are also original cosponsors of the Foreign Service Families Act.The Foreign Service, comprising 16,000 U.S. personnel, plus 75,000 locally-engaged personnel who serve at embassies and consulates overseas, are members of the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of Commerce, the Foreign Agricultural Service, the Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service, and the U.S. Agency for Global Media. “Our Foreign Service members commit themselves to protect and promote America’s interests – often at great personal risk and sacrifice. Their dedication is vital to maintaining and advancing American diplomacy around the world. That’s why I’m honored to recognize these men and women, their families, and their immense contributions to our nation in celebration of Foreign Service Day today. I’m proud to have bolstered our Foreign Service members through the passage of our bipartisan Foreign Service Families Act – included in last year’s National Defense Authorization Act. Our Foreign Service members are true patriots, and I will always have their backs,” said Senator Van Hollen. “For 98 years, the men and women of the Foreign Service have promoted America’s interests, strengthened our national security, and assisted U.S. citizens abroad,” Senator Sullivan said. “Today, my colleagues and I salute the hard-working members of the U.S. Foreign Service and reaffirm our commitment to providing this crucial diplomatic corps with the support they need and deserve.”“Each year on the first Friday in May, we commemorate Foreign Service Day to honor those who gave their lives in service to their nation, defending the security, prosperity, and fundamental values of the United States,” said Ambassador Eric Rubin, president of AFSA. “Today, democracy, human rights, individual freedom, and the rule of law are under siege around the world, and U.S. security and economic interests are under threat. Members of the Foreign Service remain ready to defend them, to take necessary risks and accept the hardships that come with serving as the first line of defense for our nation. I thank our caucus co-chairs for their commemoration of this day and the resolution recognizing the important work of the Foreign Service.” "

https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-brown-klobuchar-urge-capitol-cafeteria-management-to-ensure-senate-dining-contract-leads-to-a-collective-bargaining-agreement,"Today, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen joined Senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) in sending a letter to the Architect of the Capitol, Compass Group CEO, and Restaurant Associates CFO, urging them to work together to ensure the Senate cafeteria workers receive fair wages and benefits that reflect their substantial contributions to our Capitol community.  “Now that the immediate threat of layoffs is behind us, we encourage the Architect of the Capitol to work with all stakeholders, including Restaurant Associates and UNITE HERE, to ensure that the Senate food services contract reflects a commitment to a collective bargaining agreement with quality pay and benefits for all workers,” wrote the senators. Workers at the Senate cafeteria proudly serve U.S. Senators and staffers every day at the Capitol. They are fighting for a union contract that will offer fair wages, affordable health insurance, a pension, and job security—the latter of which has become more urgent than ever. Currently, only 18% of workers are enrolled in health insurance through the company because it’s too expensive at their current wage scale.Along with Van Hollen, Brown, and Klobuchar, the letter was signed by U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Thomas Carper (D-Del.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). You can read the full letter here or below.Dear Mr. Blanton, Mr. Green, and Mr. Sargis:We write to urge you to work together to ensure our Senate cafeteria workers receive fair wages and benefits that reflect their substantial contributions to our Capitol community. As you know, the Architect of the Capitol has received funds to protect Senate food service workers’ jobs. This critical relief comes after Restaurant Associates, the contractor, announced a series of layoffs a few weeks ago, just as the Senate is taking steps to reopen to the public. After these dedicated employees faced down a violent insurrection at the Capitol and continued to serve through more than two years of a pandemic, layoffs should never have been on the table. We understand that the ongoing public health crisis and security measures have led to financial challenges in Senate restaurants. While steps to reopen the Capitol are already underway and additional measures are being considered subject to the approval of the Capitol Police Board, foot traffic in the Senate cafeteria has been a fraction of what it was pre-pandemic and catering operations have ceased. The timing of the announced layoffs was also concerning. The announcement was made after Senate food service workers obtained union recognition—represented by UNITE HERE Local 23 following a majority card count and voluntary recognition—but before they entered into a collective bargaining agreement with Restaurant Associates. Dozens of workers were scheduled to lose their jobs before they were protected by a collective bargaining agreement and just as the Capitol Complex was beginning to reopen, which will undoubtedly increase revenue for Senate restaurants.  The current pay and benefits available to Senate cafeteria workers are already shameful. Of all cafeteria workers in federal buildings around Washington, D.C., Senate cafeteria workers are the least likely to be enrolled in employer-sponsored health insurance or retirement—only 18 percent have employer-sponsored health insurance and none are enrolled in employer-sponsored pension benefits. For these workers to be laid off after serving this body throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in these conditions would be a stain on our institution. On January 13, 2022, the Senate unanimously passed Resolution 490 honoring Capitol custodial and service workers for their bravery and service in the face of an attack by violent insurrectionists. The resolution specifically references Restaurant Associates and Sodexo staff in its findings and expresses gratitude for and provides support to Capitol personnel. The resolution also reaffirms a commitment to achieving “higher pay, collective bargaining rights, paid sick and vacation leave, and comprehensive health insurance with mental health resources” for personnel. We urge you to prioritize the needs of the essential workers of the United States Senate in line with the criteria set forth by the resolution. Now that the immediate threat of layoffs is behind us, we encourage the Architect of the Capitol to work with all stakeholders, including Restaurant Associates and UNITE HERE, to ensure that the Senate food services contract reflects a commitment to a collective bargaining agreement with quality pay and benefits for all workers. We thank you for working to resolve this matter as quickly as possible. Sincerely,"
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-booker-re-introduce-legislation-to-boost-teacher-compensation-by-up-to-15000,"U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) joined Senator Cory Booker (D-N.J.) alongside Representatives Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.), John Larson (D-Conn.), and Mark Takano (D-Calif.) in introducing legislation that would boost teacher compensation by putting tax money back in their pockets and help diversify the teaching workforce. The bill, called the Respect, Advancement, and Increasing Support for Educators (RAISE) Act, would provide educators with a minimum of $1000 in refundable tax credits and as much as $15,000. Currently, public elementary and secondary teachers earn about 20 percent less than similarly educated professions. Based on a worldwide comparison, the average salary gap between teachers and others with comparable educational backgrounds is greater in the U.S. than in any other OECD country with available data.  Early childhood educators fare far worse, with a national median wage of $11.65 an hour, well below the national living wage threshold. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly every state in the nation reported shortages of teachers in high-need subjects like science, math, special education, and English language development. Additionally, low income and students of color are the least likely to have access to a stable educator workforce, with nearly 50 percent higher teacher turnover rates in high-poverty schools.Through refundable tax credits, the RAISE Act will help boost the compensation of early childhood, elementary, and secondary school teachers. Depending on the level of poverty in the schools educators serve, public school teachers would be eligible for a tax credit up to $15,000. The bill would also double the educator tax deduction, which teachers can use to offset the cost of school supplies, and expand eligibility to early childhood educators.Specifically, The RAISE Act would:The following Senators also co-sponsored the legislation: Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Brown (D-Ohio), Duckworth (D-Ill.), Heinrich (D- N.M.)

https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-menendez-rubio-colleagues-introduce-bipartisan-resolution-to-commemorate-world-press-freedom-day,"U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) joined Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) alongside Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Time Kaine (D-Va.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Jim Moran (R-Kan.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and John Cornyn (R-Texas) in introducing a Senate Resolution to commemorate World Press Freedom Day and to recognize growing threats to press freedom and free expression worldwide. The bipartisan resolution reaffirms the vital role that a free and independent press plays in combatting the growing threat of authoritarianism, countering misinformation and disinformation, documenting human rights abuses, informing local and international audiences about public health crises, and furthering discourse and debate to advance healthy democracies. “This World Press Freedom Day, I am proud to once again be joined by my colleagues in recognizing the immense strength of an informed public and the importance of free press as a foundational pillar of democracy,” Chairman Menendez said. “As we witness more governments and malign actors across the world desperately try to muzzle the press to prevent the facts from reaching their own people, our support for the brave journalists risking everything to advance truth, transparency and accountability has never been more critical.  From Moscow to Washington D.C., free expression and a free and independent press are not only central to the health of a society, but are at the forefront of our efforts to protect and advance human rights and good governance worldwide.”“A free press serves as a check on tyranny and authoritarianism around the globe. But recent attacks on the media and journalists have put this freedom under great threat. We must stand in solidarity with all those who report the truth and especially those who do so in the face of repressive regimes. No one should ever have their rights threatened for telling the facts,” said Senator Van Hollen.“Journalists provide crucial insights into human suffering, corruption, and unrest worldwide,” Senator Rubio said. “Sadly, authoritarians such as those in the People’s Republic of China, Russia, Iran, Cuba, and Nicaragua are fiercely determined to censure any voice that challenges their own twisted narratives. I am proud to introduce this resolution and lend my unwavering support to the cause of press freedom worldwide.”“On this World Press Freedom Day, we are confronted by the very real dangers facing professional journalists every day in war zones like Ukraine and repressive, autocratic regimes like Russia. The men and women who continue to report despite the hardships and risks, are guardians of the truth and democracy,” said Senator Cardin. “The United States is not immune from efforts to limit open reporting and spread disinformation, even violence against members of the media. We must continue to support journalists as they carry out their work to report the truth here at home and around the world.”“This resolution sends the important message that press freedom remains essential and attempts to threaten the rights of journalists represent a serious affront to universal human rights,” said Senator Kaine. “Those principles must stay top-of-mind not only on World Press Freedom Day, but every day.” “Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine is just the most recent reminder of how important it is to have a free press that can report on the truth and hold leaders accountable so the world can know the unvarnished facts on the ground,” Senator Coons said. “On World Press Freedom Day, we must recommit ourselves to standing up to autocrats who clamp down on independent journalists, working to ensure reporters around the world can do their jobs without fearing for their personal safety, and vigilantly defending first amendment rights here at home.”“Journalists in Ukraine risk their lives to help pull back the curtain on the atrocities being committed by the Russian military against civilians,” said Senator Moran. “While freedom of the press is enshrined in our Constitution, members of the press in many places around the world do not enjoy the same protections. We must do our part to cultivate freedom for the press around the globe.”“Freedom of the press and freedom of speech are both vital to democracy and we should do everything we can to protect it,” said Senator Tillis. “I am proud to introduce this bipartisan resolution to raise awareness around this universal freedom and to recognize those journalists who deliver the truth to the people every day, especially those who lost their lives doing so.”Find a copy of the resolution HERE."

Wade:“If this draft decision stands, the Supreme Court will strip Americans of their reproductive rights and put at risk the lives and health of tens of millions of women. This deeply damaging and draconian opinion would overturn almost fifty years of precedent – following the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade to uphold a woman’s constitutional right to choose – and would undermine the will of the American people. It would strip away the right to a safe and legal abortion. I am determined to fight with everything we’ve got to protect reproductive rights in our nation. We must act immediately to codify Roe v. Wade, and we can’t let anything stand in our way.”Senator Van Hollen is an original cosponsor of the Women’s Health Protection Act, legislation that would codify the protections guaranteed under Roe v. Wade nationwide."
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-rosen-urge-president-biden-to-expedite-solar-tariff-investigation-decision,"U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) joined Senator Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) alongside Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) in a bipartisan letter urging President Joe Biden to expedite and bring to a swift conclusion the Administration’s investigation into solar panels and cells imported from Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia and requesting a meeting to discuss this issue. This investigation could expand harmful, job-killing tariffs on solar imports, raising costs on consumers, and has already caused widespread cancellations and delays in the U.S. solar industry. The solar industry employs over 230,000 American workers, including more than 6,000 Nevadans. According to a new report issued by the Solar Energy Industries Association, 70 percent of U.S. companies say at least half of their solar workforce is at risk as a result of this investigation.  This bipartisan letter was also signed by Senators Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Angus King (I-Maine), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii), John W. Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Christopher Murphy (D-Conn.),  Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.). “Initiation of this investigation is already causing massive disruption in the solar industry, and it will severely harm American solar businesses and workers and increase costs for American families as long as it continues,” wrote the Senators. “We strongly urge your administration to swiftly review the case and make an expedited preliminary determination. Such a determination should carefully consider the significant policy ramifications and reject the petitioner’s request for retroactivity.”  “Already, as a result of Commerce’s decision to initiate this investigation, industry surveys indicate that 83% of U.S. solar companies report being notified of canceled or delayed panel supply. Without a reliable and cost-effective source of panels, existing and proposed solar projects could come to a halt,” the Senators’ letter continued. “Left unaddressed, cutting off this supply of panels and cells also could cause the loss of more than 100,000 American jobs, including approximately 18,000 manufacturing jobs.”Full text of the letter is available here."

It’s clear that accelerating our transition to a clean energy economy is necessary to reduce the price of energy, strengthen our national security, and confront climate change.” “The war in Ukraine has underscored how our dependence on oil fills the coffers of tyrants and dictators like Putin, and that a rapid transition to clean and renewable energy is not just necessary for our environment, but critical to our economic and national security,” said Senator Merkley. “We can achieve energy independence by transitioning to cheaper, home-grown sources of renewable energy, and we can’t waste any time in getting there. The best way to end our dependence and that of our allies on foreign oil and gas is to end our reliance on oil and gas, period.”  “The oil and gas industry doesn’t drill to be patriotic – they drill for profit. They have reaped billions of dollars by taking advantage of Russia’s war on Ukraine and crushing Americans at the pump,” said Senator Murphy. “Investing in renewables is the only way we achieve true energy independence. It’s time we learn our lesson and make the transition to clean energy to strengthen our national security, combat the climate crisis, and lower costs for everyone.”“Putin’s ruthless and unjustified invasion of Ukraine coupled with continued price gouging by oil and gas companies have imperiled our country’s national security and left Americans hurting from rising fuel prices,” said Senator Booker. “As this resolution lays out, the United States must immediately begin a transition to a clean energy economy that will ensure our nation’s energy independence, protect consumers, and help us reverse the devastating effects of climate change.”  “Oil and gas companies have been profiteering from Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine by reprehensibly raising prices on Americans while raking in record profits,” said Senator Blumenthal. “Volatility in oil and gas prices exacerbated by the war and Big Oil’s greed only reinforce the need to invest in more reliable domestic green energy. A clean energy economy would ensure our energy independence while protecting the climate—and lower costs for the American people.” The Senators’ Resolution highlights how a clean energy economy is essential for protecting the United States’ national security and American consumers. It notes that authoritarian regimes such as Russia, which derives 40 percent of its federal budget from oil and gas production, rely heavily on fossil fuel revenue to maintain their grip on power and fund atrocities such as those occurring in Ukraine, and that the Department of Defense recently reported that climate change threatens American national security. The Resolution also highlights how oil and gas companies have unjustly profited from charging American consumers sky-high gas prices even as the price of oil falls.   The Resolution urges a rapid transition to renewable energy, which “can come online more quickly and reliably than oil and gas production, which will ensure the United States’ energy independence and help us maintain a safe and healthy climate.” The Resolution concludes, “Congress and the Biden Administration must stop price gouging and excessive price increases by oil and gas companies; and help consumers and small businesses that are being harmed by rising energy prices; and the United States must transition to a clean energy economy as quickly as possible to protect our national security.”The full text of the Resolution can be found here.  "

Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin, and David Trone (all D-Md.) announced $737,527 to support natural resource stewardship efforts and conserve imperiled wildlife and their habitats. This U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service federal funding through the State Wildlife Grant (SWG) Program will be distributed to state wildlife agencies to address conservation needs and protect at-risk fish, wildlife, and their habitats.“As climate change continues to endanger natural habitats, ecosystems, and wildlife in Maryland, these funds will help preserve our environment and biodiversity through collaborative conservation efforts with key on-the-ground partners,” said the lawmakers. “We will keep working to secure federal funding to protect and preserve our state’s natural beauty and revitalize our region’s valuable natural resources. These investments help boost our local economies and will ensure future generations are able to enjoy Maryland’s wildlife. Since its inception 20 years ago, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has granted more than $1 billion in federal assistance to a myriad of conservation projects and efforts to support both wildlife and aquatic species through the SWG Program. Administered by the Service’s Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program, SWG funding helps states proactively assess the status of fish and wildlife to strengthen conservation efforts and further protect their habitats. The SWG Programs and the agencies that receive funding have launched a multitude of new partnerships to conserve fish and wildlife and their habitats."

Hoyer and Anthony G. Brown (all D-Md.) released the following statement on the transfer of property from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Beltsville Agricultural Research Center to the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) – an important step toward the Bureau’s opening of a new currency production facility in Prince George’s County, Maryland. “Maryland is proud to serve as the home of many of our nation’s vital federal agencies and thousands of civil servants who keep them running. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing has made an excellent choice in joining them and selecting Prince George’s County to host its new currency production facility,” the lawmakers said. “In addition to bringing new jobs to Maryland, the transition to this Beltsville location will enable the Bureau to upgrade its manufacturing capabilities. We look forward to working with the Bureau alongside our state and local partners to advance this project in an environmentally conscious manner that respects our local communities.”BEP expects to finalize the design of the facility by next summer and have construction completed in 2027. Construction will be conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers while adhering to environmental protection and regulatory compliance measures, including the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and Maryland’s Forest Conservation Act. The Army Corps will also prepare noise suppression and exterior lighting plans to limit disruptions during construction, keep construction staging areas at least 100 feet away from surface water, and plan to restore disturbed landscapes with native species upon completion. Additionally, the Bureau and Army Corps will coordinate with Prince George’s County officials on alleviating traffic congestion on key roadways in the surrounding area."
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-young-urge-administration-to-engage-with-lebanon-to-support-on-time-free-and-fair-parliamentary-elections,"Today, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.) sent a bipartisan letter to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, urging the Administration to engage with Lebanon to ensure fairness and transparency in its upcoming parliamentary elections on May 15. In light of the ongoing political, economic, and health crises in Lebanon, the Senators stressed the importance of maintaining the scheduled elections and ensuring they are conducted with integrity. The Senators begin, “We write to ask you to engage with your counterparts in Lebanon and urge them to hold parliamentary elections scheduled for May 15 on time and in a fair and transparent manner. These polls can be a critical first step to restoring legitimacy to Lebanon’s political process and laying the foundation for enacting critical economic reforms. And yet, concerns remain that some officials may seek to postpone the upcoming elections in an attempt to preserve their own political power.” “As you know, Lebanon has been enduring interrelated political, economic, and health crises since at least 2019, when hundreds of thousands of Lebanese took to the streets to protest against political elites widely seen as responsible for decades of corruption and mismanagement,” they note. “The importance of Lebanon proceeding with these parliamentary elections on time cannot be understated. This vote will be the first since the popular uprising in October 2019 and would be a critical step to restoring confidence and stability in Lebanon’s political process. We ask you to engage with your Lebanese counterparts to urge them to proceed with these elections on May 15, with appropriate funding allocated, and in a fair and transparent manner,” they conclude.The full text of the letter is available here and below.Dear Secretary Blinken: We write to ask you to engage with your counterparts in Lebanon and urge them to hold parliamentary elections scheduled for May 15 on time and in a fair and transparent manner. These polls can be a critical first step to restoring legitimacy to Lebanon’s political process and laying the foundation for enacting critical economic reforms. And yet, concerns remain that some officials may seek to postpone the upcoming elections in an attempt to preserve their own political power. As you know, Lebanon has been enduring interrelated political, economic, and health crises since at least 2019, when hundreds of thousands of Lebanese took to the streets to protest against political elites widely seen as responsible for decades of corruption and mismanagement. Protests and ensuing political gridlock resulted in the lack of a functioning national government from October 2019 to September 2021. A deadly explosion at the port of Beirut on August 4, 2020 killed more than 200 people and injured and displaced thousands. As a result of the ongoing financial crisis, Lebanon’s currency has lost more than 90 percent of its value since 2019 and more than 75 percent of the country’s population is living in poverty. Shortages of medicine, water, food, and fuel—compounded by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—are further complicating efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic and a severe energy shortage. While there are important efforts underway to increase Lebanon’s energy supply and implement necessary financial reforms, upcoming parliamentary elections that restore popular legitimacy to the government will be essential to implementing the structural reforms Lebanon needs.Against this backdrop, in December 2021, Lebanon’s Interior Ministry scheduled its parliamentary elections for May 15, 2022. On February 4, 2022, the United Nations Security Council emphasized “the importance of holding free, fair, transparent and inclusive elections as scheduled on 15 May 2022, ensuring the full, equal and meaningful participation of women as candidates and voters in the election, and called on the Government of Lebanon to enable the Supervisory Commission for Elections to carry out its mandate, notably by providing it with adequate resources and initiating the process of nominating candidates.” On February 15, Lebanon’s government approved the allocation of $18 million to hold the parliamentary elections – a positive step, although concerns remain that some officials may yet seek to use the country’s financial crisis as a pretext to postpone the vote The importance of Lebanon proceeding with these parliamentary elections on time cannot be understated. This vote will be the first since the popular uprising in October 2019 and would be a critical step to restoring confidence and stability in Lebanon’s political process. We ask you to engage with your Lebanese counterparts to urge them to proceed with these elections on May 15, with appropriate funding allocated, and in a fair and transparent manner. Thank you for your attention to this timely issue.Sincerely,"

Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Anthony G. Brown, Jamie Raskin, and David Trone (all D-Md.) announced $238,825 to help provide Maryland schools with the tools and services they need to enhance internet connectivity in their communities. These funds were provided by the Federal Communications Commission through the Emergency Connectivity Fund – a fund that the lawmakers helped establish in the American Rescue Plan to address the digital divide. Maryland has received over $68.5 million since the fund’s creation. This funding has supported over 70 schools and libraries across Maryland and expanded broadband internet access for thousands of students, school staff, and library patrons. “Too many students in Maryland and across our country still lack reliable internet access and face significant barriers when completing their school work,” said the lawmakers. “The negative consequences of these connectivity issues have been exacerbated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We fought to secure this funding through the American Rescue Plan to help close the homework gap and provide additional support directly to our schools and libraries so that more students have the devices they need to get online. We will continue working to make sure that every student — no matter their zip code — has access to reliable and affordable internet.” Awards in this wave of funding include:The American Rescue Plan included historic investments in Maryland for broadband infrastructure, education and child care, health care, small businesses, public transit, and more – bringing significant resources directly to Maryland to help workers, families, and local officials combat COVID-19 and recover from the health and economic impacts of the virus.    "

Their letter follows ED’s recent announcement of the extension of the student loan payment pause through August 2022 and its intent to provide a “fresh start” to borrowers in default by eliminating the impact of delinquency and default and allowing these borrowers to enter repayment in good standing. “More than 7 million federal student loan borrowers are currently in default on their federal student loans. A disproportionate number of these borrowers are low income, people of color, first generation college students, veterans, student parents, students with disabilities, and people who did not complete college. Removing these borrowers from default when student loan payments and collections resume means that millions will not be immediately subject to wage garnishment, tax refund withholding, and aggressive collections practices that threaten to undermine their economic security. It also makes these borrowers eligible to enroll in Income-Driven Repayment plans,” wrote the senators. Many borrowers in default have been subject to collections for a lengthy amount of time: more than 2.1 million borrowers who were in default or at least 91 days delinquent on their federal student loans at the end of 2019 had been in repayment for 20 years or more, and another 3.4 million borrowers in default or delinquent had been in repayment for between 10 to 20 years. The senators argue that the data suggests that borrowers who remain in default even after ED has garnished their wages, tax returns, Social Security, and other benefits for years may remain in default because they do not have money to be collected, not because they are choosing not to make payments. The Higher Education Act of 1965 gives ED the clear authority to automatically remove those with federally managed loans from default status and to discharge cases of long-term default. The senators also argue that ED could grant borrowers in long-term default further relief by enforcing the Federal Claims Collections Standards, which states that agencies may compromise a debt if “the debtor is unable to pay the full amount due in a reasonable time…or the cost of collecting the debt does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount.”The senators are calling on ED to answer a set of questions about its plans to implement the “fresh start” program for borrowers in default before the payment pause expires and its plans to provide further relief to borrowers in long-term default by May 5, 2022.In April 2021, Senator Van Hollen joined Senators Warren and Warnock in urging ED to take swift action to automatically remove all federally-held student loan borrowers from default. In November 2021, Senator Van Hollen joined Senator Warren in a letter urging Secretary Cardona to use his authority to automatically remove all student loan borrowers in default on federally-held loans from their default status and to develop a policy to discharge debt for borrowers who have been in default for an extended period of time.Full text of the letter is available here. "
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-cardin-mfume-mayor-scott-and-community-leaders-highlight-new-2-million-direct-federal-investment-in-the-revitalization-of-pennsylvania-avenue-market,"Today, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin and Congressman Kweisi Mfume (all D-Md.) were joined by Mayor Brandon Scott and community leaders at the historic Pennsylvania Avenue Market to highlight a new federal investment of $2 million they worked to secure for the Market. These funds will go directly to revitalizing the market and will help provide access to healthy foods for area residents, support local entrepreneurs seeking to grow their businesses and provide more jobs, and sustain farms across the metro area. Senator Van Hollen and Congressman Mfume fought to deliver this investment as part of the FY2022 omnibus funding legislation enacted last month.“Investing federal dollars in our communities has the power to create new jobs and spur greater opportunity. That’s why I fought to secure this $2 million investment to breathe new life into the storied Avenue Market, as we continue working to revitalize West Baltimore. Alongside the efforts of our community partners, these funds will support small businesses and the local economy while increasing access to healthy food for families living nearby,” said Senator Van Hollen, who included these funds in his Fiscal Year 2022 Congressional Directed Spending priorities. “As a result of Team Maryland’s recent successful efforts to deliver congressionally directed spending to the people of Baltimore, important neighborhoods like Upton and Penn North and Sandtown will have a brighter future. We are committed to these West Baltimore communities and these neighborhoods. Today is not the first time you’ve seen the results. We recently announced similar transformational investments nearby at P.S. 103, Thurgood Marshall’s elementary school, and in East Baltimore, where we have provided the spark for new community health and wellness centers. Our congressional delegation has taken seriously the responsibility of identifying and delivering directed spending for Maryland. And, in turn, we have delivered substantial new federal investments in communities throughout the state,” said U.S. Senator Ben Cardin.“This is a Team effort. Our federal team delivers over and over again,” said Congressman Mfume. “For me it’s personal because I grew up on Division Street. I got my first job at this market to help support my younger sisters after my mother died. All of those businesses growing up meant so very much and bringing businesses back will have a great impact today on this historic market, keeping it vibrant and alive.” The history of the Avenue Market in the Upton neighborhood of West Baltimore can be traced back 150 years. Founded in the late 19th century, it is one of six Baltimore public markets, the oldest continuously operating system in the United States. Today, the median income of the residents within a half-mile radius of the market is $32,245 – 58 percent lower than the median household income in Baltimore City. As such, households are less likely to own or have access to a vehicle and have few nearby markets from which to buy affordable fresh food. The revitalization of this market, supported by this $2 million direct federal investment, can serve as the bridge between Baltimore’s many urban farms and community gardens and the residents who need access to healthy food. “I want to thank our Federal Delegation – the best Federal Delegation in the Country – for securing $2 million towards redeveloping this crucial community hub of West Baltimore's historic Pennsylvania Avenue corridor,” said Mayor Brandon M. Scott. “By providing space to emerging businesses, we create jobs, economic growth, and sustainable wealth generation in and for our communities. We are paving the way for an inclusive renaissance in West Baltimore and throughout the City.”“This investment will ensure that the long tradition and history of Baltimore’s public markets carries on, and that they continue to support diverse neighborhoods across the city – including the Pennsylvania Avenue corridor,” said Colin Tarbert, President and CEO, Baltimore Development Corporation. “I’m thankful to our federal lawmakers for making this investment possible. I’m also grateful to the customers of this market, as well as its vendors, who work hard every day for West Baltimore residents.” “This funding allows the Baltimore Public Markets to begin the community-guided redevelopment of Avenue Market at the beginning of 2023, with a scheduled completion date in mid-2024. The focus will be on affordable and healthy food and providing opportunities for neighborhood entrepreneurs to build businesses that lead to the creation of generational wealth,”said Paul Ruppert, President & CEO, Baltimore Public Markets Corporation. “Our organization runs Fresh At The Avenue, which is the only stall in the Avenue Market that currently sells fresh produce,” said Ashiah Parker, Executive Director, No Boundaries Coalition. “For us, it is a lot more than just grabbing an apple. We do workforce development and it is a gathering place – it’s a place where young folks can see that ‘this is my community and I should foster it.’ Investing in organizations who have direct impact on our community members should be the number-one priority for our elected officials, and that’s why I’m so grateful to our federal delegation today for supporting one of our greatest community assets: the Avenue Market.” “We thank all our elected partners for understanding the importance of redeveloping the historic Pennsylvania Avenue. Your continued support for improving the quality of life in our communities means the world to us,” said Wanda Best, Executive Director, Upton Planning Committee. “It is important that the Avenue Market be a flagship operation in this effort, and we will make sure that the community is engaged in all aspects of the development. Personally, as a practicing dietician for 40 years, promoting good nutrition is near and dear to my heart, so I expect to see more fresh fruits and vegetables in Central West Baltimore.”Additional images and high-quality copies are available upon request. "
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-warren-pushing-pentagon-on-accountability-for-civilian-harm,"U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) joined Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), alongside Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), Jeffrey A. Merkley (D-Ore.), and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in sending a letter to Secretary Lloyd J. Austin, III, urging the Department of Defense (DoD) to consider certain issues in its ongoing efforts to address systemic weaknesses regarding instances of civilian harm. After the Senators and bicameral colleagues called on the Biden administration to overhaul its counterterrorism policy to prevent civilian harm, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin, III released a directive on January 27, 2022, instructing the United States military to strengthen its efforts to prevent civilian deaths. In the letter, the lawmakers highlight several priorities and issues that should be addressed in the DoD's review to improve the way it protects civilians in war zones. In March, nearly 50 members of the House of Representatives sent a similar letter calling on Secretary Austin to implement these much-needed changes.  ""We appreciate and welcome this commitment to address the harm caused by U.S. counterterrorism operations and welcome this long-overdue step. However, we remain concerned that twenty years of Pentagon pledges to hold itself accountable and correct fundamental flaws that lead to civilian harm have gone unfulfilled. As such, we request that you brief Congress on your progress on repairing systemic flaws related to civilian harm,"" wrote the lawmakers.U.S. military operations have resulted in alarmingly high numbers of civilian casualties. It is estimated that since 2001, up to 48,000 civilians have been killed by U.S. air and drone strikes in seven countries. Earlier this year, a number of reports detailed DoD's failures to prevent, respond to, and hold itself accountable for civilian casualties. Following these reports and pressure from Congress, Secretary Austin announced that he would be directing the Department to submit to him a Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan (CHMRAP). The directive required DoD to, within 90 days, implement a plan to establish a Center of Excellence for civilian harm, develop standardized civilian harm reporting, and develop and incorporate improved guidance for avoiding harm. The letter requests DoD brief Congress on its progress in preventing civilian harm and highlights a series of issues and priorities that the DoD should focus on in the CHMRAP, including:   A copy of the letter can be found here."

Funding comes from the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as authorized through Section 403 of the Robert T. Stafford Act.The award of $6,421,134 reimburses the City of Baltimore for emergency protective measures, including quarantine sheltering for vulnerable and homeless populations who had no capacity to safely quarantine or self-isolate, including those who tested positive or were exposed to COVID-19 who did not require hospitalization but needed isolation. “Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the City of Baltimore provided critical services to protect residents, including shelter for those who tested positive or had been exposed to COVID-19 but were unable to find or afford a stable and safe place to quarantine. As we work to rebuild our economy, reimbursement funds like these help support our communities’ recovery and growth,” the lawmakers said. “Team Maryland will continue to secure federal funding to provide Marylanders with the assistance and relief they need.”Recently, the lawmakers announced more than $38 million in reimbursement funds for statewide COVID-19 economic recovery."
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-cardin-introduce-bill-to-honor-henrietta-lacks-with-congressional-gold-medal,"Today, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin (both D-Md.) announced the introduction of a bill to award the Congressional Gold Medal posthumously to Henrietta Lacks in recognition of her extraordinary life and legacy. Lacks, a Black woman who lived in Baltimore, died of cervical cancer in 1951. During her cancer treatment at Johns Hopkins Hospital, doctors took samples of her tumor, and from this the HeLa cell line was created – the first immortal line of human cells. Without her or her family’s knowledge, her cells were used in medical research and helped lead to some of medicine’s most important breakthroughs, including the development of the polio vaccine, along with treatments for cancer, HIV/AIDS, leukemia, and Parkinson’s disease.“The debt of gratitude we owe Henrietta Lacks can never be fully repaid for her invaluable contributions to medical research that have benefitted millions of people across the world. But we can work to ensure that Americans know her story and the critical impact her life-saving cells have had on global health, our quality of life, and patients’ rights,” said Senator Van Hollen. “I’m honored to help lead the charge to award Mrs. Lacks a Congressional Gold Medal, Congress’ highest expression of appreciation, to properly recognize her contributions to the world and highlight her life’s incredible story.”“Millions of people have benefited from the medical advances and protections derived from Henrietta Lacks’ cells. I’m proud to help lead this effort with Senator Van Hollen to award the Congressional Gold Medal in recognition of the tremendous impact of her life and legacy,” said Senator Cardin.“With this honor, we ensure that Henrietta Lacks’ life-saving contributions will forever be enshrined in American history.”“We thank Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin for their leadership in advancing the effort to award a Congressional Gold Medal to my mother, Henrietta Lacks, as the world commemorates 70 years since her HeLa cells changed modern medicine,” said Lawrence Lacks, Sr., Henrietta Lacks’ eldest son. “Together, we educate communities on her remarkable legacy through our family-led HELA100: The Henrietta Lacks Initiative. We applaud our Senators for their commitment to ensuring Henrietta Lacks’ contributions are rightfully recognized – right here at home – with the highest congressional honor in the United States.”In the U.S. House, Congressman Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.) has introduced the companion legislation. This push to honor the legacy of Henrietta Lacks follows the lawmakers’ successful efforts to pass the Henrietta Lacks Enhancing Cancer Research Act, which President Biden signed into law in January. The law directs the Government Accountability Office to study and publish a report regarding barriers to participation in federally funded cancer clinical trials by populations that have been traditionally underrepresented in such trials. Senators Van Hollen and Cardin initially introduced this legislation alongside the late Congressman Elijah Cummings, but after his passing it was sponsored in the House by Representative Kweisi Mfume. It was also cosponsored by Congressmen Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, and David Trone. "

The Senator wrote twice to President Biden in recent months – in November and again last month – calling for TPS for Cameroon.“I have long advocated for this action and I applaud the Biden Administration’s decision to provide a safe refuge for these families already residing in the United States. Forcing them to return to Cameroon in the midst of a civil war and humanitarian crisis would put their lives in grave and certain danger. Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas called me last night to inform me of this action and I thank him and President Biden for taking this important step to keep these families safe,” said Sen. Van Hollen, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health Policy.TPS is a form of statutory relief made available to nationals of a designated country living in the U.S. when return to their home country would be unsafe due to ongoing armed conflict, the temporary effects of an environmental disaster, or other extraordinary and temporary conditions. TPS provides protection from deportation and permission to work in the U.S. for the duration of the designation."

These funds from the U.S. Department of Treasury, under the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP), will be directed to Harbor Bank of Maryland, a Baltimore-based Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) and Minority Depository Institution (MDI).“The economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately harmed the financial well-being of many members of our minority-owned small business community,” said the lawmakers. “As we recover, we must continue to support those who are providing capital and loans to our hardest hit small businesses so they can fully bounce back and generate economic growth and new job opportunities. We were proud to fight for this funding and will continue to invest in these institutions as they provide needed support to small businesses that help strengthen our communities.” The lawmakers fought to increase emergency funding for CDFIs throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to boost local economies in low-income, rural, and urban communities that were disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. CDFIs are mission-driven financial institutions that serve as a direct lifeline for struggling communities by providing financing to small businesses, non-profits, affordable housing, and community development projects.CDFIs and MDIs often make smaller loans and work with borrowers who face barriers in our economy and may require more time-intensive and personalized technical support. ECIP investments are designed to support mission-driven institutions to increase responsible investments in low- and moderate-income and minority communities that have disproportionately suffered from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.  "

But Maryland is not an island, and many guns being used in crimes are coming from out of state. That’s why I was proud to see President Biden take meaningful action today to close ghost gun loopholes, modernize background check rules, and nominate a highly qualified and respected leader to head the ATF. These are important steps, but our work to reduce senseless gun violence is far from over. Even if Republicans don’t have the courage to support these common-sense reforms, I’ll keep fighting for meaningful action to reduce gun violence.”A longtime advocate for gun violence prevention, Senator Van Hollen has fought to enact common-sense reforms since his time in the Maryland General Assembly. In January, Senators Van Hollen and Ben Cardin (D-Md.) urged President Biden to take swift action to close ghost gun loopholes nationwide. Senator Van Hollen also supported the Maryland General Assembly’s efforts to ban the sale and possession of ghost guns in the state, which became law last week, submitting written testimony in support of the measure earlier in the legislative session.Additionally, the Senator has pushed for funding for community violence prevention programs on the Senate Appropriations Committee, introduced the ATF Improvement and Modernization (AIM) Act to improve and modernize the ATF in order to strengthen gun safety in our communities, and the Handgun Purchaser Licensing Act to incentivize state and local governments to enact laws requiring individuals to obtain a license before purchasing a handgun. More information on today’s executive actions by President Biden is here. "

Funding comes from the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as authorized through Section 403 of the Robert T. Stafford Act.The funding refunds expenses incurred over an 8 month period from November 2020 to June 2021 in which the Montgomery County Education Department purchased and distributed PPE such as masks, nitrile gloves, safety goggles, digital thermometers, and more.“Keeping our students, educators and staff safe as schools reopened, after the most severe days of the pandemic, was one of the highest priorities for our communities,” the lawmakers said. “We are proud to announce this federal funding which reimburses MCPS for the measures taken to safely reopen schools. Team Maryland will continue to secure federal funds for counties statewide to keep our communities safe. Previously, Team Maryland secured more than $389 million for Montgomery County Public Schools through three rounds of the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSERF).

This legislation would improve and strengthen the Opportunity Zone program in several ways by making important fixes to the original law, benefitting Opportunity Zones throughout Maryland and ensuring the investments reach the communities and residents most in need of support. The bill will also update eligibility to incorporate brownfield industrial sites, such as Sparrows Point in Baltimore.  “Gaps in Opportunity Zone programs have barred economically distressed areas from accessing the critical resources they need to create new local opportunities. This legislation will help close those gaps and ensure that Opportunity Zone investments lift up low-income communities – spurring further investments and ultimately benefiting Marylanders,” said Senator Van Hollen. “Maryland’s own Sparrows Point and Turner Station, alongside hundreds of recovering regions across the country, stand to see renewed economic vitality and more good-paying jobs as a result of this solution.” “The Opportunity Zone incentive has the potential to unleash much-needed economic growth in high poverty communities across the country – communities that investors too often overlook. But without robust guardrails in place, the incentive could be undermined or abused by those who aren’t committed to uplifting rural and urban communities across the country,” said Senator Booker. “I am proud to introduce this legislation with Senator Scott to help restore the original promise of opportunity zones by steering private capital to reinvest in underserved communities that have been historically left behind and working to level the economic playing field.”“The Opportunity Zone program represents the good that leaders can do for communities across the country when we work together toward common sense solutions,” said Senator Scott. “Independent reporting shows that investments in Opportunity Zones are making a huge impact across the country, with billions of dollars flowing into impoverished neighborhoods. I am glad to build on that success with this legislation to make the program stronger, so that we can ensure this incentive is benefitting the Americans who need it most.”Additionally, U.S. Senators Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Representatives Terri Sewell (D-Ala.-07), Dan Kildee (D-Mich.-05), and Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.-02) co-sponsored the legislation, called the Opportunity Zones Transparency, Extension, and Improvement Act. This bipartisan legislation would improve Opportunity Zones by:The full text of the legislation can be viewed here.The one-pager of the legislation can be viewed here.The section by section of the legislation can be viewed here. "
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/maryland-congressional-delegation-announces-over-340-million-in-infrastructure-funding-to-bolster-public-transit-across-the-state,"Today, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin and Congressmen Steny H. Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin, and David Trone (all D-Md.) announced $348,108,466 in federal funding for Maryland in fiscal year 2022 to strengthen public transit infrastructure across the state. The lawmakers helped secure this increased federal funding through the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Transit Administration (FTA) – which can be used to modernize aging infrastructure, upgrade vehicles, expand accessibility of transit stations, improve safety, address equity in transportation, and more – through the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). “Every day, Marylanders rely on public transit to get where they need to go. Greater federal investment in public transit is essential to make transit safer and more reliable and to reduce pollution and strengthen our economy,” the lawmakers said. “That’s why we worked to increase funding for transit that will create new, good-paying jobs by building infrastructure, upgrading vehicles to newer and cleaner models, and improving service for Maryland riders. We will continue to fight for federal investments to improve our state’s transportation infrastructure.”The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is a once-in-a-generation investment in American infrastructure that will provide more than $7 billion in federal funding directly to Maryland over five years to strengthen our infrastructure from transit systems to roads and bridges to water infrastructure, broadband connectivity, and more. The law includes measures on workforce development, equity, and climate change. The lawmakers worked to secure passage of this law in Congress, which will help spur job creation, enhance U.S. competitiveness, and make our transportation systems more sustainable and equitable.Nationally, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will provide $69.9 billion in guaranteed funding for public transit over the next five years representing the largest federal investment in public transit in history. It will repair and upgrade crumbling infrastructure, modernize bus and rail fleets, make stations accessible to all users through a new program with $1.75 billion in dedicated funding, and bring transit service to new communities with an additional $8 billion for Capital Investment Grants. The IIJA will help replace thousands of transit vehicles, including buses, with clean, zero emission vehicles through an additional $21.3 billion, 5 percent of which is dedicated to training the transit workforce to maintain and operate these vehicles. Additionally, it will benefit communities of color who have historically had more limited access to transit despite being twice as likely to take public transportation."
https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-menendez-risch-unveil-resolution-honoring-former-secretary-of-state-madeleine-albright,"Today, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) joined Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), and Jim Risch (R-Idaho) in introducing a resolution to celebrate the life, achievements, and legacy of former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. In addition to commending Secretary Albright’s patriotism and public service in the pursuit of a more peaceful, prosperous, and cooperative world order, the bipartisan resolution extends the Senate’s sincere condolences and sympathies to Secretary Albright’s family and friends in the wake of her passing. “Secretary Madeleine Albright was a trailblazer, a leader, a seasoned diplomat, and a champion for all humankind. After arriving in the United States as a refugee, she always fought to give a voice to the voiceless. And she was a force to be reckoned with,” said Senator Van Hollen. “Her legacy will never be forgotten. This resolution is a fitting way to highlight her courage and leadership which will continue to serve as an example for generations to come."" “With this bipartisan resolution, we honor Secretary Albright’s extraordinary contributions to our global community and her unparalleled dedication to serving others both as the first woman Secretary of State and throughout her tenure in public service,” Chairman Menendez said. “As a child, she fled fascism as a refugee, later becoming a leading voice for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. As in her life, Secretary Albright’s legacy will continue to shape American statecraft and to inspire foreign policy leaders and public servants for generations to come. She was a dear friend and mentor to me and to many, and she will be deeply missed.”“Madeleine Albright, a giant in the field of foreign policy, was a fierce defender of democracy and internationally-recognized human rights across the globe,” said Ranking Member Risch. “This resolution honors the indispensable work she did on behalf of the United States and extends sincere condolences to Secretary Albright’s family and loved ones.”Joining Sentator Van Hollen, Chairman Menendez, and Ranking Member Risch in introducing the resolution were Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). “Madeleine Albright embodied the ideals of America. She was a constant light in the struggle between freedom and oppression, relentlessly advocating for people to have rights she knew didn’t exist under authoritarian regimes. She broke the highest glass ceiling in her field, then spent the rest of her life fighting for opportunities for women. We’ll remember her as a diplomat and a trail blazer,” said Senator Schatz. “Secretary Albright was a friend, a dedicated public servant, and a true champion for democracy around the globe,” said Sen. Sullivan. “I was honored to work with her in our respective roles as Chairs of the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute. Secretary Albright will be greatly missed, but her life and legacy—which began when she and her family fled Soviet communism as a young girl, and led her to the highest branches of government—will help ensure the light of freedom and liberty continues shining brightly for many years to come.”“Madeleine Albright will be remembered as a giant of American diplomacy,” said Senator Coons. “I had the blessing of knowing Secretary Albright’s humor, brilliance, talent, and remarkable insights into world affairs over many years, and I am pleased the Senate has taken a moment today to honor her immense contributions to our country and to our world. As a stateswoman and a fierce advocate for democracy and human rights, Madeleine Albright truly made a lifetime of difference.”“A refugee who went on to become the first woman to serve as U.S. Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright’s life story is one of resoluteness and a reflection of the bright promises of democracy,” said Senator Romney. “Her service to our country and mark on U.S. foreign policy will be felt for generations to come.” “Madeleine Albright was a Virginian, a tireless champion for democracy, and a dear friend. She represented the very best of America—an immigrant from Czechoslovakia who rose to the highest position in American diplomacy, paving the way for women around the world,” said Senator Kaine. “I’m glad the Senate passed a resolution today in her honor. I will miss her wise counsel.”“Madeleine Albright came to the United States as a child refugee from war-torn Europe, fleeing Nazi and Soviet persecution. She grew up to become the first female Secretary of State – our nation’s top diplomat – breaking down barriers for generations of women to follow in her footsteps and stand on her shoulders. I’m proud to be one of those women and I’m honored to join members of the Senate to honor Secretary Albright for her service to our nation and for forging a path in government service that created space and leadership for women,” said Senator Shaheen. “As we mourn her loss, we don’t look back, but forward, on the opportunities she created for women around the world to realize their full potential. I urge Senate leadership to swiftly pass this resolution.”“The United States and the free world lost a giant with the passing of former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,” said Senator Cardin. “She was a champion for democratic values and institutions, as well as diplomat extraordinaire, best-selling author, long-time leader of the National Democratic Institute, trailblazing Ambassador to the United Nations and glass-ceiling breaking Secretary of State. Secretary Albright also was the mother of three remarkably successful daughters and a mentor and friend to countless other women. Her contributions to strengthening American diplomacy and standing up for democracy cannot be overstated. She was an incredible leader and a presence the world will not soon forget.”“Madeleine Albright was an accomplished diplomat, human rights champion, and trailblazer,” Senator Merkley said. “As the first woman to hold the position of Secretary of State, she broke barriers and has left a long lasting legacy of effective global diplomacy which will continue for years to come and serve as a model for future generations of diplomats.” Find a copy of the resolution HERE. "
