https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/video-capito-helps-advance-bipartisan_electoral-count-act-reform,"Click here or on the image above to watch Senator Capito’s remarks.WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a member of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, today participated in a business meeting to report the bipartisan Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act to the Senate floor. This legislation would reform and modernize the outdated Electoral Count Act of 1887, and would ensure the electoral votes tallied by Congress accurately reflect each state’s vote for President, as well as promote a peaceful transition of power between the outgoing and incoming President.Below is a transcript of Senator Capito’s remarks, as prepared for delivery:“I’d like to thank the Chair and Ranking Member for scheduling this business meeting to consider a bill I am proud to have worked on and is important to strengthen our process – the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act.“As I, and many of my colleagues in the working group have said, the bill crafted by a bipartisan group of senators offers a commonsense solution to a recurring problem.“Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have sought to use the Electoral College certification process to overturn the results of elections they do not personally like.“I have long-championed our decentralized electoral system, which gives states the power to design and enforce their election laws to meet the needs of their constituents. Because of this, I do not believe that Members of Congress should overturn lawfully cast votes.“That is why I proudly joined the Senate working group, and strongly support our bipartisan legislation.“The Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act is the result of months of careful deliberation and debate.“Our group welcomed input from legal experts, from this committee, and from individuals with a wide range of political leanings.“Based on the information we were provided, our group crafted a bill that is designed to garner bipartisan support.“This legislation is a compromise, but I firmly believe that it will tackle our most pressing shared concerns.“From the beginning, it was clear that if we wanted to prevent frivolous efforts to decertify valid election results, and reduce pressure from outside actors by passing legislation, we had to draft a narrow bill that will solve the threats to the presidential certification process.“I understand that this legislation may not encompass all that some people want, but let me be clear: Inserting partisan language will doom this effort, and leave us with no meaningful reforms at all.“The House-passed legislation seeking to amend the Electoral Count Act is a non-starter in the Senate, and involves language that we discounted for this very reason.“I urge my colleagues in the Senate, and our counterparts in the House, to support the bipartisan Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act, so that we may generate meaningful, but tailored, clarifications to the certification process.“I will continue to push for passage of our legislation, and hope that my colleagues who profess to share concerns regarding the certification process will do the same.”BACKGROUND:The Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act includes the following provisions:1)   Electoral Count Reform Act: This section would reform and modernize the outdated Electoral Count Act of 1887 to ensure that electoral votes tallied by Congress accurately reflect each state’s vote for President. It would replace ambiguous provisions of the 19th-century law with clear procedures that maintain appropriate state and federal roles in selecting the President and Vice President of the United States as set forth in the U.S. Constitution.|2)   Presidential Transition Improvement Act: This section would help to promote the orderly transfer of power by providing clear guidelines for when eligible candidates for President or Vice President may receive federal resources to support their transition into office.In developing the bills, the senators received input from state election officials as well as from an ideologically diverse group of election experts and legal scholars, including the American Law Institute. Additionally, Rules Committee Chairman Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Vice Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) provided helpful insight. A one-pager on the Electoral Count Reform Act is available here.A one-pager on the Presidential Transition Improvement Act is available here.# # #"
https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-designate-september-as-national-recovery-month,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), applauded the unanimous passage of their bipartisan resolution—led by Senators Capito and Angus King (I-Maine)—designating September 2022 as “National Recovery Month.” The senators’ resolution comes as overdoses are rising across the nation. Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) was also a co-sponsor of the resolution.2021 saw a 15% increase in overdose deaths nationwide, with communities across the country losing over 100,000 loved ones – including more than 1,400 in West Virginia. The resolution specifically recognizes the many challenges contributing to growing substance use disorders and the need for more community resources and education to help address the crisis.“Raising awareness of the available treatment and recovery measures is incredibly important as addiction continues to devastate communities and families in West Virginia and across the country. I am hopeful that with this resolution, which designates the month of September as ‘National Recovery Month,’ that more people will become educated about treatment options and supports for those in recovery. This is a critical component of the spectrum of solutions needed to save lives and fight back against the scourge of addiction, and I am proud to lead my colleagues in introducing this resolution,” Senator Capito said.“The drug epidemic continues to ravage our communities across West Virginia. From April 2021 to April 2022, we lost 1,420 West Virginians to drug related overdoses, and the COVID-19 pandemic made this heartbreaking issue much worse,” Senator Manchin said. “Every West Virginian has been impacted by substance use disorder, and it is our responsibility to provide our family, friends and neighbors with the support and recovery services they need and deserve. I am proud to join my bipartisan colleagues in designating September as National Recovery Month to help bring awareness to this crisis facing so many of our fellow West Virginians and Americans.”13% of Americans reported starting or increasing substance use during 2020, largely due to increased stress and isolation from the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s estimated that the total cost to the country from substance abuse disorders, including the costs of healthcare, lost productivity, and involvement of the criminal justice system, is $78,500,000,000 annually – a figure that continues to grow.Senators Capito and King have consistently worked on a bipartisan basis to address America’s tragic substance use disorder epidemic. Along with their annual designation of September as National Recovery Month they have joined on efforts to improve telehealth, create a better approval process for opioids, and to support mental health outreach. # # #

This funding was made available through the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and are Congressionally Directed Spending (CDS) requests by Senator Capito. In total, Senator Capito secured $241,135,000 in direct spending measures for initiatives and projects across West Virginia through the Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 appropriations omnibus package.“Just last month, I met with leaders at WVU and UC about the capacities of our higher education intuitions in West Virginia and the potential they have to make major impacts. I’m proud to have secured this funding through the Congressionally Directed Spending process, which will give resources directly to WVU to support efforts to combat the opioid crisis, and to UC to strengthen research initiatives in their biology department. I am continually impressed by the work both of these institutions do, and will continue to use my role as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee to provide the resources they need to make a difference in matters important to West Virginia,” Senator Capito said.“I would like to thank Senator Capito for her continued support to combat drug abuse and violent crimes not only within our state, but also nationally. This requested CDS funding will enable the Department of Forensic and Investigative Science at West Virginia University to enhance current capacity through technology innovation, boost the technical skills of the forensic workforce and improve development of standards in forensic practice,” Dr. Casper Venter, Chair of the Department of Forensic and Investigative Science at WVU, said. “The project will also allow the modernization of fingerprint imaging methods, as well as a faster, safer and more cost-effective portable screening methods for drug and gunshot residue detections. Moreover, incorporating these novel analytical tools into current protocols will provide a streamlined decision-making process at the crime laboratory and on site. Through education and training with the broader forensic and law enforcement community, this will provide a leap of knowledge and increased reliability in drug, fingerprint and firearm investigations.”“The University of Charleston is excited to enhance our biomedical and chemical instrumentation through the NIST grant award,” UC President Marty Roth said. “The new equipment will provide applied learning opportunities for many of our students.  It will also enhance the quality of biomedical and chemical research opportunities at the University of Charleston. The equipment will enable faculty and students to produce research suitable for presentation at scientific conferences and publication in journals.”Individual awards listed below:# # # "

We should be taking steps to increase their access, not decrease it,” Ranking Member Capito said. “Those in West Virginia who utilize our federal lands and take advantage of the wonderful opportunities they create can be assured that I will always work to improve their accessibility, and make sure that FWS is held accountable.”Last spring, FWS entered into settlement negotiations with activist organizations over a lawsuit regarding the use of traditional ammunition and lead on more than 3 million acres of federal land. Senators Capito and Daines led a group of their colleagues in urging FWS Director Martha Williams not to cave in to activists’ calls to restrict the use of lead ammo and tackle on public lands earlier this year.This bill also comes one week after FWS published a rule that, while expanding access to hunting and fishing at certain wildlife refuges, prohibited the use of lead ammunition and fishing tackle.Joining Senators Capito and Daines on the legislation are Senators John Thune (R-S.D.) John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), and Todd Young (R-Ind.). # # #

https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/icymi-sens-capito-marshall-colleagues-to-fda-commissioner-quit-ignoring-baby-formula-applications,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-Kan.), and John Boozman (R-Ark.), this week led 10 of their Senate Republican colleagues in a letter to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the agency’s ongoing strategy to replenish the supply of baby formula across the country. In particular, the senators expressed their concerns that the FDA has not approved enough formula applications to restore national baby formula supplies or prevent another shortage from occurring.They wrote in part: “Despite the numerous flexibilities and resources provided by Congress and temporary import flexibilities outlined in your letter, the infant formula crisis persists nationwide… American families need permanent long-term solutions, and that includes increasing capacity and competition in the U.S. market…Given the delicate nature of the infant formula supply chain, it’s become even more apparent that we need to diversify our commercial capacity by providing other industry manufacturers the opportunity to compete… Under the enforcement discretion authorized by President Biden’s May Executive Orders to address the formula crisis, the FDA approved only 23 infant formula products, or base powder, from 10 unique manufacturers out of dozens of ex-U.S. based formula and milk companies that have applied for short-term FDA approval to provide infant formula to the U.S. marketplace… The last application granted by FDA for enforcement discretion was August 10, over a month ago… it is unclear why the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition has chosen to ignore so many applications for more manufacturers to market infant formula products for interstate commerce.”The senators concluded their letter with questions about the FDA’s approval process for formula applications, how many applications have not been answered and why, and if applications for specialty formulas had been considered, among others.Joining Senators Capito, Marshall, and Boozman on their letter were U.S. Senators John Thune (R-S.D.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), John Barrasso, M.D. (R-Wyo.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.), and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.).View the full letter HERE or below:Commissioner Califf:Thank you for responding to our letter regarding the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) investigation of Abbott Nutrition’s facility and the infant formula shortage crisis. Despite the numerous flexibilities and resources provided by Congress and temporary import flexibilities outlined in your letter, the infant formula crisis persists nationwide.1, 2, 3 Some of the FDA’s flexibilities are set to expire at the end of this month and Operation Fly-Formula, while alleviating some issues, cannot run indefinitely. American families need permanent long-term solutions, and that includes increasing capacity and competition in the U.S. market.The infant formula market has consolidated over the years due to manufacturing-related issues and consumer demand so any disruption in an oligopoly will undoubtedly lead to supply chain shortages. Over 80 percent of the market is largely comprised of three manufacturers including Abbott Nutrition, Mead Johnson, and Perrigo. Abbott Laboratories lead with 49.5 percent, followed by Mead Johnson at 20.6 percent, and Perrigo with 11.9 percent.4 Abbott Nutrition recently announced it will restart its Similac® infant formula production at its facility in Sturgis, Michigan.5 We understand FDA did not establish or rule out a direct link between the deaths and the formula produced at the plant. But we now know that any disruption from one manufacturer – including one that makes up almost half of the infant formula market – can devastate families and cascade into a whole-of-government approach to resolve. Given the delicate nature of the infant formula supply chain, it’s become even more apparent that we need to diversify our commercial capacity by providing other industry manufacturers the opportunity to compete. This is especially necessary for manufacturers of infant formula products that cannot be reasonably substituted by currently available products.Despite this significant crisis, to date, under the enforcement discretion authorized by President Biden’s May Executive Orders to address the formula crisis, the FDA approved only 23 infant formula products, or base powder, from 10 unique manufacturers out of dozens of ex-U.S. based formula and milk companies that have applied for short-term FDA approval to provide infant formula to the U.S. marketplace. Of the products approved, 13 were approved for infants who rely on “regular” formula products, and only three are for special nutrition needs. In addition to these products intended for infants who rely on “regular” formula, the agency has approved just 6 specialty products, or bases, from 5 unique manufacturers. The last application granted by FDA for enforcement discretion was August 10, over a month ago.What’s most concerning is FDA’s decision last month to defer further review of pending applications after taking over a month to respond.6, 7 We understand from several manufacturers that FDA has still not indicated any attempt to review or prioritize increasing domestic production through competition.Given the above, it is unclear why the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition has chosen to ignore so many applications for more manufacturers to market infant formula products for interstate commerce. Therefore, we respectfully request your responses to the following questions: The FDA has the opportunity to learn from this crisis and ensure this does not happen again. We would appreciate a reply no later than Wednesday, October 5, 2022. Thank you for your attention to this matter and please do not hesitate to reach out to us or our staff should the agency require resources or cooperation from other agencies to fulfill its obligations.BACKGROUND:In May, President Biden signed the Access to Baby Formula Act, legislation Senator Capito helped introduced alongside a bipartisan group of senators. More details about the legislation can be found here.Additionally in May, Senators Capito and Marshall led 20 of their colleagues on a letter demanding answers from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding its inadequate investigation into Abbott Nutrition’s Michigan manufacturing facility and failure to mitigate the nationwide baby formula shortage. The senators also asked questions regarding when the White House was made aware of the dire situation and the steps available to limit the harmful impact on families and their newborns. # # #"

I am proud to have joined unanimous Republican opposition in voting against the DISCLOSE Act, which would have chilled free speech by imposing new regulations on political speech and requiring public disclosure of the names and addresses of individuals who choose to donate to political campaigns.“The DISCLOSE Act represents a willing effort to impede the free exercise of First Amendment rights by individuals of any political persuasion, and I commend my Republican colleagues for standing with freedom of speech and the right to private political expression. I will continue to stand for the constitutional rights of my fellow West Virginians, and all Americans, and fight against liberal efforts to suppress the free speech and political expression that is vital to our democracy.” # # # "

https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/capito-manchin-announce-83-million-for_west-virginia-water-infrastructure-improvements-through-bipartisan-infrastructure-law,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), both members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $83,000,000 in funding for West Virginia through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for water infrastructure improvements. This funding was made possible by the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).“In the Environment and Public Works Committee, we crafted the foundation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that included record investments in water and wastewater projects across the country,” Ranking Member Capito said. “For West Virginia, that meant authorizing millions of dollars through the State Revolving Funds program, enabling our communities to start or move forward with key water infrastructure projects. Because of the funding announced today from our bipartisan efforts, cities and towns can make vitally important upgrades and repairs that will ultimately improve the health and safety of residents both now and in the future.”“Every West Virginian deserves clean water to drink and fresh air to breathe. In order to ensure West Virginians have access to clean water, we must continue to upgrade and improve our water infrastructure throughout the state. I am pleased the EPA is finally delivering $83 million to West Virginia from my bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to improve the quality of our water sources and expand access for our rural communities,” Senator Manchin said. “I was proud to fight for this funding that addresses our water infrastructure needs, and I look forward to seeing the positive impacts of this funding for the state. As Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue advocating for funding to upgrade and improve our water infrastructure across the Mountain State.”# # #"

But they have now, FHWA, has released a proposed rulemaking to establish a greenhouse gas emissions performance measure requiring states to set climate targets.”SENATOR CAPITO: “So for our state, I guess, what is your reaction to that? Have you seen that? Since we have the diffused population, obviously our emissions are going to be a lot less, and so to improve those is going to be more difficult for us. That's the way I see it. How do you see this?”SECRETARY WRISTON: “Yeah, here we go again. The law is clear. That provision is not in it. Transportation is not opposed to working toward reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Of course we're not. We’re going to do anything and everything we can, which is exactly why the flexibility that's engrained in the formula programs are so important to be able to flex just the carbon reduction program when the rules told us clearly that we could flex them to 50% of that bucket to a more flexible category. And we did in West Virginia.”IMPACT OF FHWA MEMORANDUM DISCOURAGING HIGHWAY CAPACITY PROJECTS: “On the guidance that was put out by the FHWA in terms of the memorandum that really discourages new construction. You want to go to maintenance, you want to go to transit, you want to go to bike paths and other things of that nature.”SENATOR CAPITO: “Is that impacting you, Secretary Wriston? Are you actually seeing it impacting your ability to get approval for certain projects?”SECRETARY WRISTON: “Well, it certainly is. I had made these projects with the preliminary designs done, particularly in bridges. If I need to add a sidewalk arbitrarily to a bridge, whether I need it or not, then I have to go back to the design and literally redesign the steel that holds that bridge up. It has to be resized. Conversely, going the other way, if I can't add capacity to my interstates, what am I doing to the next generation if I spend tremendous resources on a resurfacing job on I-79 in West Virginia, and don't take care of the added capacity I know I'm going to need in 12 or 15 years? It makes planning impossible.”WHETHER OR NOT ‘ONE FEDERAL DECISION’ STREAMLINING PROVISION CODIFIED BY THE IIJA IS ACTUALLY IN EFFECT: “But you know, it was almost like well, Fish and Wildlife has this review, and then what would the Corps of Engineers over here, and then we got Federal Highway Administrator here, and then we have West Virginia DOT here, and then we have West Virginia environmental protection here. And, it just seemed like it was a ping ponging of responsibility, and a lack of communication, and not getting to the approvals that you need to get to get these things moving forward.”SENATOR CAPITO: “So, Secretary Wriston, One Federal Decision, Mr. Tymon talked about it a little bit, is it actually in effect in your mind? Because now we're talking about if a permitting bill comes up, one of the basis of this, permitting bill, we think, might be that one federal decision would be extended to energy projects, grid projects, and all these other things. We’re the test case here in transportation. Is it working? Is it a reality? What are the problems or what are the good things about?”SECRETARY WRISTON: The good thing is it's obviously, it is the framework for the FHWA to be the single point and to be the clearinghouse if you will. As the Secretary of Transportation, when I assign someone a project, the first thing I do is put somebody in charge, somebody I can hold accountable. And that's what we have to do with this process is put somebody in charge. You ask if this is working? Absolutely not. It's largely been ignored. We have had discussions at meetings that the acting director was at…there doesn't seem to be a sense of urgency to enact this or to even discuss it very much.”Click HERE to watch Ranking Member Capito’s questions.Click HERE to watch Ranking Member Capito’s opening statement. # # # "

He’s a dedicated public servant and he has served the state of West Virginia for over 25 years.“Last year, he received a much-deserved appointment to serve as Secretary of the West Virginia DOT, and because that doesn’t keep him busy enough, he also serves as the commissioner of the West Virginia Division of Highways.“Secretary Wriston began his career at the West Virginia DOT in the Bridge Department. You wonder why I’m always talking about bridges. He then moved to the Engineering Division and for the past twelve years served as the department’s Chief Transportation Engineer and Special Program Manager.“This wealth of experience has positioned him perfectly to lead the department. The IIJA has provided West Virginia the opportunity to make major improvements in our roadway and bridge systems.“The work of West Virginia DOT has made it possible to move projects forward on Corridor H, Coalfields Expressway, Jefferson Road expansion in South Charleston, and I-64 St. Albans-Nitro Bridge.“The state also recently received two RAISE grants for the Wheeling streetscape and Morgantown Greenbag Road corridor project.“I appreciate your leadership, Secretary Wriston, on these and other projects, and look forward to our continued partnership.“With the secretary today, we know that one person can’t do it all, he has with him Nate Tawney who is the Department of Transportation general counsel, Lorrie Hodges, who is the head of West Virginia legislative affairs, been with the department for many years and we’ve worked together, and also Melissa Decker from the governor’s office. So thank you all for being here with us.“And we did learn today because we a little meeting before that this is the first West Virginia Secretary of Transportation to testify before our committee. So we're very happy to have that historic occasion.“It’s been a year since the president signed the IIJA into law.“We promised the American people the IIJA would deliver results by improving and expanding our nation’s core infrastructure, an investment we all agreed was long overdue.“This historic legislation proves that we can come together to develop legislation that tackles our nation’s pressing challenges in a bipartisan manner. “And I am proud of what we did on this committee. The foundation was this committee’s bipartisan [products]: the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act and the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act of 2021. Both of those. We had unanimous votes coming out of this committee.“This committee now has the responsibility, I think, of ensuring proper implementation of the IIJA.“The witnesses here today are direct recipients of IIJA funding, which means they are perfectly positioned to give us a status update.“The timing of this conversation is particularly appropriate given that just last week we had a hearing to consider the president’s nominee to be administrator of the FHWA (Federal Highway Administration), Shailen Bhatt, which many of you know because he was a former DOT administrator in two states, actually.“I know the staff at the FHWA have been working hard to implement the IJJA, standing up new programs, getting funding out the door, but it’s taken a long time before we could get that nomination up to us. And I’m with you, I hope we move forward on that.“I have seen policies from FHWA that contradict the IIJA statutory text. I talked to Secretary Buttigieg about this just yesterday. I have been told the agency is neglecting to implement certain provisions of the bill, mainly the project delivery sections.“FHWA began to deviate from the law with the release of the December 16th FHWA memorandum to staff, ‘Policy on Using the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Resources to Build a Better America.’“This memorandum encourages [recipients] of highway funding to ‘flex’ that funding to transit investments, discourages states from moving forward with projects that add highway capacity, and imposes a one-size-fits-all [approach] by discouraging transferring program funds to where they are needed most, which was a flexibility that was intentionally built into the law, it’s long-standing, to ensure each state’s unique needs are met. Our needs in North Dakota and West Virginia are much different than what you need in Arizona or California or other places.“Following the memorandum, FWHA released programmatic guidance documents for the core highway formula programs that included the same policy directives represented in the memorandum.“Beyond contradicting the law, these guidance documents have created confusion among states and the FHWA division offices, and are leading to inconsistent implementation.“The IIJA provided provisions to address climate change, as the chairman said, historically a climate change dedication in the bill, and the resiliency of transportation infrastructure, and we did this in a bipartisan way.“A greenhouse emissions performance measure was debated and ultimately left out of the bipartisan IIJA.“The Biden administration decided the law didn’t go far enough and proposed a rule to impose greenhouse gas emissions performance measures and associated targets on state departments of transportation and metropolitan planning organizations without any authority from this Congress.“All of these actions follow a common theme at FHWA, which is implementing partisan policy priorities they wish had been included in the IIJA, and doing so ahead of implementing many of the provisions that are actually in the legislation.“The FHWA staff has done all of this without the accountability of having a Senate-confirmed administrator, which hopefully we’re going to solve that.“I had questions for Mr. Bhatt on many issues last week, they are pressing for us to be able to conduct our oversight activities.“With that in mind, we’ll look for our witnesses to tell us what programs and policies of the IIJA are most beneficial in addressing the unique challenges in your state, community, and member states?“What is going well regarding [implementation]?...it's a little bit easier to say everything that isn't going well. We need to hear the things that are going well because that's just as important.“I am interested in how the construction landscape is impacting transportation projects, supply chain obviously is a big issue, materials costs, staffing shortages, Buy America policies have also come up.“The IIJA included unprecedented funding to address the needs of our nation’s core transportation infrastructure. Proper implementation of the law is the only way to ensure this funding will uphold the promises that were made to the American people with its passage.“Thank you again for being here. This is important and timely. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.” # # # "

https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/capito-questions-credit-card-companies-for-tracking-firearm-purchases-,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), today expressed concerns in a letter to Visa, Mastercard, and American Express regarding the decision to implement new separate merchant category codes (MCCs) for firearms sales under the International Organization for Standardizations (ISO) guidelines.“I write to express my apprehension regarding the decision to implement new, separate, merchant category codes (MCCs) for firearms sales under the International Organization for Standardizations (ISO) guidelines. I am concerned that these efforts will undermine the ability of lawful Americans to exercise their constitutional Second Amendment rights, and seek reassurance that you will not participate in activist efforts to impede free exercise of these rights,” Senator Capito said.""The implementation of new merchant codes for firearms purchases is a worrying signal to legal sellers and buyers of firearms that their purchases can be monitored, disclosed, or even prevented from occurring,” Senator Capito continued. “This prompts serious constitutional concerns, and sets a troubling precedent wherein gun owners can be impeded in their free exercise of constitutional rights through fear of reprisal, or even the threat of their privacy being invaded. Visa, Mastercard, and American Express are under no legal obligation to implement this new MCC and I urge you to change course immediately.""Full text of the letter is available here and below.Dear Messrs. Kelly, Miebach, and Squeri,I write to express my apprehension regarding the decision to implement new, separate, merchant category codes (MCCs) for firearms sales under the International Organization for Standardizations (ISO) guidelines. I am concerned that these efforts will undermine the ability of lawful Americans to exercise their constitutional Second Amendment rights, and seek reassurance that you will not participate in activist efforts to impede free exercise of these rights.The ISO’s internal committee (Registration and Maintenance Management Group (RMMG)) approved the creation of a new MCC for gun retailers on September 9, 2022. This decision was made at the request of Amalgamated Bank, a financial institution who proudly and publicly supports “progressive causes” and engages in discriminatory lending practices. Amalgamated Bank’s request and appeal were previously denied by the ISO in 2021. According to documents obtained by CBS News, representatives from each of your companies serve as representatives and/or voting parties on the ISO committee that considers new merchant category codes.Under both our federal constitution, and West Virginia’s state constitution, law-abiding citizens have the right to keep and bear arms responsibly. However, in recent years we have seen liberal activists seek to undermine these rights, and impose a social agenda that does not follow constitutional principles that have guided our nation since its inception.The implementation of new merchant codes for firearms purchases is a worrying signal to legal sellers and buyers of firearms that their purchases can be monitored, disclosed, or even prevented from occurring. This prompts serious constitutional concerns, and sets a troubling precedent wherein gun owners can be impeded in their free exercise of constitutional rights through fear of reprisal, or even the threat of their privacy being invaded. Visa, Mastercard, and American Express are under no legal obligation to implement this new MCC and I urge you to change course immediately.Should you choose to move forward with these merchant code changes, I seek answers to the following questions:I appreciate your timely response, and will continue to closely follow any efforts to harm law-abiding citizens of my state.Sincerely,# # # "

https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senate-republicans-unprecedented-drug-price-control-scheme-threatens-innovation_future-drug-costs,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), along with her Senate Republican colleagues, this week expressed concerns in a letter—led by U.S. Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-Idaho)—about the establishment of a permanent government price-setting program, funded by billions of taxpayer dollars, in the partisan Inflation Reduction Act. Additionally, the senators raised questions regarding federal health agencies’ plans for program implementation. In a letter to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator (CMS) Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, the senators highlighted the outsize risks the impending government pricing initiative poses for patients, frontline health care providers, small businesses, and the American economy as a whole, and urge the officials to weigh impacts on health care access, research and development (R&D) and domestic manufacturing.“As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has confirmed, the government price controls codified under the recently enacted reconciliation legislation have the potential to increase launch prices for new medications, as well as to trigger fewer new drug approvals in the coming years,” the senators wrote.“Other independent analyses have projected even more catastrophic consequences, from hundreds of thousands of domestic job losses to hundreds of billions in forgone R&D dollars.  The innovation ecosystem that has made the United States the world’s unquestioned life sciences leader, bolstered by thousands of startups and small businesses, may wither under this partisan legislation, particularly in the absence of careful, deliberative implementation and assertive, consumer-oriented oversight,” the senators continued.In addition to Senators Capito and Crapo, the letter is signed by: U.S. Senators John Cornyn (R-Texas), John Thune (R-S.D.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), and Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.)Full text of the letter is available here and below.Dear Secretary Becerra and Administrator Brooks-LaSure:Congress recently acted, on a party-line basis, to establish a permanent government price-setting program for prescription drugs, financed with billions of taxpayer dollars and enforced through an unprecedented excise tax of up to 95 percent. We write to express concerns with the disruptive and distortive administrative undertaking that the implementation of this far-reaching federal expansion will inevitably represent, as well as to raise a number of questions regarding your department’s plans for putting this new program into practice. Given the outsize risks that the impending government pricing initiative poses for patients, frontline health care providers, small businesses, and the American economy as a whole, we urge you to weigh both direct and indirect impacts on health care access, research and development (R&D), and domestic manufacturing as you take the first steps toward implementing this program.As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has confirmed, the government price controls codified under the recently enacted reconciliation legislation have the potential to increase launch prices for new medications, as well as to trigger fewer new drug approvals in the coming years. Scores of life-threatening conditions, from cancer to Alzheimer’s and sickle cell disease, could see a substantial decline in possible treatment options on the horizon. Moreover, based on CBO’s analysis, some manufacturers may choose to terminate participation in Medicare and Medicaid altogether as a result of the compulsory new price-setting program, jeopardizing access to a range of therapies and cures for the most vulnerable Americans. Other independent analyses have projected even more catastrophic consequences, from hundreds of thousands of domestic job losses to hundreds of billions in forgone R&D dollars. The innovation ecosystem that has made the United States the world’s unquestioned life sciences leader, bolstered by thousands of startups and small businesses, may wither under this partisan legislation, particularly in the absence of careful, deliberative implementation and assertive, consumer-oriented oversight.Given the profound health care, economic, and national security implications of this anomalous new federal program, we ask that you carefully consider these and other threats, from depressed drug discovery and development to diminished medical access and cascades of health care provider cuts. In light of the urgent importance of clarity and caution regarding the forthcoming implementation of this colossal government initiative, please provide the following information by the close of business on October 28, 2022:  Sincerely,# # #

https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/capito-murphy-introduce-bill-to-address-parkinsons-disease,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), introduced the National Plan to End Parkinson’s Act, which aims to unite the federal government in a mission to cure and prevent Parkinson’s, alleviate financial and health burdens on American families, and reduce government spending over time. Parkinson’s disease is the second most common – and fastest-growing – neurological disease globally with at least 60,000 new cases diagnosed every year. Representatives Tonko (D-N.Y.) and Bilirakis (R-Fla.) introduced companion legislation, H.R. 8585, in July 2022.“Far too many West Virginians are impacted by Parkinson’s disease,” Senator Capito said. “Whether they are living with the disease or caring for someone impacted by it, Parkinson’s takes a terrible toll on the physical, mental, emotional, and economic well-being of everyone involved. The National Plan to End Parkinson’s Act is commonsense legislation which will establish a robust response to address the disease and move us towards new treatments and a cure.”“Anyone living with Parkinson’s or caring for a loved one impacted by the disease knows just how devastating a diagnosis it can be. The National Plan to End Parkinson’s Act would create a comprehensive strategy to get us closer to a cure while also ensuring we do everything we can to help patients and their families access higher quality, more affordable care,” Senator Murphy said.“With more Parkinson’s therapies available today and more in clinical testing, we’re hopeful about the future of Parkinson’s research and care. Yet, to realize our mission we know it’ll take the collaborative effort of individuals across sectors to move the dial and find a cure,” Deborah W. Brooks, CEO and Co-Founder of The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, said. “The Parkinson’s community across the United States is grateful for the leadership of Senator Capito and Senator Murphy in leading the Senate effort on The National Plan to End Parkinson’s — an important bill that will allow collaboration between the public and private sectors to prioritize research advancements toward better treatments and access to quality care that every person touched by this disease urgently needs.”“Senator Capito is an incredible leader and champion of better cures and treatments for neurological diseases,” George Manahan, a Charleston business owner and person living with Parkinson’s disease, said. “Her leadership on the National Plan to End Parkinson’s Act gives people suffering from Parkinson’s disease new hope for a cure. When I was diagnosed, I began working with state and federal lawmakers to prioritize the need for a cure and public-private collaboration to make it happen. Senator Capito is a hero to those of us living with Parkinson’s, and I am thankful for her work to create this important bill.”“Parkinson’s disease is impacting patients and their families in America more than ever before. It causes progressive disability in movement, cognition, and other functions with no cure on the horizon. We need to coordinate and accelerate our research and management efforts so that we can better understand this disease, in hopes that one day soon we will see an end to this disease,” Dr. Ali Rezai, Executive Chair of WVU Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute (RNI), said.The National Plan to End Parkinson’s Act will create an advisory council comprising members of every federal agency that supports research, care, and services for Parkinson’s, plus caregivers, patients, and other non-federal experts.The council will:For bill text, click here.For a one-pager on the legislation, click here.###

written, and outlined transportation priorities Congress can tackle together
moving forward.“As these funds are
distributed and new programs are set up to address our transportation needs,
implementation must be done in accordance with the law. That’s why, as the top
Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, oversight of
exactly how the IIJA is carried out will continue to be a major
priority,” Ranking Member Capito wrote.The full op-ed is
available here and below.Capitalizing on a
(Properly Implemented) Bipartisan Infrastructure LawBy: U.S. Senator Shelley
Moore Capito (R-W.Va.)The Washington TimesSeptember 15, 2022Last fall, Congress passed
the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) that made
record investments to address, upgrade, and expand our nation’s core
infrastructure.It provided more than $300
billion for our federal highways, $40 billion for bridge construction and
repairs, more than $17 billion for ports and waterways infrastructure, nearly
$3 billion for primary airports, and so much more.As these funds are
distributed and new programs are set up to address our transportation needs,
implementation must be done in accordance with the law.That’s why, as the top
Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, oversight of
exactly how the IIJA is carried out will continue to be a major
priority.For example, the law codified
the One Federal Decision policy for highway and bridge projects, which sets a
two-year goal for finishing environmental reviews for major projects. It requires
agencies to coordinate on a predictable, joint schedule, providing states and
localities the regulatory certainty they need to move projects forward.That certainty and improved
efficiency for transportation projects only comes if the Department of
Transportation puts these sections of the law into practice. Critical project
delivery sections, including One Federal Decision, however, have still not been
prioritized for implementation, almost a year after being signed into law.Republicans and Democrats
came together to craft the legislation in a specific way that would best
benefit all communities. These project streamlining provisions are part of what
made the bill bipartisan, and part of what got it across the finish line.We also provided states with
maximum flexibility by preserving the traditional formula distribution of funds
so states can address their own unique transportation needs. The agencies
responsible for implementation now have an opportunity to see these commitments
through, or stand in the way.At the EPW Committee, which
was responsible for writing the foundation of the IIJA, we will continue
to push for transparency and accountability as funding is distributed, guidance
documents are released, and project applications are submitted.Ensuring this historic
investment in our nation’s infrastructure is properly deployed is crucial, but
it’s also a reminder that we have an opportunity to build on this momentum and
continue delivering tangible results for every American.For one, the Senate recently
passed our version of the bipartisan Water Resources Development Act (WRDA),
which authorizes key projects across the country and boosts the import and
export of goods, including crops, through expansions and upgrades of inland
waterways and ports.We’re working with our
counterparts in the House to agree and move forward on a final version of WRDA,
and send it to the president’s desk.Our aviation sector is also
important to our future economic security, as well as the daily lives of many
Americans. Jobs in this field, whether in maintenance or recruiting and
developing new pilots, are needed. In my home state of West Virginia,
successful pilot and aviation training programs through Fairmont State,
Marshall University, and Shepherd University are preparing the next generation
to meet this challenge.Congress has an opportunity,
potentially through a major FAA reauthorization bill, to find ways to support
and invest in proven programs like these that will shore up the aerospace
industry workface of tomorrow, and with it, a key part of our economy.The issues facing us don’t
just apply to one group or one category of similar communities. Our
transportation needs are felt in both rural and urban areas, on the coasts, and
in the middle of the country.Fortunately, we have a solid,
bipartisan starting point.I’m looking forward to
working with my colleagues to maximize the investments we made, recognize and
support effective programs, and develop new ideas to make positive impacts on
families, workers, and employers every single day. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, West Virginia
Republican, is the Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee, and also serves on the Appropriations, Commerce, and Rules
Committees. She is the first female senator from the Mountain State.

https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/capito-manchin-announce-new-flight-services-at-clarksburg-lewisburg-airports,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) announced that Contour Airlines will provide Essential Air Services (EAS) to North Central West Virginia Airport in Clarksburg (CKB) and Greenbrier Valley Airport in Lewisburg (LWB). This announcement follows a March 2022 decision by SkyWest Airlines to terminate EAS services at 29 airports across the country, including Clarksburg and Lewisburg.“Our airports in West Virginia are vital to connecting our residents and our communities with the rest of our country and world,” Senator Capito said. “These three-year contracts that will provide weekly service between our North Central West Virginia Airport (CKB) in Clarksburg and our Greenbrier Valley Airport (LWB) in Lewisburg to Charlotte Douglas International Airport will not only create great opportunities for our residents, but will also serve as a gateway for people around the globe to visit West Virginia. I have long fought to keep Essential Air Services at our airports in West Virginia, and I’m thrilled to see this operation come to fruition.”“Air service is absolutely critical for West Virginia, connecting our communities to the rest of the country, helping businesses export their products and increasing tourism across our great state,” Senator Manchin said. “I have fought for EAS program funding for years to bring quality, reliable air travel and new economic opportunities to West Virginia, and I am pleased Contour Airlines will be continuing these critical flight services at the Clarksburg and Lewisburg airports. I am grateful to DOT for their commitment to protecting EAS in West Virginia, and I will continue advocating for our transportation hubs across the Mountain State.”Out of several applicants at both airports, DOT selected Contour Airlines to replace the services terminated by SkyWest for a three-year term beginning November 1, 2022 at Lewisburg Airport and a three-year term beginning December 1, 2022 at Clarksburg Airport. SkyWest is required to continue providing service at both airports until Contour services begin to ensure a smooth transition.# # #"

The funding was made possible through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which passed the Senate and was signed into law in June of 2022.“Safe and healthy learning environments are essential for our youth in West Virginia as they grow and progress through their educational journey. I know how important this is to our children and their families, which is why I voted in favor of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act in the Senate. I will always stand up for our children in West Virginia, and make sure resources are available to provide the support they need to be successful,” Senator Capito said.“As children across West Virginia head back to school this fall, it is more important than ever that we work together to ensure every student has a safe and healthy learning environment,” Senator Manchin said. “I was proud to vote for the critical Bipartisan Safer Communities Act earlier this year, and I am pleased the Department of Education is investing in West Virginia to increase school-based mental health support for our students. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue advocating for resources to bolster mental health services and support our students across the Mountain State.”# # #"

And so, again with the December 16 memorandum that was put out that really, I think, brought a lot of confusion, but also some concern that the flexibilities that each state has enjoyed to be able to make the determinations, whether it's equity or climate or capacity, those states have been able to make those decisions. It's also important to note that included in the memo was direct language from the bills that came out of the house, which the Chairman and I, in our negotiations, was not included in our bill. So that's the will of Congress.”ENSURING STATES HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS THEIR OWN INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS: “I mentioned the thing that happened in West Virginia where the transfer of the funds, 50% of the funds, went to another program, which is allowable…and that they had received, three months after they were given permission to do that, a letter discouraging them from doing that, which makes you wonder who's writing the letters.CAPITO: “But, I would like to know that you would uphold the right of states to transfer up to 50% of certain highway programs to other eligible highway programs, and if you have any thoughts on that particular issue…did you ever do that in Colorado?”BHATT: “Absolutely. We’ve flexed dollars.”ON SIX MONTHS OF RADIO SILENCE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION: “I mentioned in my opening statement that I had submitted questions for the record for the secretary from his opportunity in March. It's been six months, we haven't received any answers. And so I would ask that you take that back...that my frustration at not having been responded to is not taken lightly by me.

I appreciate the frank conversation that we had yesterday in my office, and thanks for spending so much time with me.“As we discussed, for almost two years we have been operating without a Senate-confirmed administrator at FHWA and it has been two years for the agency, much too long.“The president signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, IIJA, into law almost one year ago…it was cold that day, remember that?“The foundation of the IIJA was our bipartisan Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act of 2021.“The IIJA included unprecedented funding to address the needs of our nation’s road and bridge infrastructure. It stood up a number of new programs and included significant project delivery provisions, such as environmental review and permitting reforms for highway and bridge projects.“This legislation proved that Congress can come together on pressing issues facing our nation and we know that we can find bipartisan solutions that deliver results for the American people.“The staff at FHWA has been working hard to implement the IIJA, but there is still a lot of work to be done in order to ensure that funding gets out the door, shovel-ready and worthy projects move forward, and the law is implemented as Congress intended it. “As we mentioned yesterday, time is money, and in this inflationary time it has become, I think, much more of a challenge with supply chain issues as well.“I am troubled and concerned by some of the implementation actions that the FHWA has taken in the absence of a Senate-confirmed administrator.“While we all expected FHWA would prioritize the [sections] of the IIJA that advance the priorities of the Biden administration, but I do have a great deal of concern when it appears the agency is outright neglecting to implement certain provisions of the bill, mainly the project delivery actions.“I submitted questions for the record regarding implementation of the project delivery sections as a follow up to our March meeting with Secretary Buttigieg on IIJA implementation, but we have still not received any responses from DOT.“Simple questions like ‘what modal administration is overseeing implementation of each section of the law?’ shouldn’t be a hard question to answer.“Implementation deadlines should be readily available for the department to provide.“With these easy questions unanswered it begs the question: is the department not actively planning implementation of certain sections of the law?“This question is even more pressing as FHWA took it a step further by prioritizing the implementation of policies that were purposely left out of the law.“This was the subject of our hearing for me with Secretary Buttigieg.“We have seen this carried through in numerous guidance documents beginning with the December 16 FHWA memorandum to staff entitled ‘Policy on Using the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Resources to Build a Better America,’ and then in programmatic guidance documents [for] the National Highway Performance Program (NHPP), the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program (STBGP), and the PROTECT program, just to name a few.“Among those other items these guidance documents encourage recipients of highway formulas to ‘flex’ funding into transit investments. It discourage states from moving forward with projects that add highway capacity. It imposes a one-size-fits-all approach by discouraging transferring program funds to where they are needed most, which was a flexibility that was intentionally built into the law to ensure each state’s unique needs are met. “You know as a former state administrator in two different states, state flexibility is crucial to ensure that our transportation network can successfully meet the needs of all of our constituents. “I invite you and anyone from the department, we talked about this, to travel to my home state so you can fully understand that some policies are not going to solve our transportation problems that we have in the state, and in the mountains, of West Virginia. “While I have been told repeatedly that these are ‘just guidance documents,’ my frustration is building when I consider the time that limited staff at the department and FHWA are devoting to such documents instead of implementing the law in its entirety.“In July, the West Virginia Department of Transportation received a letter encouraging them not to transfer from one program to another, three months after the agency had approved the transfer.“So, let me reiterate the last part: the transfer already occurred under an approval three months before, and then they were notified three months afterward that that behavior is to be discouraged.“I am also hearing about a lack of responsiveness from FHWA and inconsistency in responses from division offices across the country, another issue that we talked about in my office.“Recipients of funding are looking for consistent direction from FHWA that adheres to the law.“If this does not happen, we run the risk of this investment not being fully utilized and the goals of the legislation not being fully realized as inflation adds urgency to maximizing this historic investment.“It is time that the FHWA stops spending limited staff resources on what the political appointees’ wish list is and instead focuses those resources on implementing what is actually in the law, the entire law, that the Congress negotiated and passed with strong bipartisan support, and that the president signed.“I am very interested to hear if and how you plan to turn this situation around, and to understand what your priorities would be if confirmed.|“Will things look different than they do now or will it be more of the same?“This is a pivotal moment. FHWA has the opportunity to provide the states and other funding recipients with the guidance and support necessary to build a modern transportation network that works for all Americans, or the agency can serve as a roadblock.“I am hopeful that if confirmed you will lead FHWA in upholding the law, that your priorities as administrator will recognize that transportation needs throughout our nation are different in every state, and that you will not push a one-size-fits-all approach.“Chairman Carper, I yield back.”# # # "

GEAR UP is designed to help low-income students prepare to enter and succeed in postsecondary education by investing in high-need middle and high schools across the country.“Giving our students in West Virginia the resources they need to enter college with a solid foundation and strong confidence is important, which is the goal of GEAR Up program. Concord has been an educational cornerstone in West Virginia for 150 years, and they are incredibly deserving of this federal support, which will help put students on a path to success,” Senator Capito said.“Every West Virginian should have the opportunity to pursue higher education, regardless of their background or where they live. GEAR UP is an incredibly important program that provides critical resources to students across the Mountain State through services such as tutoring, career mentoring, summer enrichment programming, college scholarships and more,” Senator Manchin said. “As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and longtime supporter of GEAR UP, I look forward to seeing the positive impacts of this funding and will continue advocating for resources to bolster educational programs across West Virginia.”GEAR UP currently serves more than 572,000 students enrolled in 3,474 secondary schools across 43 states. GEAR UP has demonstrated its success in helping increase the number of low-income students who enroll in post-secondary education after graduating from high school.

https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/capito-colleagues-biden-administrations-overreaching-child-mask-mandate-must-end," WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito yesterday joined her Republican colleagues in sending a letter—led by U.S. Senators John Thune (R-S.D.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.)—to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra requesting that the department rescind its one-size-fits-all federal mask mandate on Head Start programs. Children six months to five years of age are currently eligible to be vaccinated against COVID-19, but a HHS interim final rule (IFR) still requires all staff and volunteers in Head Start educational facilities to be vaccinated and requires all staff, volunteers, and children two years of age and older to wear masks – even when they are outside on the playground.“This IFR continues to be an overly rigid, inflexible rule that complicates individual Head Start programs’ ability to operate and attract staff and volunteers – though there is a preliminary injunction against the IFR in multiple states – and we request that you immediately rescind it,” the senators wrote. “The nation must continue to transition toward treating COVID-19 as an endemic condition and return to a sense of normalcy, and it is past time for Washington bureaucrats to allow Head Start programs to do the same.”The letter was also signed by Senators John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho). Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), and Thom Tillis (N.C.). The full letter can be viewed here or below:Dear Secretary Becerra:Since November 2021, vaccine and mask mandates on Head Start and Early Head Start programs have been in effect as a result of a U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) interim final rule (IFR). We write to highlight how unnecessary these mandates continue to be and request that this IFR be rescinded immediately.As you know, as of January 31, 2022, this IFR requires Head Start staff and volunteers to be vaccinated against COVID-19. It also requires Head Start staff and volunteers to wear masks. But beyond these mandates, the IFR also requires students two years of age and older to wear masks despite the World Health Organization advising against mask mandates for children five years of age and younger.Up until the publication of this IFR in late 2021 – more than 18 months after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic – individual Head Start programs across the nation had the flexibility to implement their own precautions that effectively protected staff, volunteers, and students in these facilities. This flexibility afforded each individual program the opportunity to establish health and safety protocols and other mitigation strategies that were consistent with state and local laws and recommendations that worked best for their staff, volunteers, and students. In fact, according to a December 2020 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this flexibility was effective, as the CDC found that individual programs successfully implemented recommendations that limited the transmission of COVID-19 in their facilities.The application of inflexible federal rules on individual Head Start programs through this IFR and the forcing of toddlers enrolled in these programs to wear masks even caught the attention of Congress. On May 3, 2022, the U.S. Senate passed a joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of this IFR by a bipartisan vote of 55 to 41, with seven Democrats supporting the resolution and opposing the IFR.Prior to Senate consideration of the resolution, President Biden unfortunately committed to vetoing it. A primary reason for his opposition was because, at the time of Senate consideration, the CDC had not yet approved children five years of age and younger to be vaccinated against COVID-19. However, on June 18, 2022, the CDC approved certain COVID-19 vaccines for children six months through five years of age. Head Start-aged children are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine if their families so choose.This IFR continues to be an overly rigid, inflexible rule that complicates individual Head Start programs’ ability to operate and attract staff and volunteers – though there is a preliminary injunction against the IFR in multiple states – and we request that you immediately rescind it. The nation must continue to transition toward treating COVID-19 as an endemic condition and return to a sense of normalcy, and it is past time for Washington bureaucrats to allow Head Start programs to do the same.Thank you for your prompt attention to this request. Sincerely,# # # "

The proposed changes could negatively impact automobile dealers across the country as well as those looking to purchase a vehicle.“This proposed rule would fundamentally change the way that vehicles are retailed in America. If implemented, this proposal would confuse customers, lengthen the transaction time to purchase a vehicle, limit consumer choice, increase paperwork, and mandate burdensome new recordkeeping requirements on small businesses. More troubling, the FTC appears not to have done any consumer testing to ascertain whether its new regulatory regime would work in practice,” the senators wrote.The FTC’s proposed rule, published in the Federal Register on July 13, 2022, would create burdensome new reporting requirements on auto companies that provide direct financing to their customers. Additionally, the FTC did not give advance notice of this proposed rulemaking and only allowed for a 60-day comment period for a rule that will fundamentally alter a trillion-dollar industry.Read the full letter here. # # #"

https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/capito-applauds-bhe-renewables_500-million-investment-in-ravenswood,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) today applauded the announcement that BHE Renewables, a Berkshire Hathaway Energy business, has entered into an agreement with the State of West Virginia to purchase more than 2,000 acres of land in Ravenswood, W.Va., to be developed as a first-of-its-kind renewable energy microgrid-powered industrial site.Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”), a Berkshire Hathaway Inc. business, will be the first company to locate on the site and will develop a state-of-the-art titanium melt facility that will use 100% renewable energy to manufacture titanium products for the aerospace and other industries. The land is currently owned by the West Virginia Economic Development Authority (WVEDA). WVEDA will work with BHE Renewables to bring additional businesses to the site to take advantage of the prime manufacturing location and renewable energy infrastructure.“Today’s announcement that Berkshire Hathaway Energy Renewables and West Virginia have reached an agreement to invest in Ravenswood is welcome news. This unprecedented project has the potential to rapidly transform the Ravenswood area, and spark the economic development our communities need to grow and thrive. My staff and I have been involved in this process from the very beginning because we recognize the importance of smart economic and environmental growth to our state. I am thankful for the work of Governor Justice, Mike Graney, Mitch Carmichael, and especially Senator Glenn Jefferies and the West Virginia Legislature for helping make this possible. There is strong momentum growing behind business in West Virginia right now, and we must continue to build off of this economic success into the future,” Senator Capito said.“This is a monumental announcement that will pay dividends for generations to come,” West Virginia Governor Jim Justice said. “The partnership we are forging with BHE Renewables and PCC is testament to West Virginia’s ability to compete on the world stage and recruit world-class companies like these to our state. I couldn’t be more proud of the fact that West Virginia will help lead the way into a new era of renewable energy microgrid-powered manufacturing. I can never thank BHE Renewables and PCC enough for their commitment to West Virginia and for the jobs and economic ripple effects this partnership will bring.”“This project demonstrates how investing in clean energy can revive economies that have served our country’s energy needs for decades,” BHE Renewables President and CEO Alicia Knapp said.“We are thrilled to partner with PCC and West Virginia to deliver this landmark renewable energy solution, hundreds of jobs and significant economic development,” PCC Metals President Steve Wright said. “Our future facility is an outstanding opportunity to use clean energy as we invest in further strengthening our position as a world leader in titanium metals. Manufacturing our products with 100% renewable energy benefits PCC and our customers as we strive to minimize the impact of our operations and wisely use natural resources.“Two world-class companies selected West Virginia because we created the best environment for them to do business. That includes being home to a world-class workforce. Something this big doesn’t happen without the ingenuity and work ethic of West Virginians,” West Virginia State Senator Glenn Jeffries said.“Our state’s growth-focused economic policies are second-to-none. West Virginia is investing in smart new ways for businesses to build success around clean energy that’s here to stay,” West Virginia Secretary of Economic Development Mitch Carmichael said.# # #

https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/capito-manchin-announce-50000-for-greenbrier-valley-economic-development-corporation,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), both members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced $50,000 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Business Development Grant Program for the Greenbrier Valley Economic Development Corporation. The funding will support job creation in the local forestry, transportation and sawmill industries and will accelerate economic development throughout southern West Virginia.“There are fantastic opportunities for economic development all across our state, and Greenbrier County is no exception,” Senator Capito said. “I saw this firsthand when I visited The Schoolhouse Hotel and Mountaineer Steer in White Sulphur Springs earlier this year, and I’m glad to see more funding heading to the region to support more economic development opportunities within the sawmill, transportation, and forestry industries. I will continue to fight for the resources to help create and maintain a healthy business climate that our counties need to grow and thrive.”“Investing in our communities spurs economic growth and creates good-paying, long term jobs, which is why I’m pleased USDA is supporting the Greenbrier Valley Economic Development Corporation’s efforts to accelerate local business development. The awards announced today will boost the forestry, transportation and sawmill industries across southern West Virginia, and I look forward to seeing the positive impacts of the investment,” Senator Manchin said. “As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue to advocate for funding to bolster rural economies across the Mountain State.” # # #"
https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/capito-leads-colleagues-in-introducing-comprehensive-regulatory-and-permitting-reform-legislation,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, led 46 of her Republican colleagues in introducing the Simplify Timelines and Assure Regulatory Transparency (START) Act, comprehensive federal regulatory permitting and project review reform legislation.“Since our calls for action and offers to see legislative text from the permitting ‘deal’ remain unheeded, Republicans are introducing this legislation today to deliver solutions to the roadblocks, delays, and postponements of key infrastructure projects across the country,” Ranking Member Capito said. “The START Act would provide regulatory certainty to states, expedite permitting and review processes, codify substantive environmental regulatory reforms, and expedite permitting of the critically important Mountain Valley Pipeline.

The amendment failed by a vote of 50-49, with all 50 Senate Democrats voting against it.SUPPORT:Ranking Member Capito’s bill is cosponsored by 46 senators, including, U.S. Senators Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), John Thune (R-S.D.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), and James Lankford (R-Okla.).BILL DETAILS:Full text of the legislation can be found here.A section by section summary can be found here and below.Section 2 - Codification of NEPA RegulationsSection 3 - Providing Regulatory CertaintySection 4 - Limiting New Red Tape and Costs for Gasoline and Other FuelsSection 5 - Expediting Permitting and Review ProcessesSection 6 - States’ Authorities in Hydraulic Fracturing RegulationsSection 7 - Federal Lands Freedom ActSection 8 - Expedited Approval for the Mountain Valley PipelineSection 9 - Reducing Timeframes for Endangered Species Act ConsultationsSection 10 - New Source Review Permitting Improvement ActSection 11 - No Retroactive Permit VetoesSection 12 – Policy Review under the Clean Air Act# # #

I am proud to support and be an advocate for equal and fair play, and I hope to see other organizations follow the leadership set by U.S. Soccer on behalf of young girls across our country.”Earlier this year, the USWNT settled their longstanding gender discrimination lawsuit against U.S. Soccer, reaching an agreement on a deal to be compensated at the same rate of pay as the men’s team. The two new Collective Bargaining Agreements, which run through 2028, achieve equal pay through identical economic terms for both the men and women’s teams. These economic terms include identical compensation models for all competitions, including the FIFA World Cup, and the introduction of the same commercial revenue sharing mechanism for both teams.The ceremony was emceed by World Cup champion and ESPN commentator Julie Foudy. Fans also heard from U.S. Department of Labor (DoL) Secretary Marty Walsh, U.S. Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone, Women’s National Team players, and a message from tennis player Billie Jean King.The bipartisan Equal Pay for Team USA Act would require that all athletes representing the United States in global amateur athletic competitions receive equal compensation and benefits for their work, regardless of gender. It also would require equal payment for medical care, travel, and expenses.The bill applies to 50 different sports’ national governing bodies, and it requires the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) to conduct oversight and the USOPC and national governing bodies to report on compliance with the legislation.Senators Capito and Cantwell introduced the bipartisan legislation in July 2021 and it passed the Commerce Committee on June 22, 2022. The legislation is currently awaiting final vote by the full Senate. Organizations Supporting the Equal Pay for Team USA Act: Photos from the event are included below:U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), U.S. Women’s Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone, U.S Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), and U.S. Soccer Foundation CEO Ed Foster-Simeon attend the signing ceremony for the historic equal pay agreement in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, September 6, 2022. U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and USWNT Player Alex Morgan and her daughter attend the signing ceremony for the historic equal pay agreement in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, September 6, 2022.# # #

This would benefit 44 out of West Virginia’s 55 counties (80%) and 2,147 out of the country’s 3,143 counties (68%) as well as thousands of other cities, towns, and other governmental entities.“Competitive federal grants provide critical support to West Virginia’s recent economic development boom, and I am proud to support legislation that will ensure that even our smallest communities can access needed resources. Many of our rural communities lack the infrastructure to submit competitive grants, putting them at a disadvantage compared to wealthy urban areas. The Simplifying Grants Act will benefit approximately 80% of our most vulnerable areas, and support the good work our fellow Mountaineers are doing to improve quality of life. West Virginia’s brightest days are ahead of us, and I remain a committed partner to our federal, state, and local entities seeking to invest in the future of our state,” Senator Capito said.“Local governments use federal dollars to invest in infrastructure, public safety, law enforcement, and our children’s education, among other important priorities. Regretfully, our current grant process leaves small local governments and their residents behind. This bill would provide a simplified process so small local governments are able to apply for and receive the funds they need,” Senator Rubio said.Full text of the legislation is available here.# # #"
https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/icymi-senate-unanimously-passes-bipartisan-bill-to-reduce-spread-of-toxic-pfas-at_commercial-airports,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – This week, the Senate unanimously passed bipartisan legislation authored by U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), to reduce the spread of toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination at commercial airports.The Preventing PFAS Runoff at Airports Act would deploy more existing Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) funding for commercial airports to purchase devices necessary to test their firefighting equipment without discharging toxic PFAS chemicals. This legislation would incentivize commercial airports to purchase the relatively low-cost devices – also referred to as an input-based testing system – to help limit and prevent exposure to PFAS, which are known as “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down.“The FAA requires regular testing of firefighting equipment, which may put undue burdens on regional, commercial airports, and lead to the discharge of harmful chemicals like PFAS,” Senator Capito said. “Specifically, the Preventing PFAS Runoff at Airports Act would benefit several airports in West Virginia – like Yeager, Greenbrier, and Mid-Ohio Valley – and improve overall safety of their operations. I’m pleased my colleagues joined our effort to advance this legislation in the Senate, recognizing the importance of testing airport rescue and firefighting equipment without dispersing dangerous PFAS chemicals into the environment.”# # #

https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/video-capito-urges-support-for-bipartisan-bills-protecting-motorsports-farmers-from-epa-overreach,"Click here or the image above to watch Ranking Member Capito’s questions.WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, questioned witnesses, including champion American drag racer Antron Brown and American Farm Bureau Federation Vice President Scott VanderWal, about two pieces of legislation, the Recognizing the Protection of Motorsports (RPM) Act of 2021 and the Livestock Regulatory Protection Act of 2021.HIGHLIGHTS:PROTECTING AUTOSPORTS FROM EPA OVERREACH: “The RPM Act…seems like a simple, very commonsense fix…and there is a problem there. Mr. Brown, you've testified to that. And Mr. Walke acknowledged that we need to have a fix here. So, I guess my question to you Mr. Brown, because you've been really explicit about talking about your youth and STEM education and you have a wonderful family there that's involved in racing. And I imagine that most of your audience are families that come out on an evening to an affordable way to enjoy being with their families and watching a great sport. But if a looming EPA lawsuit is looking over you and you said you just created your new team, what kind of reaction do you have that as a small business owner? How would you ever be able to fight that?”ON NEED FOR LIVESTOCK REGULATORY PROTECTION ACT: “We also heard that the cow tax proposal…‘there's really no need for this legislation, because it's taking care of every year in appropriations.’ Well, I'm on Appropriations. I wouldn't be betting on what's going to happen every year in an appropriations process here in the United States Congress. I mean, we're heading up to a continuing resolution, which is not the way that this whole system was conceived. We should have our appropriations bills in line by September 30, have them passed, and have our wishes moved forward. So a year by year band aid is not, I don't think, a solution to the issue that you're talking about.”TECHNOLOGY, MARKET INCENTIVES DELIVER BETTER EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS THAN MANDATES: “As you're moving forward as an industry with the innovation and technology that’s coming forward, you’re able to bring your emissions down almost in a voluntary manner, because it's good for the environment, it's good for the farmer, it's good for the consumer. And so, I think putting our emphasis in the positive areas is a much more beneficial way than in a punitive way such as a cow tax would put forward.”# # #"

And Senator Tillis is also on the statement.“I want to thank our witnesses for joining us here today, and I look forward to hearing from each of you.“We are here to consider four bills: the Livestock Regulatory Protection Act, the Recognizing the Protection of Motorsports Act, the Smoke-Ready Communities Act, and the Smoke Planning and Research Act.“These bills relate to EPA’s authority on issues spanning from livestock to racing vehicles to wildfire smoke. “I am interested to hear more about Senator Merkley’s bills, the Smoke-Ready Communities Act and the Smoke Planning and Research Act. “But I do want to highlight that EPA has existing authority to fund wildfire research, including through the “Science to Achieve Results” (STAR) program.“That program has provided research funds for universities for wildfire research, which appears to be something that Senator Merkley’s bill, the Smoke Planning and Research Act, would reauthorize in a separate [program], and I’d like to understand if there’s any duplication there.“In 2021, EPA awarded $9 million in grant funding for researchers to develop approaches and strategies to reduce the risks of smoke from wildfire and prescribed harm.“And through the Democrats’ what I call a reckless tax and spending spree that we just saw last month, EPA has been provided with excessive additional funding and authorities. EPA received funding for air monitoring, which can be used for wildfires, as well as a $3 billion grant that can award funding to ‘mitigate climate and health risks’ from wildfire events.“I question the need for an even greater increase in EPA power and appropriations in light of the recent spending.“As we consider the other topics before us today, I want to thank Chairman Carper for agreeing to consider two bipartisan bills during this hearing: the Livestock Regulatory Protection Act, and the RPM Act.“These two bills are narrowly tailored to provide clear relief and certainty to critical American groups that could suffer outsized costs from EPA regulation: farmers and ranchers, and motorsports enthusiasts, which are rampant in my state.”“The regulatory threat is real and we have already seen this administration take a very expansive view of EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act when evaluating the energy sector.“The first bill I’ll talk about is the Livestock Regulatory Protection Act, which would ensure EPA cannot establish a new “cow tax” and would prohibit EPA from requiring Clean Air Act permits related to livestock emissions.“Farmers and ranchers are on the front lines of dealing with rising prices, including higher costs of fertilizer, feed, fuel, and equipment that are vital to their operations.“Enacting Senator Thune’s bipartisan, straightforward bill, which is cosponsored by Senator Kelly, a member of this committee and thank you for that, Senator Boozman, and Senator Sinema, could codify a narrow exemption for livestock.“I would note that Majority Leader Schumer himself supported Senator Thune’s bill when it was introduced back in 2009.“I am also pleased to speak in support of necessary relief for racecar enthusiasts and their supporting industries.“I have proudly supported Senator Burr’s RPM Act since it was first proposed.“This legislation seems so simple to me. As introduced, has broad, bipartisan support, including on  this committee.“In addition to myself, four other committee members are supportive: Senator Kelly, thank you for that support, Senator Inhofe, Senator Ernst, and Senator Sullivan are also cosponsors.“In total, the bill has 32 cosponsors, including 11 Democrat cosponsors.“Back in 2017 when I was chair of the Subcommittee of Clean Air and Nuclear Safety, we held a hearing on the RPM Act.“As we heard then and we will hear again today, Americans all over the country enjoy the hobby of modifying vehicles into racecars.“The RPM Act would clarify that vehicles to be used solely for competition are not to be treated like the cars that drive on our nation's roads.“Congress never intended for cars that have been modified from street use to race track use to be regulated.“This legislation would provide a narrow exemption, again, narrow, to ensure that small businesses that help hobbyists who transition their vehicles into racecars – that are not driven on the road and cannot be driven on the road – are not unfairly punished or targeted through EPA enforcement, because that was never the intent of this Congress.“I am glad that we are hearing about these bills today and I hope to learn more from our witnesses.“So, thank you again for holding this hearing.”# # #"
https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/photos-capito-highlights-improvement-projects-during-eastern-panhandle-visits,"EASTERN PANHANDLE, W.Va. – U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) today made stops in the Eastern Panhandle focused on Congressionally Directed Spending (CDS) funding through the Senate Appropriations Committee to support several improvement projects. In total, Senator Capito secured $241,135,000 in direct spending measures across West Virginia in the FY 2022 appropriations omnibus package.First, Senator Capito visited Shepherd University where she met with President Mary Hendrix to receive an update on the various CDS requests Senator Capito advocated for, and learn more about how the university is putting these resources toward projects to improve curriculum and university life overall.“The projects at Shepherd University have the benefit of helping the university through improving programs, curriculum, and the overall college experience,” Senator Capito said. “During the conversations around the Congressionally Directed Spending process, projects like the ones I discussed today with President Hendrix were exactly what I had in mind. I enjoyed the opportunity to receive an update on the plans, and I can’t wait to see the positive impact this will have on the Shepherd community.”“Shepherd University is honored to receive a visit from Senator Capito. We are deeply appreciative for the senator’s support, especially the Congressionally Directed Spending she has kindly secured for our university. This has had a transformational impact on our academic programs, infrastructure, and community. It has been a privilege to work with the senator and experience first-hand her passionate commitment to helping West Virginia,” Dr. Mary Hendrix, President of Shepherd University, said.Senator Capito then visited the Eastern West Virginia Regional Airport where she met with the leadership team about the airport’s efforts to modernize its operations. While at the airport, Senator Capito also met with the leadership of Acoustic Research Systems, which is the world’s leading full service provider of acoustic testing services. During the visit, Senator Capito was briefed on the company’s role in the emergent field of acoustic stress testing of space mission components, followed by a tour of the equipment demo space.“We appreciated Senator Capito’s visit the Eastern West Virginia Regional Airport. The senator has been very supportive of our airport (MRB). It was a pleasure to show her the progress we’ve made at MRB in recent years thanks in part to her efforts. We are the largest airport in the state and now the second busiest. We have been in growth mode for a few years and the hard work is beginning to pay off. Thanks to Senator Capito’s support, we will continue on that trajectory moving forward,” Nic Diehl, Executive Director & CEO of Eastern Regional Airport Authority, said.“The future is bright for the growth of the Aerospace industry and we believe that we can and will make a great impact to the economic growth in the region,” Jeremiah Leiter, CEO & Co-Founder of the Acoustic Research Systems, said. “We are honored that Senator Capito has put some attention to our mission both here in Martinsburg but also with our other initiatives with the Keystone Space Collaborative. In only a few months she was able to help garner the attention and resources that help us keep moving forward. We are truly grateful for her depth of engagement with these initiatives.”Senator Capito’s final visit of the day consisted of a walking tour of downtown Martinsburg with Mayor Kevin Knowles. During the tour, the senator learned more about current and future improvements the city is focused on, as well as received a general update on the city.“Today was a great opportunity to see firsthand how Martinsburg and Berkeley County are taking the right steps to create safe communities, drive job creation, and make the area a great place to live and raise a family,” Senator Capito said. “I want to thank Mayor Knowles for his leadership, and the many other local leaders that are working hard to truly make a difference in the community.”“The City of Martinsburg has always had a great relationship with Senator Capito and her staff. Her willingness to listen and put into action our needs here in Martinsburg has not gone unnoticed. The city has had several projects in the works such as the Queen Street underpass, the Frog Hollow Trail, and the Martin Street streetscape project, just to name a few. Her staff is always responsive to our needs. Senator Capito and I have worked on several projects over the years, and she has always done things with a passion, and I always look forward to working with her on future projects,” Martinsburg Mayor Kevin Knowles said.Senator Capito also made a stop at the Berkeley Senior Services Center where she met with seniors and staff.Photos from today’s visits included below:U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) visits Shepherd University in Shepherdstown, W.Va. on Tuesday, September 6, 2022.U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) visits Berkeley Senior Services in Martinsburg, W.Va. on Tuesday, September 6, 2022.U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) receives an update on city projects with Martinsburg Mayor Kevin Knowles in Martinsburg, W.Va. on Tuesday, September 6, 2022.U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) visits Acoustic Research Systems in Martinsburg, W.Va. on Tuesday, September 6, 2022.# # #

https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/capito-manchin-announce-5-million-for-charleston-area-medical-center,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. – Today, U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), both members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced the Charleston Area Medical Center (CAMC) Health Education and Research Institute will receive $5,000,000 to support a new system that will archive clinical images, improve image storage and enhance patient care. The funding is made possible by a Congressionally Directed Spending (CDS) request secured by Senators Manchin and Capito and is funded through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).“This funding announcement today, made possible through the Congressionally Directed Spending Process, resulted from several conversations we have had with CAMC about their needs and possibilities should funding be obtained. I am happy to have helped play a role in securing these resources, which will contribute to establishing better care for CAMC patients,” Senator Capito said.“The Charleston Area Medical Center provides essential care for its community, from responding to the COVID-19 pandemic to every day health concerns. That is why I proudly secured this funding to support their efforts for a new archiving and communication system to help ensure patients have continued access to the high-quality healthcare services they deserve,” Senator Manchin said. “The funding announced today will upgrade the current imaging technology to allow remote access by specialists in the case of an emergency, improve the quality of image storage and enhance patient care. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue advocating for resources, including earmarks, to support our healthcare organizations as they care for West Virginians across the Mountain State.”Congressionally Directed Spending (CDS), more commonly known as earmarks, allow state and local governments, non-profits, and other public entities to apply for targeted funding for projects to bolster their communities and directly support West Virginians. These local communities and organizations are now beginning to receive funding for projects that both Senators Capito and Manchin fought for in last year’s funding bill. As members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senators Capito and Manchin work to ensure taxpayer dollars are allocated to priorities that benefit all West Virginians, boost economic growth and support the needs of communities across the Mountain State while remaining fiscally responsible. # # #

https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/capito-manchin-announce-53-million-for-green-bank-telescope-repairs,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. – U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), both members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $5,300,000 from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for foundation repairs to the Green Bank Observatory (GBO) Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in Pocahontas County, W.Va. The GBT is a vital tool for astronomical researchers and one of the world’s largest moving structures, with 16 wheels carrying 17 million pounds on a steel track that rotates to pinpoint planets, stars, asteroids and other astronomical phenomena.“This commitment from the National Science Foundation to the Green Bank Telescope is welcomed, needed, and worthwhile,” Senator Capito said. “I have long advocated for the capabilities and opportunities for discovery that exist at the Green Bank Observatory. I am thankful for the NSF’s assistance in stabilizing the Green Bank Telescope so that the pursuit of scientific discovery can continue in Pocahontas County.”“West Virginia has a long history with groundbreaking space research, from Katherine Johnson to the Rocket Boys. The Green Bank Telescope is a critical tool for the national and global astronomical community, and I am pleased NSF is investing $5.3 million to upgrade its foundation and replace key equipment,” Senator Manchin said. “I look forward to seeing the positive impacts of this funding, and I will continue working with NSF to support scientific research opportunities across the Mountain State.”Since the GBT’s completion in 2000, the Green Bank Observatory (GBO) staff perform annual maintenance to ensure the structural integrity of the telescope, but many components are nearing the end of their planned lifetime, including the track’s top layer of “wear plates” and epoxy grout between the plates and foundation. The funding announced today will be used to purchase 48 new wear plates, and grout will be replaced in sections through 2026. Additionally, two new techniques to mitigate cracking in the wear plates will be tested and, if successful, implemented.  # # #

While West Virginia has experienced some major economic wins, we need to make sure that we keep the focus to continue this positive economic momentum. I look forward to keeping up our efforts to do just that to make West Virginia the best place to live, work, and raise a family.”“This is the biggest year yet for the Annual Meeting & Business Summit. That is a testament to the leadership in our state and the strides we’ve made to make West Virginia the best place to live, work and raise a family. I am very thankful to our remarkable slate of speakers this year that share their time and enterprise with our members. I have never been more encouraged for the future of our state,” Steve Roberts, President of the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce, said.Senator Capito also participated in a working lunch hosted by Marshall University President Brad Smith, which focused on rural health development and the linkage between community health and economic prosperity.“From our larger hospitals to our smaller health clinics, our medical institutions and professionals play a key role in providing essential medical services to the people of our state. That is especially true for our facilities in rural areas, which are often the only resource available for residents of our small communities,” Senator Capito said. “In order for our rural communities to be successful, access to reliable health resources must be available. I’m glad that President Smith is taking initiative once again and encouraging conversations like this one so we can work toward developing innovative solutions that will help move us in the right direction.” # # #

GigaBeam is a regional Internet Service Provider that is already working to connect rural areas of West Virginia with critical broadband access. I’m thrilled to see this funding authorized today, and look forward to its contribution in closing the digital divide in the future.”“Access to affordable, reliable broadband is vital to the success and growth of our communities across West Virginia,” Senator Manchin said. “We know that at least 258,000 West Virginians have no broadband access and that number is likely much higher, which is why I’m pleased the FCC is supporting GigaBeam’s efforts to expand broadband services to over 9,100 locations in West Virginia.

https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/capito/braun-op-ed-oppose-kotagal-for-eeoc-chief,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – In an op-ed published today in several Ogden Newspapers in West Virginia and Indiana, U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) wrote about their strong opposition to the nomination of Kalpana Kotagal to serve as a commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Specifically, the senators outlined the negative impact Ms. Kotagal could have on West Virginia and Indiana businesses and their employers if she is confirmed.“The nomination of Kalpana Kotagal to be a member of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is a significant one. Her appointment would shift the balance of the five-member EEOC from its current makeup to one that would stifle economic growth, especially on the fossil fuel industry. It is sobering to think about what one vote could do on the EEOC. It is also important to remember what one vote could do in the U.S. Senate as well. Her nomination was deadlocked in committee, and thus would require every Democrat, in addition to the vice president, to advance the nomination. One Democrat voicing opposition would keep her from advancing and changing the makeup of the EEOC,” the senators wrote.The full op-ed is available here and below.Oppose Kotagal for EEOC ChiefBy U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.)September 1, 2022Word Count: 499Within the next few weeks, the U.S. Senate will consider a nomination that could have deep impact on West Virginia and Indiana businesses and their employees. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is one of those Washington, D.C. agencies that could, through overregulation and interference, disrupt American business and put jobs in danger.We have seen far too often in West Virginia and Indiana how unelected bureaucrats have hindered advancement and progress through their policy overreaches in pursuit of an agenda that dismisses the contribution states like ours have made to our economy.The nomination of Kalpana Kotagal to be a member of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is a significant one. Her appointment would shift the balance of the five-member EEOC from its current makeup to one that would stifle economic growth, especially on the fossil fuel industry.It is sobering to think about what one vote could do on the EEOC. It is also important to remember what one vote could do in the U.S. Senate as well. Her nomination was deadlocked in committee, and thus would require every Democrat, in addition to the vice president, to advance the nomination.One Democrat voicing opposition would keep her from advancing and changing the makeup of the EEOC.This is important because Ms. Kotagal has made it clear what she stands for: litigation over arbitration, and a strong dislike for fossil fuels as an energy source.Ms. Kotogal has allied herself with a group, for example, that wants to “retire coal-fired power plants, oil-based transportation systems and other fossil fuel infrastructure.”She has said that “the connection between addressing climate change and adapting to its effects and furthering social justice and equity is a crucial one.” For West Virginians and Hoosiers, we know what the impact of these social experiments are: lost jobs, with no plan to replace them.An EEOC under the majority that would exist, if Ms. Kotogal is confirmed, would be one of more intrusion and litigation and less transparency and accountability. With Ms. Kotogal at the EEOC, we would have another federal agency whose mission would be to advance an agenda at the expense of those they are chartered to help.Ms. Kotogal has tried to downplay her beliefs on fossil fuel and her activist positions. But there is not much left unclear when she says, “the connection between addressing climate change and adapting to its effects and furthering social justice and equity is a crucial one.”Her beliefs represent a stronger bureaucratic state, less transparent and responsive to the American people outside of the trial bar, all the while pursuing an agenda that adheres to the principles of the Green New Deal. As we have far too often seen in this administration, this is the wrong deal for West Virginia and Indiana.We will be voting to oppose her nomination to this post and call on anyone who advocates for a fair playing field for American businesses and their workers to do the same.---Republican U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito represents the state of West Virginia. Republican U.S. Senator Mike Braun represents the state of Indiana. # # #

Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) today attended the West Virginia Chamber of
Commerce’s 86th Annual Meeting and Business Summit where she participated in
several events with business and community leaders.First, Senator Capito spoke to the West Virginia Manufacturing
Association (WVMA) Chemical Industry Committee (ICI) about the importance of
the industry, efforts to secure a Hydrogen Hub in West Virginia, and the
negative impact the so-called “Inflation
Reduction Act” will have on the chemical manufacturing industry.“Manufacturers
play an increasingly important role in our state, and that is particularly true
about the chemical industry and the continued development they create,” Senator Capito said. “We must do all we
can to increase their access to needed resources through critical supply chains
and provide opportunities for growth, not increase their taxes in the middle of
a recession.”Senator
Capito later joined state and federal leaders for Pure Watercraft’s
announcement that it has executed an agreement with the State of West Virginia
to manufacture its electric pontoon boats in Beech Bottom, W.Va. Pure
Watercraft is the leading direct-to-consumer provider of high-performance
electric boats, and has previously met with Senator Capito regarding future
investment in West Virginia.“Whether
it’s cruising Summersville Lake, a day at Bluestone Lake, or fishing in the
Cheat River, West Virginia does not disappoint when it comes to a fun day on
the water, and Pure Watercraft understands that. Several months ago, I had the
opportunity to meet with Pure Watercraft to learn more about their vision for
outdoor recreation in West Virginia, and I’m thrilled to see this now coming to
fruition,” Senator Capito said.
“Pure Watercraft’s facility in the Northern Panhandle will help create jobs and
further expand our recreation tourism focus in West Virginia, and we are
thrilled they chose to invest right here in the Mountain State.”“We
are grateful to Senator Capito and her team for their accessibility and direct
support as we made our site decision,” Andy
Rebele, Pure Watercraft's Founder & CEO, said. “Her leadership
contributed to our choosing West Virginia for our electric boat production
facility. We look forward to working together to build the electric boat

Capito later visited the Mountaineer ChalleNGe Academy’s South Campus where she
toured the academy, and met with West Virginia National Guard (WVNG) Adjunct
General Bill Crane, WVNG leadership, academy leadership, and cadets. Through
her role on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Capito has made it a
priority to advocate for funding for the National Guard, specifically for West
Virginia’s ChalleNGe Academies. In January of 2020, Senator Capito wrote a letter of support of
the WVNG’s proposal to open the Montgomery ChalleNGe Academy, which is the
state’s second location and opened in October of 2020.“The
Mountaineer ChalleNGe Academy has proven to be a priceless resource in our
state, providing at-risk youth West Virginians the opportunity to finish their
basic education and gain the skills necessary to become contributing members of
our communities,” Senator Capito said.
“I’m thrilled to see our South operation thriving, and I look forward to
continuing working together with the dedicated leadership to ensure that the

These projects will be funded through an initial national award of $560 million from the Department of the Interior to address and clean up orphaned oil and gas wells on Federal lands across the United States. This funding was made possible by the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and will reduce methane emissions, clean up the environment and help reinvigorate communities across West Virginia impacted by orphaned oil and gas wells.“When we crafted the bipartisan infrastructure law, addressing abandoned wells scattered throughout our nation and in West Virginia was an important priority. It takes key investments to help local communities meet the challenges posed by these orphaned wells, and that’s exactly what this will provide. In this round of funding alone, our state will be able to plug and begin to remediate 160 wells, which will have a major impact in nearly every corner of our state,” Senator Capito said.“I’m pleased the Department of the Interior is continuing to effectively implement my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law by announcing this additional funding for orphaned well clean-up projects, including 160 wells across West Virginia. These projects will ensure West Virginia’s hardworking communities can remain safe and healthy for future generations, while also bringing new economic opportunities and creating good-paying jobs for our communities. I look forward to seeing West Virginia move quickly to utilize these funds and, as Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I will continue advocating for resources to ensure communities across the Mountain State can rebuild and succeed once again,” Senator Manchin said.The historic Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided $4.7 billion to plug, remediate and reclaim orphaned wells via grants to the States and new federal programs. In West Virginia, these grants will help the State’s Department of Environmental Protection to ensure that state and local priorities are addressed, while employing local oil and gas workers. Millions of Americans live within a mile of hundreds of thousands of orphaned oil and gas wells and there are at least 4,646 documented orphan wells in West Virginia alone that will be eligible for funding under this initiative. These wells jeopardize public health and safety by contaminating groundwater, seeping toxic chemicals, emitting harmful pollutants including methane, and harming wildlife. In addition to creating good-paying jobs addressing this pollution, these investments create safer and more inhabitable communities and drive new economic opportunities. # # # "
https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/capito-statement-on-epas-proposed-designation-of-two-pfas-chemicals-as-hazardous-substances,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, released the following statement after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed designating two per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) as “hazardous substances” under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).“I continue to be a strong, leading proponent of action to address PFAS contamination in West Virginia and across the country. Over the years, we’ve heard from local stakeholders and studied the real-life impacts of this complex issue, which is why I am concerned about the uncertainty and unintended consequences that today’s proposal could have. If this proposal is finalized, property owners, farmers, employers, essential utilities, and individuals may be liable for unknowingly having PFAS on their land, even if it was there years or even generations prior to ownership and came from an unknown source.“The best way to give Americans confidence that they are safe from PFAS should be prioritizing research efforts to both understand the environmental and public health challenges the chemicals pose and develop technologies to ultimately find, remove, and destroy PFAS for good. As I’ve said before, the EPA needs to expeditiously complete work on an enforceable drinking water standard to promote the health and safety of every American.”Under the EPA’s new proposed rule, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) would be listed as “hazardous substances” under CERCLA. Both substances are no longer used commercially, meaning the rule would largely target sites with legacy contamination. # # #

The program will help address pilot shortages, introduce new career paths to the region, and help grow the aerospace industry in West Virginia. As a leader on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Capito has helped secure federal funding to make this program possible.“West Virginia has so much to offer to the aerospace industry, and we have so much to gain from the high-tech industry,” Senator Capito said. “Thanks to the partnership between Marshall University, Mountwest Community and Technical College, Huntington Tri-State Airport, and Yeager Airport, Marshall’s Aviation Maintenance Technician program will help develop critical workforce training programs to support our goal of growing the aerospace economy in West Virginia. This is the comprehensive approach we need to attract the aerospace industry to West Virginia and prove that we have the solid workforce needed to fill these types of jobs. I’ve worked diligently in Congress to make sure the program is supported and has the tools needed to be successful, and I can’t wait to see the positive impact it will have on our students, aerospace economy in West Virginia and the broader region.”“This program was made possible by the collaborative relationship between Mountwest and Marshall,” Dr. Joshua Baker, President of Mountwest Community and Technical College, said. “Each institution made valuable contributions that will develop our economy and workforce and create great careers for students.”In the afternoon, Senator Capito met with the Putnam County Development Authority to discuss the economic growth in the county, the challenges they face, and the solutions needed to overcome some of these obstacles. Following the discussion, Senator Capito toured businesses and ongoing economic development projects in the area including, Tasty Blend Foods, Inc., Alexander’s Place with Dave Hobba Builders, and available property in the Putnam Business Park.“It’s an exciting time for economic development in Putnam County right now, and that was evident during my visits today,” Senator Capito said. “I was encouraged to hear from the Putnam County Development Authority and see firsthand the existing and ongoing projects in the area. The future success of our state depends on our ability to create more opportunity and jobs, and I’m confident that Putnam County is suited to meet these needs.”“We are so thankful for Senator Capito taking time to visit Putnam County and our organization. Putnam County is seeing growth with more on the horizon, and the Development Authority continues to drive our communities forward. The Senator’s visit was at a great time so we could discuss infrastructure needs as our county continues to grow; we were also able to celebrate the success of local businesses who have already chosen to make our county home. It was an honor to showcase a few of the great assets of Putnam,” Morganne Tenney, Executive Director of Putnam County Development Authority, said.“My Dad grew up poor in government assisted housing in Charleston, but his dreams were bigger than his circumstances.  He built something amazing that I’m honored to now lead.  We are a West Virginia based company that employs West Virginians and we make products that are used by West Virginia businesses, families and schools.  My father’s dream became a West Virginia success story, and we’re so proud to have Senator Capito here to see our success story,” Cathy Elswick, President and CEO Tasty Blend Foods, Inc., said.Photos from today’s visits included below: U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) cuts the ribbon at the ceremony for Marshall University’s AMT Program in Huntington, W.Va. on Thursday, August 25, 2022.U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) meets with Dave Hobba Builders at the Putnam Business Park in Fraziers Bottom, W.Va. on Thursday, August 25, 2022.U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) meets with Dave Hobba Builders at the Putnam Business Park in Fraziers Bottom, W.Va. on Thursday, August 25, 2022.# # #

with Congressman David McKinley (R-W.Va.), today hosted Doug Kinkoph, Associate
Administrator for the Office of Internet Connectivity and Growth of the
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), for a
broadband summit in Wheeling, W.Va.The summit provided an opportunity
for federal, state, and local officials, as well as Internet Service Providers,
to highlight the unique challenges West Virginia faces, for example in the Northern Panhandle, when it comes to
improving broadband connectivity.“Broadband connectivity is
key to a modern economy, which is why it’s my top priority,” Senator Capito said. “With the incoming
broadband dollars coming to West Virginia through the new bipartisan
infrastructure law, we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to strengthen our
broadband deployment efforts. However, in order to achieve this goal,
collaboration at the federal, state, and local levels is absolutely essential.
That’s what today’s summit is about, and I was glad to bring NTIA here to West
Virginia to not only see the problem firsthand, but also to hear directly from
those at the state and local level about the unique challenges we face and
learn more about how we can ensure we effectively and efficiently address this
problem.”“The Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, supported by Senator Shelley Moore Capito, provides the
resources to connect everyone in America to high-speed internet to finally
bridge the digital divide,” Douglas
Kinkoph, Associate Administrator, of NTIA’s Office of Internet Connectivity and
Growth, said. “Access to affordable and reliable high-speed internet
for West Virginians means opportunities for workforce development in
high-skilled, high-paying jobs and the ability to close the ‘homework gap’ by
making sure every child has internet access at home.”Photos from today’s summit

https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/icymi-video-capito-joins-metronews-talkline-special-on-alzheimers-disease-with-dr-ali-rezai_-,"To watch Senator Capito’s full interview, click here or the image above. MORGANTOWN, W.Va. – U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), and Dr. Ali Rezai, Director of the Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute (RNI) today joined Hoppy Kercheval, host of MetroNews Talkline, for a special interview on Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. During the interview, Senator Capito shared her personal experience as a caretaker for her parents who struggled with Alzheimer’s disease, as well as her continued efforts to assist families in West Virginia going through similar circumstances.HIGHLIGHTS FROM SENATOR CAPITO:PERSONAL EXPERIANCE: “Right, really difficult situation. I think my mother – I remember her looking at me, probably 15 years before she passed away, saying ‘Shelley, I'm losing my mind.’ And her mother went through almost the exact same pattern and she knew what was happening to her. She closed in, she lost her confidence, she became afraid to do certain things and be around certain people and I don't think I really understood it, but she had my dad kind of right there with her helping her and it let you know he's wearing out at the same time.”LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS: “We've tried to work on some legislation, not just funding, and I'd love to hear the doctor's advice on early detection. We've tried to introduce early detection of Alzheimer's in the ‘Know Your Medicare,’ you know, your first exam that you get when you get onto Medicare. The other thing is caregiving. We're trying to help with more avenues, because the caregivers get worn out…and then the research, which is what they do so well.”CONTINUING INNOVATIVE RESEACH AT WVU: “Working with Dr. Rezai here, we had the NIH Institute of Aging in early, we're going to have them back. We've had also the head of addiction from NIH to come in because I think the research that's going on here at WVU – and the innovative work that Dr. Rezai is doing with his team…I want to try to like shine a national spotlight on that but also to encourage the work and I mean, you can do this through federal funding but also through formulating the programs that fit.”HELPING FAMILIES IN WEST VIRGINIA: “Well, I want to see other families be able to pick up that book and find out what to do, or to avoid it entirely. We've now seen a lot of trials of different medications. Dr. Rezai is doing a really innovative surgery…it's an ultrasound that has great promise. There's so much going on here. I just want to try to do what I can but you know, I love my parents very much, in sickness and in health, and I hesitated in the beginning to talk about it because it was difficult, but a lot of people were going through the same things and worse.”HIGHLIGHTS FROM DR. REZAI:IMPORTANCE OF EARLY DETECTION AND RESEARCH: “Basically, it's typically the brain is getting worse for 15 to 20 years before the first external manifestation of dementia or Alzheimer's. The first time your loved one has difficulty paying the bill at a restaurant or is being repetitive or can't find a way around – all of these manifestations are occurring after 15 to 20 years of brain degeneration. So it's important that we can do research, so we can detect this earlier on but typically Alzheimer's affects your thinking your memory, your anxiety, behavior, finding your way around – that’s so many elements of your life.”ON PROGRAMS FOR CAREGIVERS: “I think that one key thing that people need to understand is the stress, the impact this has on the caregiver, the spouse, the family and that's really important because the caregiver now has got the burden of taking care of everything in their daily lives, plus taking care of the loved one and dealing with emotional aspects and seeing the loved one who was probably very strong person in their lives, and they looked up to them, is deteriorating and sort of the light faded in them. It's very tough to see them. So I think the stress and anxiety for the caregiver is very significant and we cannot ignore that.”WEST VIRGINIA IS LEADING THE WAY: “Yes, we need to do more studies and here in West Virginia, we're among the world's leaders looking at how we can detect Alzheimer's earlier on using technologies of imaging and other techniques that we can help detect it earlier. And like cancer these days, you can detect cancer earlier…we can detect heart disease, but that has not been translated for Alzheimer's. So that needs to be accelerated by research and innovation and public private partnerships.”RECOGNIZING SENATOR CAPITO’S EFFORTS: I really want to commend you, Hoppy, for having this dedicated hour because raising the awareness is extremely important for people to know there's opportunities and resources available. And Senator Capito, I want to commend you for your efforts to legislate to help people, that's very important. So West Virginia is really a unique state for Alzheimer's, whether it has to do with legislator awareness and also what we have here for research and innovation are world leaders.”# # # "

The funding comes from the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and will be used to mobilize communities to prevent and combat youth substance use.“I have often said that community based solutions are among the most effective in our continued battle against the opioid and addiction crisis. No two places are the same, and our approach towards substance use prevention needs to reflect the individual people in specific areas. The Drug-Free Communities Support Program is a great example of the inclusive approach we need to tackle this problem and steer our youth in West Virginia away from the wrong path toward drug addiction. I’ve seen firsthand the positive impact that programs in our state that follow this model can have, and I’m confident this funding will help provide the focused approach to substance use prevention that the youth of our state need,” Senator Capito said.“The drug epidemic continues to ravage West Virginia and impacts every family and child in our state. It’s especially heartbreaking to watch our youngest generation of West Virginians struggle with substance use disorder. The Drug-Free Communities Support Program plays an essential role in combatting and preventing drug misuse among young West Virginians, and I am pleased to announce this funding to support additional community efforts across our state,” Senator Manchin said. “I am grateful to Dr. Gupta for his commitment to combatting the drug epidemic in West Virginia and across the country, and I will continue advocating for resources to support safe, healthy, drug-free communities.”The DFC Program is the nation’s leading effort to mobilize communities to prevent and combat youth substance use. The DFC Program provides funding to local coalitions to strengthen prevention programs and help create safe, healthy, drug-free communities across the United States. The funding announced today will help three more organizations address and prevent youth substance use by helping implement educational strategies at schools, increase recruitment of community members into coalitions and reduce of youth access to dangerous substances.“Adolescence is a critical period to prevent the initiation of substance use when the developing brain is particularly vulnerable,” Dr. Rahul Gupta, Director of ONDCP, said. “Research shows that youth substance use decreased significantly in communities served by a DFC-funded community coalition. This funding for communities in West Virginia and across the country reinforces our commitment to preventing youth substance use as part of President Biden’s Unity Agenda to beat the overdose epidemic. By investing in evidence-based prevention strategies like this, we can continue to instead help our youth reach their full potential. I appreciate the commitment of Senator Manchin and Senator Capito to supporting young people in West Virginia to lead healthy and productive lives.”Individual awards listed below: # # #

The Marion County Chamber of Commerce is fortunate to have her in Washington working on our behalf,” Tina Shaw, Marion County Chamber of Commerce President, said.Earlier in the day, Senator Capito, who is the Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, hosted U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Director Martha Williams in Charleston, W.Va. for meetings focused on alleviating regulatory delays to critical projects across the state. At a recent EPW Committee hearing, Senator Capito secured a commitment from Director Williams to visit West Virginia and address these ongoing issues. Click here for a full recap on those visits.“At a time when we should be taking full advantage of new investments in West Virginia’s infrastructure, we are seeing delays and backlogs due to lengthy agency review processes and staffing shortages,” Senator Capito said. “I appreciate Director Williams fulfilling the commitment she made to come to our state, see firsthand the impact of these projects not being able to get off the ground, and work with us to resolve these problems and coordinate more efficiently moving forward. There is still work to do here, and I look forward to continuing the dialogue with Director Williams and her staff to move projects forward.”Photos from today’s visit included below:U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) visits TMC Technologies in Fairmont, W.Va. on Wednesday, August 17, 2022.U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) attends the Marion County Chamber of Commerce Annual Dinner in Fairmont, W.Va. on Wednesday, August 17, 2022.# # #

https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/capito-statement-on-democrats-partisan-and-extreme-abortion-bill,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) today released the below statement regarding her vote against Democrats’ partisan and extreme abortion legislation:“To be clear: The Supreme Court has not made a final decision on overturning Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood. Today, my Democratic colleagues put forth a bill that goes way beyond putting Roe v. Wade into law. This bill overrides all state and federal laws that exist on restrictions to abortions. This bill denies faith-based conscience protections under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. This bill enables federal funding for abortion, yet the Hyde amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funding to pay for abortion, was first passed in 1976. The bill also creates a right to an abortion at any point of the pregnancy. Many of these issues I have voted against repeatedly. Therefore, I voted ‘no’ today on this radical legislation, and I am not surprised that this effort failed.”Specifically, S. 4132 would: # # #

Click here to read the op-ed.HIGHLIGHTS:AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SUPPORTING OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES: “We see the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has put a light—and the president has talked about this—on the need for energy security both here and abroad.  The president has mentioned the ability of the United States to help with liquefied natural gas and things of that nature to help Europe become less dependent on Putin. Would you agree that we must act immediately to replace Russian imports into Europe with American-made energy? Have you taken any specific actions to strengthen our energy security, increase our domestic energy production to meet this, and export more? I think the answer to that is no?”PERMITTING IIJA PROJECTS: “On the permitting issue that I talked about with the IIJA, does this run into conflict with some of the goals that you’ve set forward in terms of a two-year timeline, a 90-day repeat, shortening the time of the projects? How do you see those working in conjunction with one another because we feel—and I feel—as though you could create a conflict there?”  POLICY INCONSISTENCY: “I was interested that one of the quotes from your opening statement is ‘more building in the next few years.’ It appears laced through your action plans that you took on the NEPA action plan regulatory changes—where you’ve taken down three of the major provisions that the Trump administration put forward only sets up more regulations from different federal regulators. Again, it looks like a burdensome package again to slow any kind of new construction or even a CCUS project.”  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OVERREACH: “In a filing to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last year, the EPA ‘recommend[ed] that attention be paid to the costly irreversibility of constructing natural gas pipelines.’ EPA stated that ‘[a]n important question to consider is whether [pipeline] construction will: … lock in natural gas production and use at the expense of substitute energy sources with lower social costs….’ I would remind you that according to the WHEJAC, some of those projects that would be eliminated would be CCUS projects, direct air capture projects, nuclear projects. I was very concerned to see a similar line of thinking incorporated into the recent NEPA regulatory changes you signed last month. Under those regulations, the government defines the ‘purpose or need’ of a project under NEPA – and can override a project developer’s purpose. As I understand it – under these new regulations – an energy company could request permits for a natural gas plant and the federal government could instead say through the NEPA review that solar generation should be developed instead – regardless of the actual business case is.”ONE FEDERAL DECISION: “One of the key project delivery provisions of IIJA was the codification of One Federal Decision for major transportation projects. In today’s fact sheet on the Permitting Action Plan – you state that the IIJA’s permitting provisions ‘enhance efficiency, accountability, and predictability and provide the tools needed to ensure timely and sound delivery of these historic infrastructure investments.’ You seem to recognize the critical role One Federal Decision plays in environmental review and permitting process. So as you move forward to Phase II of your update of NEPA, do you commit to keeping One Federal Decision in place as part of these regulations? I think you really have to follow the law here. It is in the law.”# # # "

Click here to read the op-ed.Below is the opening statement of Ranking Member Capito, as prepared for delivery.“Thank you, Mr. Chairman Carper, for holding today’s hearing to conduct oversight of the Council on Environmental Quality, known as CEQ. And thank you for coming to be here with us today, chair.“I know both you and I were so proud of the committee’s monumental accomplishment of developing and reporting surface transportation and drinking and wastewater legislation unanimously last year.“And, we were also very proud when those bills became law at the end of last year as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).“And soon, hopefully the WRDA legislation, which this committee unanimously approved just last week will join IIJA into law.“A top priority for all of us now on the committee should be to make sure the programs and authorizations we carefully negotiated move from being words on a page to projects on the ground. “If IIJA is implemented as Congress intended, we will develop modern roads and bridges to connect rural communities, critical water infrastructure projects to create access to clean water, improvements to our transmission system to ensure access to reliable and affordable power, and the development of natural gas pipelines and other energy projects to ensure fuel for use both here and exports abroad, a need made all the more real by the Russian war in Ukraine.“The funding and authorizations provided by the IIJA will propel development, but those projects also must complete environmental reviews and secure federal permits before shovels can actually go in the ground.“In that legislation, we also recognized that the status quo for National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA reviews and permitting has been unacceptable.“A 2020 CEQ report found that the average Environmental Impact Statement took 4 ½ years to be completed. We know that some projects can take up of 10 years to get through the NEPA and permitting processes.“Congress explicitly directed streamlining of environmental reviews for transportation projects, particularly by codifying the One Federal Decision policy for certain transportation projects.“That policy recognizes that delays caused by a never-ending environmental review process can kill or stifle projects and investment.“IIJA puts in a place a commonsense guidepost that NEPA reviews for major transportation projects should not take longer than two years, and all environmental permits and other project authorizations should follow within 90 days after that.“A clear project timeline will help to plan, finance, and construct transportation projects within the five-year authorization window for the federal highway programs.“Congress’s clear intent, both in the highway title and in other portions of IIJA, such as the permanent reauthorization of the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, was to ensure projects are completed faster so the American people can benefit from the investments.“As the agency charged with overseeing implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act, as well as the agency that serves as an environmental coordinating hub administration-wide, CEQ could play a unique and instrumental role in implementing Congress’s goals.“CEQ could institute environmental review and permitting efficiencies that can make the IIJA implementation a success.“I will say that nothing I have seen coming out of CEQ assures me that is what’s going to happen.“Certainly, improving NEPA efficiency does not appear to be a priority.“Instead, CEQ seems extremely busy implementing executive orders that direct CEQ to manage and develop countless new administration-led priorities not authorized in statute, from coming up with an environmental justice screening tool to be deployed administration-wide, to managing new federal efforts to transition all government cars to electric vehicles in an unrealistic timeframe.“CEQ is bogged down with activities imposed by the president unilaterally, and even then, CEQ cannot even keep up with the president’s own timelines.“For example, the draft environmental justice tool was not released until this February, more than five months after President Biden’s self-imposed deadline.“In the meantime, CEQ has not provided—I don’t think—adequate attention to actually implementing NEPA.“The one major action related to NEPA CEQ has taken will not speed up projects.“Last month, CEQ rolled back three key reforms made to NEPA under the Trump administration.“CEQ proposes to put the federal government in charge of deciding a project’s purpose and need.“CEQ would encourage individual federal agencies to layer on additional review requirements.“And CEQ is directing agencies to bring in cumulative and indirect impacts that will have the effect of putting the thumb on the scale against certain projects.“In doing so, CEQ has only amplified ambiguity and uncertainty—that we’re trying to get around—within the NEPA review process, which will slow down our project delivery. “The opposition from project developers across industries, from roadbuilders to energy producers, has been swift and emphatic.“Their message is clear: Why is CEQ making the NEPA process more difficult for project developers, not faster and clearer?“CEQ has not shown any willingness to expedite the review and permitting review process for CCUS, as directed by Congress in the USE IT Act.“CEQ has proposed guidance that largely serves to present alleged pros and cons of CCUS and fails to provide concrete direction to federal agencies to actually expedite CCUS projects.“That’s disappointing to me as someone who is a big supporter of that, and telling that even with respect to projects that are clearly necessary to meet the administration’s well-publicized climate goals, CEQ is apparently unwilling to propose reforms that cut red tape.“Chair Mallory, thank you for coming today to discuss the topics I brought up.“This could not be a more important time for this discussion.“Just this morning, the administration has released an action plan for expediting permitting decisions, and I look forward to learning more about that plan, as well as how the administration will implement the project delivery improvements enacted by Congress.“The actions the administration takes now, concerning environmental review and permitting, will determine whether IIJA, the USE IT Act, and other recent legislation delivers the American people the infrastructure improvements Congress intended and they deserve.“I look forward to today’s hearing, and I will turn it over to you, chair, for your opening statement.”# # #"

https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/west-virginia-delegation-calls-on-president-biden-to-reject-air-commission-recommendations-for-west-virginia,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), and Representatives David McKinley (R-W.Va.-01), Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.-02), and Carol Miller (R-W.Va.-03), called on President Biden to reject the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recommendations to the Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission, which includes significant reductions in services at three of the four VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) in West Virginia.The lawmakers said in part, “We write to you today to express our grave concern with the recommendations the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) submitted to the Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission, pursuant to Title II, Subtitle A of the VA MISSION Act. These recommendations are the first step in a long process that will require the approval of both the White House and Congress before any VA facilities may be closed, relocated, or downsized. The VA’s recommendations are based on faulty data and assumptions that fail to consider the actual needs of West Virginia Veterans and the capacity of West Virginia’s healthcare network to meet those needs.”The VA has recommended that the Clarksburg, Beckley, and Huntington VAMCs all discontinue inpatient medical and surgical services, which would push veteran health care needs to civilian health care providers that are already struggling. 54 of the 55 counties in West Virginia are designated partial or whole health professional shortage areas (HPSA), with only enough staff for 70% of the licensed hospitals beds.“As illustrated in a recent Government Accountability Office titled “Incomplete Information Hinders Usefulness of Market Assessments for VA Facility Realignment”, the VA used faulty data to make these harmful recommendations. We request that the AIR Commission hold public roundtables with VA leadership and local Veterans community leaders in West Virginia while assessing the recommendations to understand the concerns and impacts they would have in the local communities,” the lawmakers continued.Read the full letter below or here.Dear President Biden:We write to you today to express our grave concern with the recommendations the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) submitted to the Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission, pursuant to Title II, Subtitle A of the VA MISSION Act. These recommendations are the first step in a long process that will require the approval of both the White House and Congress before any VA facilities may be closed, relocated, or downsized. The VA’s recommendations are based on faulty data and assumptions that fail to consider the actual needs of West Virginia Veterans and the capacity of West Virginia’s healthcare network to meet those needs. If enacted, these recommendations would gut three of our four VA Medical Centers (VAMC). We urge you to reject these recommendations outright and direct the AIR Commission to hold public roundtables with VA leadership and local Veterans community leaders in West Virginia before finalizing any recommendations.The VA has recommended that the Clarksburg, Beckley, and Huntington VAMCs all discontinue inpatient medical and surgical services. Those are sweeping recommendations that would deeply impact Veterans’ access to care and they were made without measuring the local civilian communities’ workforce and ability to take on the influx from that decision. 54 of the 55 counties in West Virginia are designated partial or whole health professional shortage areas (HPSA), with only enough staff for 70% of the licensed hospitals beds.By redirecting Veterans to these already under-staffed rural hospitals, it would further exacerbate wait times, staff shortages, and reduce health outcomes for Veterans and rural patients alike. West Virginia’s rural status relies on a delicate balance between small rural hospitals, and larger rural referral centers. The closure of any one facility puts significant pressure on the rest of the system. Rural patients are, on average, older and sicker, and West Virginia has the most vulnerable population in the country, making our current HPSA status an already tenuous position.During surges of the current COVID-19 pandemic, West Virginia hospitals experienced critical capacity requiring patients to be transferred out of state. As we have seen over the past two years, the VA is vital to our national emergency response plans. In West Virginia Veterans have been able to safely and easily take COVID-19 tests and almost 150,000 have received vaccines and booster shots at their local VA facilities. For many of those Veterans, there may be no other viable option for care like that in their area.As illustrated in a recent Government Accountability Office titled “Incomplete Information Hinders Usefulness of Market Assessments for VA Facility Realignment”, the VA used faulty data to make these harmful recommendations. We request that the AIR Commission hold public roundtables with VA leadership and local Veterans community leaders in West Virginia while assessing the recommendations to understand the concerns and impacts they would have in the local communities.Veterans have put their lives on the line to protect this country. They deserve consistent, accessible, quality care when they return. That’s the promise we made to these brave men and women when they took their oath to serve. Our delegation is West Virginia strong, and we intend to keep that promise. We look forward to collaborating with you further on how we can maintain quality care for Veterans across the nation without cutting services or access in our state.# # #"
https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/capito-op-ed-cutting-care-for-our-veterans-is-never-the-answer,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – In an op-ed, U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), wrote about the potential impacts the Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission recommendations would have on veterans in West Virginia and the importance of preserving these critical services.“I am hearing from many constituents who are concerned that these recommendations are final, but please know, this process is only beginning and I intend to use my voice throughout. The commissioners that will be need to be confirmed by Congress will be tasked with reviewing these recommendations. They will have until early 2023 to review all of the recommendations and hold public meetings to hear the concerns of those that these recommendations will impact,” Senator Capito wrote.Last week, Senator Capito questioned VA Secretary Denis McDonough the current AIR recommendations, which she has previously expressed deep concerns about. Click here for a recap of their discussion.The full op-ed is available here and below.Cutting Care for Our Veterans is Never the AnswerBy: U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.)Word Count: 558Our veterans deserve the best medical care that we can provide. That is one principle we can all agree on, even in these challenging times. But, recent actions by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have put that principle into question, and that action has not gone unnoticed by the many constituents I have heard from on this issue, or by me.In March, the VA released its initial Asset Infrastructure Review (AIR) recommendations, which were required as part of the 2018 VA MISSION Act. The intention of the AIR recommendations was to address the aging infrastructure of the VA’s medical facilities, however, the recommendations proposed by the VA essentially eliminate crucial medical services offered at three of our state’s four VA Medical Centers (VAMC). The three that will be impacted the most are the Clarksburg, Beckley, and Huntington VAMCs. If these recommendations are approved, veterans who currently receive care at these facilities will have to go to an outside provider for inpatient medical and surgical services.Currently, our nation is facing a nursing shortage, which has hit rural healthcare systems particularly hard. It is already difficult enough for individuals to set doctor’s appointments, but these wait times in the community will only be exacerbated if certain medical services are cut at VAMCs.While there are some veterans that wish to receive care in the community—and the VA MISSION Act allows for that—there are many who want the option to continue to receive care at their VAMC. Many of the veterans who are contacting my office are not doing so solely because of the medical care that they receive, but rather because of the sense of community they feel at the VA.By receiving care at the VA, veterans are around others who understand what they have gone through and it provides them with an outlet to speak freely about their service, without fear of being misunderstood. When determining the recommendations, the VA only viewed this from a business standpoint and did not consider the human impact. I fear that by dismantling this sense of community that brings many veterans to the VA, it may worsen the mental health crisis that veterans face because many will no longer have the VA as an outlet to be around others who understand their perspective.I am hearing from many constituents who are concerned that these recommendations are final, but please know, this process is only beginning and I intend to use my voice throughout. The commissioners that will be need to be confirmed by Congress will be tasked with reviewing these recommendations. They will have until early 2023 to review all of the recommendations and hold public meetings to hear the concerns of those that these recommendations will impact.I have already joined a bipartisan group of senators in demanding that President Biden ensures that before he signs the final recommendations into law, he consults with our offices on a state-by-state basis so we can share the feedback that we are receiving directly from our constituents.Make no mistake, our facilities need improvements, but these recommendations are not improvements. In the meantime, I will remain vocal and continue to work with my colleagues to halt the drastic recommendations that have been proposed. The VA needs to recognize that cutting care for our veterans is never the answer. # # #

https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/icymi-capito-op-ed-biden-rollback-of-permitting-reform-makes-his-own-energy-goals-impossible,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, wrote an op-ed for the Washington Examiner detailing how the Biden administration’s rollback of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) permitting reforms not only delays infrastructure buildout following the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure law, but also hinders the administration’s own energy goals.“According to the National Mining Association, Australia and Canada, two countries with equivalent environmental protections as the U.S., have mine permitting processes that last two to three years on average. In the U.S., permitting a mine drags on for an average of seven to 10 years,” Ranking Member Capito wrote. “Rather than improving environmental reviews under NEPA, the Biden administration has chosen to make them more burdensome. Recently, the Biden administration rolled back key modernizations the Trump administration made to the more-than-40-year-old NEPA regulations.”The full op-ed can be read here and below:Biden rollback of permitting reform is making his own energy goals impossibleBy U.S. Senator Shelley Moore CapitoThe Washington ExaminerMay 9, 2022Word Count: 942The United States has a permitting problem.At a time when energy and natural resource security is more important than ever, we need an all-of-the-above approach to unleash American energy. However, that will not be possible until the Biden administration supports our drillers, miners, and energy innovators with tools to help do their jobs. For now, the administration seems focused on the opposite — shutting down domestic production in the long term and placing ill-suited measures on a much larger problem.President Joe Biden’s recent actions, such as releasing 25% of our strategic petroleum reserves, invoking the Defense Production Act for domestic critical minerals supply, and reopening a small fraction of federal land for drilling, do not address the root cause of his domestic energy crisis: permitting.The reality is that overly burdensome policies and environmentalists’ legal challenges are stopping energy companies before they ever break ground. According to the National Mining Association, Australia and Canada, two countries with equivalent environmental protections as the U.S., have mine permitting processes that last two to three years on average. In the U.S., permitting a mine drags on for an average of seven to 10 years!Instead of making permitting faster, the Biden administration is making it harder. National Environmental Policy Act reviews are notorious for holding up energy and infrastructure projects for years. In 2020, the White House’s Council on Environmental Quality found that it took an average of 4 1/2 years to complete an environmental impact statement under NEPA.Rather than improving environmental reviews under NEPA, the Biden administration has chosen to make them more burdensome. Recently, the Biden administration rolled back key modernizations the Trump administration made to the more-than-40-year-old NEPA regulations.As someone who represents an energy-producing state, I understand just how difficult it is for energy producers to navigate the environmental review and permitting labyrinth. Roadblocks and lawsuits from self-described “radical” groups slow down projects at every turn — and they are emboldened by an administration that is openly opposed to most energy projects to begin with.During the 2020 campaign, Biden promised to end drilling on federal lands. On his first day in office, he killed the Keystone XL pipeline.Faced with an unjust Russian war in Ukraine and Europe desperate for American energy, the Biden administration is now trying to make itself appear friendlier to fossil energy.But appearances are deceiving. For example, the Biden administration recently announced more federal land would be opened for oil and gas leases. But before actual development can ever begin on that leased land, the government must conduct an environmental analysis under NEPA, which can take years, and then the government must approve a permit to drill on the lease.The Interior Department is sitting on more than 4,000 drilling permits waiting to be approved, and development is being held up in litigation on thousands of leases. The bottom line is that the number of leases aren’t the problem, the permitting and review processes are, and that will not be improving under this administration’s new NEPA regulations.The administration’s hostility to regulatory reform applies even to types of “clean” energy projects that it praises publicly. Take renewable energy and electric vehicles. The administration has made bold promises to ensure 50% of vehicles sold in the U.S. are electric by 2030 and that all power will be zero emissions by 2035. To meet those promises will require an exponential increase in the amount of lithium, nickel, cobalt, and other so-called critical minerals that go into electric vehicle batteries, wind turbines, and solar panels. Based on the Paris Agreement’s goals for greenhouse gas emission reductions, the International Energy Agency estimates global demand for key minerals could increase by between 700% and 4,200% by 2040 from 2020 levels.Biden’s accelerated transition to these technologies exposes a major problem. Right now, Russia and China control the supply chains for these minerals. Russia supplies about 20% of the world’s Class 1 nickel, and another adversary, China, controls the refining process of 50% to 70% of lithium and cobalt.Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently said that shortages in these materials are raising prices and limiting the adoption of electric vehicles. We have many of those resources here, but we can’t get them out of the ground because the federal government is not issuing permits, leaving us at the mercy of hostile regimes.If the Biden administration will wake up to the fact these barriers are hurting all energy projects, from fossil energy to renewables, I stand ready to work across the aisle. These problems are difficult but not insurmountable. We made real progress by codifying the Trump administration’s “One Federal Decision” policy to roads and bridge projects as part of the bipartisan infrastructure bill last year. That policy ensures that project developers have a lead federal agency to work with and won’t be ping-ponged between multiple agencies. It aims to complete the federal environmental review process for any major project within two years, with federal permits and other authorizations issued within 90 days after that.We could codify the same One Federal Decision policy for mining, drilling, and pipeline projects. We could also codify the commonsense modernizations to the NEPA regulations that the Biden administration is now trying to undo.That would be a relatively simple first step and provide much-needed regulatory certainty.Now it is time to come together and reform the environmental review and permitting process to support an all-of-the-above approach to American energy — including oil, gas, coal, nuclear, renewables, and critical minerals. Through bipartisan reforms, we can secure our domestic production and export American-produced energy across the globe. I’ll be waiting for the administration to join me.# # #"
https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/capito-manchin-announce_more-than-54-million-for-west-virginia-bridge-repair-and-adhs,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. — U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), both members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced West Virginia will receive $54,790,795 from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) as part of Fiscal Year 2022 appropriations. Of that funding, $40,000,000 will go towards bridge replacement rehabilitation and the remaining $14,790,795 will go towards the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS).“This funding is addressing two of our state’s biggest transportation infrastructure challenges: structurally deficient bridges and the completion of Corridor H. Both of these items have been high priorities for me as I work on both the EPW and Appropriations Committees,” Senator Capito said. “I worked closely with Senator Shelby to secure a set-aside specifically for ADHS in the regular appropriations process. This funding on its own is substantial, but when combined with the funding included in the bipartisan infrastructure law, the impact is even greater to address West Virginia’s surface transportation infrastructure needs.”“West Virginia’s infrastructure plays a critical role in our state’s economy. Fixing our roads, bridges and highways is one of my top priorities, which is why I successfully fought to include my Finish the ADHS Act in our bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) to secure nearly $200 million in funding toward the completion of Corridor H,” Senator Manchin said. “West Virginia has the highest percentage of bridges in poor condition in the country, which is why I have fought for years through my seat on the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee for dedicated funding for bridge rehabilitation across the state. I am pleased West Virginia is receiving more than $54 million from FHWA this year, and I will continue to work with federal and state agencies to address the infrastructure needs of the Mountain State.”# # #"

One of my favorite things to see in places across our state is the growth over time of our local businesses, and today’s ribbon cutting celebration is an example of just that. Congratulations to Rustic Ravines, and I can’t wait to see what’s next!”“In recent years, tourism has flourished in West Virginia,” Congresswoman Miller said. “The establishment of the New River Gorge as a national park, combined with a pandemic that caused many people to spend more time outside, created a boom in our state’s recreational tourism industry. Resorts like Rustic Ravines have also attracted people looking to experience the natural beauty of our great state. Rustic Ravines truly has something for everyone, and their new Trailhead Brewing Company restaurant is the latest example. I am thrilled to see how Rustic Ravines has grown, and I look forward to watching them continue to thrive in the years to come. Thank you for all you do to bring more visitors, tourism, and commerce to southern West Virginia.”“Rustic Ravines really appreciates all the support we have received from so many people in the State of West Virginia.

Senator Capito discussed with VA Secretary Denis McDonough current recommendations to eliminate certain hospital services for veterans in West Virginia, which she has expressed deep concerns about, and received an update on the implementation of her legislation to improve transparency and safety at VA hospitals through security cameras.HIGHLIGHTS:ON IMPLEMENTING CAPITO LEGISLATION TO INSTALL CAMERAS IN VA HOSPITALS:SENATOR CAPITO:“Because of the things that happened at the Lewis Johnson Veterans Facility, I was able, with the support of my colleagues, to ask the VA to install more cameras because that would have helped us a lot in trying to get the perpetrator a lot quicker than we did. And I think you have to report back by November the 23rd. I just wanted to put that on your radar screen to see if you had any comments on how that project is going and what kind of future you see.”SECRETARY MCDONOUGH:“So, it's on my radar screen. Partly because of this hearing, partly because you and I talk on a very regular basis and I know how important it is you. We have deployed the cameras. So we are beginning to use them and beginning to make these initial assessments. There is some privacy concerns as you're aware of that we're working through, but we'll be in a position to surely make that report to you in a timely way.”ON VA PROPOSAL TO CUT SERVICES AT THREE OF WV’S FOUR MEDICAL CENTERS: “I want to ask you about the Asset and infrastructure Review (AIR). I want to make sure I understand the process, not just the process. So, we have four VAs in West Virginia. It looks as though three of them will, in this recommendation, will be essentially closed. Emergency rooms closed, and other recommendations. And I'm wondering, number one, how you came to the conclusion? There's a big uproar in our state. We've already sent you a letter. I'm sure you've heard from other members of our delegation on this…and other delegations. So can it be changed? Is it like a BRAC where you come back with another final recommendation?”ON NEED TO FULLY CONSIDER IMPACT BEFORE CHANGES TO VA SYSTEMS IN WV: “Just as an example, the Huntington VA is over Charleston. Charleston has a CBOC [Community-based outpatient clinics]. 15 years ago we moved the CBOC to a bigger place to get better accessibility from southern West Virginia and other places. This recommendation is that you move it again. And I'm thinking, that sounds like a giant waste of money. That state’s move their VA offices down there to co-locate and I'm thinking, I don't understand…the other thing is, when you looked at what local resources had did they look at what they could actually provide? So, I'm talking to a hospital administrator. I said if they close the Huntington VA, can you absorb the surgeries? And they're like, ‘we don't really know.’”# # #"

I heard all about this all over the weekend of concern of sort of an Orwellian, you know, policing of speech. You yourself even admitted and you just repeated it here today that the rollout of this has been vastly, you say, misunderstood. So, I think quite honestly, for the good of the rest of the department that now is a good time to abandon this ludicrous and much-maligned idea. When you say that we have operational control of the border is that definitionally disinformation? Because from a lot of our perspectives we don't believe that is true. So it seems such a subjective and undefined what disinformation is. I would challenge you to punt this and rethink for the reasons that you mentioned….These are very sensitive issues to Americans who believe fundamentally in the right to freedom of speech.”DHS: COVID ISN’T OVER SO WE WON’T FILL DETENTION BEDS TO CAPACITY. ALSO DHS: COVID IS OVER SO WE’RE LIFTING TITLE 42: “I want to ask about the ICE bed cut because I think this is important. You have testified that you don't have the resources…you mentioned you don't have the resources to really detain and hold people. We know that we have appropriated last year 34,000 beds but because of COVID, you only have those 75% occupied, which is sort of ironic in that Title 42 is going away under a COVID national emergency yet the ability to use all of your detention beds is stymied because of the COVID requirements by CDC. So that doesn't jive at all. How can you have at the one hand say you don't have the resources and on the other hand, come in with a budget that asks for funding for 9,000 fewer beds?”ON THE DESPERATE NEED TO IMPLEMENT DETERRENCE POLICIES: “Deterrence is something that I don't think you've placed enough emphasis on. One of the deterrents is detention. Instead of putting an alternative to detention where you put a bracelet on…where there's 260,000 people in this country under this alternative to detention, and that number is growing. That's not a deterrent. And you stated over on the House side, that you're deporting folks after they have their asylum claims, but you didn't leave the…this is after six to eight years after they've been in the country waiting for their claim.”ROUND 2 HIGHLIGHTS:BIDEN’S BORDER CRISIS FUELING WV’S DRUG EPIDEMIC: “On that issue of narcotics, obviously my state has the highest percentage per capita of death by overdose from opioids. Very, very sad situation. And it is coming from the southern border. So, when you think about it, when you have this flood of humanity coming over with not enough deterrent or no deterrence in some cases, it diverts your workforce away from interdicting these drugs. Because we know they’re coming in. We also know that the more people that come in, puts more money in the hands of the cartels, which allows them to up their ability to have a more robust drug trade. So there's there is a correlation here, and I'm concerned about that.”YET ANOTHER REASON A DISINFORMATION GOVERNANCE BOARD AT DHS IS UNNECESSARY: “About the Disinformation Governance Board…I know that you have a large office of civil rights and civil liberties. Why should we continue to fund them if you're creating a whole other…establishing a new board or working groups? What’s wrong with what they're doing in this area?”URGING DHS TO FOLLOW THE LAW:SENATOR CAPITO: “Isn't the law that if you are denied a claim that you would be removed from the country?”SECRETARY MAYORKAS: “Oh, that is indeed the case.”# # #"

If you look at the different projects, you can see the vastness of our nation displayed just throughout this bill.“Since 2014, Congress has enacted WRDA legislation every two years, and I am thrilled that we reached a bipartisan agreement to continue that tradition of addressing our nation’s water resources needs.“In addition to the chairman, I also want to thank Senators Cardin and Cramer for their leadership on the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure.“Your support and partnership during this process was integral to our reaching a solid agreement.“I would also like to thank your staff, Mr. Chairman, for their diligence, professionalism, and commitment of many long hours throughout this process.“Today proves once again the ability of this committee to develop bipartisan infrastructure legislation that addresses the needs of our members and the communities they represent.“True to the Corps’ tradition, this bill moves forward projects that will benefit both local communities and the entire country.“For example, we are authorizing a significant project for coastal storm risk management on the coast of Texas that will ensure critical port assets can continue to serve our country’s shipping and supply chain needs moving forward.“This project will help mitigate the worst impacts of hurricanes for local communities, and it will also provide a vital corridor for our nation’s energy industry.“As this committee heard during its oversight hearing on the Corps’ response to Hurricane Ida, when constructed, these coastal projects work to prevent the worst effects of storm damage and flooding.“And while this bill is very much oriented toward advancing critical projects in our states, it also includes several policy changes that will help the Corps succeed better in its mission.“At the beginning of this process, I outlined some of the areas in which I believed changes would be beneficial.“I said we needed to ensure more effective delivery of projects and reduce the confusion some communities have experienced in dealing with the Corps.“This bill includes several provisions that improve flexibility with regard to financial accounting for projects.“It requires reporting on timelines for the environmental review process for projects.“It authorizes for the first time a dedicated research and development account for the Corps to spur innovation, and provides contracting flexibility in undertaking these activities.“It opens the sometimes black box of the Corps by bolstering the agency’s technical assistance authorities and providing a new advisory committee for non-federal interests to voice their opinions on how the Corps can better meet their water resources needs.“The input of non-federal interests of the Corps is critical, and we preserve the integral role of non-federal cost share partners in the project delivery process by avoiding mandates from Washington D.C.“In addition to my role as ranking member, I represent the great state of West Virginia, and I worked to address several of the needs of my home state and I would like to share a few highlights in this bill.“This legislation advances a critical flood control project in the City of Milton, West Virginia.“Authorized in the 1990s, this project is a long time coming and I am proud to have helped it move forward in recent years.“The bill also supports flood control studies for the Kanawha River Basin and in the City of Huntington.“And it continues to provide environmental infrastructure assistance to communities throughout the state.“In closing, there is a lot in this bill for both sides of the aisle and for communities across the country.“It is the culmination of a true bipartisan effort and represents our shared goal of addressing our nation’s water resources needs.“I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.“Today, we are also voting on other committee pending business, including a number of GSA resolutions and the nomination of Benny Wagner to serve as Inspector General of the Tennessee Valley Authority.“Thank you for your continued partnership, Chairman Carper, as we find ways to work together and get things done for our country.”# # #"

West Virginians can expect more beneficial water and wastewater infrastructure funding like this thanks to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.”“Every West Virginian deserves clean water to drink and fresh air to breathe. In order to ensure all West Virginians have access to clean water, we must continue to update and improve our water infrastructure across the state. I successfully fought to include historic investments for water infrastructure and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and I am pleased to announce these five new investments in our state,” Senator Manchin said. “As the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue to advocate for funding to upgrade and improve water and wastewater infrastructure across the Mountain State.”Individual awardees:# # # "
https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/photos-in-monongalia-county-capito-mckinley-highlight-key-infrastructure-projects,"MONONGALIA COUNTY, W.Va. – U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Congressman David McKinley (R-W.Va.-01) today made stops in Star City and Morgantown to tour a local wastewater treatment plant and an Abandoned Mine Land (AML) site.First, Senator Capito and Congressman McKinley toured the Morgantown Utility Board Wastewater Treatment Plant in Star City. They then visited the Richard AML site in Morgantown. The bipartisan infrastructure law includes more than $140 million in AML funding for West Virginia over the next 15 years.“When we were crafting the bipartisan infrastructure law, West Virginia’s core infrastructure needs such as water and wastewater systems, and abandoned mine lands, were key priorities,” Senator Capito said. “Today in Monongalia County, we saw the impact of investing in and updating these core infrastructure projects. It not only means safer, cleaner water systems and better care of our environment, but it also means more jobs right here in West Virginia. I appreciate the local leadership and hard work being done in Star City and Morgantown to continue improving our communities for hardworking families and future residents.”“West Virginia has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to restore aging water and sewer systems, clean up abandoned mine land sites and to address roads and bridges, expand broadband and many other long-awaited physical infrastructure improvements,” Congressman McKinley said. “Today’s visits to the Morgantown Wastewater Treatment Plant and the Richard Mine AML site, was an opportunity to see, first-hand, the significant impact these types of physical infrastructure investments will have on our state, ensuring access to clean water for the people living here while also attracting economic growth and good jobs to West Virginia.”“We appreciate Senator Capito taking time to visit our Star City wastewater treatment plant. Her being here demonstrates more than the priority she places on advancing area infrastructure. Senator Capito’s visit shows her understanding of the role infrastructure investments plays in economic development and environmental protection. Projects like this are not about putting pipes in the ground. Projects like this are about protecting public health and moving toward a more sustainable future through the employment of world-class technologies. This is what we do at MUB every day and what Senator Capito is assisting us with achieving through her various roles within our federal government. We are grateful for her support,” J.T.

I look forward to seeing the positive impacts of this funding and as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue advocating for resources to support educational and career advancement for young adults across the Mountain State,” Senator Manchin said.“We at RCHA are excited to be awarded this grant and want to thank all our supporters and partners who helped with this successful application.
