His efforts to implement an assault weapons ban, clean up New Jersey’s water and Superfund sites, and accomplishments on other priorities inspired leaders throughout our state and nation. Governor Florio leaves behind a lasting legacy, and New Jersey owes him a huge debt of gratitude for his principled leadership. My heart is with his family and loved ones during this difficult time of grief.” "
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-urges-epa-to-follow-guidelines-for-glyphosate-final-registration-review-decision,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cory A. Booker (D-N.J.) today urged the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to properly follow its Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment, which provides EPA with guidance for evaluating risk of substances like pesticides, when finalizing the agency’s registration review decision for glyphosate.Glyphosate, the most widely used pesticide in the United States, is applied to an average of 298 million acres annually. People are exposed to glyphosate during its chemical application, when entering areas where it was recently sprayed, and when they eat foods that were treated with the pesticide.However, along with ecological concerns, independent research has linked glyphosate to a range of human health issues, from kidney disease to shortened pregnancies and lowered birth weight. This has prompted eleven countries to ban and thirteen countries to restrict the use of the chemical. In 2015, the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer found that glyphosate is “probably carcinogenic to humans.”Despite this, the EPA has continuously affirmed the safety of glyphosate. The EPA’s most recent human health assessment was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.“In 2016, EPA issued the “Glyphosate Issue Paper: Evaluation of Carcinogenic Potential” and consulted the agency’s Scientific Advisory Panel,”  wrote Senator Booker in a letter to Administrator of EPA Michael Regan. “This panel then issued its own concerns, similar to those of the Office of Research and Development, that EPA failed to follow its cancer assessment guidelines. Once again, the agency disregarded these concerns and, in 2017, released a draft risk assessment finding that glyphosate poses no serious human health risks. EPA’s most recent assessment, the January 2020 Interim Registration Review Decision for glyphosate which was subsequently struck down by United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, reaffirmed this stance.”“EPA must ensure the most rigorous final assessment possible,” urged Senator Booker. “It is unacceptable for the agency to continue to reassert conclusions built on inconsistent findings. I urge the EPA to closely follow its Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment in its current review of glyphosate in order to protect our nation’s public health from this dangerous chemical.”Full text of the letter can be found here."
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-menendez-announce-15-million-to-support-suicide-prevention-for-veterans-and-families,"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Cory Booker and Bob Menendez (both D-NJ) announced $1.5 million in federal funding to develop community-based suicide prevention strategies, connect veterans and their families to resources, and promote outreach to at-risk individuals.“We must ensure that our veterans are provided the care, support, and resources they need to succeed as they return to civilian life,” said Sen. Booker. “This grant is critical to the mental health and long-term well-being of our veterans. I am committed to ensuring our veterans who have bravely served our nation receive the care they deserve.”     “When they raise their hand to serve our nation, our veterans are pledging their lives to defend and protect our democracy,”said Sen. Menendez. “When they return from active duty, it is our solemn obligation to provide them with the resources they need and deserve, including mental health and suicide prevention services. Partnering with community providers through grants such as this will help ensure that we are reaching thousands of at-risk New Jersey veterans through life-saving counseling.”Community Hope and Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine were each awarded the maximum amount of $750,000 in grants through the Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention Grant Program (SSG Fox SPGP), which is administered by the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention (OMHSP) within the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs’ (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA).The SSG Fox Suicide Prevention Grants are awarded to county governments and community-based organizations that provide or coordinate suicide prevention services for veterans and their families."

Booker (D-N.J.), Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA), and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to rapidly implement the funding authorized under Section 22006 of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was signed into law by President Biden last month. This provision authorizes payments to distressed farm loan borrowers whose agricultural operations are at financial risk.The Senators also urged the USDA to quickly carry out another provision of the IRA which provides financial assistance for farmers who have suffered discrimination in USDA farm lending programs.“Thousands of USDA borrowers are struggling to make ends meet and are barely holding on to their farms, and it is critical that USDA provide assistance to these farmers prior to the expiration of the current USDA foreclosure moratorium,” wrote the Senators in a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack. “Now that Congress has provided USDA these critical resources, it is our expectation that distressed farmers with USDA direct and guaranteed loans will be able to remain on their land.”The Senators also urged the USDA “to quickly begin the selection process for non-governmental entities to administer Section 22007 of the IRA, which will provide much needed financial assistance to Black farmers and others who have suffered discrimination through USDA’s farm lending programs.” The full text of the letter can be found here.

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-merkley-grassley-adams-and-hinson-introduce-national-stillbirth-prevention-day-resolution,"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Reps. Alma Adams (D-NC-12) and Ashley Hinson (R-IA-01) introduced a bipartisan, bicameral resolution recognizing today, September 19, as ""National Stillbirth Prevention Day.” “In the United States, thousands of families experience the heartbreaking pain of a baby being stillborn. This issue is exacerbated along racial lines, with stillbirth rates alarmingly higher for Black women and birthing people,” said Senator Cory Booker. “No family should bear this tragedy. That is why I am proud to join my colleagues on this resolution designating September 19 as National Stillbirth Prevention Day. The United States must use the tools at its disposal to reduce stillbirths and begin to address the maternal and child health disparities that affect our nation.”“Stillbirth is an emotionally devastating tragedy for far too many Americans, and upends the lives of individuals and families from all demographics across the United States, including increasing the risk of maternal mortality and morbidity,” said Senator Jeff Merkley. “Nearly 1 in 4 stillbirths could be preventable, and it is alarming that the rate of stillbirth is considerably higher in Black, American Indian, and Alaska Native women. This resolution recommits us to leveraging advances in modern medicine to ensure we are doing everything we can—especially for historically marginalized communities—to prevent individuals and families from experiencing the trauma of stillbirth.”“The stillbirth rate in the United States is unacceptably high, and it’s clear we must do more to protect mothers and children from this heartbreaking tragedy. In recognizing National Stillbirth Prevention Day, we’re calling on the Biden administration to leverage federal resources to reduce the stillbirth rate by improving data collection, supporting evidence-based prevention efforts and educating parents to improve understanding of stillbirth causes. I’ve previously led efforts to support at-risk pregnant women and families, including through the Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, and I’ll continue working with my colleagues to help expectant families,” Senator Chuck Grassley said.""For too long, stillbirth has been a silent crisis, but 23,500 babies are stillborn every year. According to a recent study, nearly 1 in 4 stillbirths are potentially preventable, and the United States is trailing other countries in making progress,"" said Congresswoman Alma Adams, co-founder and co-chair of the Black Maternal Health Caucus. ""That is why I am proud to recognize September 19 as National Stillbirth Prevention Day with Congresswoman Hinson and Senators Booker, Grassley, and Merkley. All available data suggests we can make progress, so we hope increased attention to this issue will reverse this shocking trend of stillbirths and maternal mortality in the United States. I am thankful for all of the colleagues joining us as we raise awareness about stillbirth prevention efforts, promote research, and recognize the tens of thousands of American families who have endured a stillbirth tragedy. These babies – and their mamas – can't wait.“My heart goes out to any woman or family who has endured the tragedy of a stillbirth. The stillbirth rate in the United States is unacceptably high, especially for low-income and rural moms, and we must do more to help them have healthy pregnancies. Designating today as National Stillbirth Prevention Day is an important bipartisan action to prevent stillbirths and support expecting moms through their pregnancy, regardless of their income level or where they live,” said Congresswoman Ashley Hinson.“I am so unbelievably grateful for all our bipartisan stillbirth prevention champions in Congress who made today possible. There are no words that can adequately express how much it means to me to see stillbirth prevention finally gain this kind of recognition and to know that we are working together to save more babies and families. I know Autumn and all babies lost too soon are cheering us on,” said Debbie Haine Vijayvergiya, mother to Autumn who the SHINE for Autumn Act of 2022 is named after and founder of the 2 Degrees Foundation.In addition to co-leads Booker, Merkley, and Grassley, original Senate co-sponsors include Senators Wyden, King, and Peters.In addition to co-leads Adams and Hinson, original House cosponsors include Representatives Axne, Castor, Cohen, Fitzpatrick, Herrera Beutler, Miller-Meeks, Roybal-Allard, and Tonko. Endorsing organizations include Healthy Birth Day, Start Healing Together, SUDC Foundation, Mommies Enduring Neonatal Death (MEND), Measure the Placenta, Maternal Mental Health Leadership Alliance, National Birth Equity Collaborative, March of Dimes, JustActions, NechamaComfort, Three Little Birds Pregnancy & Infant Loss Support, Society for Reproductive Investigation, Every Mother Counts, the Shane Foundation, MomsRising, Association of Maternal & Child Health Programs, Preeclampsia Foundation, HER Foundation, Kindred Beginnings, What to Expect Project, and Group B Strep International.BackgroundIn our nation, an alarming 23,500 babies are stillborn every year. This is greater than the number of babies that die during the first year of life and more than ten times the number of babies that die annually due to sudden infant death syndrome.According to a recent study, nearly 1 in 4 stillbirths are potentially preventable. Data comparing the United States to other countries informs that our nation can do more to prevent stillbirth.While the rate of stillbirth has declined since the 1940s due to improvements in maternity care, in recent years, the decline has slowed or halted. Stillbirths increase the risk of maternal mortality and morbidity and negatively impact parental mental health and family well-being.Like many of the health crises in our country, disparities exist, and Black women and Black birthing people are over two times more likely than white women and white birthing people to have a stillbirth. Stillbirth rates are also high for American Indian or Alaska Native women and birthing people, who are almost 1.5 times as likely to have a stillbirth compared to White women. Hispanic women also experience higher rates.Despite impacting families from all backgrounds and people with otherwise healthy pregnancies, stillbirth is more common for people who are 35 years or older, of lower socioeconomic status, for people who have multiple pregnancies, like twins or triplets, and those who have already experienced the loss of a pregnancy.In addition, stillbirth also occurs more commonly amongst people who smoke while pregnant or are diagnosed with certain medical conditions like hypertension, diabetes, or obesity.Due to social determinants of health, people from less advantaged backgrounds and who are marginalized, continue to experience a greater burden of stillbirth. And these disadvantages are further impacted by the social determinants of health. For example, women in maternity care deserts and rural areas have fewer healthcare providers. Nationwide, approximately 10% of births take place in counties with limited access to maternity care.According to The Lancet, in a 2016 study, the United States ranked number 48 out of 49 high-income countries in annual stillbirth rate reduction. Furthermore, in comparison with the same group of countries, the United States stillbirth rate per 1,000 births was higher than 24 other countries.Previous EffortsEarlier this year, Booker introduced the Stillbirth Health Improvement and Education (SHINE) for Autumn Act, legislation that aims to reduce the alarmingly high U.S. stillbirth rate. Named after Autumn Joy, a New Jersey baby who was stillborn in 2011, the bill would provide critical resources to states, local public health departments, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other related federal agencies to improve data collection and increase education and awareness of stillbirth in the United States.Text of the resolution is available here."
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-van-hollen-lee-davis-introduce-bill-to-improve-access-to-care-for-americans-with-sickle-cell-disease,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), along with U.S. Representatives Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) and Danny Davis (D-Ill.) introduced the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Centers Act, legislation to improve access to care for Americans living with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Approximately 100,000 Americans are currently living with SCD, an inherited blood disorder that causes pain, infection, and stroke. The disease disproportionately affects Black Americans but is also found among people from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. But despite the prevalence of the disease and the need for consistent and coordinated treatment, few patients have access to multidisciplinary care teams.During a press conference on Capitol Hill to announce the new legislation, the lawmakers were joined by SCD patients, health care leaders, and advocates who discussed the importance of making Sickle Cell care more available and accessiblethrough the new legislation. Also in attendance was Kimberley Davis, the mother of John Amara Walters, a member of Senator Van Hollen’s legislative staff who died of complications from SCD last year at the age of 29.The lawmakers’ bill will grow the network of care for SCD by creating a “hub-and-spoke” framework for the delivery of SCD care. The bill establishes a new $535 million annual grant program to provide federal funding opportunities for hospitals with current SCD programs to expand their services to community health and outpatient centers, in order to help address the shortage of comprehensive treatment centers and so patients can access care and other services closer to their homes.“Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that affects thousands of Americans, disproportionately people of African descent, with devastating outcomes,” Senator Booker said. “Despite being one of the most common genetic blood diseases, Americans with sickle cell disease continue to face barriers when trying to access comprehensive integrative treatment. That is why I am proud to introduce this bicameral legislation that will establish and fund treatment centers across the U.S. as well as vital training and education resources for patients and providers.”“For the tens of thousands of Americans living with Sickle Cell Disease, accessing care can be near-impossible. And the lack of accessible care is not just an inconvenience – for some patients it’s life or death. This gap in care is unacceptable. That’s why we’re introducing this legislation to broaden the reach of existing Sickle Cell centers so we can bring treatment into the countless communities that don’t yet have it,” said Senator Van Hollen. “A new national network of Sickle Cell care would redefine how we treat this disease in the United States – and ensure nobody falls through the cracks. This is the next step forward in a long fight to provide Sickle Cell patients with the services they need, and I’m committed to moving it across the finish line.”“This unprecedented legislation being introduced by Senator Van Hollen today, honoring my and our dear John, will make a measurable difference in the lives of families living with Sickle Cell Disease living in all areas of our nation. It cannot be underestimated how there will be a much more measurable positive trajectory of Sickle Cell Disease care and treatment achieved with these substantive underpinnings in funding and structure of care and support to this large important community. Adults, children, caregivers and families; medical, educational, social and community professionals—the entire Sickle Cell Disease family nationwide—will benefit from a sea of change that benefits all impacted. While we truly miss and long for John’s physical presence here today, his incredible legacy of public service contributions to the good of United States will live on,” said Kimberley Davis.“Even though sickle cell disease is the most common inherited blood disorder in the United States, Congress has not introduced a comprehensive and national bill on the disease since the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act of 1972. Over 3 million people in the US have the sickle cell trait, and many are unaware of their status. This includes a large number of African Americans, who are disproportionally affected. Senator Van Hollen, Senator Booker, Rep. Davis and I are working to address this disparity and other inequities and raise awareness among our colleagues. This bill is long overdue, and we won’t stop fighting until it’s on President Biden’s desk for signature,” said Representative Barbara Lee.“Sickle Cell is a disease that currently affects an estimated 100,000 Americans, with an additional 2 million carrying the trait,” said Rep. Davis. “Furthermore, it is a disease that disproportionally impacts the lives of African Americans more so than that of any other ethnic group in the United States. Better treatments and outcomes for patient’s affected by Sickle Cell Disease do not happen by chance. Rather, it comes as a product of the hard work and sacrifice by countless individuals across this great nation. Every day, progress continues to be made toward the advancement of more effective forms of medical care. I know that increased resources for research and clinical trials is the key to developing more effective medication options and a cure for sickle cell disease. As the co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Sickle Cell Disease Caucus, I remain committed to championing the fight for quality, health care that provides a cure for Sickle Cell Warriors and their families.”“The Sickle Cell Disease Association of America is composed of 53 community-based organizations that do the challenging on-the-ground work of caring for sickle cell patients and their families who have been left behind by our health system. With the funding in this bill for the hub-and-spoke model of care, these organizations will be ready to help create a national infrastructure for sickle cell patients to get treatment wherever they are. I want to thank Senator Van Hollen, Senator Booker, Congressman Davis, and Congresswoman Lee for their hard work on the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Centers Act and their dedication to improving care and treatment for our sickle cell warriors,” said Regina Hartfield, President and CEO, Sickle Cell Disease Association of America.“Children's National Hospital and its Comprehensive Sickle Cell Disease Program enthusiastically support the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Centers Act of 2022. We believe this monumental healthcare legislation will benefit thousands of patients living with Sickle Cell Disease in the U.S. The network of 128 Treatment Centers and 110 community-based organizations will significantly mitigate the limited access to Sickle Cell Disease comprehensive care that many patients and families experience locally. The introduction of this legislation is a significant step in closing the health care disparities and addressing the unmet needs of Sickle Cell Disease patients and families,” said Andrew Campbell, MD, Director, Comprehensive Sickle Cell Disease Program, Children's National Hospital.This bill establishes a National Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Center Grant Program, authorized at $535 million annually, which will enable hospitals that offer SCD specialized care to partner with more accessible community health centers and outpatient centers to implement a hub-and-spoke framework for the delivery of care and treatment of patients with SCD. The medical hubs and spokes would be required to partner with community-based organizations to provide education, outreach, and help coordinate social services for patients. These networks will be equipped to provide patients with: ·             Comprehensive integrated care management for SCD, including primary care, specialized care, and mental health services;·             Sickle Cell trait testing and genetic counseling;·             Social work services as well as education on disease management to patients, caregivers, and providers; and·             Support navigating health insurance coverage and support with transportation to treatment centers.Additionally, the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Centers Act establishes a national coordinating center to work in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to oversee the hub-and-spoke networks as well as collect and distribute data, best practices, and other findings regarding the activities funded by the federal grants.This legislation has been endorsed by Sickle Cell Disease Association of America, American Society of Hematology, Sick Cells, Maryland Sickle Cell Disease Association, Sickle Cell Coalition of Maryland, Johns Hopkins Medicine, Children’s National Hospital, and Loma Linda University Children’s Hospital.“The American Society of Hematology (ASH) applauds Senator Van Hollen for introducing the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Centers Act of 2022, which calls for the establishment of a national network of medical and community-based centers to advance and meet the health care needs of people living with Sickle Cell Disease. As a Society with a long-standing commitment to improving care for individuals living with SCD, we are grateful for Senator Van Hollen’s dedication to addressing the burden of SCD and look forward to continuing to work with the Senator as the bill moves forward,” said ASH President Jane N. Winter, MD, of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine.“MSCDA couldn't be more pleased that the Senator is continuing his support of Sickle Cell Disease with the introduction of this important legislation! This is an exciting time for the Sickle Cell Disease community. Three new therapies have been approved since 2017, more therapies are in various stages of development and curative options such as bone marrow transplants are improving, and gene therapy is very promising. However, without a comprehensive model of care and services being in place, access to, and knowledge of, these advances will not be realized by many. Sen. Van Hollen’s Sickle Cell Treatment Centers Act of 2022 will address the glaring gap in comprehensive care that exists for Sickle Cell Disease. We are pleased to see that the Act would create a system of comprehensive care centers that will be essential to ensuring those living with sickle cell will have access to current and future treatments. We believe that an important aspect of the Act is that it not only will provide access to treatment centers but also to services provided by community based organizations. The Maryland Sickle Cell Disease Association (MSCDA) endorses, without hesitation, The Sickle Cell Treatment Centers Act because it is precisely what the sickle cell community needs right now so that those that those affected by this devastating disorder can have access to the treatments that will allow them to live their lives to their full potential,” said Derek Robertson, MBA, JD, CHC, President of the Maryland Sickle Cell Disease Association.You only have to see one child writhing in pain from sickle cell disease, to know what a historic missed opportunity it has been, to not have invested in “care and cure” for this dreadful condition that disproportionally affects the most disadvantaged group of people in the United States. The Sickle Cell Treatment Centers Act has the power to revolutionize access to care and aid in understanding the barriers that have made this disease so unassailable. It will address the unmet need in sickle cell disease care delivery, by supporting sickle cell centers to become centers of excellence, putting the focus on disease prevention and eradication as a unified nationwide network of treatment centers,” said Dr. Akshat Jain of Loma Linda University Children’s Hospital.“The Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Centers Act of 2022 offers a bold, new, system-wide approach to structuring comprehensive care for Sickle Cell Disease. For a community that has lacked full medical and social support, relevant data, and needed auxiliary services for so long, this legislation illustrates what stakeholders might achieve through a collaborative approach with dedicated funding,” said Ashley Valentine, President & Co-founder, Sick Cells. Text of the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Centers Act is here, and a one-page summary is available here."

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-abraham-accords-caucus-members-honor-two-year-anniversary-of-abraham-accords-signing,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) James Lankford (R-OK), Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) today honored the two-year anniversary of the historic signing of the Abraham Accords by introducing a resolution to commemorate the historic moment on September 15, 2020, for the US, Israel, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates. “Over the past two years, the Abraham Accords have promoted greater economic opportunity and security for Israel and the greater Middle East,” said Booker. “As co-chair of the Senate Abraham Accords Caucus, I remain committed to building on this achievement to bring new countries into the fold, foster meaningful people-to-people engagement, continue integrating the agreements within the region, including with Jordan, Egypt, and the Palestinians, and advance progress towards a negotiated two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.“Two years ago, I witnessed a historic moment among leaders from Israel, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates as President Trump held a White House signing of the once-thought-impossible Abraham Accords,” said Lankford. “Since then, we’ve added two other nations, Morocco and Sudan, to the Accords. As we build on that momentum together, we should remember that through reconciliation and common goals, even unlikely allies can find a way to come together. We continue to stand with Israel and should continue to lead in bringing nations together to further US national interests and the interests of our allies.”“The historic Abraham Accords have transformed the Middle East – paving the way for unprecedented cooperation between Israel and Arab partners in energy and water security, cybersecurity, defense, and trade,” said Rosen. “As we celebrate two years since this landmark agreement, I am proud to join my fellow Senate Abraham Accords Co-Chairs in introducing a bipartisan resolution to celebrate the Accords, call for their expansion and enhancement, and encourage other countries to normalize relations with Israel.”“The Abraham Accords was the most significant peace agreement of the 21st Century,” said Ernst. “This bipartisan measure seeks to honor the monumental effort achieved by the Trump administration in bringing together our Arab allies and Israel to forge an unprecedented and lasting peace deal that has made America and the world more secure. As co-chair of the Senate Abraham Accords Caucus, I remain committed to expanding upon the Abraham Accords and defending America, and our allies, from Iranian aggression.”The Senators launched the Senate Abraham Accords Caucus in order to build on the success of the historic Abraham Accords. For decades, Congress has played a key role in promoting peace between Israel and its neighbors. The Caucus provides an opportunity to strengthen the Abraham Accords by encouraging and partnerships among the existing Abraham Accords countries and expanding the agreement to include countries that do not currently have diplomatic relations with Israel.Earlier this year, the Senators introduced the DEFEND Act to establish an integrated air defense capability among Israel and Arab allies. The Senators also joined in a statement earlier this year following the signature into law of the Israel Relations Normalization Act, which builds on the success of the Abraham Accords by strengthening and expanding normalization and peace agreements between Israel and United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco, as well as previous agreement with Egypt and Jordan."
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-bennet-brown-delauro-delbene-torres-statement-on-extending-the-expanded-child-tax-credit-before-year-end,"Washington, D.C. – Today, as new data from the Census Bureau showed that child poverty dropped to a record low in 2021 in large part as a result of the expanded Child Tax Credit, U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), alongside U.S. Representatives Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.), and Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.), released the following statement:“Today’s Census data confirms that the expanded Child Tax Credit worked: it allowed the hard work of tens of millions of parents to pay off and helped them keep up with the cost of living, dramatically reducing child poverty and hunger. We should have never allowed this critical program to lapse, and we should not extend corporate tax breaks at the end of this year without also extending the expanded Child Tax Credit.”Today, the Census Bureau released new data demonstrating the profound impact the expanded Child Tax Credit had, enabling families to keep up with the cost of living and fighting poverty, hunger, and homelessness last year. New data reveals that:·         The child poverty rate fell from 9.7 percent to 5.2 percent between 2020 and 2021, a 46 percent decline in a single year. The child poverty rate is now the lowest on record.·         Without the American Rescue Plan’s CTC expansion, child poverty would have been 8.1% and more than 2 million additional children would have been in poverty."
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-announces-senate-introduction-of-legislation-to-close-gun-fire-sale-loophole,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) has introduced the Fire Sale Loophole Closing Act, legislation that would prevent gun dealers with revoked licenses from converting their firearm inventory into their personal collections and selling the weapons without conducting background checks. Companion legislation was introduced in the U.S. House earlier this year by Representative David Cicilline (D-RI-01). In 2020, there were 45,000 firearm-related deaths in the U.S. – their highest level in 40 years. According to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Americans are 25 times more likely to be killed in a gun homicide than in other high-income countries. “Though we have taken steps forward to prevent gun deaths, we cannot stop our work to address the gun violence epidemic that continues to grip our country,” said Senator Booker. “Closing the fire sale loophole is a commonsense measure that would help prevent firearms from being sold without background checks and ending up in the wrong hands.”The full text of the legislation can be viewed here."

The bulldozer has come to be a symbol of intimidation against Muslims and other religious minorities in India, and its inclusion in this event was wrong. New Jersey is proudly home to some of the most diverse communities in the nation, including one of the largest South Asian communities, and all ethnic and religious groups have a right to live without intimidation or fear.”"
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-releases-top-policy-priorities-for-white-house-conference-on-hunger-nutrition-and-health,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Ahead of the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) outlined his top policy objectives that have the potential to dramatically improve nutrition and reduce hunger and diet related diseases in the US. The Conference will be held on September 28, 2022 and is the largest whole-of-government initiative to improve the national food system in more than 50 years. Booker urged for better integration of Food as Medicine –programs that integrate the power of food to prevent and treat diet-related disease– into federal healthcare. “Our healthcare system largely ignores nutrition as a targeted opportunity for improving health and lowering healthcare spending, despite it being the top cause of poor health. Innovative new strategies can integrate nutrition and healthy eating for both treatment and prevention across federal healthcare programs,” wrote Sen. Booker in a letter to Ambassador Susan Rice. “Programs such as medically tailored meals and produce prescriptions should become covered benefits by Medicare, Medicaid and the Veterans Administration in order to prevent and manage chronic disease.”Additionally, Booker pushed for the Food and Drug Administration to use its existing legal authority to protect consumers. “Front-of-package labeling—such as warning labels or stoplights that signal to consumers if the food product is too high in salt, added sugar, or saturated fat—can promote more equitable access to nutrition information, encourage companies to reformulate their products to be healthier, and encourage healthier diets,” Booker noted. “The majority of sodium and added sugar intake in our diet come from ultra-processed foods. Very little progress will be made to improve our diet and reduce diet-related disease if ultra-processed foods go unchecked,” Booker continued. “In order to substantially reduce diet-related disease, the FDA should require mandatory reductions of excessive sodium and added sweeteners including sugars.” Booker also called upon President Biden to issue an Executive Order to require use of the Food Service Guidelines for Federal Facilities (FSG) for food and beverages sold and served at federally owned and operated facilities, which would ensure that healthy food is available on federal property. “Millions of people rely on federal food service operations, including federal employees, veterans in Veterans Affairs hospitals, members of the armed services, and people who are incarcerated in federal prisons,” Booker explained. “An executive order requiring the use of the FSG would change our government purchasing to improve health and reduce long-term healthcare costs. Procurement consistent with the FSG would also support healthy food purchases from independent family farmers and help address climate change. In addition, all federal agencies should make a vegetarian entrée available everywhere that federal government cafeterias are serving meals.”Sen. Booker worked with Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN) and U.S. Representatives James P. McGovern (D-MA) and Jackie Walorski (R-IN) on bipartisan, bicameral legislation (S.3064/H.R.5724) to help establish the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. In August, he hosted a listening session with New Jersey anti-hunger advocates, state officials, and agricultural stakeholders in advance of the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health scheduled for September.  Full text of the letter can be found here."
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-leads-colleagues-in-urging-cdc-and-hhs-to-monitor-and-address-racial-disparities-in-monkeypox-virus-response,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) led 11 colleagues in urging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to track and address racial disparities in the nation’s public health response to the monkeypox virus (MPV).“Similar to the COVID-19 outbreak, the U.S. monkeypox outbreak is disproportionately affecting Black and Latino Americans,” wrote the Senators in a letter to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. “At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, limited data/reporting on cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and tests disaggregated by race or ethnicity made it difficult to assess its implications across communities….Over time, federal, state and local data showed that the majority of COVID-19 cases and fatalities affected people of color, with most illnesses and deaths occurring in regions with higher percentages of Black and Latino populations.” “The devastating racial and ethnic disparities during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic underscored the underlying social, economic, and health inequality that has long existed within our health care system due to racial and discriminatory systemic and structural barriers, and the disparities began to narrow with targeted education, outreach, and resource distribution,” continued the Senators. The Senators highlighted that existing racial disparities and inequities in health outcomes and health care continue to be seen with the spread of MPV across the country. As of the end of July, Black and Latino people accounted for 26% and 32% of MPV cases with known race and ethnicity information, respectively. Public health experts have expressed concern over the fact that white men appear to be receiving a disproportionately higher share of the MPV vaccine nationally which is undermining efforts to safeguard communities that are more susceptible and have less access to medical resources. “Lack of racially and ethnically disaggregated data on both diagnosis and treatment of MPV will exacerbate existing health disparities and result in the loss of lives in vulnerable communities,” highlighted the Senators. The Senators noted that “Limited state data that is available shows that we are headed towards a concerning trend.” A report issued by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services shows that although 70% of MPV cases are in Black men, Black North Carolinians have received less than a quarter of the vaccinations so far. Similar trends are cited in the letter for New Jersey, Atlanta metro area, and Chicago. “Vaccine access must be equitable, even in the face of high demand,” urged the Senators. “Any federal targeted response and aid must not inadvertently stigmatize the ongoing public health crisis, but there should be intentional outreach to get resources to impacted communities. The implementation of a rapid and efficient vaccination program is essential to containing and eradicating MPV in communities across the United States. Collecting quality data is crucial to direct our vaccination and testing in the proper directions.”The letter was cosigned by Senators Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Ed Markey (D-MA), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Dr. Rev. Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Alex Padilla (D-CA), and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD). Full text of the letter can be found here. "
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-gillibrand-sanders-warren-markey-urge-epa-and-usda-to-limit-new-incentives-for-factory-farm-biodigesters,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Edward Markey (D-MA) warned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) against providing new electrification pathways under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for methane biogas from factory farms, and separately expressed concern about plans at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to rely heavily on methane digesters to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector.The Senators are specifically concerned that efforts at both agencies will increase the number of methane digesters used in industrial livestock operations, which will have unintended negative consequences for agriculture industry consolidation and for environmental justice.In a letter to EPA Administrator Regan, the Senators raise concerns about a forthcoming decision at the EPA regarding implementation of certain electrification pathways under the RFS. “One of the potential RFS electrification pathways could allow methane biogas from Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) to serve as a qualified feedstock and generate electric renewable identification numbers (e-RINs) under the RFS’ cellulosic mandate,” the Senators wrote. “While we appreciate this administration’s support for electric vehicles (EVs) and transportation electrification, we also urge EPA to ensure that this federal support does not come at the expense of environmental justice communities that are already overburdened with pollution.”In a separate letter to USDA Secretary Vilsack, the Senators requested additional information about the agency’s Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan for livestock emissions, which relies heavily on expanding the use of methane digesters on factory farms. “To our knowledge, USDA has not yet produced evidence that subsidizing manure digesters will reduce absolute emissions from the agriculture sector, which is the top source of U.S. methane emissions,” the Senators wrote. “Additionally, we remain concerned that USDA has not fully explored or produced evidence of the impacts of manure methane digesters on other key issues. These issues include co-pollutants of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), food system concentration, public health, and heightened community risks for rural, low-income, agricultural-dependent, and Black and Brown communities.”The letter to EPA can be viewed here and the USDA letter can be viewed here."
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-concludes-2022-jersey-summer-road-trip,"Newark, NJ – From visits to businesses to local farms, roundtable discussions to townhalls, press conferences to small business walks, U.S. Senator Cory Booker concluded his 2022 Jersey Summer Road Trip today. Over six days, Booker visited all 21 counties in New Jersey and highlighted his efforts to secure congressionally directed spending for critical New Jersey projects and organizations, his support of local industries, and his continued commitment to serving the state’s residents. Booker launched his tour in Stafford Township to discuss the On P.O.I.N.T. program, which provides on-site social workers for police departments to address the high volume of social service-related calls and incidents they receive. He then announced legislation that would expand the VA’s Supportive Services for Veteran Families program, which promotes housing stability among very low-income veteran families, to former members of the National Guard and Reserves.Booker hosted a listening session with New Jersey stakeholders to discuss food insecurity and hunger in New Jersey, the need to reform our nation’s food system, and the rising incidence of diet-related diseases. Booker will use the comments and feedback he received at the listening session, cohosted with New Jersey Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, for the upcoming White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health that he successfully secured funding for. Booker also announced over $1 million in federal grant money for Norwescap Food Bank to increase its capacity to distribute food and build a more modern facility. To close out his road trip, Booker hosted a roundtable discussion in Cumberland County to discuss the county’s work to implement community violence intervention strategies that aim to reduce and prevent gun violence. Booker has been a proponent of such strategies; in 2019, he introduced the Break the Cycle of Violence Act, legislation that would provide federal grants to communities for gun violence intervention and prevention programs designed to interrupt cycles of violence. Research has shown that a combination of community-oriented intervention programs and commonsense gun control policies can reduce gun violence rates.“Over the past days, I’ve had the chance to meet with advocates, elected officials, and residents of the Garden State who have graciously shared their feedback, concerns, and stories with me,” said Sen. Booker. “These conservations will stay with me and help me further advocate for our state as I return to Washington. It’s an honor to serve the people of New Jersey, and I know that together, we will address the unique challenges our state and nation faces.” "

He supported the designation of CREATES as a U.S. Department of Transportation Region 2 University Transportation Center, a program designed to address the need for safe, efficient, and environmentally sound transportation through the creation of partnerships between government and universities.“Partnerships between the federal government and institutes of higher learning are what drive our nation’s innovation and prosperity,” said Sen. Booker. “The students, professors, and leadership at Rowan University are working on groundbreaking projects—from rocket engine tests for NASA, to environmental studies for local governments, to research used in the aerospace and biomedical industries. I was proud to visit and see this research firsthand today.”“Rowan’s research capability will continue to impact the greater good for the citizens of our great state. We are extraordinarily grateful for the support and leadership of Senator Booker as we work together to address New Jersey’s—and our nation’s—challenges, particularly in areas of health, transportation, food production, and defense materials,” said Rowan University President Dr. Ali A. Houshmand. “With the help of state and federal legislatures, Rowan University is poised to transform higher education in the State of New Jersey and beyond. As the third fastest growing research institution in the country, we are well on our way toward our goal of becoming a top 100 research institution.“Pending accreditation, the Rowan University School of Veterinary Medicine will be the first in New Jersey,” continued President Houshmand. “Collaboration between the veterinary school, our two medical schools, the Henry M. Rowan College of Engineering, CREATEs, and industry partners puts Rowan in a strong position to deliver on our mission of expanding access to a quality, affordable education while also driving economic growth in the South Jersey region.”Today’s event was part of Booker’s 2022 Jersey Summer Road Trip, a series of stops highlighting the priorities he continues to fight for in the U.S. Senate on behalf of the state’s residents.

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-announces-senate-introduction-of-enslaved-voyages-memorial-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) has introduced the Enslaved Voyages Memorial Act, legislation that would authorize a memorial in Washington, D.C. commemorating enslaved individuals who were forcibly transported across the Atlantic. The legislation would specifically task the Georgetown African American Historic Landmark Project and Tour to establish a memorial honoring enslaved Africans who endured the Middle Passage. Companion legislation was introduced in the House earlier this year by Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC). By the 19th century, nearly 12 million enslaved Africans were forcibly transported across the Atlantic. The first enslaved Africans were brought to what would become the United States in late August 1619 – more than 400 years ago. “We must never forget the painful reality that millions of enslaved Africans were forcibly transported to this land over hundreds of years of our history,” said Senator Booker. “Although I rejoice in our progress, our nation still has a long way to go to reckon with and overcome the dark legacy of slavery and the violence and injustice that has persisted since its end. I am honored to join Representative Norton and introduce this legislation that will commemorate, honor, and celebrate the contributions of these enslaved people and help ensure that their stories are never forgotten.” “Thank you to Senator Booker for introducing the Senate companion to my bill in the House, which passed the Committee on Natural Resources in January,” Norton said. “This bill, to authorize the establishment of a memorial on federal land in D.C. to honor enslaved persons, would honor enslaved persons’ presence, celebrate their contributions to history and recognize their resilience and fortitude. Let us honor the personhood of these individuals, who were repeatedly assumed to have none, so that they will never be forgotten.” The full text of the legislation can be viewed here."

Unfortunately, MPV testing efforts have been hampered by processing challenges that have resulted in underreporting and a lack of data to help the federal government allocate resources appropriately. In addition, implementation of a rapid and efficient mass vaccination program is essential to containing and eradicating MPV in communities across New Jersey and the United States.”Although New York has received additional doses on top of their standard population size allocation, New Jersey has yet to receive the basic allocation for the state’s expected disease burden. The lawmakers requested that New Jersey receives its “fair share on behalf of New Jersey residents” and “additional allocation given [its] interwoven relationship with Philadelphia and New York City.” Booker and Sherrill also urged Secretary Becerra to ensure that “[a]ny federal response and aid directed to the LGBTQ+ community must not inadvertently stigmatize the ongoing public health crisis, but there should be targeted outreach to get resources to impacted communities.” The lawmakers concluded by reiterating their call for an increase in “testing and vaccine availability for the State of New Jersey given the disproportionate risk faced by residents and visitors.”Full text of the letter can be found here.Christian Fuscarino, Executive Director of Garden State Equality, a New Jersey organization dedicated to lifting up the diverse voices of LGBTQ+ communities, applauded Booker and Sherrill for the letter, stating, “We must ensure that high-risk populations and communities that face barriers to healthcare have easier access to vaccinations. We commend Senator Cory Booker and Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill for educating our federal partners on why New Jersey must receive a similar percentage of vaccine allocation as our neighbors in New York City and Philadelphia. Their voices are invaluable at this critical time.”Booker and Sherrill hosted a townhall on Monday with members of the LGBTQ+ community. The event was part of Booker’s 2022 Jersey Summer Road Trip, a series of stops highlighting the priorities he continues to fight for in the U.S. Senate on behalf of the state’s residents.

The visit comes just weeks after Booker introduced a resolution celebrating the achievements of Muslims living in the United States and designating July as Muslim-American Heritage Month.“Last month, I was proud to introduce a resolution that recognized the diverse contributions that Muslim Americans have made to American life,” said Sen. Booker. “The Muslim-owned small businesses in the heart of Paterson offer powerful examples of these contributions. The owners, employees, and community leaders I met strengthen our local economy, perform essential work in the community, and add to the richness and vibrancy of our state.” “Thank you to Senator Cory Booker for visiting our small businesses here in Paterson,” said Mayor André Sayegh. “As a former big city Mayor, Senator Booker understands and appreciates the importance of growing our small business community.”“It was great having Senator Booker in the 6th Ward visiting with Muslim small business owners,” said Councilman Alaa Abdelaziz. “Community-owned small businesses are the backbone of our city’s economy and provide essential services and local jobs.”The event was part of Booker’s 2022 Jersey Summer Road Trip, a series of stops highlighting the priorities he continues to fight for in the U.S. Senate on behalf of the state’s residents.

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-menendez-announce-446-million-for-union-city-bus-garage-and-terminal-project,"Newark, NJ – Today, U.S. Senators Cory Booker and Bob Menendez (both D-NJ) announced $44,677,500 in Federal Transit Administration (FTA) funding for the Union City Garage and Bus Terminal Reconstruction Project. The funding will allow for the rehabilitation of Union City’s 75-year-old garage to make the facility suitable for bus storage and includes the addition of a bus terminal to improve connectivity for the city’s 70,000 residents. The proposed garage and terminal will be capable of supporting battery-electric buses, which is a critical part of NJ TRANSIT’s Garage Modernization Program and consistent with the agency’s goal of achieving a zero-emissions fleet by 2040. Booker wrote a letter to FTA Administrator Nuria Fernandez in support of the project last month.  “This federal grant is a win for our economy and public health: it will lead to the replacement of older buses with new, electric ones, reduce air pollution in communities, and bolster New Jersey’s transportation system in one of the most densely populated areas of our state,” said Sen. Booker. “Over the past months, New Jersey has embarked on initiatives to improve its infrastructure, and this investment continues our efforts to enhance public transportation for commuters. I was proud to secure this funding and look forward to seeing the impact that it makes in our state.” “This federal grant will help modernize our state’s public transportation system, increase service for commuters, and improve air quality for residents in Union City and the surrounding area,” said Sen. Menendez. “Investing in green buses and the infrastructure to support them, benefits public health, strengthens our economy, reduces our dependence on fossil fuels, and creates a healthier environment for our families. As a former mayor of Union City, I recognize the critical importance of this modernization project and appreciate the Biden Administration for their commitment to ensuring we have the resources to create a greener, cleaner New Jersey.” ""The Union City Bus Garage Reconstruction project is a critical step in advancing NJ TRANSIT’s Bus Modernization Program on our way to a 100 percent zero-emissions bus fleet by 2040,” said NJ TRANSIT President & CEO Kevin S. Corbett. “NJ TRANSIT is grateful to the FTA for this significant grant award, which will allow us to transform a structure that’s currently unfit for bus maintenance and storage, into a state-of-the-art facility supporting up to 60 battery-electric buses. We’re also thankful for the continued support and advocacy for funding from Senator Menendez, Senator Booker and the NJ Congressional Delegation, as well as our partnership with Union City Mayor Brian Stack.”"

Booker was a strong supporter of the American Recue Plan that ensured the financial security of local communities in New Jersey during the COVID-19 pandemic.Hunterdon County received $250,000 from the American Rescue Plan to accelerate tourism in the county. The funding was used to support the Explore Hunterdon initiative, which invites visitors from the greater Northeast region to the county and experience the county’s vineyards, breweries, farms, historic downtowns, and restaurants.“As today’s roundtable discussion highlighted, the American Rescue Plan Act has been a lifeline to local communities that were struggling due to the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Sen. Booker. “With this funding, Hunterdon County has been able to build a stronger, more resilient economy that promotes tourism to the region and highlights the many local sites in the area, from natural trails to museums, vineyards, and restaurants. I was proud to vote for the American Rescue Plan and am encouraged to see the lasting impact that it is having for our state.”“As a Hunterdon resident, I am grateful to have helped deliver resources through the American Rescue Plan to support our local economy and ensure everyone can experience Hunterdon County’s natural beauty and unique history,” said Representative Tom Malinowski (D-NJ-07)“As a mayor of a small community that has benefitted directly from the ARP funding that Senator Booker fought for we are grateful to have the opportunity to share with him how those funds are creating opportunities in Hunterdon county through the tourism initiative our county commissioners supported,” said Janice Kovach, Mayor of the Town of Clinton.“I was grateful for the opportunity to welcome Sen. Booker to Hunterdon County and talk about issues important to the local economy, such as tourism, and to showcase the county’s new tourism initiative,” said John Lanza, Director of the Hunterdon County Board of Commissioners.“As Hunterdon County looks to find sustainable avenues for economic development, tourism tops the list of viable options. Hunterdon County offers the perfect platform to share quintessential agro-tourism and heritage tourism options,”said Paul Muir, Mayor of Bethlehem Township and Executive Director of the Red Mill Museum Village, a popular tourist attraction and site of today’s roundtable. “The additional support and funding from ARP supported by Senator Booker will prove beneficial as Hunterdon County creates more awareness of our tourism experiences.”Today’s event was part of Booker’s 2022 Jersey Summer Road Trip, a series of stops highlighting the priorities he continues to fight for in the U.S. Senate on behalf of the state’s residents.

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-coughlin-host-nj-listening-session-ahead-of-white-house-conference-on-hunger-nutrition-and-health,"New Brunswick, NJ – Today, U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) and New Jersey General Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin hosted a listening session with New Jersey anti-hunger advocates, state officials, and agricultural stakeholders in advance of the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health scheduled for next month. The roundtable discussion highlighted food insecurity and hunger in New Jersey, the need to reform our nation’s food system, and the rising incidence of diet-related diseases. A recent report found that one in 12 New Jersey households experienced food insecurity from 2018 to 2020 and that chronic health conditions resulting from food insecurity cost New Jersey about $1.3 billion each year. Nationally, the number of people under the age of 20 living with Type-II diabetes grew by 95% from 2001 to 2017, with the greatest increases seen in Black and Hispanic youth.Earlier this year, Booker successfully fought to secure funding for a second White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. The first such conference was held more than 50 years ago in 1969, culminating in the creation and expansion of programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and the National School Breakfast and Lunch Program. The purpose of the second conference is to take a whole-of-government approach to ending hunger and combatting nutrition insecurity, featuring diverse stakeholders such as independent family farmers and ranchers, health care professionals, and anti-hunger advocates.“The second White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health provides us with the opportunity to create a roadmap to reform America’s failed food policies that have left Americans without access to affordable, nutritious foods and have caused an explosion of diet-related diseases,” said Sen. Booker. “To achieve success, it’s incredibly important that we bring together stakeholders of different backgrounds who are on the frontlines of the dual hunger and nutrition crises that are impacting millions of Americans. I am grateful for the government leaders, anti-hunger activists, and medical professionals who shared their perspectives at today’s listening session. Their experiences are vital ahead of next month’s White House Conference, and I look forward to incorporating them as I work with President Biden and the White House to develop comprehensive solutions so that all people have equitable access to healthy food options.”“Right now, far too many in our country and across the great state of New Jersey grapple with food insecurity. More than a governmental obligation, we have a moral obligation to make sure people are able to access healthy and nutritious foods which in turn empowers them to lead successful and fulfilling lives,” said New Jersey Assembly Speaker Craig J. Coughlin. “Addressing the challenges of food access caused by food deserts, strengthening critical federal food aid programs like school meals, and supporting emergency feeding organizations and food banks in their work to sustain communities are just some of the comprehensive and multidimensional strategies we have employed as a state to ensure people’s most basic food needs are met. There is more work to do and, by sharing New Jersey’s perspective and successes in this area, it is my hope we help ignite the conversation at the national level to produce a blueprint for meaningful change and action toward food security.”“I am proud to take part in the listening session today on hunger with Speaker Coughlin and Senator Cory Booker,” said Assemblyman Roy Freiman. “Hunger has long been a growing crisis in our State affecting many New Jersey families and seniors in every community. Today with experts, advocates, and lawmakers together at a table, we worked to uncover the next actionable step we can take toward ending hunger in New Jersey.”“Rutgers is happy to welcome our state and federal partners in the effort to address food and nutrition issues,” said Jonathan Holloway, President of Rutgers University. “The leadership of Sen Booker and Speaker Coughlin on these issues is as important as it is impressive. These are critical issues as we all work to make New Jersey one of the best places to live, work and learn.”Additional quotes from attendees at today’s listening session can be found here.Last month, Booker invited New Jerseyans to share feedback for the upcoming White House conference. More than 60 New Jersey anti-hunger advocates, state and local officials, medical professionals, direct service providers, family farmers, agricultural stakeholders, and people who have personally experienced the impact of hunger, food insecurity, or diet-related illness submitted comments which Booker directly shared with the White House. Today’s event was also part of Booker’s 2022 Jersey Summer Road Trip, a series of stops highlighting the priorities he continues to fight for in the U.S. Senate on behalf of the state’s residents.

Booker was also a vocal advocate for opening the first MBDA regional office in New Jersey. As a result of these efforts, The Enterprise Center, which has a longstanding history of supporting Black-owned businesses, was selected to operate New Jersey’s first MBDA located in Camden, NJ.  “At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly half of Black-owned small businesses were forced to shut down—some permanently,” said Sen. Booker. “Yet, even before the public health emergency, deep-seated inequities, including barriers to capital and business development, prevented Black entrepreneurs from starting or expanding their business. That’s why I’ve fought in the Senate as a member of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship to expand access to capital and critical resources to Black business owners. Today’s discussion highlighted the ongoing challenges these entrepreneurs face and underscored the importance of our continued advocacy for them.”  “Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and our community. Today with Senator Booker, we got to hear from black businesses owners in Willingboro about their aspirations and how we can best support them,” said Congressman Andy Kim. “From ATAP to Glam Bar, to Seafood Heaven, these businesses and their owners make our community a better place. I look forward to continuing these conversations alongside my friend Senator Booker to make sure we’re looking out for our small businesses, cutting government red tape, and getting them the support they need to keep Willingboro and surrounding communities’ economies strong.” Today’s event was part of Booker’s 2022 Jersey Summer Road Trip, a series of stops highlighting the priorities he continues to fight for in the U.S. Senate on behalf of the state’s residents.

Norwescap will use the funding to increase its capacity to distribute food by 33 percent and build a new, more modern facility.Norwescap is one of the largest food banks in New Jersey and receives food through federal and state funding, private donations, and partnerships with supermarkets and private organizations. It currently distributes nearly 1.7 million meals annually and also provides financial literacy, employment, housing, nutrition, and other services to people in Warren, Hunterdon, Morris, Somerset, and Sussex Counties. There are more than 62,000 people living below the poverty line within Norwescap’s service area, and 120,000 households that struggle to cover basic expenses.Booker announces $1 million for Norwescap Food Bank “For so many food-insecure and low-income people, Norwescap is a beacon of hope, offering daily meals as well as critical support services that put them on the path to achieving success,” said Sen. Booker. “I was proud to fight on behalf of this organization and secure more than $1 million in federal funding that will help Norwescap expand its vital operations and provide more than 800,000 more meals each year to people and families in need.”“Having Senator Booker’s help to secure this grant opens up amazing opportunities for Norwescap to expand our efforts to fight hunger, but more importantly it will be life changing for the tens-of-thousands of people for whom we provide vital, life-sustaining support every year,” said Mark Valli, Chief Executive Officer of Norwescap. “Not one person in New Jersey—the Garden State—should ever go hungry, and thanks to the Senator’s support, Norwescap will be in a better position to make sure that we live up to that goal for the people of northwestern New Jersey.”“USDA Rural Development works hand in hand with Norwescap, a key stakeholder and partner, to invest in and improve the quality of life for rural communities and residents in Northwest New Jersey,” said Jane Asselta, New Jersey State Director, USDA Rural Development. “NORWESCAP, as a non-profit, and USDA Rural Development, a Federal entity, each support food pantries and food access, educational programs that can lead to employment, financial literacy and affordable housing, healthcare delivery, and services for seniors and disabled individuals. I am proud to be here today to honor their accomplishments and their continued success as a champion for the underserved throughout our rural counties.”Booker’s 2022 Jersey Summer Road Trip is a series of stops highlighting the priorities he continues to fight for in the U.S. Senate on behalf of the state’s residents. The road trip will focus on Booker’s ongoing commitment to serving New Jersey’s veterans, his efforts to secure congressionally directed spending for critical New Jersey projects and organizations, and his support of local businesses and industries, among other things."
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-announces-legislation-to-expand-vas-ssvf-program-to-national-guardsmen-and-reservists,"Newton, NJ – Today, U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) announced legislation to expand the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) program, which promotes housing stability among very low-income veteran families who reside in or are transitioning to permanent housing. The Supportive Services for Reserve Component Veterans and Families Act would expand SSVF eligibility to former members of the National Guard and Reserves who have retired or separated from service after having served a term of enlistment.Established in 2011, the SSVF program has helped decrease veteran homelessness by 50% and assisted 850,000 veterans and their family members by permanently housing, rapidly rehousing, or preventing them from becoming homeless. However, under the program’s current guidelines, many former members of the National Guard and Reserve Component, who were not activated for federal active duty military service while serving, are ineligible for the program. Booker announced the bill at Sussex County Community College, alongside SSVF providers.Booker with advocates at the bill announcement. “The SSVF program has proven to be a tremendous success, helping thousands of veterans and their families find quality, affordable housing,” said Sen. Booker. “Yet, former members of the National Guard and Reserves are often ineligible to access the benefits of this program despite the critical role they played in protecting our nation and serving our communities. With this legislation, we will ensure that we honor our commitment to those who have served and sacrificed for our country by finally expanding eligibility of the SSVF program to national guardsmen, reservists, and their families.”“The National Coalition for Homeless Veterans (NCHV) applauds Sen. Cory Booker for introducing the Supportive Services for Reserve Component Veterans and Families Act. Those who served in the National Guard and Military Reserve have been ineligible for many benefits when not federally activated. This important legislation would remove this barrier to entry from the Department of Veteran Affairs' Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) program,” NCHV CEO Kathryn Monet stated. ""NCHV thanks Senator Booker for expanding access to SSVF for veterans of both the Guard and Reserve, bringing us one step closer to achieving our mission of ending veteran homelessness.""“Our National Guard and Reserve are at the forefront when crisis hits,” said Dave Pearson, Assistant Director of Veteran Services for Catholic Family & Community Services in the Diocese of Paterson and Co-Chair of the New Jersey SOS Veteran Stakeholder Group. “Whether it’s a flood, hurricane or national emergency, it’s always our citizen soldiers who answer the call and respond to the need. We support Senator Booker’s initiative in extending SSVF emergency housing services to our National Guard and Reserve people. Creating a safeguard for the families of these state heroes if they are in jeopardy of losing their homes is a small request for those who give so much to our communities in our most trying times.”“Soldier On supports efforts to expand the existing SSVF grant eligibility guidelines to include low-income veterans of the National Guard and their families,” said Bruce Buckley, Chief Executive Officer of Soldier On. “Service members should never be in a position where they are homeless or at-risk of homelessness. By expanding SSVF grant eligibility we can ensure that an even larger portion of our veteran population can access housing stabilization services in their local communities.” “The Veterans Multi-Service Center (VMC) is proud to support the expansion of SSVF eligibility to many National Guardsmen and Reservists who are in need of these valuable services,” said Peter R. Wine, SSVF Program Manager, The Veterans Multi-Service Center. “The current proposal is a more equitable solution for the men and women who have served our country and the VMC is prepared to meet Senator Booker’s call to action.”“Retired and separated National Guardsmen often face the same housing challenges as their former active-component brothers and sisters, yet many are ineligible for help from of the VA’s Supportive Services for Veteran Families program,” said retired Brig. Gen.  J. Roy Robinson, President of the National Guard Association of the United States. “We applaud Senator Booker for this bill that would correct this longstanding inequity.”  In addition to expanding eligibility of the SSVF program, the legislation would also require the Secretary of Defense to submit an annual report to Congress detailing food and housing insecurity experienced by current reserve component service members, across all seven components of the Reserves and National Guard.Full text of the legislation can be found here. Booker will formally introduce the bill when the Senate returns to session after Labor Day.Today’s event was part of Booker’s 2022 Jersey Summer Road Trip, a series of stops highlighting the priorities he continues to fight for in the U.S. Senate on behalf of the state’s residents.

The museum also highlights the history of Cape May as a crucial stop on the Underground Railroad and a center of abolitionist activity.Booker at the Harriet Tubman Museum of New Jersey“Harriet Tubman is a personal hero of mine and was a harbinger of hope for many,” said Sen. Booker. “Even after securing her own freedom, Tubman led hundreds of other people held as slaves out of bondage, a testament to her unfathomable courage and righteous calling. I am proud to see her incredible life memorialized at this museum and am grateful for the stakeholders and members of the community who led a grassroots effort to preserve the rich history of the African American community in Cape May and New Jersey’s legacy as a beacon of freedom.”“Senator Booker has been an important supporter of the Harriet Tubman Museum of New Jersey since its inception,” said Cynthia Mullock, Executive Director of the Harriet Tubman Museum of New Jersey. “Considering his own inspiring advocacy for issues of social justice and human dignity, we are thrilled to have the opportunity to share Harriet Tubman's time in Cape May, the narratives of the abolitionist community who supported her, and our ""small museum with a big story"" with him today.”Booker’s 2022 Jersey Summer Road Trip features a series of events spanning the Garden State that will highlight the priorities he continues to fight for in the Senate on behalf of state residents."
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-kim-discuss-on-point-program-with-ocean-county-police-departments-and-medical-professionals,"Stafford Township, NJ – Today, U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Representative Andy Kim (D-NJ-03) joined the Stafford Police Department, Bright Harbor Health Care, and seven area police departments to highlight the On P.O.I.N.T. program, which provides on-site social workers for police departments to address the high volume of mental health, substance abuse, and social service-related calls and incidents that police receive. Booker and Kim secured $32,000 in congressionally directed funding to expand the On P.O.I.N.T. program this year.Since its establishment in 2016, On P.O.I.N.T. has expanded to include nine total police departments. The program provides early intervention by diverting individuals experiencing mental health crises from the criminal justice system into the appropriate health care system. During the meeting, Booker and Kim discussed the challenges that police departments and medical providers have faced while responding to these incidents and the success of the innovative program.“As law enforcement officers have often told me, police departments are overburdened responding to distressful calls that involve issues related to mental illness, addiction, or poverty,” said Sen. Booker. “Appropriately addressing these challenges requires the expertise of social workers, medical professionals, and mental health experts. With the On P.O.I.N.T program, police departments are receiving the support they need to help the most vulnerable. I am proud to have fought alongside Rep. Any Kim for funding to expand this vital initiative and was grateful to hear from stakeholders today about their experiences implementing and using the program.” “Our police officers are the first ones to answer the call when we are in danger and it's up to us to make sure they have the resources they need to continue doing this important work,” said Congressman Andy Kim. “I'm proud to have worked with Senator Booker to secure funding for Stafford Police Department to expand their successful and innovative On P.O.I.N.T. partnership with Bright Harbor Healthcare to include Barnegat Police Department. Together, our local police and mental health professionals are improving outcomes, reducing violence, having safer interactions, and improving community relations.”“There has been a gap between how law enforcement and the mental health and substance use treatment systems have interacted with each other—we both try to help the same community members, however we have often not communicated with each other or worked in concert,” said Meghan Corrigan, co-creator of the On P.O.I.N.T. at Bright Harbor Healthcare. “The On P.O.I.N.T. program was intentionally designed to address the gap between law enforcement's initial observation and triage of a crisis to long term treatment and support to resolve the underlying cause of the crisis.”“I thank both Senator Booker and Congressman Kim for their continued support of the On P.O.I.N.T. program,” said Thomas Dellane, Stafford Township Police Chief. “Their advocacy on behalf of the program has enabled On P.O.I.N.T. staff to effectuate positive change in many people’s lives thereby improving the mental and physical health of communities that On P.O.I.N.T. serves.”Today’s event was part of Booker’s 2022 Jersey Summer Road Trip, a series of stops highlighting the priorities he continues to fight for in the U.S. Senate on behalf of the state’s residents.

Booker fought to secure funding for the conference, the first such gathering in more than 50 years aimed at combating hunger and reducing diet-related diseases. “In years past, the Summer Road Trip allowed me to meet directly with New Jerseyans and listen to their concerns so that I could effectively serve them in the Senate,” said Sen. Booker. “I’m excited to once again travel across our state to hear from as many residents as possible. These events and conversations will help us develop solutions to the unique challenges our state faces.” Booker’s 2022 Jersey Summer Road Trip is scheduled to begin Monday, August 8th, with several stops in South Jersey.

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-statement-on-senate-passage-of-inflation-reduction-act,"Washington, D.C. -- U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) issued the following statement:“Today, Senate Democrats took a historic step forward to reduce consumer costs, combat climate change, and implement a fairer tax code by passing the Inflation Reduction Act – all while reducing the deficit.“With commonsense reforms that will allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices and cap out-of-pocket costs, we will protect seniors from outrageous prices charged by pharmaceutical companies for lifesaving medications. This bill also provides an additional three years of Affordable Care Act subsidies which will lower health care premiums for millions of Americans. We will also make the largest-ever Congressional investment to address the threat of climate change, moving our country toward cleaner energy production and reducing carbon emissions by roughly 40% within the decade. All of this will occur without increasing taxes on middle and lower-income families and individuals; instead, the biggest corporations will finally pay a fairer share.“Importantly, the Inflation Reduction Act also invests $60 billion for environmental justice priorities, which will address legacy pollution, reduce air pollution in overburdened communities, and provide federal assistance to low-income consumers to make their homes more energy efficient. As a co-chair of the Senate Environmental Justice Caucus, I am proud to have championed these initiatives. I also recognize that Black and Brown communities, like my home city of Newark, require additional investments to equitably transition to a clean energy economy, and to ensure that clean air and clean water are not a privilege for some but a right for all. I remain committed to fighting on behalf of these underserved and disadvantaged communities.“This bill will reduce costs for Americans and fight inflation.  I am proud to have voted for it, and I urge the House to pass it swiftly.”"
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-urges-epa-to-regulate-seeds-coated-with-neonicotinoids-and-other-insecticides,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) urged the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate insecticide-coated seeds under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).“Neonicotinoids are powerful insecticides that have been linked to pollinator declines and harm to aquatic ecosystems and water quality,” wrote Sen. Booker in a letter to EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan. “Neonicotinoids pose an acute risk to bees and contribute to bees’ high mortality rates and collapsing populations. And by poisoning aquatic insects in water bodies, neonicotinoids eliminate food sources for fish, birds, and other wildlife.” One of the leading sources of neonicotinoids in the environment are pesticide-coated seeds that shed their insecticide into the surrounding air, soil, and water. As Booker highlights, “this planting season, almost every field corn seed, about half of soybeans, and nearly all cotton seeds planted will be coated with neonicotinoids. This means that at least 150 million acres of cropland in the United States will be planted with neonicotinoid insecticides.”  Despite the widespread use of neonicotinoid coated seeds, the benefits to farmers are minimal. For example, “Neonicotinoid seed treatments offer soybean plants a maximum of three weeks of protection and do not protect against major pests that arise later in the bloom stages of the soybean….Additionally neonicotinoids can have a counter-productive effect by killing beneficial insects that prey on agricultural pests and overuse can lead to the rise of insecticide-resistant pests.”The EPA currently has no regulations regarding the disposal of unused pesticide-treated seeds. “The lack of oversight by EPA on disposal of these toxic seeds has led to an ongoing environmental and public health disaster in Mead, Nebraska,” continues Booker.Given the detrimental impact of neonicotinoid-coated seeds on the environment and their limited benefit, Booker ends by urging the “EPA to end the massive overuse and abuse of neonicotinoid coated seeds in the United States” and urges the EPA to grant a petition that would ensure pesticide-coated seeds are regulated like other insecticides.  Full text of the letter can be found here."

Booker. “I fought to ensure this funding was included and am grateful for the organizations, community leaders, and elected officials who joined together to advance these vital initiatives.

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-menendez-outline-wins-for-new-jersey-in-major-funding-bill,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Cory Booker and Bob Menendez (both D-NJ) today voted to approve the $1.5 trillion Fiscal Year 2022 government funding bill which provides significant investments in transportation, housing and education for New Jersey. Sens. Booker and Menendez also fought to secure federal funding in the bill designed exclusively for community projects across the state. The package also includes $13.6 billion in emergency funding to assist Ukraine and NATO allies.“Tonight, the Senate passed a historic, bipartisan government funding bill that will help address the biggest challenges we face at home and abroad. This legislation invests in the American people, helps reduce rising costs, and will create good-paying jobs. We will increase funding for schools and Head Start programs, provide pay raises for our troops, improve health and nutrition, unlock more federal money to invest in our country’s crumbling infrastructure, and take steps toward building a more equitable country. The bill also provides much-needed humanitarian and security aid to the people of Ukraine as they fight to defend their democracy after Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion,” said Sen. Booker. “I am disappointed that this bill does not provide sufficient funding to address the global famine crisis that is threatening the lives of tens of millions of people, including millions of children, around the globe. In addition, in the midst of a global pandemic, I am also deeply disappointed that continued funding for COVID-19 relief was cut from this bill. I hope that the Senate will come together and pass urgently needed funding to continue the fight to keep Americans healthy and COVID at bay.”“Not every day we have an opportunity to secure billions of dollars in critical federal funding for programs to support hardworking families, protect communities, and ensure every child has a chance to succeed. The funding bill crafted by Democrats and passed by the Senate today will create good-paying jobs, lower costs, and tackle some of the most pressing issues facing New Jersey families such as access to child care and higher education, affordable housing, and reliable and safe transportation. At the same time, we’re sending a strong message of support to Ukraine and our allies by providing humanitarian and security aid at the time they need it the most,” said Sen. Menendez. “And while I’m disappointed in the Republicans’ refusal to provide additional funding for COVID-19 response efforts to support state and local governments reeling from the effects of the pandemic, I will continue to push my colleagues to pass this funding in a separate bipartisan effort as quickly as possible.” The FY22 funding bill includes:NJ Community Projects Funding Secured by Sens.

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-applauds-senate-passage-of-the-emmett-till-antilynching-act,"Washington D.C. -- U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) issued the following statement:“After 200 failed attempts and over a century’s worth of efforts, I am proud to say that Congress has finally passed legislation to criminalize lynching, a shameful instrument of terror used to intimidate and oppress Black Americans. During the 19th and 20th centuries, more than 4,000 African-American men, women, and children were lynched and between 1936 and 1938, the national headquarters of the NAACP hung a flag with the words ‘A man was lynched yesterday’, solemn reminders of the dark eddies of our nation’s past. Although no legislation will reverse the pain and fear felt by those victims, their loved ones, and Black communities, this legislation is a necessary step America must take to heal from the racialized violence that has permeated its history.                        “I first introduced legislation to make lynching a federal crime in 2018. Over the years, I have been proud to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure this bill passes Congress and heads to the President’s desk. The bipartisan support this bill has achieved underscores the importance of meeting this moment, of reckoning with the past, and of finally being able to say that we did the right thing.”  In 2018, Booker and then-Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) first introduced antilynching legislation and subsequently helped lead its unanimous passagein February 2019. After the effort stalled, Booker reintroduced the Emmett Till Antilynching Act last month to create a specific offense for lynching under existing federal hate crime statues.In 1900, Congressman George Henry White of North Carolina introduced the first of what would ultimately become a series of more than 200 congressional bills that attempted to make a federal crime. Ninety members of the U.S. Senate passed a bipartisan resolution in 2005 apologizing to the victims of lynching for the repeated failure of the Senate to enact anti-lynching legislation. These senators expressed their deepest sympathies and most solemn regrets of the Senate to the descendants of victims of lynching, the ancestors of whom were deprived of life, human dignity, and the constitutional protections accorded all citizens of the United States.Full text of the Emmett Till Antilynching Act can be found here.

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/as-house-passes-anti-lynching-act-booker-scott-introduce-companion-bill-in-senate-to-make-lynching-a-federal-crime,"Washington D.C. -- Today, U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Tim Scott (R-SC) introduced legislation to make lynching a federal crime. Booker and Scott, along with then-Senator Kamala Harris, first launched their effort to make lynching a federal crime in 2018.Named after Emmett Till, a 14-year old boy who was brutally lynched in 1955, the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act would amend the United States Code to specify that lynching is a crime that warrants an enhanced sentence under existing federal hate crime statues. Companion legislation was introduced in the House by Rep. Bobby Rush (D-IL-1) and is expected to pass the chamber today.“Between 1936 and 1938, the national headquarters of the NAACP hung a flag with the words ‘A man was lynched yesterday’, a solemn reminder of the reality Black Americans experienced daily during some of the darkest chapters of America’s history,” said Sen. Booker. “Used by white supremacists to oppress and subjugate Black communities, lynching is a form of racialized violence that has permeated much of our nation’s past and must now be reckoned with. To that end, I am proud to introduce this legislation to help us acknowledge the pain caused by lynchings and make the shameful practice a federal crime. Although this bill will not undo the terror and fear of the past, it’s a necessary step that our nation must take to move forward.”""While we cannot erase our nation's past, we can work toward a better future for all Americans,"" said Sen. Scott. ""The Emmett Till Anti-lynching Act will do just that. This long-overdue piece of legislation sends a clear message: We will not tolerate hatred and violence against our fellow Americans.""“It's important that our nation affirm its commitment to rejecting lawlessness, violence and bigotry,” said Bryan Stevenson, founder and Executive Director of the Equal Justice Initiative. “It's as important today as it was decades ago which makes the bill timely and urgent.”The efforts to pass anti-lynching legislation date back to 1918 when Congressman Leonidas C. Dyer (R-MO) became the first member of Congress to introduce a bill on the issue. His bill, intended to punish authorities who failed to prevent lynching, ultimately died in the Senate after facing stiff opposition. After 200 failed attempts by Congress to pass anti-lynching legislation, Congress is now prepared to criminalize lynching as an instrument of terror and intimidation used against more than 4,000 African-African men, women, and children during the late 19th and 20th centuries, according to data from the Equal Justice InitiativeIn 2019, Booker, Scott, and then-Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) led unanimous passage of an earlier version of the legislation on the Senate floor. That motion passed, marking a historic step towards the first federal anti-lynching law in the United States.In 2005, 90 members of the U.S. Senate passed a bipartisan resolution apologizing to the victims of lynching for the repeated failure of the Senate to enact anti-lynching legislation. These senators expressed their deepest sympathies and most solemn regrets of the Senate to the descendants of victims of lynching, the ancestors of whom were deprived of life, human dignity, and the constitutional protections accorded all citizens of the United States.Full text of the legislation can be found here.The Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act is supported by: Equal Justice Initiative, The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, National Action Network, National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, Black Women's Roundtable, Anti-Defamation League, and the National Urban League."
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-statement-on-the-nomination-of-judge-ketanji-brown-jackson-to-the-united-states-supreme-court,"Washington, DC -- U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, issued the following statement:“I’m deeply grateful to President Biden for conducting a rigorous and thorough process to determine his first Supreme Court nominee. He clearly found the best person for the job.“I’m so impressed with Judge Jackson’s exemplary career, particularly her experience as a public defender -- a deeply important role in our justice system that no one who’s ever served on the Supreme Court has experience doing. This kind of occupational diversity is badly needed on our nation’s highest court, and helps root Judge Jackson in the reality that the Court’s decisions have on people’s lives -- especially those without great wealth and privilege.“This is a Jackie Robinson moment for our nation. For generations America has been blessed with extraordinary legal talent in people of all backgrounds, but for the first time in our history an extraordinarily talented Black woman will serve on the Supreme Court. I’m profoundly moved by this; my heart aches with joy. I’m committed to doing everything possible to make sure that Judge Jackson becomes the next justice on the Supreme Court.”"
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-statement-on-russias-invasion-of-ukraine,"Washington, DC — Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued the following statement:“Just five years ago I visited Ukraine to meet with the nation’s leaders to discuss the urgent threats they faced from ongoing Russian aggression. I found a hopeful, resilient people determined to build a free, prosperous nation that is a part of the international community, and I was lifted then as I am now by Ukrainians’ fierce commitment to democratic ideals like liberty and self-determination.“President Putin’s illegal and unprovoked invasion is putting the lives and livelihoods of millions of people at grave risk. This unjust attack threatens the international rules-based order, which has helped to ensure peace and promote security in Europe. In these dark hours, the United States and our allies will stand with the freedom-loving people of Ukraine who share our most fundamental ideals. “We will hold Putin and the Kremlin accountable for this outrageous violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty. I strongly support the enactment of broad and severe international sanctions targeting Putin, the Russian economy, and those individuals and entities that are supporting and enabling the Russian military’s invasion. We are united with Ukraine, its people, and our NATO allies in our determination to counter Russia’s aggression and its attack on an independent, democratic nation.”"

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-adams-underwood-introduce-resolution-recognizing-black-maternal-health-week,"Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), along with Representatives Alma Adams (D-NC-12th) and Lauren Underwood (D-IL-14th), introduced a resolution recognizing Black Maternal Health Week “to bring national attention to the maternal health crisis in the United States and the importance of reducing maternal mortality and morbidity among Black women and birthing persons.” Black Maternal Health Week is observed from April 11 through April 17.The resolution underscores the disproportionate health complications suffered by Black birthing people during pregnancy who face maternal morbidities three times as often as their white counterparts due to structural racism and gender oppression in maternal health care experiences. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these inequities, with data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicating that the maternal mortality rate for Black women has increased by 26% since the pandemic began. In order to reverse these alarming trends, the resolution calls on Congress to “support and encourage policies grounded in the human rights, reproductive justice, and birth justice frameworks that address Black maternal health inequity.”  “Our nation is experiencing a maternal mortality crisis,” said Sen. Booker. “The United States has one of the highest maternal mortality rates of any wealthy nation, which has rapidly increased during the past years and continues to disproportionately impact Black birthing people who more often encounter the systemic inequalities of our broken health care system. To improve Black maternal health outcomes, this resolution calls on Congress to implement a comprehensive approach that provides Black communities with economic support, environmental justice provisions, and access to high-quality, affordable health care. I am proud to once again work with Representatives Adams and Underwood on this resolution to address this urgent and critical issue.” ""This week we are lifting up the voices of Black women who are doing the critical work of eliminating maternal health disparities and creating a world where maternal justice and equality are a reality,"" said Congresswoman Adams, co-chair of the Black Maternal Health Caucus. ""In 2018, I was honored to introduce the first Congressional resolution recognizing Black Maternal Health Week with then-Senator Kamala Harris. In 2019, I asked the youngest Black woman elected to Congress, Lauren Underwood, if she wanted to launch a Congressional Caucus focused on Black maternal health. So, we launched the Black Maternal Health Caucus, which now boasts 115 bipartisan Members of Congress. In 2020, we introduced the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act – a package of 12 bills to comprehensively address existing gaps in policy solutions to the maternal health crisis. The bill was crafted with Black women, by Black women and for Black women. Last year, we re-introduced the Momnibus, and passed the first bill from the package. I’m so excited to continue this work in this Congress, because Black mamas can't wait.""“The maternal health crisis demands urgent attention and serious action to save lives and advance birth equity across the country,”said Rep. Underwood. “In 2019, I co-founded the Black Maternal Health Caucus with Congresswoman Alma Adams to respond to this crisis and advocate for evidence-based solutions that will end disparities. I’m thrilled to introduce this resolution with Congresswoman Adams and Senator Booker to recognize Black Maternal Health Week 2022, which elevates Black maternal health as a national priority and emphasizes the need to reduce maternal mortality and achieve maternal health justice.”“The Black Maternal Health field has expanded significantly since the first Black Maternal Health Week launched back in 2018. I am so proud of the work that BMMA, our partners, and collaborators have led to create a demonstrable impact on behalf of Black women and birthing people’s maternal and reproductive rights,” said Angela D. Aina, Executive Director of Black Mamas Matter Alliance. “Still, there is so much more to be done to address the startling statistics and realities facing Black expectant individuals. As we celebrate Black Maternal Health Week, and continue to champion the reproductive rights and health equity of all Black birthing people, we hope our collective efforts will create even more transformative change for generations to come.”“March of Dimes commends Representatives Alma Adams, Lauren Underwood and Senator Cory Booker for spearheading this year’sBlack Maternal Health Week Resolution and their efforts to address the alarming state of Black maternal health,” said Stacey D. Stewart, President and CEO of the March of Dimes. “In the U.S., Black women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes and 50 percent more likely to have a preterm birth as compared to White women. It is past time we address the structural racism and inequities in social determinants of health that contribute so significantly to the disproportionately high rates of maternal mortality and morbidity among Black women.”Booker has led and pushed for legislation to address the Black maternal health crisis. Last year, Senator Booker, along with Representative Lauren Underwood and Representative Alma Adams, introduced the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021, which would help save moms’ lives, end racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes, and achieve maternal health justice for Black women and all women and birthing people of color. He also introduced the MOMMIES Act, legislation that would expand Medicaid coverage for birthing people and especially help Black birthing people afford reproductive care.In addition to Booker, the resolution is cosponsored in the Senate by: Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Ed Markey (D-MA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Gary Peters (D-MI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), and Jacky Rosen (D-NV).Additional quotes in support of Black Maternal Health Week 2022 can be found here.

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-announces-introduction-of-bill-to-ban-surveillance-advertising,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) announced the introduction of the Banning Surveillance Advertising Act, legislation that prohibits advertising networks and facilitators from using personal data to target advertisements, with the exception of broad location targeting to a recognized place, such as a municipality. The bill also prohibits advertisers from targeting ads based on protected class information, such as race, gender, and religion, and personal data purchased from data brokers. The bill makes explicit that contextual advertising, which is advertising based on the content a user is engaging with, is allowable. Congresswomen Anna G. Eshoo (D-CA) and Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) introduced the Banning Surveillance Advertising Act today in the House. “Surveillance advertising is a predatory and invasive practice. The hoarding of people’s personal data not only abuses privacy, but also drives the spread of misinformation, domestic extremism, racial division, and violence,” saidSenator Booker. “With the introduction of the Ban Surveillance Advertising Act, advertisers will be forced to stop exploiting individuals’ online behavior for profits and our communities will be safer as a result.”“The ‘surveillance advertising’ business model is premised on the unseemly collection and hoarding of personal data to enable ad targeting. This pernicious practice allows online platforms to chase user engagement at great cost to our society, and it fuels disinformation, discrimination, voter suppression, privacy abuses, and so many other harms. The surveillance advertising business model is broken,” said Rep. Eshoo. “I’m proud to partner with Senator Booker and Congresswoman Schakowsky on legislation to ban this toxic business model that causes irreparable harm to consumers, businesses, and our democracy.”“Surveillance advertising is at the heart of every exploitative online business model that exacerbates manipulation, discrimination, misinformation, extremism, and fundamentally violates people’s privacy in ways they would never choose if given a true choice. The Banning Surveillance Advertising Act will put a stop to this repulsive practice and therefore protect consumers by removing the financial incentive for companies to exploit consumers’ personal information and help stop a morass of online harms. I’m proud to join my colleagues Representative Eshoo and Senator Booker to stop this poisonous practice,” said Rep. Schakowsky. “I remain committed to passing bipartisan, comprehensive consumer data privacy legislation, and I believe a ban on this practice should be a part of any such privacy law. I look forward to continued discussion with Energy and Commerce Members on both sides of the aisle in order to achieve this outcome.”The Banning Surveillance Advertising Act is supported by leading public interest organizations, academics, and companies with privacy-preserving business models, including the following:   Quotes from endorsing organizations can be viewed here.The full text of the legislation can be viewed here. "
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-statement-on-recent-developments-in-ethiopia,"Washington, DC -- U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health Policy, issued the following statement:“I remain very concerned by the grave humanitarian situation in Ethiopia and the continuing violence and tragic deaths, including those of dozens of civilians from reported air strikes in Tigray and Oromia. Reports that more than 90 percent of the population in Tigray is in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, as are people in other parts of the country, are extremely troubling.“It is imperative that all parties cease hostilities and human rights abuses and engage in a political dialogue that is representative of all Ethiopians. Towards this goal, I welcome the creation of the Ethiopian National Dialogue Commission and its work towards an inclusive dialogue and reconciliation process, one that needs to bring together representatives of all the major ethnic and political groups to ensure a continued democratic path forward for the country.  I am hopeful that all parties will engage in good faith in the upcoming National Dialogue. I am encouraged by the Ethiopian government’s recent announcement that it will release several political prisoners, including prominent Oromo and Tigrayan political prisoners, among others. “Despite these positive developments, much work remains to be done, and I strongly urge the Ethiopian government to make good on its commitment to allow unfettered access for humanitarian efforts. More must be done to ensure that human rights are protected throughout Ethiopia; thousands of political prisoners remain imprisoned and must be released.“I also warmly welcome the appointment of veteran diplomat Ambassador David Satterfield as the new U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa. He is the right person for the job, and I urge all parties to welcome and work with him to find a lasting solution to the political problems in Ethiopia.”"
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-gillibrand-menendez-schumer-introduce-legislation-to-protect-the-new-york-new-jersey-watershed,"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), along with Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), introduced the NY-NJ Watershed Protection Act, legislation that would safeguard and restore the New York-New Jersey Watershed. A critical regional and national resource that generates more than $60 billion in annual revenue from tourism, commercial fishing, and recreational activities, the NY-NJ Watershed currently faces threats from climate change, legacy pollution, and untreated wastewater. The proposed legislation would address these ongoing issues by establishing and funding a new program, administered by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, to jumpstart and coordinate restoration projects in local communities situated within the watershed, prioritizing communities that are experiencing environmental injustice. Companion legislation was introduced in the House last year by Representative Paul Tonko (NY-20).“The New York-New Jersey Watershed is a vital natural resource, providing economic and environmental benefits to nearby communities as well as greenspace for millions of Americans to enjoy,” said Sen. Booker. “As the watershed is increasingly threatened by rising sea levels, storm surges, and the harmful effects of legacy pollution, I am introducing this legislation to make federal investments that help restore the natural resources of our region, mitigate flood risks, and create greater recreational opportunities for residents to enjoy.”  “Investing in our waterways like those in the New York-New Jersey Watershed is vital to protecting our economic and environmental future. The NY-NJ Watershed is one of our most important natural treasures and serves as a vital economic anchor between our states,” said Sen. Gillibrand. “This legislation is critical to protecting the NY-NJ Watershed’s long-term health and environmental quality, and will support New York State’s local economy for years to come. I am proud to be co-leading this important legislation with my friend and colleague, Senator Booker.”“From climate change causing more frequent storms and rising sea levels to pollution and hazardous waste, it is now more important than ever to invest in the protection and restoration of the New York-New Jersey Watershed,” said Sen. Menendez. “Restoring the watershed will improve the ecosystems for marine and wildlife populations, improve water quality, increase public access, and improve the quality of life for the millions of Americans living within the watershed. With revenue from tourism, fishing, and other recreational activities, the watershed is vital to the regional and national economies and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the critical bill.”“From the Hudson Valley to the New York Harbor our rivers and waterways generate billions in economic activity, are vital pathways for both commerce and recreation, and are some of our most invaluable natural wonders,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. “The New York-New Jersey Watershed Protection Act will turn the tide for the cleanup and restoration of our waterways and ensure their environmental beauty continues to flow for generations. I am proud to co-sponsor this legislation that puts the environment and frontline communities suffering from environmental injustice first.”In addition to creating a new program administered by the U.S Fish & Wildlife Service, the NY-NJ Watershed Protection Act would:Throughout his time in the Senate, Booker has worked extensively on environmental justice issues. Last year, he reintroduced the Environmental Justice Act, sweeping legislation that would address environmental injustices experienced by Black and Brown, low-income, and indigenous communities. He has also reintroduced the Environmental Justice Legacy Pollution Cleanup Act that would invest over $200 billion to eliminate pollution that disproportionately impacts and harms marginalized communities.Senator Gillibrand has long been an advocate for environmental justice in New York and across the country. She has also been a champion for cleaning up toxic PFAS chemicals, remediation, and testing for those affected by PFAS contamination. During the 117th Congress, Gillibrand introduced her PEAKER Act, which would facilitate rapid deployment of clean energy and battery storage to replace aging and dirty peaker plants historically located in disadvantaged communities. Senator Gillibrand also introduced the Long Island Sound Restoration and Stewardship Act, enacted in 2018 through the Water Resources Development Act, which supports projects to protect and restore the Long Island Sound and watershed.The legislation is endorsed by more than 40 national and regional organizations.

Booker first introduced the legislation in September 2020 and reintroduced the legislation for the 117th Congress last year.“At the age of 14, Emmett Till was abducted and lynched at the hands of white supremacists. His gruesome murder still serves as a solemn reminder of the terror and violence experienced by Black Americans throughout our nation’s history,” said Sen. Booker. “The courage and activism demonstrated by Emmett’s mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, in displaying to the world the brutality endured by her son helped awaken the nation’s conscience, forcing America to reckon with its failure to address racism and the glaring injustices that stem from such hatred. More than six decades after his murder, I am proud to see the Senate pass long-overdue legislation that would award the Congressional Gold Medal to both Emmett and Mamie Till-Mobley in recognition of their profound contributions to our nation.”Background:In 1955, Emmett Till was kidnapped, beaten, and brutally murdered in Money, Mississippi while visiting his uncle, Moses Wright. Till’s murderers were acquitted despite Wright providing an eyewitness testimony that the men on trial kidnapped Till. Following Till’s death, his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, brought his body back to Chicago and demanded an open casket funeral with more than 50,000 attendees. Till-Mobley allowed a photograph of Till to be taken in his casket, which galvanized activists who were working for civil rights.Till-Mobley continued her work for justice in honor of her son. She created the Emmett Till Players, where teenagers traveled throughout the country presenting Martin Luther King, Jr. speeches. She co-founded the Emmett Till Justice Campaign, while pushed for the re-investigation of Till’s murder by the State of Mississippi, the FBI, and the Department of Justice in 2004.

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-and-barragn-urge-epa-to-strengthen-standards-for-freight-pollution-sources,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Cory Booker and Congresswoman Nanette Diaz Barragán led 48 of their colleagues in encouraging the Environmental Protection Agency to update technology standards for freight-related sources of pollution to address the high levels of air pollution in communities surrounding our nation’s freight shipping facilities and freight transportation corridors.In a letter to EPA Administrator Michael Regan, Booker, Barragán and their colleagues also requested information regarding EPA’s regulatory schedule for updating freight-related emissions standards, technology assessments for mobile and non-mobile freight sources, and opportunities available to streamline rulemaking to update several emissions standards by 2025.“We appreciate the EPA’s demonstrated commitment to combatting environmental racism and advancing equal access to clean air, land and water. We specifically applaud the steps the EPA has taken to set criteria pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks. We encourage you to expand these efforts to include other freight sources, including locomotives, ocean-going vessels, and aircraft,” the members of Congress wrote.In the 10-20 years since the EPA has updated emissions standards for mobile and non-mobile freight-related emissions sources, new control technologies have become available, including zero-emissions and electric options. There are significant opportunities for reducing toxic air pollution in environmental justice communities while addressing the climate crisis.Senator Booker and Congresswoman Barragán were joined on the letter by Senators Richard Durbin (Ill.), Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), Edward J.

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-leads-colleagues-in-calling-on-us-department-of-education-to-suspend-wage-garnishment-of-student-loan-borrowers,"Washington, D.C. -- Today, U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) led colleagues in urging the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) to suspend administrative wage garnishment of student loan borrowers. The letter comes nearly a month before student loan and interest payments are set to resume on January 31, 2022.“Currently, over 9 million borrowers are in default on more than $180 billion in federal student loan debt,” wrote the lawmakers to USDOE Secretary Miguel Cardona. “A disproportionate number of these borrowers are people of color, first-generation college students, veterans, parents, people with disabilities, and students who will not complete college. Even before the devastating COVID-19 pandemic, these borrowers in default were subject to aggressive collection measures, some of which only the federal government can utilize to collect on student loans. In addition to having to pay exorbitant fees, borrowers in default could expect to see their wages, tax refunds, and even Social Security checks confiscated. Low-income families that had their Child Tax Credit (CTC) and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) refund checks seized by the federal government were often left in worse situations with limited access to jobs and housing, and fewer resources to cover basic necessities.”The lawmakers continued by highlighting that the USDOE’s “current intention to resume these collection efforts in a couple of months, as cash-strapped borrowers struggle to recover from a still-ongoing pandemic, will likely result in significant financial harm.” As such, they asked the Department “to automatically remove eligible borrowers from default status” and “to suspend administrative wage garnishment and other forced collections until of the end of the COVID-19 national public health emergency.”Furthermore, the lawmakers urged the USDOE “to conduct an analysis of the disparate effects of these practices on Black, Latino and Indigenous people with student debt as part of any comprehensive review of the student loan debt collection system.”The lawmakers concluded that reforming the harmful wage garnishment process “would play a critical role in our nation’s recovery efforts and would protect the most financially vulnerable student loan borrowers. We appreciate your prompt attention to our urgent request.” The letter follows Senators Booker and Elizabeth Warren’s Ending Administrative Wage Garnishment Act of 2020, legislation introduced nearly a year ago that will suspend wage garnishments for those who have defaulted on their student loans and revise income-drive repayment plans.The letter was co-signed by Senators Warren (D-MA), Rev. Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Bob Casey (D-PA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), and Sherrod Brown (D-OH).Full text of the letter can be found here."
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/senators-booker-and-scott-introduce-comprehensive-legislation-addressing-sickle-cell-disease,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Tim Scott(R-SC) introduced the Sickle Cell Disease Comprehensive Care Act. This legislation would direct the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to create a Medicaid demonstration program to improve access to comprehensive, high-quality, outpatient care - including clinical and support services - for individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). Congressman Danny K. Davis (D-IL 07) and Congressman Michael C. Burgess (R-TX 26) introduced the Sickle Cell Disease Comprehensive Care Act in the House last week.Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that disproportionately impacts people of African descent. Among the most notable symptoms of SCD is severe, debilitating pain, but people with SCD also experience complications like stroke, acute chest syndrome, and organ damage. Sadly, individuals with SCD have a significantly lower life expectancy than the overall population.While some advancements in the field have been made recently, many with SCD are not receiving the level of care needed to adequately manage the disease.  A Medicaid demonstration program, such as the one outlined in the Sickle Cell Disease Comprehensive Care Act, could significantly improve the quality of care SCD patients receive. Additionally, any improvements made as a result of this demonstration program would have the potential to meaningfully improve care for all SCD patients as approximately half of SCD patients in the U.S. are enrolled in Medicaid according to CMS data. Further, this demonstration program shows a lot of promise in saving money, as it aims to reduce patients’ reliance on costly emergency room care. “People with sickle cell disease have for too long suffered from an underinvestment in federal funding and attention,” said Senator Booker. “The Sickle Cell Disease Comprehensive Care Act would improve access to high-quality, comprehensive care for SCD patients and would be the greatest investment in SCD patients and care since our Sickle Cell Disease and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment Act that passed into law in 2018. I am proud to introduce this legislation with Senator Scott.”  “Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited blood disorder in the U.S., affecting one in every 365 Black Americans,” said Senator Scott. “Yet despite the prevalence of SCD, research and treatments remain far too limited. I’m proud to support today’s legislation that will help our medical community better treat individuals with this painful disease.”“Sickle Cell Disease Association of America welcomes the Sickle Cell Disease Comprehensive Care Act and hopes that this will improve access to quality medical care for more individuals with sickle cell disease,” said Lewis Hsu, MD, PhD Chief Medical Officer, Sickle Cell Disease Association of America.  “We applaud Senators Booker and Scott for acknowledging and addressing the problem of lack of comprehensive care for individuals living with SCD,” said American Society of Hematology President Martin S. Tallman, MD. “As hematologists, we know that individuals living with SCD lack access to comprehensive care to manage their condition to avoid serious complications. Unfortunately, this means that these individuals – who are already burdened by a devastating disease – do not receive care that is holistic and tailored to their unique needs. The introduction of the new bill, which would provide an organized approach to primary and preventative care for individuals with SCD, is a crucial first step toward improving outcomes for the SCD community. We look forward to continuing to work closely with Senators Booker and Scott and other members of Congress to ensure that all people living with sickle cell disease get the care they need.”“Representing African-American physicians across the nation, the National Medical Association (NMA) continues to advocate for and find solutions to eliminate health disparities faced by individuals with Sickle Cell Disease.  We proudly support the Sickle Cell Comprehensive Care Act, which authorizes the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to create a program for Medicaid beneficiaries living with Sickle Cell Disease, particularly young adults and pregnant persons. This innovative policy improves access to comprehensive outpatient care, specialists and resources in an effort to combat this disease and address critical gaps in care. The NMA understands that passage of this legislation is a crucial step in improving health outcomes and quality of life for this underserved population, as we strive to achieve equitable health care for all,” said Rachel Villanueva, MD FACOG, National President of National Medical Association.Throughout his time in the Senate, Booker has raised awareness for sickle cell disease and advocated for equitable funding, increased attention, and better access to treatments and care for people with SCD. The Sickle Cell Disease Comprehensive Care Act builds upon this work, including his bipartisan Sickle Cell Disease and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment Act that he introduced with Senator Scott and which passed and was signed into law in 2018. Additionally, earlier this week, Senators Booker and Scott’s resolution designating September as Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) Awareness Month unanimously passed in the Senate. The full text of the legislation can be viewed here."
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-cardin-sanders-introduce-legislation-to-create-special-envoy-to-monitor-and-address-islamophobia,"WASHINGTON, D.C - Today, U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Ben Cardin (D-MD), both members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) introduced the Combating International Islamophobia Act, legislation that would require the Department of State to establish a Special Envoy for tracking and combatting Islamophobia globally. The creation of the Special Envoy will also help lawmakers and other government officials better understand anti-Muslim hatred and violence, allowing for the development of a comprehensive strategy that will establish U.S. leadership in addressing Islamophobia worldwide.The legislation is the Senate companion to a House bill introduced by Representatives Ilhan Omar (MN-05) and Jan Schakowsky (IL-9). The House is expected to consider Omar and Schakowsky’s bill for passage as early as today.In a recent survey conducted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), 69% of American Muslims responded that they have personally experienced anti-Muslim bigotry or discrimination since 9/11. In March, the United Nations Human Rights Council cited discrimination and hatred toward Muslims had risen to “epidemic proportions.”“We’ve witnessed in recent years an alarming rise in Islamophobia both in the United States and globally that has threatened the religious freedom, well-being, and lives of Muslims,” said Sen. Booker. “Establishing a Special Envoy at the State Department is an important step that we should take to develop a comprehensive plan to reverse this trend and position the U.S. as a global leader in combating hate.”“For over a decade, we have seen a rise in Islamophobia around the country and around the world. The United States should be a global leader in fighting such intolerance. So I am proud today to be joining my Senate colleagues in introducing the Combating International Islamophobia Act. This bill would elevate our commitment to freedom of religion and further protect the rights of Muslims everywhere, ” said Senator Cardin, who serves as the Special Representative on Anti-Semitism, Racism, and Intolerance for the 57-nation Organization Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly.""The Council on American-Islamic Relations thanks Senator Cory Booker for introducing a Senate companion to the Combating International Islamophobia Act,” said Nihad Awad, Executive Director of CAIR. “It is important to American Muslims, and Muslims around the world that Congress supports the creation of a U.S. Special Envoy at the Department of State to Monitor and Combat Islamophobia. Passing this act into law will equip our nation with the necessary tools to ensure the safety and wellbeing of Muslims here in the United States and abroad, given the transnational nature of Islamophobic hate.""  ""CAIR New Jersey thanks Senator Cory Booker for introducing the Combating International Islamophobia Act,” said Selaedin Maksut, Executive Director of CAIR-New Jersey. “By monitoring and confronting the rising tide of global Islamophobia, the U.S. can help ensure the religious freedom of Muslims around the world. The New Jersey Muslim community supports the creation of a special envoy position to monitor and combat this rising tide of anti-Muslim hate – and the Combating International Islamophobia Act would make this special envoy position a reality.""Full text of the legislation can be found here."

I am proud to lead the Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month resolution with Senator Scott and I will continue to champion federal initiatives to raise awareness, improve access to care, and help find a cure for this disease.”“Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited blood disorder in the U.S., affecting one in every 365 Black Americans,” said Senator Scott. “Yet despite the prevalence of SCD, research and treatments remain far too limited. With this resolution, we commit to raising awareness and seeking out legislation that will help our medical community fight—and one day, cure—this painful disease.”Senator Booker and Scott’s sickle cell legislation, the Sickle Cell Disease and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment Act, was signed into law in 2018, and Booker continues to advocate for the sickle cell community today.The resolution was cosponsored by Senators Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Todd Young (R-Ind.)

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-norcross-celebrate-expansion-of-the-enterprise-center-into-new-jersey,"Newark, NJ - Today, U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Representative Donald Norcross (NJ-01) celebrated the New Jersey launch of The Enterprise Center, a nonprofit organization that has secured contracts to create two distinct entities: the New Jersey Minority Development Agency (MBDA) Business Center and the Camden Cares Business Center. Through these contracts, The Enterprise Center will help minority-owned businesses in New Jersey access capital, business development opportunities, and contracts to grow their operations as well as provide technical assistance, training services, and funding application support to COVID-impacted businesses in Camden.Citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on minority small business and historical racial inequities within the financial system, Booker urged the U.S. Department of Commerce to establish a Minority Business Center in New Jersey earlier this year. Over the past years, he has also worked to ensure that the MBDA is permanently authorized, an effort that was recently signed into law as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal. “The devastating economic effects of this pandemic have disproportionately impacted minority small businesses across America, with nearly half of Black and one-third of Latino small businesses being forced to shut down - some permanently,” said Sen. Booker. “However, we know that minority businesses and entrepreneurs were struggling even before the pandemic, and historic inequities and barriers were merely exacerbated by this crisis. That is why I’ve fought to make the MBDA permanent and fought to open the first Minority Business Center here in New Jersey so that our residents don’t have to travel out of state to access these services. As it launches today, I know that The Enterprise Center will offer critical resources and assistance to our state’s underserved small businesses for years to come.”“We know that our financial institutions can and need to be better if we’re going to expand equal opportunity to everyone in our community,” said Rep. Norcross. “I know I wouldn’t be where I am today if it weren’t for accessible education and career training, and I know that having The Enterprise Center in Camden will help level the playing field by opening doors to opportunity and increasing access to vital resources for local minority-owned businesses.”""I am proud to lead The Enterprise Center's expansion into New Jersey,"" said Victoria Hosendorf, Executive Vice President of The Enterprise Center. ""Through the New Jersey MBDA Business Center and Camden Cares Business Center, we have an opportunity to build upon our mission of cultivating and investing in minority entrepreneurs at a critical time when so many are struggling to recover from the pandemic and years of economic hardships. We look forward to working with and for our community here in Camden and beyond."""
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-krishnamoorthi-lead-colleagues-in-calling-on-us-department-of-education-to-facilitate-student-civic-engagement-in-institutions-of-higher-education,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi (IL-8th) led a bicameral group of over two dozen colleagues in urging the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) to address student voter registration and participation as it formulates rulemaking for higher education accountability. The letter comes as states across the country pass legislation designed to curb the voting rights of Black, Brown, and young people.“Across the country, voting rights are under attack, and new laws restricting access to voting have been transparently intended to discourage students and people of color from participating in our elections,” wrote the lawmakers to USDOE Secretary Miguel Cardona. “The Department can and should play a significant role in supporting democracy by creating additional nonpartisan opportunities for students to register to vote, keep their voter registration up to date, and participate in state and federal elections.”The lawmakers continued by highlighting that “Section 487(a)(23) of theHigher Education Act requires each institution of higher education that receives federal financial aid funds to make a “good faith effort” to distribute voter registration materials and to make such materials “widely available” to students. A college’s good faith effort to distribute voter registration information widely should reflect the most common methods by which individuals register to vote—including, increasingly, online registration—and the deadlines they must meet.”Given that the USDOE will only complete rulemaking for higher education institutions in early 2022, the lawmakers called on the department to“swiftly issue sub-regulatory guidance that clarifies institutions’ responsibilities under current regulations. This guidance should remind colleges of their existing requirement to distribute voter registration information to students well in advance of state deadlines to register to vote. And, such guidance should strongly encourage institutions to adopt best practices for providing links to voter registration online and through direct notifications to students, including links during course registration and campus-wide email reminders.” The lawmakers concluded, “Participating in our democracy is consistent with the goals of federal financial aid, and the Department should take swift action to support access to voter registration and voting for students in this rulemaking process. Thank you for your attention to our request.”The letter follows Senator Booker’s Help Students Vote Act, legislation introduced earlier this year that would strengthen student voter registration and civic participation on college campuses.The letter was co-signed by the following Senators: Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Tina Smith (D-NM), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI),  Patty Murray (D-WA), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Rev. Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Mark Warner (D-VA).The letter was also co-signed by the following Representatives: Deborah Ross (NC-02nd), Ruben Gallego (AZ-07th), Sheila Jackson Lee (TX-18th), Terri Sewell (AL-07th), Stephanie Murphy (FL-07th), Stephen Lynch (MA-08th), Mary Gay Scanlon (PA-05th), and Tom Suozzi (NY-03rd).The full text of the letter can be viewed here.

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-menendez-applaud-senate-judiciary-committee-passage-of-bipartisan-bill-to-protect-privacy-safety-of-federal-judges-and-their-families,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-N.J.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and co-author of the bill, and U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), lead and co-author of the bill, applauded the passage of the Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy Act of 2021 by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The legislation comes after the fatal, targeted attack last year on U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas’s New Jersey home. The bill, named for Judge Salas’s son who was murdered during the violent home invasion last year, would safeguard the personally identifiable information of federal judges and their immediate families that could leave them vulnerable to potential threats.The bill passed through the Judiciary Committee today without opposition and with broad bipartisan support.WATCH MEDIA AVAILABILITY HERE“I am grateful that Senators of both parties came together today to support the Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy Act— urgently needed legislation that will help protect the privacy and safety of federal judges and their families,” said Senator Booker, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. “No person who takes on the responsibility of serving as a federal judge should ever have to live in fear that they or their family could be targeted by someone who is able to access their personal information easily online. As we continue to grieve and stand with the Salas family in honoring the memory of their son Daniel, we must never forget that tragic day, and we must ensure that this legislation is passed by the full Senate.”“I made a personal commitment to Judge Salas that I would push for legislation to better protect those who serve on our federal judiciary.  Today, we are one step closer to fulfilling that promise with this important legislation passing the Senate Judiciary Committee,” said Sen. Menendez, who recommended Judge Salas to President Barack Obama for appointment to the federal bench. “Over the past several years, we have witnessed increased threats against the men and women who serve on our federal judiciary. To ensure the sanctity of judicial independence and to help prevent another devastating tragedy like the one endured by Judge Salas, I urge my colleagues in Congress to swiftly pass this commonsense, bipartisan bill.”“My husband and I thank the Senate Judiciary Committee from our hearts,” Judge Salas said. “Daniel’s death showed tragically that threats against federal judges are real, and they have dire consequences. I urge Congress to follow the committee’s lead and ensure that judges can perform their duties without fear, for themselves or their families.” In July 2020, a man posing as a delivery driver went to the home of Judge Salas and opened fire, critically wounding her husband, Mark Anderl, and killing their 20-year-old son, Daniel. The gunman had previously argued a case before Judge Salas and used publicly available information to target the judge and her family. Since the attack, Judge Salas has made advocating for greater safety and privacy protections for federal judges a personal mission.The Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy Act would shield the personally identifiable information of federal judges and their immediate family who share their residence, including home addresses, social security numbers, contact information, tax records, marital and birth records, vehicle information, photos of their vehicle and home, and the name of the schools and employers of their immediate family members.The legislation establishes guidelines for federal agencies, state and local governments, and commercial data collectors to create safeguards to protect the personal information of active, senior, recalled, or retired federal judges and their immediate families by:The bill would also authorize funding for the AO and U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) to monitor and assess online threats, maintain records, investigate complaints, and address acts of aggression and violations. It would also allow the USMS to hire additional intelligence analysts, deputy U.S. Marshals, and other personnel to ensure the agency is able to anticipate and deter threats against federal judges.The full text of the legislation can be viewed here."
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-sullivan-introduce-world-aids-day-resolution,"Washington, DC - Today, U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Dan Sullivan (R-AK) introduced a resolution commemorating and supporting the goals of World AIDS Day, including the goal to achieve zero new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths. The resolution recognizes current efforts made by the United States and international organizations in combatting HIV/AIDS while also encouraging greater coordination between the global community to end the HIV epidemic by 2030. A companion resolution was introduced in the House by Representatives Barbara Lee (CA-13) and Jenniffer González-Colón.“Each year, thousands of Americans are newly diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, with Black and Brown communities being disproportionately affected by the disease,” said Sen. Booker. “As we commemorate World AIDS Day, this is also the time for us to recommit to finally eradicating HIV/AIDS in the United States and worldwide by scaling up support for prevention, treatment and research programs and improving access to life-saving medications, especially for vulnerable populations.” “As we continue to battle COVID-19, World AIDS Day is an important reminder of the millions of people living with another virus—HIV,” said Senator Sullivan. “Since coming to the Senate, I’ve been an ardent supporter of robust funding for PEPFAR, a federal program started by President Bush that has treated nearly 15 million people around the world. I’m glad to join Senator Booker and our House colleagues in introducing a resolution to recognize World AIDS Day and the critical work being done to prevent infections and save lives.”“On World AIDS Day, we remember those who have lost their struggle against this disease, their families and loved ones, and the millions more who continue to live with and fight against it,” said Rep. Lee. “This is the moment that we must all enact the political and moral will to bring equitable care and services for the LGBTQI+ community, sex workers, racial and ethnic minorities, and women and girls. We will only end AIDS if we address the deep disparities in access to sexual and reproductive care, life-saving HIV services, and education. “As we mark the 33rd World AIDS Day, it is imperative that we address stigma, discrimination, and repeal punitive laws against people living with HIV. We must come together to protect lifesaving public health programs to realize our shared goal of achieving an AIDS-free generation. I’m proud to be working with co-chair Rep. Jennifer Gonzalez-Colon on this effort and I stand with the HIV community, their families, advocates, and my colleagues, to recognize the progress we have made over the years, but to fully commit to the work that remains.”“As we commemorate World AIDS Day, I am proud to join my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in introducing bicameral resolution to continue our efforts in spreading awareness about HIV and continue our efforts to prevention, care and treatment,” said Rep. González-Colón. “This is a mission I care about deeply, as in my district, two people become newly infected with HIV every day. It’s imperative we continue supporting those living with this virus and their families,  as we continue working in crafting common sense policies and programs to improve research and treatment and end the HIV epidemic.”The resolution was endorsed by the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, AIDS Alabama, the National Alliance of State & Territorial AIDS Directors, Friends of the Global Fight, The AIDS Institute, RESULTS, NMAC, and ONE.Full text of the resolution can be found here.

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-and-durbin-introduce-legislation-aimed-at-increasing-membership-within-us-sentencing-commission,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) today introduced the Sentencing Commission Improvements Act, legislation that would for the first time add an ex officio member with a public defender background to the U.S. Sentencing Commission.   The U.S. Sentencing Commission, an independent agency within the federal judiciary, was created to establish policies and practices to help reduce sentencing disparities. It specifically collects and analyzes information on federal sentencing practices to help develop fairer and more effective criminal justice policies.Currently, the Commission consists of seven members from both political parties appointed by the President and two ex officio, nonvoting members, the Attorney General or a designee and the U.S. Parole Commission chair. However, unlike the majority of state sentencing commissions, the federal Commission lacks a representative from a public defender background who would provide an essential perspective on the criminal justice system. “The federal Sentencing Commission was created to be fair, impartial, and capable of providing evidence-driven improvements to our sentencing system, which is fraught with disparities,” said Senator Booker. “Adding a statutory member to the Commission with a public defender background will ensure that the Commission’s ranks include this distinct and essential perspective on our criminal justice system and, thus, bring us one step closer to a more balanced and just system.”“The U.S. Sentencing Commission is tasked with establishing practices and policies to promote transparency and reduce sentencing disparities, but the Commission is missing a crucial perspective from the federal public defender system. If we hope to improve sentencing policies in America, we must balance the Commission’s membership by adding a nonvoting federal defender,” said Senator Durbin. “The Sentencing Commission Improvements Act will remedy the Commission’s blind spot and move us toward a fairer sentencing process.”“We welcome Senators Booker and Durbin’s support for a federal defender ex officio,” said Jon Sands, co-chair of the Federal Public & Community Defenders  Legislative Committee & Federal Defender for the District of Arizona. “The time is past due for Congress to ensure defender representation on the United States Sentencing Commission. As the Judicial Conference has long recognized, a defender ex officio would make federal sentencing fairer and more just.” The Sentencing Commission Improvements Act adds an ex officio, nonvoting federal defender member to the U.S. Sentencing Commission designated by the Defender Services Advisory Group, the body under the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts that represents defender offices and advises the federal judiciary.The full text of the legislation can be viewed here.

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-announces-legislation-aimed-at-banning-dangerous-pesticides-from-our-agriculture-system,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) announced the Protect America’s Children from Toxic Pesticides Act of 2021 (PACTPA) that would remove dangerous pesticides within our farm system. Specifically, this legislation would update the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act of 1972 (FIFRA) by banning the most damaging pesticides that have been scientifically proven to harm the safety of people and our environment.Each year, the United States uses over a billion pounds of pesticides — nearly a fifth of worldwide use. Once they’re approved, pesticides often remain on the market for decades, even when scientific evidence overwhelmingly shows a pesticide is causing harm to people or the environment. In 2017 and 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency registered more than 100 pesticides containing ingredients widely considered to be dangerous.Approximately one-third of annual U.S. pesticide use — over 300 million pounds from 85 different pesticides — comes from pesticides that are banned in the European Union. The pesticide regulation statute, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act of 1972 (FIFRA), contains many loopholes that put the interests of the pesticide industry above the health and safety of people and our environment.“As we sit down with family and friends for Thanksgiving, let this day also be one of gratitude for the workers who have worked tirelessly to ensure we have food on our tables,” said Senator Booker. “Farmworkers are often exposed to dangerous and toxic pesticides, risking their health as they work to provide our food. It is imperative that we address this issue directly by updating our laws in order to protect farmworkers, frontline communities, and our environment.”“Pesticide hazards haunt farm workers, especially those that are parents. No parent should worry that hugging their children after a long day of work could expose them to brain-harming chemicals. No pregnant worker should have to wonder what the effects will be on a developing baby. Just living in an agricultural community places farm worker families at the front lines of exposure to dangerous nerve agents. This silent risk extends to every consumer who could unknowingly put food with toxic residue on their family’s table,” said Teresa Romero, President of the United Farm Workers of America.  “For our union, at the heart of the fight against harmful pesticides are countless tragic incidents of workers who experienced pesticide poisoning, and of parents whose children are dealing with developmental injuries, learning disabilities or other health impairments. “The Protect America’s Children from Toxic Pesticides Act recognizes that our nation’s farm workers and consumers deserve better and puts an end to the unacceptable risks to our communities.”“Farmworkers and their families are exposed to highly toxic pesticides in the fields where they work and the communities where they live,” said Iris Figueroa, Director of Economic and Environmental Justice, Farmworker Justice. “The reforms in this bill provide long-overdue protections for the essential workers who provide our food, facing significant risks to their own health as they do so.”“Children and farmworkers should not have to risk suffering serious harm from dangerous pesticides, including many that are banned in other countries,” said J.W. Glass, EPA policy specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “These critical reforms are long overdue. They’ll ensure that people’s health comes before the pesticide industry’s greed."" “Exposure to paraquat increases risk for Parkinson’s disease — as well as causes lung damage and other issues. This herbicide must be banned,”said Todd Sherer, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research Strategy of The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research. “It is irresponsible to continue allowing a chemical on the market that is a known contributor to developing a neurodegenerative disease. In addition to the human toll, Parkinson’s brings a high financial cost to the individual and the government. Banning paraquat will reduce the number of people who develop Parkinson’s and ease the economic burden.”Specifically, the Protect America’s Children from Toxic Pesticides Act of 2021 (PACTPA) would provide desperately-needed improvement to FIFRA that would better protect people and the environment, including:Senators Gillibrand (D-NY), Sanders (I-VT), Warren (D-MA), and Padilla (D-CA) co-sponsored this legislation.A list of the organizations endorsing the Protect America’s Children from Toxic Pesticides Act can be found here.The full text of the legislation can be viewed here.

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/as-thanksgiving-approaches-booker-khanna-announce-legislation-to-protect-meatpacking-workers,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Representative Ro Khanna (CA-17) announced the Protecting America’s Meatpacking Workers Act which would provide stronger workplace protections for meat and poultry processing workers.Our nation’s food system has long been broken, but the COVID-19 pandemic has shined a light on just how broken the system truly is for workers, farmers and ranchers, animals, and consumers. Unfortunately, the workers responsible for getting food from the farm to our table are often overlooked and underappreciated. It is clear that our food system is not safe for most farm and food chain workers including meatpacking workers that, due to the power and influence of large multinational corporations, have been forced to risk their lives, crowded into meatpacking plants that became hotbeds for COVID-19 outbreaks. In fact, recent reports indicate that over 59,000 meatpacking workers employed by JBS, Tyson, Smithfield, Cargill, and National Beef contracted COVID-19, and at least 269 died.The Protecting America’s Meatpacking Workers Act would provide much needed protections for meatpacking workers along with systemic reforms such as creating a fair market that allows independent farmers, ranchers and robust local food systems to thrive and ensuring that consumers can actually identify where their food comes from so that food giants cannot simply shift the burden of their unfair system to others in the supply chain or import more unsustainable meat from other parts of the world.“As we sit down with family and friends this Thanksgiving, let it also be a day of gratitude for the workers who have worked tirelessly to ensure we have food on our tables,” said Senator Booker. “Unfortunately, meatpacking workers, including those processing the turkeys on the plates of many Americans this week, often face exploitative and dangerous work conditions. We must end this era of abusive practices and begin to ensure that all workers, farmers, and ranchers have a safe and fair opportunity to earn a living. The Protecting America’s Meatpacking Workers Act would provide essential protections to meatpacking workers and is a critical piece in transforming our food system to one that is rooted in resilience, fairness, and justice.”“The COVID-19 pandemic publicly exposed the dangerous conditions that meatpackers employed by large multinational corporations face, but this has been a problem for a long time,” said Rep. Ro Khanna. “I’m glad to join Senator Booker to establish enhanced protections and safety standards at these mega meatpacking plants. It’s time to prioritize people over profits and implement real reforms that will keep workers safe.”“America’s meatpacking and food processing workers have put their health on the line every day of this pandemic to ensure our families can put food on the table. These hard-working men and women on the frontlines of our food supply chain deserve safe workplaces,” said Marc Perrone, International President, United Food & Commercial Workers International Union.“Today’s introduction of the Protecting American Meatpacking Workers Act by Senator Booker and Representative Khanna is a critical step toward strengthening protections in these plants, increasing consumer protections, and holding the industry accountable. Americans deserve to know that their food is safe, made here in the United States, and comes from American workers who are protected on the job. “With action to strengthen safety inspections, improve transparency and require more injury reporting, this bill would deliver the real reforms this industry needs. As America’s largest union for meatpacking workers, UFCW is calling on both Democrats and Republicans in Congress to quickly pass this legislation which supports good American jobs and will keep our food supply chain secure for years to come.”""The members of Wisconsin Farmers Union stand in solidarity with food system workers seeking workplace safety through the ‘Protecting America's Meatpacking Workers Act of 2021,’” said Lauren Langworthy, Special Projects Director at Wisconsin Farmers Union. “As both farmers and eaters, we depend on the laborers who process our meat products. Issues of workplace safety and abuse - especially in the most consolidated processing plants - have endangered the health and wellbeing of laborers and added to the fragility of our food system as a whole. Workers deserve the basic protections brought forth in this bill, better enforcement of existing workplace safety laws, and meaningful consequences for employers who neglect the safety and wellbeing of this important workforce.""“NELP applauds Senator Booker and Representative Khanna for this legislation that secures robust health, safety, and legal protections for meatpacking workers and our food system,” said Rebecca Dixon, Executive Director, National Employment Law Project. “This legislation is a culmination of the fierce advocacy of workers, advocates, and policymakers to protect the meat and poultry workforce, a community that is critical to our nation’s wellbeing as we continue to work towards an inclusive and just recovery.”“We want to thank Senator Booker for leading this effort,” said Suzanne Adely, Co-Director, Food Chain Workers Alliance. “Meat processing workers have been organizing for safe working conditions and for a voice in their workplace for years, and the COVID pandemic showed us just how much these workers are at risk.  While there is still much more to do to protect workers and support worker organizing in meat processing plants, we think the provisions in this Bill are a critically important step.”“For too long, poultry companies have been exposing workers to inhumane working conditions while profiting from their labor,” said Magaly Licolli, Executive Director, Venceremos. “They have failed to take full accountability for the abuse, injuries, illnesses and financial stress their workers are subject to. This bill will address some of the most urgent protections for workers who have been undervalued to ensure they have dignity as they work to put food on our tables.”  Specifically, the Protecting America’s Meatpacking Workers Act would do the following:   Last year, Senator Booker introduced the Safe Line Speeds in COVID-19 Act, that suspended all current and future USDA waivers and regulations that allowed companies to increase production line speeds at meatpacking plants during the COVID-19 pandemic. A list of the organizations endorsing the Protecting America’s Meatpacking Workers Act can be found here. The following Senators co-sponsored this legislation: Gillibrand (D-NY), Blumenthal (D-CT), Sanders (I-VT), and Warren (D-MA).The full text of the legislation can be viewed here.  "
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-murray-menendez-maloney-kelly-and-porter-lead-over-100-democrats-in-introducing-the-access-to-birth-control-act,"Washington, D.C.—Today, Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Committee on Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and Bob Menendez (D-NJ) led the reintroduction of the Access to Birth Control Act in the Senate. Representatives Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY), Chairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Robin Kelly (D-IL), and Katie Porter (D-CA) reintroduced the bill in the House. Over 100 Democrats are cosponsors of the bill. The legislation—which has been endorsed by 50 national and local advocacy organizations—would guarantee patients’ timely access to birth control at the pharmacy—including by addressing pharmacies’ refusals of contraception that prevent patients from obtaining their preferred form of birth control medication.“Birth control is a vital part of reproductive health care and basic family planning,” said Senator Booker.  “At a time when reproductive rights are under increasing attack throughout the country, protecting Americans' access to contraception is more important than ever.  The Access to Birth Control Act would ensure that all people not only have autonomy over their health but also have affordable and timely access to birth control.”“Birth control is essential health care—full stop.  And it’s health care that helps ensure everyone can control their own bodies, lives and futures,” said Senator Murray. “With reproductive rights under attack from every angle, we’ve got to stand up and make clear that no one should be able to come between a patient and the birth control they need—including being turned away at the pharmacy.”“I am proud to lead my colleagues in reintroducing the Access to Birth Control Act to ensure patients seeking birth control can access their health care without unnecessary barriers or delay,” said Chairwoman Maloney. “During the Trump Administration, some health care providers—including pharmacists—denied patients care simply based on their personal views.  Health care providers must do their jobs based on science—not ideology—and we cannot let this dangerous trend continue.  I’ve been a fierce advocate for equitable access to reproductive health care for many years, and I won’t stop fighting until everyone can access the care they need, when they need it.”“I am pleased to join Senators Booker and Murray in introducing this important legislation to ensure women are able to access their contraceptive of choice at the pharmacy of choice without fear of intimidation or harassment,” said Sen. Menendez. “This is a critical step forward in making sure we protect a woman’s settled right to access full and equitable reproductive care, including birth control.”“Access to birth control is an essential part of women’s healthcare, and a pharmacist’s or provider’s personal views should not factor into a woman’s access to birth control,” said Representative Kelly. “Women’s healthcare is constantly under attack, and we must provide solutions to protect their access to care.  I am proud to co-lead this legislation to ensure that every woman who wants to access birth control is able to easily obtain it.”“Bodily autonomy is essential to social equality and economic security,” said Representative Porter. “Everyone ought to have the freedom to make their own health care decisions, including if and when they would like to have children.  I’m proud to join my colleagues today in introducing legislation that will better protect patients seeking to make decisions about their own bodies.”“People’s access to birth control should never be restricted by a pharmacy employee’s personal beliefs,” said Fatima Goss Graves, President and CEO of National Women’s Law Center.  “We’re glad to support this bill that will make sure everyone can leave a pharmacy with the birth control they need, without discrimination, harassment, or delay.  At a time when extremist politicians are trying every way possible to take away our reproductive health care, it’s urgent to secure federal protections like the ABC Act.  We thank Senator Booker and Representative Maloney, Chairwoman of the Oversight Committee, along with Senator Murray, Chair of the HELP Committee, and Representatives Kelly and Porter for taking action and urge Congress to pass it.”“Contraception is a protected fundamental right and access to contraception is necessary for people to make and exercise decisions about whether and when to become pregnant,” said Dr. Joia Crear-Perry, Founder and President National Birth Equity Collaborative. “The Access to Birth Control Act will especially aid in closing the disparities gap for women of color who historically have faced challenges accessing contraception and medication due to systemic racism. Establishing certain duties for pharmacies to ensure safe and equal access to contraception is a critical step in protecting women's sexual reproductive health and wellbeing. ”""Birth control is a lifeline used at some point by 98% of U.S. Catholics to plan and support their families, manage health conditions, and achieve their educational and employment goals,” said Jamie Manson, President of Catholics for Choice.  “It is dangerous and wrong for a pharmacist to refuse essential care based on their personal religious beliefs, because refusal compromises a patient’s health, economic security, and moral autonomy – all of which our Catholic social justice values compel us to protect.  Catholics for Choice is proud to support the Access to Birth Control Act to ensure that people can get the care they need without delay, following their own individual consciences without obstruction or coercion.""According to the National Women’s Law Center, pharmacists have refused to fill prescriptions for birth control or provide emergency contraception over the counter to patients in 24 states and the District of Columbia. In addition, the ongoing coronavirus crisis has exacerbated barriers to contraception access, with one in three women experiencing delays in obtaining their birth control during the pandemic.The Access to Birth Control Act ensures patients seeking FDA-approved contraception, including emergency contraception and medication related to contraception, are able to access it in a timely manner and not be prevented from doing so by a pharmacy. Click here to read a summary of the Access to Birth Control Act.Click here to read the full legislative text of the Access to Birth Control Act.Click here to read the full list of Members introducing the Access to Birth Control Act.Click here to read the full list of organizations endorsing the Access to Birth Control Act.

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/on-eve-of-veterans-day-booker-klobuchar-announce-legislation-to-improve-access-to-mental-health-services-for-veterans,"Washington, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) announced the Vet CENTERS for Mental Health Act, legislation that would expand access to mental health services for veterans and their families. The bicameral bill would allow 10 additional states, including New Jersey and Minnesota, to be eligible for at least one additional Vet Center which would provide mental health counseling to veterans, survivors of military sexual assault, and Gold Star families. Companion legislation was earlier introduced in the House by Representatives Mikie Sherrill (NJ-11), Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01), Anthony Gonzalez (OH-16), Dean Phillips (MN-03), and Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan (Northern Mariana Islands-At-Large). This legislation has been endorsed by The American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the Service Women’s Action Network, and New Jersey SOS Veteran Stakeholder Group.  “Vet Centers play a critical role in ensuring that our veterans and their families receive access to affordable and potentially lifesaving care, including vital mental health resources and gender specific services,” said Sen. Booker.“Unfortunately, as data shows, such centers are not always available in communities with high veteran populations. This bicameral legislation will help expand Vet Center services in several states, allowing more of our nation’s veterans to receive the VA care they have earned and deserve.” “Our veterans have sacrificed for our country, and we need to repay this service by providing access to care that meets their unique needs, whether that be mental health needs or readjustment counseling,” said Sen. Klobuchar. “The VA estimates that about 11 to 20 out of every 100 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have been diagnosed with potential symptoms of PTSD, making it all the more crucial that we ensure every veteran has access to Vet Center services, regardless of where they live. I am proud to partner with Senator Booker on this legislation to prioritize the mental health of our veterans.”“Vet Centers play a critical role in assisting veterans as they transition into civilian life and aiding those who are experiencing readjustment issues. Unfortunately, not all veterans have access to Vet Centers because of their geographic location, said Paul E. Dillard, National Commander of The American Legion. “To address this issue, The American Legion supports efforts to establish new Vet Centers that consider factors not measurable, but rather reflective of the unique characteristics of each state, its resources, and limitations to reach as many veterans as possible. Therefore, The American Legion is pleased to endorse the Vet CENTERS for Mental Health Act. Expanding the number of Vet Centers in certain high-population states that have high veteran to Vet Center ratios will help to reduce gaps in VA healthcare coverage and provide veterans the support they desperately need.”“Vet Centers are vital community-based lifelines to mental health care and readjustment services for veterans, service members, and families,” saidBrittany Dymond, Associate Director with the VFW’s National Legislative Service. “However, some communities lack access to a Vet Center while others experience demand that exceeds their Vet Center’s capacity. The VFW supports the Veterans Census-Enabled National Treatment Equitable Resource Supplement for Mental Health Act of 2021 (Vet CENTERS for Mental Health Act of 2021), which would require VA to increase the number of Vet Centers. We applaud Senators Booker and Klobuchar for their attention to this issue in order to provide additional touch points to VA services.”“VET Centers are a critical lynchpin in VA’s ability to support Military Sexual Trauma (MST) survivors and other veterans in need of services to support their mental health,” said Lory Manning, Director Of Government Relations for the Service Women’s Action Network. We need more VET Centers in more locations so more veterans can be helped by the healing programs and peer support they provide.”“Catholic Charities Veteran Services is proud to support this legislative effort to establish another Vet Center in New Jersey,” said David Pearson, Assistant Director of Veteran Services for Catholic Family & Community Services in the Diocese of Paterson and Co-Chair of the New Jersey SOS Veteran Stakeholder Group. Access to local mental health services for our veterans is critically important, and is a benefit that they deserve. We thank Senator Booker and Senator Klobuchar for leading this initiative in the Senate to help fulfil our country’s obligation to our veterans and service members.”“The New Jersey SOS Veteran Stakeholders Group is grateful for the support of Senator Booker and Senator Klobuchar for their advocacy on this very important issue,” said AJ Luna, Co-Chair of the New Jersey SOS Veteran Stakeholder Group. “Our veterans and their families have served and sacrificed for us all. We must continue to advocate for them so that they can have access to the resources and services that best support them during their transition to civilian life.”“As a veteran who recognizes the life-saving value of Vet Centers from firsthand experience, it is heart-warming to see legislation that would expand the number of Vet Centers across the United States,” said Emerson Crooks,Co-Chair of the Veterans Advisory Council of the New Jersey VA Health Care System and Vice President of the Mental Health Association of North Jersey. “Vet Centers provide much needed mental health services for veterans and their families, especially for those who served in combat and require readjustment services upon their return home. I am thankful to Senator Booker and Senator Klobuchar for leading this initiative in the Senate, and for their continued advocacy to make this critical service available to more veterans. We must continue to advocate for our veterans and ensure that they have the support necessary during their transition into civilian life.”“As a recently retired Director of a Vet Center in New Jersey, I have seen firsthand the critically necessary support that Vet Centers provide to our servicemembers and their families,” said David Cathcart, Retired Director of the Secaucus VA Vet Center. “Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring our veterans can receive mental health services in a timely, local manner has never been more important in the fight to reduce veteran suicide. Adding additional Vet Centers across the United States, especially in New Jersey, will effectively reduce wait-times, decrease travel-times, and ensure providers are not overwhelmed with large caseloads. It is the least we can do for the men and women who have given so much to our nation.”Historically, different methods have been used to identify where the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) places Vet Centers, leading to unintended underinvestment in certain states and territories that have higher ratios of veterans to Vet Centers than the national average. This legislation modifies the criteria that the VA uses by leveraging results of the 2020 Census and the VA’s own population data to ensure underserved areas are eligible for additional Vet Centers. Throughout his time in the Senate, Booker has been a tireless advocate for the nearly 400,000 veterans that call New Jersey home. He has introduced theDOULA Act to support pregnant veterans and improve maternal health outcomes. Booker has also introduced the GI Bill NEED Act and the VR&E NEED Act which would protect veterans’ educational and vocational rehabilitation benefits under the GI bill during the COVID-19 pandemic.

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-celebrates-four-months-of-child-tax-credit-payments-to-nj-families,"WASHINGTON, DC - Today, U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) highlighted the transformative impact that four months of Child Tax Credit (CTC) payments have had on New Jersey families. Since monthly payments were first issued in July, nationally, the CTC has provided historic economic relief for nearly 39 million households, covering almost 90 percent of children in the country, and setting the U.S. on course to cut child poverty by half. Statistics from the Treasury Department and IRS show that $1,552,834,000 in CTC payments was awarded to New Jersey families from July to October, with more than 1.6 million New Jersey children being covered in October alone.“Four months ago, families across the United States received their first child tax credit payments, a historic investment in the lives of working people that has helped struggling parents put food on the table, cover child care costs, and buy school supplies,” said Sen. Booker. “In New Jersey specifically, this transformative policy has been a lifeline for the 14% of children who lived in poverty prior to the pandemic, helping change life trajectories and positioning our state for stronger economic growth. I am especially encouraged to see President Biden’s Build Back Better framework include an extension of these payments.”Booker has worked extensively on expanding tax credits for working and middle class families. In 2019, he introduced the American Families Act and the Working Families Tax Relief Act that would permanently expand the CTC and the Earned Income Tax Credit for children and low-income families. Booker has also decried Republican efforts to reverse CTC payments and spoke on the Senate floor to discuss the impact of the CTC on families with kids.

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-colleagues-urge-dot-to-implement-regulations-to-detect-and-reduce-methane-leaks,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) led a letter with 11 colleagues urging the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) to issue strong regulations to help reduce methane leaks within our natural gas pipeline system. Specifically, the Senators urged DOT and PHMSA to require advanced methane leak detection technologies that effectively detect and address harmful greenhouse gas emissions, an important step in implementing the PIPES Act of 2020 which Congress passed last year. “Leaks in natural gas gathering, transmission, storage, processing and distribution threaten public health and our environment and cost industry substantial amounts in escaped methane,” the Senators wrote to DOTSecretary Pete Buttigieg. “Methane is more than 80 times as potent as carbon dioxide and drives near-term greenhouse gas emission trends. A 2018 study published in Science found that the volume of natural gas leaking from across the natural gas supply chain would be enough to fuel 10 million homes and isworth an estimated $2 billion per year – and these estimates do not include the significant air quality and climate benefits associated with abating these methane emissions.”The Senators continued, “The first step to fixing methane leaks is finding them. Fortunately, effective technologies now exist to detect, locate, and quantify natural gas leaks quickly and accurately. Enabling swift, broad deployment of this technology will keep our communities safer, our air cleaner, and our greenhouse gas emissions lower. That is why in December 2020, Congress reauthorized the PIPES Act and required PHMSA to create minimum performance standards for leak detection and repair that reflect the capabilities of commercially-available advanced leak detection technologies.”“We are urging the Department of Transportation and PHMSA to take quick action to complete this rulemaking process and issue strong regulations that will enhance pipeline safety and reduce harmful methane emissions throughout the United States,” the Senators concluded.”The following Senators co-signed this letter: Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Angus King (D-ME), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Ed Markey (D-MA), Mazie K.

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-peters-lead-21-senators-to-urge-interior-department-to-place-emergency-protections-on-gray-wolves,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Gary Peters (D-MI) led 21 of their colleagues in urging the U.S. Department of Interior to issue an emergency listing to restore temporary federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) protections to the gray wolf in the western United States. The letter comes on the heels of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service initiation of a comprehensive status review of the gray wolf in the western United States as well as the recent enactment of dangerous wolf eradication policies in several states including Idaho and Montana.“If continued unabated for this hunting season, these extreme wolf eradication policies will result in the death of hundreds of gray wolves and will further harm federally protected ecosystems like Yellowstone,” the Senators wrote to Secretary of Department of Interior Deb Haaland. “The Department of the Interior can prevent these senseless killings, and we urge you to immediately establish emergency interim protections while the Service completes its status review. The Senators continued, “As you know, wolves are an integral component of North American ecosystems. More than 600 scientists have written to request emergency relisting of the Northern Rockies wolf population, precisely because wolves’ role in maintaining healthy ecosystems is being jeopardized by the policies now being implemented by Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. As the scientists note, ‘Without the presence of key species in numbers, we are merely conserving scenery and not functioning ecosystems.’“Given the above, we urge you to immediately issue an emergency listing to establish temporary federal protections for gray wolves. An emergency listing, which extends for 240 days, will prevent more wolves from being killed before the Service makes a determination about whether relisting is warranted. Furthermore, as part of its status review, we respectfully request that the Service both engage in meaningful tribal consultation and consider the impacts of state-level policies like those in Idaho and Montana as they reevaluate the gray wolf’s status,” the Senators concluded.The following Senators co-signed this letter: Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Jack Reed (D-RI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Bernard Sanders (I-VT), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Mazie K.

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/sen-booker-reps-sherrill-gottheimer-malinowski-call-for-va-vet-center-in-northwest-new-jersey,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) and U.S Representatives Mikie Sherrill (NJ-11), Josh Gottheimer (NJ-05), and Tom Malinowski (NJ-7) called on the U.S Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to authorize the creation of a sixth Vet Center in New Jersey, which would provide necessary counseling and support services to veterans residing in Morris, Sussex, Warren, and Hunterdon counties. In a letter to VA Secretary Dennis McDonough, the lawmakers explained how establishing a sixth Vet Center in Morris or Sussex County will allow for 36,000 veterans to receive access to quality, local, and accessible mental health care and counseling services. Veterans currently living in the state’s four northwestern counties face severe travel burdens in seeking critical services, forcing many to find care out-of-state. This week, Booker, Sherrill, Gottheimer, and Malinowski also convened a virtual roundtable with local veterans, in partnership with NJ SOS Veteran Stakeholders Group, to discuss the need for the establishment of a VA Vet Center in either Morris or Sussex County. Video of the lawmakers’ remarks from the event can be found here. “Without the selfless service of our troops and the sacrifices of their families, we would never be able to enjoy the freedoms that make the United States of America so extraordinary,” the lawmakers wrote. “By establishing a sixth Vet Center in New Jersey, the VA will be able to continue to provide quality counseling services to veterans, service members, Reservists, members of the National Guard, and their families in an accessible location closer to their homes. Additionally, the creation of a sixth Vet Center will remedy overcapacity issues at current VA Vet Centers, therefore ensuring no veteran is sent out-of-state to receive care.” “The NJSOSVETS Veteran Stake Holders Group is happy to be working with the offices of Senator Booker and Representatives Sherrill, Gottheimer, and Malinowski in helping to improve mental health services for the State of NJ,” said David Pearson, Co-Chair of the NJ SOS Veteran Stakeholders Group. “Creating a Vet Center for Northwest New Jersey would be a game changer in bringing the much needed local access to our veterans who bear the emotional scars of war. I can say for all of us at NJSOSVETS that we are grateful for the service of our veterans who gave to this country and that we will always remember them and fight so they get the services they so much deserve.” Booker has been steadfast in his commitment to supporting New Jersey’s service-members, veterans, and their families. In 2017, Booker led the successful effort to establish a new Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) in Sussex County after hearing from veterans living in northwestern counties who had to travel to out-of-state VA facilities to get quality care. Booker and U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ) are leading the effort to expand the VA health center in Ocean County in order to better serve veterans in the southern part of the state. Booker is also leading the effort to create a standalone VA Women Veterans Clinic in Northern New Jersey following reports of limited gender-specific programming available to female veterans. The full text of the letter can be found here and below: March 11, 2021 The Honorable Dennis McDonough Secretary, U.S Department of Veterans Affairs810 Vermont Avenue, N.W.Washington, D.C. 20420  Dear Secretary McDonough:  We write to express our support for the establishment of a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Vet Center in Northwest, New Jersey – servicing veterans residing in Morris, Sussex, Warren, and Hunterdon counties. Today, New Jersey has only five Vet Centers serving the state’s 350,000 veterans, 36,000 of which reside in the state’s four northwestern counties.[1] We respectfully request that your administration authorize the creation of a sixth Vet Center in New Jersey, which would provide necessary counseling and support services to many thousands of veterans residing in the northwestern part of the state.  As you know, Vet Centers are critical community-based counseling centers that provide social and psychological services, including professional readjustment counseling, marriage counseling, and family counseling to eligible Veterans, active duty service members, Reservists, members of the National Guard, and their families. The facilities and services are notably different from those in other VA care settings (e.g. hospitals, clinics, etc.) in a number of important aspects which increase accessibility, interest, and utilization. For example, by offering services during non-traditional hours, Vet Centers are uniquely positioned to allow women veterans, working veterans, and their spouses to receive services at times that fit within their schedules. Unlike mental health appointments at VA hospitals or clinics, children are allowed in all Vet Center facilities, thereby allowing parents to receive counseling services without the burden of obtaining childcare during treatment sessions. All Vet Center treatment is confidential, adding an extra level of security for users who need help but are concerned that receiving treatment could impact their current employment or deployment orders. Finally, Vet Centers do not restrict eligibility based on discharge status or VA health care enrollment, therefore allowing a greater number of veterans to utilize Vet Center services. Today, the VA operates five Vet Centers in New Jersey, located in Bloomfield Township, Egg Harbor Township, Ewing Township, Lakewood Township, and Secaucus Township. Currently, veterans residing in Morris, Sussex, Warren, and Hunterdon counties utilize the Vet Centers located in either Bloomfield, Secaucus, or Ewing– placing a severe travel burden on individuals who need to travel, sometimes over an hour, to receive necessary mental health services. Due to the increased demand at both the Secaucus and Bloomfield Vet Centers, new clients are currently being referred to out-of-state counselors. While this provides immediate access for individuals requiring Vet Center services, it is merely a temporary solution because once in-person visits can resume, clients should not have to travel outside their home-state to receive care. Veterans currently seeing an out-of-state counselor via telehealth will be required to maintain service virtually, or will be reassigned to a new counselor in a closer Vet Center. Both options provide a disruption in service for the client, as veterans will either have to start over with a new counselor, or continue utilizing telemedicine rather than the more effective and/or preferred in-person mental health treatments. Finally, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many veterans are reporting increased rates of hypervigilance, isolation, anxiety, and stress. As the VA continues to prioritize increasing access to mental health services aimed at preventing veteran suicide, we must ensure that veterans and their families have mental health services which are confidential, easily accessible, and tailored to their needs. By establishing a sixth Vet Center in New Jersey, the VA will be able to continue to provide quality counseling services to veterans, service members, Reservists, members of the National Guard, and their families in an accessible location closer to their homes. Additionally, the creation of a sixth Vet Center will remedy overcapacity issues at current VA Vet Centers, therefore ensuring no veteran is sent out-of-state to receive care. Thank you for your time and attention to this important request. Without the selfless service of our troops and the sacrifices of their families, we would never be able to enjoy the freedoms that make the United States of America so extraordinary. We stand ready to work with you and your administration to ensure that all those who wish to utilize Vet Center services can do so locally.                                                                                 Sincerely, [1] https://www.va.gov/vetdata/veteran_population.asp ###

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-delauro-thompson-re-introduce-bill-to-protect-meatpacking-workers-from-covid-19,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Representatives Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) and Bennie Thompson (D-MS) reintroduced the Safe Line Speeds During COVID-19 Act to protect worker, consumer, and animal safety by suspending all current and future USDA waivers and regulations that allow companies to increase production line speeds at meatpacking plants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Across the country, many meat processing plants have become COVID-19 hotspots. To date, more than 57,000 meatpacking workers have tested positive for COVID-19, and at least 284 have died this past year, according to the Food and Environment Reporting Network. According to a recent study conducted by the National Employment Law Project, there have been more deaths related to COVID-19 in meat and poultry plants in 2020 other work-related deaths in the past 15 years in the same industry.  In January of this year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) withdrew the Trump administration's proposed rule which would have allowed poultry processing plants to increase the speed of their production lines by 25%. “Since the beginning of the pandemic, outbreaks of COVID-19 have surged in meatpacking plants across the country, where the majority of workers are from immigrant communities and communities of color, resulting in tens of thousands of COVID-19 infections among meatpacking workers and tragically at least 284 deaths,”said Senator Booker. “The situation only worsened last year when the Trump administration approved more than 20 requests from meatpacking plants to exceed regulatory limits on line speeds despite the risks posed to the safety of workers and consumers. The Biden administration has taken an important first step in withdrawing the previous administration's proposed rule to increase line speeds in poultry plants, but it is critically important that we continue to prioritize the safety of frontline workers and consumers over the profits of large multinational meatpacking corporations.” “Last week, the Labor-HHS Subcommittee that I chair heard testimony on the safety of meatpacking workers that revealed corporate meatpackers pursued faster line speeds to protect their bottom lines at the tragic expense of workers,” said Representative DeLauro. “The ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks at meat plants over the last year have raised serious questions about the safety conditions inside these plants. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, these workers experienced injuries at a higher rate than comparable occupations. And now, faster line speeds make it impossible for workers to practice social distancing and comply with safety guidelines. That is why I am proud to join the leadership shown by Senator Booker and Representative Thompson in introducing this legislation that will reign in these reckless line speed waivers for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency.” “It is imperative that we ensure worker safety on slaughter lines,"" said Representative Thompson. “Safety cannot be exchanged for high production. During this unprecedented time of COVID-19, we should take the necessary precautions to ensure employees are safe while working at meat and poultry establishments.” “NELP applauds Senator Booker and Representative DeLauro for this bill that will help ensure the safety and health of the 500,000 meat and poultry workers in the U.S. by suspending the previous administration’s waivers that allowed increased line speeds in meat and poultry plants and blocking funds for the implementation of line speed increases in hog slaughter plants,” said Rebecca Dixon, Executive Director, National Employment Law Project (NELP). The line speed increases allowed by last administration's Department of Agriculture have jeopardized the lives and health of the largely Black, Latinx, and immigrant packinghouse workers and their communities during the pandemic. This bill is a critical step in the right direction toward a just recovery for those communities and all meat and poultry workers.” “The Trump administration’s approach to the pandemic was to do what the meat industry wanted: speed up production and reduce government oversight. This was dangerous and deadly: Meat plants that adopted faster line speeds had double the county-wide COVID-19 illnesses than other plants,” said Food & Water Watch Senior Staff Attorney Zach Corrigan. “Senator Booker and Congresswoman DeLauro have been leaders on agriculture and food safety, and we look forward to working hard with them to make this important bill into law.”“Industrial agriculture’s failures during the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed massive vulnerabilities in our food system, creating an urgent need to transition to a more humane food system that values animals, people and the environment,” said Matt Bershadker, ASPCA President and CEO. “Prohibiting irresponsibly fast slaughter speeds is one immediate step we can take to enhance protections for animals, workers and consumers, and we thank Senator Booker and Representatives DeLauro and Thompson for their leadership on the Safe Line Speeds During COVID-19 Act.”“America’s meatpacking and food processing workers are putting their health on the line every day to ensure our families can put food on the table as this pandemic continues. These hard-working men and women of America’s meatpacking industry deserve safe workplaces,"" said UFCW International President Marc Perrone. “Today’s introduction of the Safe Line Speeds in COVID-19 Act by Senator Booker and Representative DeLauro is a critical step toward strengthening protections in these plants. Simply put, slower line speeds help to keep workers safe from injuries and ensure safe social distancing to stop the spread of COVID-19. As these essential workers continue to serve on the frontlines of this pandemic, all Members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats, must commit to putting safety first by passing this critical legislation that will strengthen vital protections for the brave men and women in meatpacking plants who are helping to keep our food supply secure during this crisis.”  For the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration, the Safe Line Speeds During COVID-19 Act would:    Additionally, the Safe Line Speeds During COVID-19 Act would:    In addition to Booker, the bill is cosponsored by Senators Feinstein (D-CA), Warren (D-MA), Sanders (I-VT), Merkley (D-OR), Blumenthal (D-CT) Baldwin (D-WI), Brown (D-OH), Casey (D-PA), Gillibrand (D-NY), Murray (D-WA), and Cardin (D-MD). In addition to DeLauro and Thompson, the bill is cosponsored by Representatives Barragán (D-CA), Blumenauer (D-OR), Katherine Clark (D-MA), Cooper (D-TN), Jesús ""Chuy” García (D-IL), Hastings (D-FL), Kaptur (D-OH), Khanna (D-CA), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Andy Levin (D-MI), Lowenthal (D-CA), McGovern (D-MA), Napolitano (D-CA), Norton (D-DC), Pingree (D-ME), Pressley (D-MA), Rush (D-IL), Schakowsky(D-IL), Suozzi (D-NY), Tlaib (D-MI), Watson Coleman (D-NJ), and Van Drew (R-NJ). The Safe Line Speeds During COVID-19 Act endorsed organizations can be viewedhere.  The bill text for the Safe Line Speeds During COVID-19 Act is available here.  ###"

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-menendez-release-breakdown-of-102b-in-state-and-local-covid-relief-coming-to-nj-counties-municipalities,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Cory Booker and Bob Menendez (both D-N.J.) today released a county-by-county and town-by-town breakdown of the $10.189 billion in direct, flexible, federal assistance to state and local governments allocated to New Jersey in the American Rescue Plan.  The final funding formula targets federal resources to areas with the greatest need and is modeled after Sen. Menendez’s bipartisan SMART Act, cosponsored by Sen. Booker, netting New Jersey around $1 billion more than had the money been distributed by population.The $1.9 trillion COVID relief package contains $360 billion in state and local aid to help keep essential workers on the job, assist struggling families and small businesses, and make critical investments in infrastructure.  The State of New Jersey will receive approximately $6.434 billion plus another $189 million to expand broadband internet across the state.  An additional $1.823 billion will be split among the 21 county governments and $1.741 billion divided among all 565 cities and municipalities.“In the midst of the greatest public health and economic crises of our lifetimes, it is unacceptable New Jersey schools, hospitals, small businesses, and workers faced the additional threat of budgetary shortfalls,” said Sen. Booker.  “With state and local governments across our country facing the painful decisions of potentially laying off thousands of police officers, firefighters, teachers, and other essential workers, and cutting essential services, the full support of our federal government has never been more important to fight this pandemic.  The federal funding in this COVID relief package will help provide the relief that New Jerseyans desperately need, and I was proud to work with Senator Menendez in getting it across the finish line.""“Our state and local governments have been on the frontlines of the fight against COVID-19.  They have been bleeding resources for over a year while costs have soared and revenues have plummeted.  As a result, they have borne the brunt of the economic pain and desperately need help,” Sen. Menendez said.  “This badly needed federal funding will not just keep the lights on at City Hall, it will also help our communities get more vaccines in people’s arms, keep our first responders, teachers and other essential workers on the job, maintain our infrastructure and critical services, help our small businesses stay afloat, and put us on a smoother path towards economic recovery after the pandemic.  This was a long and hard-fought battle, but I am pleased to be able to deliver in this COVID relief package billions in direct, flexible federal assistance to each and every corner of New Jersey.”The direct, flexible funding can be used by state and local governments to pay COVID-related expenses; cover lost revenues due to the pandemic to maintain critical services and avoid layoffs of essential workers; provide additional assistance to residents and small businesses; and invest in water, sewer and broadband infrastructure.While the SMART Act initially called for $500 billion in targeted state and local funding to the areas with the greatest need, Sen. Menendez was instrumental in fighting efforts to further lower that topline number or change the formula to hurt New Jersey, which has been disproportionately impacted economically by the pandemic. As a result of the final formula, New Jersey will receive the eighth largest pot of federal money compared to other states, about $1 billion more than it would receive had the formula been based entirely on population.  The formula allocates virtually all of the funding dedicated to state governments based on the number of unemployed persons in each state compared to the overall U.S. population to determine need. Below is a breakdown of the $10.189 billion in state and local funding for New Jersey: STATE OF NEW JERSEY – $6,434,000,000 ATLANTIC – $106,673,358.22County Government: $51.14

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-lauds-passage-of_american-rescue-plan,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) praised the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 by the Senate. Following the vote, he issued the following statement:“As we face economic and public crises unlike anything we have seen in our lifetimes, the American Rescue Plan is an urgently needed and historic investment in the health and financial security of New Jerseyans and people across the country, a boost to our small businesses, a lifeline to state and local governments and a necessary step in our country’s long-term recovery. “This landmark legislation will issue another round of direct cash payments to families that need them, extend critically needed pandemic unemployment assistance, extend protections for renters and homeowners, dedicate resources to safely re-opening our schools and supporting our teachers, and, critically, will expand the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit to get help to those who need it the most.  Expansions to the CTC and EITC as a part of the American Rescue Plan will lift millions of children out of poverty, put more money into the pockets of American workers and help middle class families across the country.“To get COVID-19 under control, this bill also allocates urgently needed resources for vaccine distribution, testing and tracing, and other public health activities. It also expands affordable health coverage to millions and provides critical resources to help our loved ones in nursing homes.  “Additionally, we have secured state and local funding needed to support our first responders, educators, essential workers, and critical programs, additional support for small businesses, including dedicated funding to go towards small and minority-owned small businesses and debt forgiveness for farmers of color who have been among those hardest hit by the economic crisis. “I urge the House to act quickly to send this measure to President Biden’s desk. I’m grateful for the President’s vision and commitment to building back better and am ready for the work to come to ensure our country continues down the road to recovery.”###"
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-risch-press-state-department-on-re-evaluation-of-us-uganda-relationship,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Jim Risch (R-ID), both members of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, sent a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressing concern about the state of democracy and ongoing human rights abuses in Uganda.  The letter also urges the Treasury Department and the State Department to utilize the authority of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability to designate individuals who are responsible for human rights abuses and corruption in Uganda in recent years, and to request the State Department to review all U.S. non-humanitarian assistance to Uganda to ensure that it is not aiding or abetting corruption or human right abuses. The letter comes in the wake of Ugandan government authorities detaining and carrying out violence against opposition leaders and activists ahead of Uganda’s January 2021 presidential election. “The U.S.-Uganda relationship has remained largely unchanged for years, spanning multiple administrations,” the Senators wrote to Secretary of State Antony Blinken. “When lawmakers, civil society, and human rights organizations have raised concerns with State Department, Department of Defense, and other U.S. officials about Uganda's human rights record and failing democracy,  these agencies have generally responded with platitudes about Uganda's essential contributions to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), Uganda's role in managing the peace process in South Sudan and hosting nearly one million South Sudanese refugees, its longstanding partnership with the U.S. on HIV/AIDS and other health related programs, and additional regional security and development issues. Uganda’s critical role in these areas is undeniably true, but this should not grant President Museveni, his government, and party- which are virtually synonymous - a free pass to commit human rights abuses at home.” The Senators continued, “Uganda is a young and vibrant country with enormous potential. If managed by a competent and uncorrupt government, rather than one that has time and again put its interests first, Uganda could quickly become one of the region's largest agricultural exporters, tourist destinations, energy exporters, and manufacturing leaders on the continent. Once again, Uganda could secure itself as a net exporter of security to the region and genuinely claim the mantle of being the ‘Pearl of Africa.’”   Specifically, in their letter, both Senators requested that the State Department respond to questions and concerns relevant to the U.S.-Uganda bilateral relationship.  Additionally, they requested that the State Department provide a detailed analysis of the U.S.-Ugandan relationship, informed by an interagency review of whether continued partnership with an increasingly brutal authoritarian leader poses risks to U.S. interests in East and Central Africa, and to develop a plan to mitigate such risks over the next five years. It also tasks the State Department with developing a plan to intensify the U.S. response to human rights abuses in Uganda beyond rhetorical condemnations, and to work with the Government of Uganda and local non-governmental organizations to secure accountability for citizens who have been subjected to arbitrary arrests, torture, and extrajudicial killings. The full text of the letter can be found here.  ###

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-applauds-house-passage-of-the-george-floyd-justice-in-policing-act,"Washington, DC -- Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Criminal Justice and Counterterrorism, issued the following statement: “America has a serious and deadly problem when it comes to discriminatory policing and excessive force used against communities of color -- and the scale and urgency of this crisis demands action by Congress.  “I applaud the swift consideration and passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act by the House of Representatives, the second time in nine months the chamber has passed the bill. It’s a powerful sign that the momentum behind comprehensive policing reform is real and sustained.  “I’m also encouraged by conversations I’m having with Senators on both sides of the aisle, and I believe comprehensive policing reform is an issue that has and will attract bipartisan support. We will work to continue building a diverse coalition of support behind these reform efforts and advance policing reform through the Senate. The time for action is now.” Booker is an original co-author of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which was first introduced in Congress last summer. # # #

Markey (D-MA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), sent a letter requesting information from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) about its oversight authority and regulatory history with regard to tenant screening technology companies, which approximately 90% of landlords use for reviewing income and employment history, eviction history, and criminal background to make decisions about whether to rent to a potential tenant. However, these data sources are often plagued by inaccuracies and are known to collect faulty, publicly available data from court records -- disproportionately harming tenants of color. ""We are particularly concerned that communities of color that have been disproportionately affected by job losses in the pandemic, and have historically been precluded from homeownership, will be the hardest hit, and we write to request more information on the regulation of these tenant screening software companies,"" wrote the lawmakers. ""As a direct result of our nation's legacy of racist, harmful policies, Black families are less likely to own homes, less likely to have generational wealth from past homeownership to afford a down payment, and more likely to be renters - so Black families are at greater risk in the absence of renter protections.""Many tenant screening companies employ search algorithms and use web scrapers to search for and collect data on publicly available court websites. Companies then compile this data into reports containing either a numerical recommendation score or a ""thumbs-up or thumbs-down"" recommendation of whether a landlord should rent to the potential tenant. However, many screening services only search for whether the potential tenant has been named in an eviction case - and don't include the reasons for the landlord filing the eviction, how long ago it occurred, or the outcome of the case including whether it was dismissed. Because of these and other flaws, renters can find themselves blacklisted as a result of incomplete data from the screening software.""This problem of incomplete and incorrect data on eviction filings poses a risk to renters every year, but may create a heightened threat in 2021,"" wrote the lawmakers. ""Due to the economic and housing instability wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 30-40 million Americansremain at risk of eviction; in January 2021, more than 20% of renters reported being behind on rent.""These evictions pose a severe threat to families and to public health, and people of color are disproportionately at risk of the harms of eviction. Communities of color and women have been hardest hit by job losses during the pandemic-with women of color at particular risk.""It is vital, with the recent wave of evictions nationwide caused by the pandemic, that these companies do not further disadvantage Americans looking to find safe and reliable housing,"" concluded the lawmakers. The senators have requested a response by no later than March 14, 2021. This letter is the latest in a broad series of oversight inquiries into concerns of bias in banking, health, criminal justice, and employment technology disproportionately impacting communities of color.Senator Booker has made expanding access to fair and affordable housing a priority during his time in office and going back his time as a tenant advocate in Newark. In 2017 Senator Booker he introduced the Tenant Protection Act which would reform tenant screening practices and regulate the companies that create these screening reports so that inaccurate or outdated information cannot be used to blacklist prospective tenants from accessing housing.The full text of the letter can be viewed here. ###

Specifically, the report shows that these provisions of the American Rescue Plan would collectively lift nearly 10 million children above or closer to the poverty line – including 2.3 million Black children, 4.1 million Latino children, and 441,000 Asian-American children. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, these changes would cut the remaining number of children in poverty by more than 40 percent. Additionally, the provisions will also increase income for nearly 17 million childless adults.  The DPCC report also includes new data compiled by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities on the state-by-state impact of the tax credit expansions. Click here to download the full report. “Our country is facing an economic crisis unlike anything we have seen in our lifetimes,” said Senator Booker. “Tens of millions of Americans, especially low-income communities and communities of color, are facing food insecurity and slipping deeper and deeper into the trap of poverty and debt because of this dual public health and economic crisis. An expanded Child Tax Credit and expanded EITC as a part of the American Rescue Plan aren’t just common sense policiesthat will set us up for a stronger long-term economic recovery, they will be lifelines for families and people who are struggling right now and need help.”  “Even before this pandemic, hard work wasn’t paying off for millions of workers,” said Senator Brown. “Wages have been flat for decades, while the cost of everything is up – particularly the cost of raising kids. After a year of being told their government can’t help them, Americans across the political spectrum, in all kinds of communities around the country, want us to go big and pass the American Rescue Plan. The EITC and CTC are a big part of that effort – these tax credits are two of the most effective tools to put money in the pockets of working people and pull children out of poverty. This plan will help deliver real, tangible results that make a difference in people’s lives.” “We are on the verge of doing more to eradicate child poverty than we have in generations,"" said Senator Bennet. ""Expanding these tax credits would boost incomes for nearly 300,000 workers in Colorado and benefit over one million kids statewide. This can’t come soon enough, and I'm going to do everything I can to get this over the finish line and then make these changes permanent going forward.” “Georgia voters voted for a bold response to this pandemic, and strengthening crucial federal investments for families helps us get as much direct relief to as many Georgians as possible—to buy food and diapers, pay for child care, purchase critical prescriptions and so much more. By increasing Georgians’ purchasing power through expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, we can put necessary resources right in people’s pockets that will also help stimulate local economies and the state economy as a whole,” said Senator Warnock. “These federal investments are the economically and morally sound options Congress can take to help hardworking Georgians weather the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.”  Senators Booker, Brown, and Bennet have worked extensively on expanding tax credits for working and middle class families. In 2019, all three Senators introduced the American Families Act and the  Working Families Tax Relief Act that would permanently expand the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit for children and low-income families.   ###

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-murray-wyden-re-introduce-resolution-recognizing-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-women-and-girls-globally,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Patty Murray (D-WA), Ron Wyden (D-OR) re-introduced a resolution recognizing the disproportionate impact that the coronavirus pandemic has had on women and girls globally. Specifically, the resolution urges Congress and the executive branch to protect the rights of women and girls in the United States and abroad, provide robust humanitarian aid that supports women and girls, and ensure that the needs of women and girls are part of the ongoing international response to the COVID–19 crisis.   During the pandemic, gender-based violence such as domestic violence, child marriage, and female genital mutilation has increased, and is expected to continue to increase. An additional 13,000,000 child marriages are expected by 2030, in addition to an increase of approximately 2,000,000 cases of female genital mutilation between 2020 and 2030. Women also comprise 70 percent of health care workers globally, yet often are not prioritized for the receipt of personal protective equipment, disproportionately exposing them to contracting COVID–19. Women and girls also perform three times the amount of unpaid care work in homes and in their communities as men - a burden that has increased during the COVID–19 crisis as women and girls are disproportionately responsible for caring for sick and elderly family and community members and children who are out of school-- limiting the ability of women and girls to perform income generating work, pursue education or skills building, or avoid exposure to COVID–19. ""COVID-19 has exposed and exacerbated the existing structural inequities facing women and girls globally, from increases in gender-based violence to worsening gender based disparities in lack of access to healthcare, education and economic security threatening to reverse decades of gains for women,"" said Senator Booker. “Developing a comprehensive international response to COVID-19 requires that we acknowledge, address and work to end the inequities and disparities that disproportionately harm the safety, health and economic security of women here at home and across the world.” “This pandemic has taken an outsized toll on women across the world as the health care, including reproductive health care, they need has become harder to get, economic security has become harder to attain, and gender-based violence has become more prevalent,” said Senator Murray. “We won’t fully recover from this pandemic until women recover—so we must address the specific health and economic burdens that women have experienced during this unprecedented time. And we cannot lose sight of the fact that this pandemic has only revealed and exacerbated the deep inequities that women have long faced, and must recommit to supporting women and girls and building a world where they can thrive.” “From an uptick in gender-based violence to a growing lack of access to health care and education, women and girls across the globe are too often bearing the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Senator Wyden. “ The United States has a moral obligation to address the barriers faced by women and girls who are doing their best to keep their families and communities safe throughout this crisis. That means ensuring their wellbeing is at the forefront of a global approach to tackle COVID-19.” Specifically, the resolution will do the following:          The following organizations have endorsed the resolution: CARE USA, Global Woman P.E.A.C.E.

Although the overall proportion of people of color working within the department full-time increased from 28 to 32 percent from 2002 to 2018, the proportion of women of color was lowest at management and executive levels. Additionally, although the overall proportion of people of color at the department did grow over this period,  the proportion of African Americans and women employed at the Department declined.  This lack of diversity can be tied in part to the Department’s internship program—often used as recruitment and hiring tool in every industry—which is mostly unpaid and fails to provide housing or travel assistance to Washington, D.C., or abroad. This barrier  prevents many low-income and students of color from applying to internships within the department and therefore from advancing to full employment.  ""For far too long, the State Department has failed to recruit low-income and students of color within their internship program largely due to it being unpaid,” said Senator Booker. “Having a diplomatic corps that represents the diverse makeup of the United States will increase the institutional knowledge and capacity of the State Department and improve our image abroad. The Department of State Student Internship Program Act will help level the playing field and ensure everyone from all backgrounds has an equal opportunity to achieve upward mobility.""  “I am proud to support this bipartisan legislation to ensure everyone—no matter their financial status—has the opportunity to gain experience with the Department of State,” said Senator Scott. “Our foreign service personnel play a key role in our nation’s success, and this act will ensure we are recruiting the best and brightest—a workforce that truly reflects the American people.” “This bill is the gold standard for how governmental internship programs should be structured. The bill focuses on payment, access, and opportunity and will allow working-class Americans the chance to be involved in our foreign policy without financial burden,” said Carlos Vera, Executive Director of Pay Our Interns. “We want to thank both Senator Booker and Scott, who have been leaders in making sure our democracy is accessible to all.”  Specifically, the Department of State Student Internship Program Act will do the following:        The full text of the bill can be viewed here.  ###"
https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-cornyn-murphy-collins-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-expand-access-to-tutoring-for-underserved-students,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), John Cornyn (R-TX), Chris Murphy (D-CT), and Susan Collins (D-ME) introduced a bipartisan bill, the Partnering Aspiring Teachers with High-Need Schools (PATHS) to Tutor Act, that will expand access to one-on-one and small group tutoring in underserved communities during the pandemic. The legislation will also strengthen the pipeline of future teachers by placing teacher-candidates into tutoring roles.  The coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated existing education inequities. According to a recent study done by McKinsey Analysis, lower income students are less likely to have access to high-quality remote learning, resulting in them being more likely to fall behind, exacerbating the achievement gap by 15 to 20 percent. Additionally, a study by the Policy Analysis for California Education (PACE) found low income students experienced a 7 percent decline in learning, while wealthier students had a 5 percent gain in learning.  “COVID-19 has exposed and exacerbated the deep structural inequities within our education system,” said Senator Booker. “It is unacceptable that many students of color and students from low-income families arebeing disproportionately denied the opportunity to access high-quality education during this crisis. The PATHS to Tutor Act will provide crucial resources to underfunded schools by expanding access to one-on-one and small group tutoring for the students who need it the most while also preparing the next generation of educators to succeed.”  “Sadly, far too many students in Texas do not receive the educational tools they need to succeed, and this issue has been compounded by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Senator Cornyn. ""The PATHS to Tutor Act will expand access to small group tutoring in high-need areas while simultaneously reducing economic burdens on our teachers by allowing this tutoring to count toward national service and their TEACH grant service requirement. Texas students deserve every resource we can give them to achieve on a level playing field, and this legislation will give them just that.” “The quick transition to remote learning caused by COVID-19 has disproportionately affected low-income students and created even more glaring inequities in our education system. I’m glad to team up with my colleagues to introduce this bipartisan legislation that supports high-quality tutoring programs to help address learning loss, while helping educators find new opportunities and allowing teachers in training to put their skills to immediate use in meeting this tremendous need,” said Senator Murphy.   “During the pandemic, too many students have fallen behind due to reduced in-person instruction and other challenges,” said Senator Collins.“By expanding access to high-quality group tutoring services for students who need it most, this bipartisan bill would support teachers while providing a boost to students to help them remain on course to achieve lifelong success.” Link to quotes from endorsed organizations and Universities  Specifically, the PATHS to Tutor Act, would do the following:    ·        TEACH Grant service requirements are amended to allow one-on-one tutoring and small group instruction to count toward the service obligation outlined in the Higher Education Act.  ·        The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) is instructed to recognize one-on-one tutoring and small group instruction programs as a national service  The following organization have endorsed the PATHS to Tutor Act: National Black Child Development Institute, Committee for Children, Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL), New Leaders, National Institute for Excellence in Teaching, Teaching Matters, Teach Plus, The School Superintendents Association (AASA), National Rural Education Association (NREA), National Rural Education Advocacy Consortium, Association of Educational Service Agencies, Teach For America, National Association of State Boards of Education (NASBE), TNTP, The Education Trust, The Learning Accelerator, Turnaround for Children, Deans for Impact The full text of the bill can be viewed here. ###

Together, these proposals are a necessary step in beginning to root out systemic racism in our institutions, creating proposals foraddressing and repairing for past harm, and building a more just nation forevery American.” “Inequality, systemic racism, and white supremacy are at the heart of every crisis we’re facing right now – the COVID-19 public health crisis disproportionately impacting communities of color, the crises of police brutality and mass incarceration, the crisis of poverty, and much more,” said Congresswoman Lee. “We’ve made substantial progress, but the legacy of systemic racism clearly shows that the chains of slavery have yet to be broken. This commission will educate and inform the public about the historical context for the current inequalities we witness each and every day. I’m proud to partner with Senator Booker on this effort, which is complimentary to the push for establishing a commission on reparations championed by Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, who I’m pleased is also a supporter if this legislation.

The Justice for Incarcerated Moms Act would create grant and model programs to better care for pregnant people who are incarcerated, commission a study on the maternal health crisis within our prison system, and end the practice of shackling pregnant people. Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) introduced the House companion to this bill earlier this month.In the past three decades, the number of incarcerated women in the United States has drastically increased by 742 percent, with a majority of them being in childbearing years. Additionally, according to recent studies,incarcerated pregnant people have a higher likelihood than non-incarcerated pregnant people of experiencing poverty, suffering from a substance use disorder, and other risk factors that can lead to adverse maternal health outcomes.“As the rest of the world works to improve maternal health outcomes, skyrocketing maternal mortality and morbidity rates here in the United States, and more specifically within our prison system, are precipitating a public health crisis,” said Senator Booker. “We cannot continue to profess to be the land of liberty and justice for all and ignore the maternal health crisis that is disproportionately putting mothers of color and incarcerated people at risk. The Justice for Incarcerated Moms Act will work to address the maternal health crisis in our prisons and ensure all mothers are provided with the best care during and after their pregnancy.” “Incarcerated mothers face heightened risk for maternal mortality and other complications, with incarcerated Black women facing particular risks,” said Senator Durbin. “I am proud to support the Justice forIncarcerated Moms Act in order to establish programs for pregnant and postpartum moms who are incarcerated. With this bill, we can ensure these moms get the care they need to have healthy and safe pregnancies and deliveries.”“Our incarceration system is ill-equipped to handle the growing numbers of mothers and pregnant women entering the nation’s jails and prisons. Unfortunately, this failure disproportionately impacts Black women, who are imprisoned at twice the rate of white women and who are three times more likely to die from pregnancy related causes as white women,” said Senator Hirono. “The Justice for Incarcerated Moms Act introduces common sense reforms—such as creating maternal health programs and strengthening visitation policies—to protect the health and dignity of incarcerated women.” “A safe pregnancy should be a right not a privilege, and every person should be able to experience their pregnancy without worrying if they will survive delivery or make it to their child’s first birthday—including women behind the wall,” said Congresswoman Pressley. “The Justice forIncarcerated Moms Act would center the dignity of pregnant people behind the wall by creating systems to protect the health and dignity of incarcerated people and enlist them as partners in our fight for justice and equity. I am grateful for the partnership of Senators Booker, Durbin and Hirono, and look forward to continuing our work to end the maternal mortality crisis once and for all.” Specifically, the Justice for Incarcerated Moms Act would:     The Justice for Incarcerated Mothers is 1 of 12 individual bills that are a part of the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021, recently introduced by Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), Representative Lauren Underwood (IL-14) and Representative Alma Adams (NC-12) -- along with Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Gary Peters (D-MI), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Edward Markey (D-MA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Tina Smith (D-MN), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Raphael Warnock (D-GA) and Members of the Black Maternal Health Caucus. The legislation would help save moms’ lives, end racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes, and achieve maternal health justice for Black women and all women and birthing people of color.  Full text of the legislation can be found here.  # # #

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/02/26/2021/booker-statement-on-governor-murphy-signing-historic-adult-use-cannabis-reform-bills-into-law,"NEWARK, NJ – Today, U.S. Senator Cory Booker, Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Criminal Justice and Counterterrorism, issued the following statement on New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signing historic adult-use cannabis reform bills into law: “The failed War on Drugs has systematically targeted people of color and the poor, disproportionately impacting Black and Brown communities and hurting families in New Jersey and across our nation. Today is a historic day, and I applaud Governor Murphy, the legislature, and the many advocates for racial and social justice whose leadership is ensuring that New Jersey is at the forefront of equitable marijuana legalization policy. I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to end the federal marijuana prohibition so we can finally begin healing the wounds of decades of injustice.” Booker has been a leader on criminal justice reform in the Senate, authoring landmark legislation to end the federal prohibition on marijuana. Earlier this month, Booker was joined by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) in announcing that they are working on comprehensive cannabis reform legislation in the Senate. ###

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-blumenthal-introduce-comprehensive-legislation-to-address-covid-19-crisis-in-nursing-homes,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) introduced the Quality Care for Nursing Home Residents and Workers During COVID-19 Act. Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky introduced the House companion to this bill, H.R. 598, in late January. This legislation will protect the health and well-being of those living and working in nursing homes by increasing resources for infection control and prevention, testing, and personal protective equipment; surging funding for strike teams to the hardest hit nursing homes; mandating transparency and reporting of COVID-19 cases and fatalities; and requiring the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to conduct better oversight, including inspections and guidance. While more than 166,000 residents and workers at nursing homes and other long term care facilities were estimated to have died from COVID-19, as of December 2020, accounting for 36 percent of COVID-19 deaths in the United States, we still do not know the full extent of COVID-19 cases and fatalities among residents or the workers who care for them. “Across the country, residents and workers at nursing homes and long-term care facilities have been devastated by COVID-19,” said Senator Booker. “Our bill will help enable nursing home facilities to do everything in their power to keep residents and staff safe from COVID-19, improve quality of care for nursing home residents and ensure they can remain connected to their families, empower nursing home workers with the training, tools, and resources they need, and ensure greater transparency and oversight. Nursing home residents and their families deserve to have the peace of mind knowing that they are safe and cared for.” “This bill introduces new standards to ensure the safety of nursing home residents, protect the workers who heroically care for them, and guarantee much needed transparency,” said Senator Blumenthal. “It also expands residents’ ability to virtually connect with loved ones, alleviating the loneliness and uncertainty that has accompanied this crisis. We can and must do more to protect our most vulnerable members of society, and this bill a first step in the right direction.” “The COVID-19 crisis in our nation’s nursing homes and long-term care facilities is a national tragedy that demands a strong response. This legislation will finally offer that to the millions of the older Americans, individuals with disabilities, and dedicated workers who rely on nursing homes for their lives and livelihoods,” said Congresswoman Schakowsky. “Over the past year, we have failed to adequately protect our nation’s nursing homes from the spread of COVID-19, and thousands of residents and staff have unnecessarily died. I urge all of my colleagues in the House and Senate to support the inclusion of these vital COVID-19 protections in the next relief package.” Specifically, the Quality Care for Nursing Home Residents and Workers During COVID-19 Act would immediately address our inadequate federal response to the COVID-19 crisis in our nursing homes by guaranteeing:         Blumenthal and Booker also introduced the Quality Care for Nursing Home Residents Act that ensures overall better care and support fornursing home facilities.   Full text of the bill can be found here ###

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-to-chair-senate-judiciary-subcommittee-on-criminal-justice-and-counterterrorism,"Washington, DC -- US Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) will chair the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Criminal Justice and Counterterrorism in the 117th Congress. Booker will be the first Black chair of a Senate Judiciary subcommittee.  “Our nation’s broken criminal justice system is a stain on the soul of our country, the result of decades of failed policies that have broken apart families and communities and have not made us safer,” Booker said. “The burden of this broken system has been disproportionately and dramatically borne by Black and brown Americans, and the poor. It’s past time forchange. “Congress has made progress in starting to turn the tide in recent years, and now is a time of great promise. I look forward to continuing and strengthening my partnership with Chairman Durbin to further advance reforms to our policing and criminal justice system.” The subcommittee’s jurisdiction includes oversight of: the Justice Department’s Criminal Division; the Drug Enforcement Administration; COPS and other law enforcement grant programs; the Bureau of Prisons; the US Sentencing Commission; the Office of National Drug Control Policy; the Department of Homeland Security’s functions that relate to anti-terrorism enforcement and policy; and more. Booker has made championing reforms of America’s broken criminal justice system a top priority during his time in the Senate. His numerous criminal justice reform proposals have included the Marijuana Justice Act, the Fair Chance Act, the CARERS Act, the MERCY Act, the Dignity forIncarcerated Women Act, the Second Look Act, and most recently theJustice in Policing Act. He was also a key architect of the most sweeping overhaul of the criminal justice system in decades, the First Step Act, which was signed into law in 2018. More recently, Booker introduced a sweeping follow up proposal, the Next Step Act, to further advance the cause of criminal justice reform. Booker was appointed to the Senate Judiciary Committee in January 2018. # # #

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/sens-booker-warren-and-rep-khanna-seek-answers-from-federal-trade-commission-on-investigation-into-tysons-misleading-advertisements-to-consumers,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Representative Ro Khanna (D-CA) sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Acting Associate Director for the Division of Advertising Practices Serena Viswanathan and the FTC’s four commissioners asking for an update on the department’s investigation into recent allegations against Tyson Foods for knowingly making false and misleading descriptions of their operations and what actions could be taken at the conclusion of the investigation. The investigation into Tyson Foods stem from complaints that allege that for the purposes of willfully misleading consumers, Tyson Foods made untrue claims about safe labor conditions and close relationships with independent family farms, and advertised their meats as being produced in a natural, environmentally sustainable way.  “Marketing and advertising tactics that knowingly mislead or misinform the public are unacceptable and illegal,” the lawmakers wrote to the Federal Trade Commission. “The alleged misinformation employed by Tyson to sell its products may provide the company with an unfair advantage over its competitors, many of which are truly independent and family owned and do treat their animals more humanely. It is also unfair to consumers, who increasingly opt for products that are sustainable, that are humanely raised, and that abide by high labor standards, and who are often willing to pay a premium for these products.” The lawmakers continued, “Tyson’s alleged willful misrepresentation of its practices, if proved, would not only be poor behavior; it would also be in direct violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act). While such practices are harmful in ordinary circumstances, the COVID-19 pandemic has shined a light on our broken food system and created urgency in addressing potential abuses.”  Specifically, Senators Booker, Warren, and Representative Khannarequested responses to the following questions:      The full text of the letter can be found here and below.   Serena ViswanathanActing Associate Director, Division of Advertising PracticesBureau of Consumer ProtectionFederal Trade Commission600 Pennsylvania Avenue NWWashington, D.C. 20580 Dear Acting Associate Director Viswanathan, We write to express concern about complaints submitted to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requesting an investigation into Tyson Foods, Inc.’s (Tyson) misleading advertising to consumers. It has been alleged that Tyson has been making false and misleading claims about its poultry products and the labor, sustainability, and animal welfare practices utilized in production. The allegations in these complaints raise serious questions about competition as well as consumer trust. The recent complaints claim that Tyson has been employing false and misleading descriptions of their operations, particularly as it relates to its network of “independent” family farms and safe labor conditions. The company claims in response that its meat is produced in a natural, environmentally sustainable way. Marketing and advertising tactics that knowingly mislead or misinform the public are unacceptable and illegal. The alleged misinformation employed by Tyson to sell its products may provide the company with an unfair advantage over its competitors, many of which are truly independent and family owned and do treat their animals more humanely. It is also unfair to consumers, who increasingly opt for products that are sustainable, that are humanely raised, and that abide by high labor standards, and who are often willing to pay a premium for these products.  Tyson’s alleged willful misrepresentation of its practices, if proved, would not only be poor behavior; it would also be in direct violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act). While such practices are harmful in ordinary circumstances, the COVID-19 pandemic has shined a light on our broken food system and created urgency in addressing potential abuses. We request that the FTC, which is charged with enforcing civil antitrust law and protecting consumers, investigate this serious matter.  Specifically, we request responses to the following questions: 1. What is the status of the FTC’s investigation of Tyson Foods’ alleged false marketing?  2. What penalties under the FTC Act are applied to cases of willful false advertising, and how will this inform the potential actions that FTC takes in response to its findings?  We look forward to learning more about what actions the FTC is considering taking in response to the claims of Tyson’s false advertisements. Thank you foryour attention to this important matter.  Sincerely, Cory A. Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Ro Khanna CC:The Honorable Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, Acting ChairThe Honorable Noah Phillips, CommissionerThe Honorable Rohit Chopra, CommissionerThe Honorable Christine S. Wilson, Commissioner ###

https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/02/26/2021/booker-warren-gillibrand-smith-warnock-and-leahy-announce-comprehensive-bill-to-address-the-history-of-discrimination-in-federal-agricultural-policy,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Tina Smith (D-MN), Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) announced landmark legislation aimed at addressing and correcting historic discrimination within the U.S. Department of Agriculture in federal farm assistance and lending that has caused Black farmers to lose millions of acres of farmland and robbed Black farmers and their families of the hundreds of billions of dollars of inter-generational wealth that land represented. Senator Booker originally introduced the legislation in 2020. In 1920 there were nearly 1 million Black farmers in the United States. Today, due to this history of discrimination, it is estimated that there are less than 50,000 remaining Black farmers. The Justice for Black Farmers Act will enact policies to end discrimination within the USDA, protect remaining Black farmers from losing their land, provide land grants to create a new generation of Black farmers and restore the land base that has been lost, and implement systemic reforms to help family farmers across the United States. ""Overtly discriminatory and unjust federal policy has robbed Black families in the United States of the ability to build and pass on intergenerational wealth,” said Senator Booker. “When it comes to farming and agriculture, we know that there is a direct connection between discriminatory policies within the USDA and the enormous land loss we have seen among Black farmers over the past century. The Justice for Black Farmers Act will address and correct USDA discrimination and take bold steps to forgive debt and restore the land that has been lost in order to empower a new generation of Black farmers to succeed and thrive. As a new member on the Agriculture committee, I am proud to re-introduce this landmark legislation alongside  my colleagues as we work to correct this historic injustice.” “For decades, racist policies have robbed Black farmers of the economic opportunity to thrive in our country's agricultural industry. I'm glad to cosponsor Senator Booker's bill, which goes a long way toward restoring and protecting property rights of Black farmers, rooting out discriminatory policies, and providing Black farmers with the necessary tools to succeed,” said Senator Warren. “Black farmers and ranchers have been historically excluded in agricultural industries. Inequities in federal policies have stripped them of their land and denied them federal aid. It is not only our responsibility to investigate this systemic discrimination, but we must end and correct it, so that the next generation of Black farmers can grow – especially as we help farmers across the country recover from the economic crisis,” said Senator Gillibrand, member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. “The Justice for Black Farmers Act will put an end to discriminatory practices that have harmed Black agricultural producers for more than a hundred years. I thank Senator Booker for his leadership on this issue and I’m proud to cosponsor this legislation to make farming more equitable and inclusive.” “We have to acknowledge that the USDA has a history of institutionalized discrimination against Black farmers and farmers of color. That is the history we cannot look away from,” said Senator Smith. “At a recent Senate Agriculture Committee hearing, I brought up the need to create equitable credit access for diverse farmers—including the Black, Hmong, Latino and Native American farmers in my state of Minnesota—because these are the types things we need to be working to address. This historic legislation is needed so we can help create a future that empowers more farmers to succeed.” “The Justice for Black Farmers Act is essential legislation that will help level the playing field for Black farmers in Georgia and across our nation who for too long have been denied the true promise of the American Dream. While we work on getting immediate relief to farmers of color to help them move behind this current health and economic crisis, I look forward to fighting alongside Senator Booker to get this bill passed and signed into law,” said Senator Reverend Warnock. “The Justice for Black Farmers Act is the most ambitious legislative proposal ever developed to address historic and ongoing discrimination against Black farmers,” said John Boyd, Founder and President of the National Black Farmers Association (NBFA). “As NBFA and the Environmental Working Group recently documented, Black farmers have been systemically denied access to land, subsidies, loans and other critical tools through government and private discrimination, and the institutional racism that has driven Black land loss is being reinforced through the USDA’s broken policies. By providing new access to land and credit and providing debt relief, the Justice for Black Farmers Act will help right these historic wrongs. By providing new oversight and accountability within the USDA, the Justice for Black Farmers Act will help address the roots of the USDA’s racist history. By making an unprecedented investment in training through historically Black colleges and universities and groups like the National Black Farmers Association, the Justice forBlack Farmers Act will ensure that Black farmers have the tools they need to succeed. These reforms are long overdue. We applaud the leadership of Sens. Booker, Warren, Gillibrand, Warnock and Smith, and we urge Congress to act swiftly to address USDA’s long history of discrimination against Black Farmers.” ""The Justice For Black Farmers Act is an incredibly important step towards addressing the harm that Black farmers and land stewards have suffered and continue to endure,” said Dara Cooper, Executive Director of the National Black Food and Justice Alliance. “This is one very important opportunity towards addressing the state of emergency that Black farmers and land stewards continue to face. Considering Black farming communities have been reduced by an alarming 98%, we are sounding the alarm that it is long past due to address the unfinished business that farmer activists have been calling for quite some time. Let us all rally behind this important piece of legislation and make sure it passes. It is the least we can do for Black farmers and our failing food system.""  Specifically, the Justice for Black Farmers Act will:        The full text of the bill can be viewed here.
