Barrasso. “In addition to facing record-high inflation, this would make it even harder for families, farmers, and small businesses to get by. Our legislation would stop the IRS from using any supersized funds for audits on hardworking taxpayers making less than $400,000. The people of Wyoming and across the country want nothing to do with the Democrats’ plan to run the middle class dry.”“The hardworking people of Wyoming should not be subjected to frivolous audits to help pay for the Democrats’ reckless tax and spending spree,” said Sen. Lummis. “The IRS should never have received this massive increase in funding. This commonsense legislation will ensure that everyday, hardworking American citizens are protected from gross IRS overreach.”This legislation would prevent the IRS from using any of the supersized $80 billion of funding for audits on hardworking Wyoming taxpayers and small businesses with taxable incomes below $400,000.###"

In addition, it provides regulatory certainty and expedites permitting of key projects.“Important infrastructure, highway, and energy projects across the country are being strangled by the red tape coming out of the Biden administration,” said Sen. Barrasso. “Road and bridge safety projects that take months to build are now taking years to permit. Energy projects are being hijacked by open-ended and far-reaching ‘climate change’ reviews. We need to focus on making the permitting process easier, not harder. Our legislation makes key reforms that will help energy and infrastructure projects get done better, faster, cheaper, and smarter.”“Critical infrastructure and energy projects in Wyoming, as well as across the country, face a constant uphill battle when trying to bring projects online under the Biden Administration. The onslaught of overly burdensome environmental regulations and red tape have caused unnecessary delays and, in many cases, brought projects to a grinding halt,” said Sen. Lummis. “I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing this commonsense permitting reform bill to expedite approval of essential projects.”Full text of the legislation can be found here.A section by section summary of the legislation can be found here.###"

The proposed changes could negatively impact automobile dealers across the Cowboy State as well as Wyoming citizens looking to purchase a car.“This proposed rule would fundamentally change the way that vehicles are retailed in America. If implemented, this proposal would confuse customers, lengthen the transaction time to purchase a vehicle, limit consumer choice, increase paperwork, and mandate burdensome new record keeping requirements on small businesses. More troubling, the FTC appears not to have done any consumer testing to ascertain whether its new regulatory regime would work in practice,” the senators said in the letter. The FTC’s proposed rule, published in the Federal Register on July 13, 2022, would create burdensome new reporting requirements on auto companies that provide direct financing to their customers. Additionally, the FTC did not give advance notice of this proposed rulemaking and only allowed for a 60-day comment period for a rule that will fundamentally alter a trillion-dollar industry. Read the full letter here. ### "

The Preventing PFAS Runoff at Airports Actwould allow commercial airports to leverage additional existing Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) funding to purchase devices necessary to test their firefighting equipment without discharging toxic polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS chemicals. This legislation would incentivize commercial airports to purchase the relatively low-cost devices – also referred to as an input-based testing system – to help limit and prevent exposure to PFAS, which are known as “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down.“PFAS contaminations around airports is a serious problem with a very easy solution. With simple testing solutions that are already funded under the Federal Aviation Administration’s Airport Improvement Program, we can protect the environment without creating more burdensome regulations on small airports around Wyoming,” said Senator Lummis. “I am thrilled this important legislation passed the Senate, and I hope the House will pass it quickly.”The FAA has required commercial airports nationwide to use firefighting foam that contains toxic PFAS chemicals. For years airports were required to discharge this foam as part of routine, federally-mandated testing of their firefighting equipment. This puts firefighters, the environment and the public at risk from exposure to toxic PFAS chemicals. The Preventing PFAS Runoff at Airports Act would make more funding from the FAA’s Airport Improvement Program available to commercial airports to purchase devices that avoid discharging PFAS chemicals when testing firefighting equipment. Currently, seven Wyoming airports are eligible for this PFAS remediation funding.To read the bill, click here.###"

https://www.lummis.senate.gov/press-releases/lummis-pushes-back-on-administrations-anti-coal-actions/,"August 15, 2022Lummis calls the moratorium on coal lease sales “lunacy,” applauds industry appealWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), applauded the decision by the National Mining Association to appeal a district court decision to reinstate the Biden administration’s disastrous decision to place a moratorium on coal lease sales on federal lands.“I am glad that this decision will be appealed. Despite what some climate catastrophists might say, coal is still necessary for our nation’s energy mix. American coal from federal lands, especially Wyoming coal, is among the cleanest burning and has provided reliable, affordable, base-load energy for decades. While the rest of the world continues to develop fossil fuels, it is lunacy to limit our own nation’s ability to fuel our homes and industry. I am proud of Wyoming’s historical contribution to powering our nation and I will never stop fighting to further this legacy.”Wyoming is the top coal-producing state in the nation, representing more than 40% of the annual U.S. coal supply. Wyoming coal is considered “super compliant” by environmental requirements, meaning the burning of Wyoming coal emits minimal amounts of sulfur into the atmosphere. Coal is essential for electricity generation and 90% of coal mined in the United States is used to generate electricity. In 2021, 21% of electricity in the U.S. was generated by coal.###"

It is important that the Federal Reserve also includes clear deadlines for the master account review process,” said Senator Lummis. “I am now looking forward to some clear answers for the Special Purpose Depository Institutions in Wyoming that have been waiting for master accounts for over two years.” Wyoming has spent the last four years developing expertise in digital assets and the future of finance. In 2019, the Wyoming Legislature passed HB 74 which created special purpose depository institutions as a new custodial bank charter to responsibly integrate digital assets into the U.S. financial system. Today’s step by the Fed was also welcomed by Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon. “After urging the Federal Reserve to act for more than a year, we welcome these guidelines as another step forward in our effort to lead the nation in the digital asset realm,” Governor Gordon said. “Wyoming’s innovation and commitment to developing a regulatory environment for these institutions is reflected in the years of work that have brought us to this point.” Read the Federal Reserve’s release here. Senator Lummis was also encouraged by the Federal Reserve’s embrace of digital assets after the release of an outline for Fed-regulated banks to begin providing digital asset services. “This is an important step forward to the full integration of digital assets into our financial system. There is still work to be done, and Congress needs to vote on and pass the Lummis-Gillibrand Digital Asset Framework to give industry and regulators the clarity they need to promote innovation and protect consumers.” Read the guidance here.  ###"

Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) voted against the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, a partisan spending packaged jammed through the Senate by Democrat leadership without a single Republican vote.“I could not support this legislation that raises taxes on Wyoming families and pushes Green New Deal priorities that will harm domestic energy production. Record high inflation continues to harm people in Wyoming, as they struggle to afford basic goods and services. The last thing Washington should be doing right now is raising taxes that will harm low and middle class families, but that’s exactly what this bill does,” said Sen. Lummis. “These job killing tax hikes do nothing to help the American people, only provide Democrats with a pathway to pay for insane environmental regulations. This bill attacks our fossil fuel industry, which not only causes prices to go up for every family in Wyoming, but it also puts into place unrealistic measures to cut carbon emissions that will cost millions of jobs and hundreds of billions of dollars.”During the Senate’s vote-a-rama, Sen. Lummis voted in support of commonsense amendments that would secure the border, provide meaningful permitting reform, and protect people in Wyoming from IRS overreach. Senate democrats struck down these amendments.  Sen. Lummis offered an amendment to the bill to cut unnecessary new greenhouse gas monitoring programs and provide actual environmental benefits by clearing superfund sites. Sen. Lummis is committed to focusing on actual environmental issues, such as superfund remediation, rather than spending billions of dollars on climate change programs that will not benefit the people of Wyoming.

The bill also restores previous NCUA authority to examine credit union service providers and mirrors the provisions of the Bank Service Company Act. ###"

Nothing in this legislation changes current safety and proficiency procedures for commercial pilots. Pilots will continue to be held to an incredibly high standard to ensure passenger safety.###"

Even though they are unscientific and can result in more burdensome regulations, the measurement theories have been used in the federal government to determine the economic impact of potential federal regulations. This bill would prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, the Interior Department, the Council on Environmental Quality, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of the Treasury, the US Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Health and Human Services from using the social cost of carbon, social cost of methane, and social cost of nitrous oxide as rationales for their regulations.###"

https://www.lummis.senate.gov/press-releases/wy-delegation-blasts-blm-for-secretive-land-acquisition-in-wyoming/,"June 23, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Liz Cheney, all R-Wyo., sent a letter to Department of the Interior (DOI) Secretary Haaland blasting DOI for the lack of transparency in its recent, massive acquisition of land in Natrona and Carbon Counties.In the letter, the delegation notes how the administration didn’t involve the public, local and state officials in the process and failed to consider the impacts of lost revenue on local communities. The delegation specifically urges DOI to neutralize the Bureau of Land Management’s expansion of the federal footprint in Wyoming by identifying equivalent disposal opportunities elsewhere in the state. They also call for the reinstatement of a previous DOI policy requiring local and state support before the federal government can acquire more land.  “However, because the federal government already owns and controls nearly half of Wyoming’s lands, we question the BLM’s need to purchase and acquire vast amounts of additional lands in our state—especially if such acquisitions are not accompanied by equivalent federal land disposals,” the delegation wrote. “Also, we are troubled that there appears to have been no coordination or communication between BLM and state and local officials prior to the purchase and acquisition, and that no notice was given prior to the June 2 announcement.”Click here for a copy of the letter.  June 23, 2022Dear Secretary Haaland,On June 2, 2022, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) announced its largest Wyoming land purchase in history, a 35,670-acre acquisition of private property spanning Carbon and Natrona counties. The BLM purchased this land using $21 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). No prior notice was given to local, state, or federal officials, stakeholders, or Wyoming citizens.We steadfastly respect private property rights, and the rights of individual landowners to sell to willing buyers. We also understand the desire to increase access to our public lands so that all Americans can enjoy them. However, because the federal government already owns and controls nearly half of Wyoming’s lands, we question the BLM’s need to purchase and acquire vast amounts of additional lands in our state—especially if such acquisitions are not accompanied by equivalent federal land disposals. Also, we are troubled that there appears to have been no coordination or communication between BLM and state and local officials prior to the purchase and acquisition, and that no notice was given prior to the June 2 announcement. We supported former Secretary Bernhardt’s requirement in Secretary’s Order 3388 for any federal acquisitions made using LWCF funds to be supported by the affected Governor and local county or county government-equivalent.While federally-owned lands can offer opportunities such as recreation, tourism, and wildlife habitat, they can also yield costly drawbacks. For instance, when the federal government owns land in a county, the county cannot collect property tax on that acreage and such losses need to be offset by additional federal spending through the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) Program. In addition, in spite of major recent investments, federal land management agencies continue to struggle to adequately address significant maintenance needs. Consequently, additional federal acquisitions only serve to add to this backlog, further diminishing land management agencies’ ability to effectively manage lands and assets. We are also troubled by this Administration’s policies regarding management of public lands. The so-called 30 by 30 initiative, though ill-defined, appears to be intended to grow the federal footprint and expand federal control over western lands. In fact, in its announcement of the land acquisition, BLM stated that the project supports the Administration’s initiative “to conserve 30 percent of the nation’s lands and waters by 2030,” further confirming fears that 30 by 30 will be ‘achieved’ through land acquisitions.In Wyoming, we know that private landowners and local officials are the best stewards for lands within our state. Federal ownership of land has not, and never will be, equivalent to conservation. I would urge both the Department and the Bureau to make decisions based upon what’s best for the land, not what might be in the Administration’s political interests.For the above-mentioned reasons, we urge you to neutralize BLM’s recent expansion of the federal footprint in Wyoming by identifying equivalent disposal opportunities elsewhere in the State. We further urge you to reinstate former Secretary Bernhardt’s policy to ensure local and state approval prior to federal land acquisitions. Finally, in cases where determinations have been made to purchase and acquire new lands, we implore you to provide better notice to relevant officials, stakeholders, and citizens, and quickly and adequately counteract losses to local revenues.###"

This letter is a follow-up to one sent by a number of House members in April 2022 which misunderstood many of the realities and data relating to digital asset miners.“As you know, a substantial portion of digital asset miners’ energy use is based on renewable sources. Additionally, many miners use other power sources, like natural gas, that may otherwise go unused. JAI Energy in Wyoming is an example of a company that is working with oil and gas producers to make a positive environmental impact through bitcoin mining. Bitcoin mining that utilizes flared gas is also reducing methane emissions in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, West Virginia, Ohio, and North Dakota. This private sector-led breakthrough is an important tool to a lower emission future. Finally, digital asset mining can have a substantial stabilizing effect on energy grids. It maintains robust baseload levels, yet it can be switched off quickly in times of peak demand.”Senator Lummis and Representative McHenry are joined by Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Steve Daines (R-MT), and Representatives Pete Sessions (R-TX), Bill Posey (R-FL), Bill Huizenga (R-MI), Tom Emmer (R-MN), Anthony Gonzalez (R-OH), William Timmons (R-SC), Andy Barr (R-KY), Brian Steil (R-WI), and Ralph Norman (R-SC).Read the full letter here.###"

John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Liz Cheney, all R-Wyo., sent a letter to the Department of Transportation requesting timely assistance to help Yellowstone National Park and its gateway communities repair the damage caused by recent historic and unprecedented flooding.In the letter, the delegation specifically calls on the Biden administration to provide emergency relief funds to help begin the immediate repair of critical infrastructure needed to restore park operations. “The timely and efficient delivery of funds is imperative to restoring park operations and helping gateway communities. We urge you to use all of your current authorities and funding to help National Park Service address this disaster,” the delegation wrote. “Your ability to quickly and effectively respond to the infrastructure and disaster-response needs of the Park Service will have an immense impact on Yellowstone, its millions of annual visitors, and the gateway communities whose economies depend on the park.”Click here for a copy of the letter.  June 17, 2022Dear Secretary Buttigieg,Yellowstone National Park, the nation’s first National Park which attracts over four million visitors annually, has received historic and unprecedented flooding. During the week of June 12, severe rainfall produced historic floodwaters and rockslides, causing significant damage to vital infrastructure in and around the park, including roads and bridges. This damage has created substantial interruptions to park operations that will continue to occur until repairs can be made. The timely and efficient delivery of funds is imperative to restoring park operations and helping gateway communities. We urge you to use all of your current authorities and funding to help National Park Service address this disaster. We request that the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provide Emergency Relief funds to help begin emergency repairs. In the near term, we ask the FHWA to immediately provide ample sums of its “quick release” Emergency Relief funds in order to fulfill the Park Service’s initial needs. Once such funding has been provided, we ask that FHWA continue to deliver sufficient emergency funding to Yellowstone National Park on an as-needed basis for critical emergency repairs and resiliency improvements. In particular, the Emergency Relief for Federally Owned Roads Program (ERFO)— which assists the National Park Service with the repair or reconstruction of federal roads and infrastructure with severe damage from natural disasters or from catastrophic failure— should be utilized to the fullest extent needed.As Yellowstone’s infrastructure is rebuilt, we ask that you consider any future funding requests from Federal, State, and local partners to help repair damaged infrastructure and boost resiliency to any future natural disasters. This includes any potential applications through the Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, Efficient, and Cost-saving Transportation (PROTECT) program or the Nationally Significant Multimodal Freight & Highway Projects program (known as the INFRA program).Your ability to quickly and effectively respond to the infrastructure and disaster-response needs of the Park Service will have an immense impact on Yellowstone, its millions of annual visitors, and the gateway communities whose economies depend on the park.###"
https://www.lummis.senate.gov/press-releases/lummis-gillibrand-introduce-landmark-legislation-to-create-regulatory-framework-for-digital-assets/,"June 7, 2022Bipartisan Responsible Financial Innovation Act Addresses CFTC And SEC Jurisdiction, Stablecoin Regulation, Banking, Tax Treatment Of Digital Assets, And Interagency Coordination, Including An Advisory Committee.Lummis-Gillibrand Focuses On Flexibility, Innovation, Transparency And Consumer Protections In Order To Integrate Digital Assets Into Existing Law And Provide Certainty To The Growing Industry.Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), member of the Senate Banking Committee, introduced the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, landmark bipartisan legislation that will create a complete regulatory framework for digital assets that encourages responsible financial innovation, flexibility, transparency and robust consumer protections while integrating digital assets into existing law. To date, the Lummis-Gillibrand bill is the most substantial and comprehensive bipartisan effort to provide certainty and clarity to the growing digital asset and blockchain industries.“The United States is the global financial leader, and to ensure the next generation of Americans enjoys greater opportunity, it is critical to integrate digital assets into existing law and to harness the efficiency and transparency of this asset class while addressing risk. My home state of Wyoming has gone to great lengths to lead the nation in digital asset regulation, and I want to bring that success to the federal level. As this industry continues to grow, it is critical that Congress carefully crafts legislation that promotes innovation while protecting the consumer against bad actors,” said Senator Lummis. “The Responsible Financial Innovation Act, a bipartisan framework that I crafted in conjunction with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, creates regulatory clarity for agencies charged with supervising digital asset markets, provides a strong, tailored regulatory framework for stablecoins, and integrates digital assets into our existing tax and banking laws. I am grateful for Senator Gillibrand’s partnership on this legislation, and I look forward to bringing more of our colleagues into this effort.”“Digital assets, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies have experienced tremendous growth in the past few years and offer substantial potential benefits if harnessed correctly. It is critical that the United States play a leading role in developing policy to regulate new financial products, while also encouraging innovation and protecting consumers,” said Senator Gillibrand. “The bipartisan Responsible Financial Innovation Act is a landmark bill that will establish a regulatory framework that spurs innovation, develops clear standards, defines appropriate jurisdictional boundaries and protects consumers. Importantly, the Lummis-Gillibrand framework will provide clarity to both industry and regulators, while also maintaining the flexibility to account for the ongoing evolution of the digital assets market. I am proud to introduce this bipartisan bill with Senator Cynthia Lummis, who has been a passionate and engaged partner, and look forward to working alongside her to build support.”Lummis and Gillibrand have worked for months to craft the bipartisan package, first announcing the effort in March 2022. Their respective committee assignments laid the groundwork for the partnership: Gillibrand serves on the Agriculture Committee, which has oversight over the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which regulates commodities markets. Lummis serves on the Banking Committee, which has oversight over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which regulates securities.The full text of the bill is available here, in addition to a section-by-section overview. You can find statements of support from industry stakeholders here.Read the senators’ joint Medium post about their bill here.The Responsible Financial Innovation Act, also known as Lummis-Gillibrand, contains the following provisions:Creates a clear standard for determining which digital assets are commodities and what types are securities, providing clarity and structure for businesses and regulators. The bill makes a clear distinction between digital assets that are securities and commodities by looking at the purpose of the asset and the rights or powers it conveys the consumer, giving digital asset companies the ability to determine what their regulatory obligations will be and giving regulators the clarity they need to enforce existing securities and commodities trading laws.Creates clear definitions. There is no common set of definitions for digital assets today. Lummis-Gillibrand creates definitions that will enable discussions about digital asset regulation to take place in a consistent way, and for all Americans to know the laws that affect them.Assigns regulatory authority over digital asset spot markets to the CFTC. Understanding that most digital assets are much more similar to commodities than securities, the bill gives the CFTC clear authority over applicable digital asset spot markets, which aligns well with their current purview over other commodity markets. Digital assets that meet the definition of a commodity, such as bitcoin and ether, which comprise more than half of digital asset market capitalization, will be regulated by the CFTC.Defines and creates requirements for stablecoins that will protect consumers and markets and promote faster payments. Payment stablecoins are increasing in use and adoption and when structured appropriately, could provide consumers with faster, more secure means of payments. Lummis-Gillibrand establishes 100% reserve, asset type and detailed disclosure requirements for all payment stablecoin issuers. This guarantees that a payment stablecoin holder can always redeem the stablecoin in exchange for the equivalent dollar value, which maintains its value and protects consumers from many of the potential risks associated with stablecoins. The bill also sets forth a detailed, optional framework for all banks and credit unions to issue payment stablecoins. The bill also authorizes a special depository institution charter under both state law and theNational Bank Act for payment stablecoin issuance, with tailored capital requirements and holding company supervision. The bill does not require all payment stablecoin issuers to become depository institutions.Creates an advisory committee to develop guiding principles, empower regulatory agencies and advise lawmakers on fast-developing technology. The bill creates an advisory committee composed of a diverse set of stakeholders, including industry, advocacy groups, federal and state regulators, and subject matter experts knowledgeable in consumer protection, consumer education, financial literacy and financial inclusion. The committee is key to flexibility and for responding to rapid developments in the industry. It will continuously study the quickly changing industry and make recommendations based on new developments so that regulations remain relevant and effective.Imposes disclosure requirements on digital asset service providers to ensure that consumers understand the product and can make informed decisions when engaging with digital assets. Consumer education must remain a priority for digital asset service providers. The Lummis-Gillibrand disclosure requirements on digital asset service providers will ensure that consumers understand the products they’re purchasing, their rights, as well the associated risks of engaging in digital assets, including source code version changes and digital asset lending.Requires a study on digital asset energy consumption. The bill directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to analyze and report on energy consumption in the digital assets industry. Virtual currency mining, like other mining, can be an energy-intensive endeavor. It is important to study this issue to determine the best ways in which we can leverage this technology to help us move closer to our common climate goals by deploying more renewable and clean energy and reducing energy waste.Directs the CFTC and the SEC to study and report on the development of a self-regulatory organization (SRO) and develop a proposal for its creation. SROs can play a complementary role, working with regulators to allow them to be more nimble and efficient, while maintaining strong supervision. However, the composition and scope of this kind of organization must be structured carefully in order to achieve the desired results.Directs the CFTC and SEC to consult with Treasury and the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop comprehensive, principles-based guidance relating to cybersecurity for digital asset intermediaries. As more is learned about the ways in which countries like China and Russia are participating in cryptocurrency and other digital assets markets, we need to prioritize the development of robust cybersecurity standards. It is important that the U.S. lead this regulatory effort so that businesses and innovation remain onshore, ensuring that the U.S. will determine the cybersecurity standards that govern the industry. The bill directs the appropriate regulators to study the potential for sanctions avoidance, money laundering, and terrorist financing and to develop rules around appropriate cybersecurity standards, threat identification and mitigation, security operations, auditing and penetration testing.Provides a regulatory sandbox for state and federal regulators to collaborate on innovative financial technologies. Innovation must be able to flourish in its early stages. Lummis-Gillibrand creates a joint structure in which federal and state regulators collaborate with financial technology companies to permit them to introduce innovative products into the market on a limited basis, allowing regulators to become more familiar with financial technology products in a controlled environment, and to participate in the consumer education and financial literacy work that is important to help them engage safely with the market.Creates a workable structure for the taxation of digital assets. As digital assets grow in use and legitimacy, it’s important to make it easier for people to use them in their everyday lives. The bill creates a de minimis exemption so that people can make purchases with virtual currency without having to account for and report income. The bill also clarifies the tax treatments of different actors and actions in the digital asset industry, including that miners and other validators are not “brokers” for income tax purposes and that their rewards shall not be income until redeemed for cash.Directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct an analysis of the potential opportunities and risks associated with investing retirement savings in digital assets and to report its findings to Congress, Treasury, and the Department of Labor. Lummis-Gillibrand aims to avoid limiting consumers’ opportunities to benefit from this growing sector, while also ensuring that investments can be made safely, given that many Americans count on the benefits of retirement savings through 401k plans.Directs the Office of Management and Budget, along with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Defense Department, to conduct an information security study around the digital yuan, China’s central bank digital currency. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are growing in prevalence, and it’s important that the U.S. understands the national security implications of the digital yuan and China’s intention to promote its adoption internationally."

This legislation would direct the Commerce Department to help educate U.S. businesses that are, or are considering, doing business in foreign jurisdictions where significant human rights abuses have occurred, such as Russia and the People’s Republic of China.“Small businesses across Wyoming want to do right by the workers who produce their products,” said Senator Lummis. “They do not want to empower authoritarian regimes, like those in Russia and China, to commit human rights abuses against their own citizens. This legislation equips businesses with the information they need to make sure their products are not made with slave labor. I am grateful to introduce this bipartisan legislation with Senator Gary Peters to give Wyoming businesses the information they need to protect workers abroad.”Sen. Lummis cosponsored this bill after recent reports surfaced detailing the Chinese Communist Party’s horrific human rights violations committed against the Muslim Uyghurs in the Xinjiang Region of China. These atrocities include forced sterilization and internment camps, where slave labor is used to produce goods sold around the world. This bill would ensure U.S. companies are aware of the human rights violations happening in countries they do business with. The Commerce Department already provides valuable assistance to help U.S. businesses break into new markets and this bipartisan bill would build on existing human rights training for department staff. It ensures that the Department’s workforce is specifically informed about emerging trends and issues when it comes to human rights abuses occurring around the world.To read the bill, click here.###PERMALINK: https://bit.ly/3a0ybFE"

It would be helpful to the people I represent to have a legally cited explanation for why potentially changing the use of hundreds of millions of acres is not a major federal action,” Senator Lummis said. “When an initiative is announced that is hugely consequential for the West, yet it doesn’t have the normal framework that is used to have interaction and public input and dialogue in a state like mine that is half federal land, it’s scary. We need something in writing that guarantees that the people in Wyoming are part of the process when addressing the federal land in our state.”Shortly after taking office, President Joe Biden announced a plan to conserve at least 30 percent of U.S. lands and 30 percent of U.S. ocean areas by 2030. Also referred to as the “America the Beautiful” plan, it lays out vague recommendations for climate action, conservation, and recreation on federal lands. Senator Lummis joined Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) on a letter to the Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) Chair Brenda Mallory asking for a National Environmental Policy Act Review of any efforts related to the 30×30 plan. Senator Lummis also asked Director Williams about the status and process of Wyoming’s petition to remove the Greater Yellowstone Grizzly Bear from the endangered species list. To view the hearing, click here. ###PERMALINK: https://bit.ly/39ZPGWm"

Her historic first vote in Wyoming set the course for women’s suffrage across the nation. I am grateful to Senators Van Hollen, Barrasso, and Cardin for helping me honor Louisa Swain who called both Wyoming and Maryland home. I am thrilled to have my first bill to become law be one that honors her legacy and I look forward to seeing that legacy enshrined in my hometown of Cheyenne.”Senator Lummis said.“Louisa Swain was a pioneer in the fight for women’s suffrage, and her work to broaden our democracy must not be forgotten. Maryland is proud that after her historic vote, Ms. Swain went on to call our state home and was laid to rest at the Friends Burial Ground in Baltimore. I was honored to introduce this bipartisan legislation with Senator Lummis, and I’m glad that this fitting tribute to mark Ms. Swain’s contributions to our nation has now been signed into law,” said Senator Van Hollen.“As the Equality State, Wyoming is proud to be the home of many exceptional, trailblazing women who have shaped our state and nation,” said Senator Barrasso. “One of those trailblazers was Louisa Swain. With our bipartisan bill signed into law, Cheyenne will soon rededicate one of our federal buildings in her honor. It is a fitting tribute for Louisa Swain’s historic election vote in 1870, a critical milestone in ensuring full participation of women in our democracy.”“Marylanders have a long history of standing tall for women’s rights, and Louisa Swain is a prime example. Her historic act of casting the first legal ballot reminds us of how far we have come on women’s rights, and how far we still have to go,” said Senator Cardin. “Standing up for equality is always the right thing to do, and I am gratified to have been able to help the effort to ensure that we have a new monument to that fact in Cheyenne, Wyoming.”  “We are delighted Senator Lummis worked her magic to lead this designation heralding Louisa Gardner Swain and her important 1870 vote!

https://www.lummis.senate.gov/press-releases/lummis-sinema-warner-hagerty-introduce-bill-to-make-it-easier-for-main-street-businesses-to-go-public/,"April 4, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – Last week, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and her colleagues Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Mark Warner (D-VA) and Bill Hagerty (R-TN) introduced a bill to help reduce the costs incurred by small and medium-size Main Street businesses when they conduct an initial public offering (IPO) and “go public,” trading company stocks on a stock exchange. Their bill, the Middle Market IPO Underwriting Cost Act, would require the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue a report on the direct and indirect costs of a traditional IPO and compare those costs with the cost of obtaining alternate forms of financing. The SEC would also have to report on recent trends in IPO offerings, and the costs incurred.Similar legislation was sponsored in the U.S. House of Representatives by Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) in 2018.“We need to bring our financial sector into the 21st century, and that means looking at new, innovative ways to do things like initial public offerings,” Senator Lummis said. “Big companies figured out years ago that they could reduce costs by changing IPO fee structures. Wyoming is full of small and mid-sized companies and they should not be penalized simply because of historic fee structures and restrictions on how IPOs are funded. I am honored to work with Senators Hagerty, Sinema and Warner on this important legislation.”“Our commonsense, bipartisan bill boosts Arizona businesses by making it easier to grow and create jobs. By going public, Arizona businesses will be able to give everyday Arizona families the opportunity to invest directly in their businesses and build wealth for the future. We’ll continue working across the aisle to fuel economic opportunities across our state,” said Senator Sinema.“When our companies become publicly traded, more Americans can participate in their growth and success,” Senator Warner said. “Small and mid-size firms play a key role in our economy, and this bill will help give investors a clearer picture of the costs and challenges such companies can face when they take that important step.”   “As someone who spent their career in business, I am well aware of the challenges and regulatory requirements it takes to conduct an initial public offering, which can be very costly,” Senator Hagerty said. “It’s important that Congress gain a better understanding of the evolution of these burdens and costs, which is why I’m pleased to co-sponsor this legislation that requires the SEC to report back its findings on the current trends.”About the bill, Robert Jackson, co-director of the Institute for Corporate Governance and Finance at New York University School of Law, said, “For years, the middle-market IPO tax has made it harder for small companies to raise the public capital they need to create the jobs our economy depends upon. This important legislation would make sure that the SEC finally grapples with how Wall Street taxes middle-market companies—and gets to work on making American capital markets work for businesses of all sizes.”When going public, companies tend to hire an underwriter and other professionals like attorneys and accountants to help prepare the IPO. Underwriters, serving as intermediaries between companies and prospective investors, typically receive a set percentage of the IPO price as compensation for their work.

Originally introduced last November, the American Energy, Jobs & Climate Plan is an innovative energy and climate strategy with the potential to reduce global emissions by up to 40 percent by 2050 and create thousands of jobs for hard-working Americans.“Instead of half measures, President Biden should commit his administration to unleashing clean American energy to free our allies from dependence on dirty Russian energy,” said Senator Lummis. “Our resources and ingenuity can solve the current energy crisis that is hitting not only the United States but our allies around the world. The American Energy, Jobs & Climate Plan is the perfect roadmap for how to do this, and Senators Sullivan, Cramer and I are ready to help President Biden implement it.”Last week, the Biden administration announced that they intend to work with the European Union (EU) to help curb European dependence on Russian natural gas. The American Energy, Jobs & Climate Planleverages America’s many unique strengths and positions to get America back on a path to providing enough energy not only for our own country but for rest of the world as well. Click here to read the full plan.###"

Serving as Senator Lummis’ first stand-alone piece of legislation to pass both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives, this bill designates the federal building located at 308 West 21st Street in Cheyenne, Wyoming as the “Louisa Swain Federal Office Building.” “As the first woman to serve Wyoming in the U.S. Senate, I am honored that my first bill to pass both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives is one that commemorates a true pioneer from my home state of Wyoming,” Senator Lummis said about her bill. “I cannot think of a better name for a federal building in the first state to recognize this right and enshrine full suffrage for women in law. It has been an honor working with colleagues in Wyoming and Maryland on this bill to honor a pioneer so important to both of our states.” Laramie resident Louisa Swain was 70 years old when she cast her vote in Wyoming’s general election of 1870, making her the first woman to legally vote in the United States. Later in life she moved to Maryland and was laid to rest in Baltimore. The bill passed the House of Representatives with 412 votes in the affirmative. The U.S. Senate passed the bill unanimously through a voice vote on October 7, 2021. This was a historic moment for Senator Lummis as it was her first stand-alone bill to pass through the Senate.

Legislation like this will help reshape America’s workforce to prioritize people over politics and protect workers in the process.

Senator Lummis and a group of 25 senators wrote a letter to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Acting Director Regina Richardson requesting an explanation for changes to the ATF’s handling of applications to create and own a firearm silencer. The ATF has been rejecting law-abiding Americans’ attempts to create and own a silencer, even though federal law has not changed, and the ATF’s own website acknowledges that federal law allows individuals to make a silencer.“We in Wyoming care deeply about our Second Amendment rights. In a western state like ours, a gun is as much a tool as a shovel or an axe,” Senator Lummis said. “I am deeply opposed to unelected bureaucrats making extra-legal decisions to unilaterally keep folks from exercising their rights, and I expect the ATF to answer for its actions.”Historically, the ATF has simply required law-abiding citizens to fill out a form and pay a fee before creating a firearm silencer for personal use. Now, the ATF is treating parts used for the assembly of a silencer as though they were already a silencer. This forces companies selling those parts to pay more in taxes, and forces the individual buyer to fill out more paperwork when registering a silencer. To read the full letter, click here. ###"

The group of lawmakers voiced concerns over the fact that the IRS is dealing with an unprecedented backlog of customer service and processing issues, and asked for information about what the IRS was allowed to do legally to ease the burden on taxpayers and reduce its backlog in a more timely manner.“As recently as last September, the IRS was trying to enact a $600 reporting requirement for all financial transactions by regular taxpayers in Wyoming and around the country. Meanwhile, the IRS is unable to handle the level of information it currently receives from American taxpayers,” said Senator Lummis. “As tax filing season is already well underway, Wyoming taxpayers should not have to continue to be affected by the numerous problems that the IRS itself is facing. Instead of forcing Americans to report even more information to the IRS, the IRS should work on fully processing the information it already has. This would be the best service it could provide to taxpayers across the country.”You can read the full text of the letter here. ###"

In Wyoming, we believe that projects should be awarded to qualified contractors regardless of their connection to labor unions. Competition drives down prices and increases transparency. That should be our top priority.”The letter, signed by 43 Republican senators, urges the Biden administration to discontinue its preferential treatment of union-connected contractors for taxpayer-funded projects. Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) put local Wyoming companies at a disadvantage due to low rates of union membership across Wyoming. Senator Lummis believes that projects executed in Wyoming should be completed by Wyoming companies and workers, regardless of union status. Read the full letter here.###"

Empty shelves and backlogged deliveries have wreaked havoc on American citizens and their businesses. This bill focuses on streamlining the process to get products off of ships, into trucks, and onto shelves. “Congress must find ways to relieve the pressures of the supply chain crisis on people in Wyoming,” Senator Lummis said. “The SHIP IT Act would cut red tape and ease factors that are increasing prices and slowing down shipping times for goods that we need. I am pleased to work with Senator Mike Lee on this important legislation to tackle the escalating prices and empty shelves Wyoming consumers are facing.”The SHIP IT Act builds on, and expands, Senator Lee’s STOP the GRINCH Act that was introduced in 2021, of which Senator Lummis was also a co-sponsor.

These regulations are strangling energy producers in Wyoming, and the consequences are being paid at the pump.”As a result of our current high oil and gas prices, the Biden administration has proposed easing sanctions on hostile oil nations run by brutal dictators, including Russian ally Venezuela. Meanwhile, states like Wyoming have the capability and means to produce American energy to offset ever-increasing costs. The senators specifically called on President Biden and Treasury Secretary Yellen to instruct federal financial regulatory agencies to delay all regulatory initiatives related to the environment until the Biden administration develops a detailed plan to protect America’s energy security. This request comes as reports indicate the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to propose its climate risk rule as early as next week.

In the future, we should end this cycle of false choices by making spending at current levels automatic unless Congress agrees to a deal that actually helps Americans. This would be a win for taxpayers in Wyoming, and would finally allow us to start clawing our way out of debt.“Anytime there is a spending bill this big, it includes some good things, and I am proud of the bipartisan support we are showing for the people of Ukraine in this one. But, frankly, I am disgusted that Ukraine funding is strapped to a massive, irresponsible spending package like this, because it forces us to choose between helping the Ukrainian people and further indebting our own constituents. It was a cynical ploy to buy votes.“A spending bill this large always has serious flaws as well, and this one is no different. It continues to fund President Biden’s vaccine mandates, which I cannot support. It also contains anti-Second Amendment provisions that threaten the rights of law-abiding citizens to own firearms. Because of these and other reasons I ultimately had to vote against this bill.”###"

If he has any doubt, he should look to Wyoming, where digital assets are booming within a common-sense, balanced regulatory framework. We need thoughtful rules around stablecoins, and though I remain unconvinced on the need for a central bank digital currency (CBDC), I will continue to follow the Federal Reserve’s work in this area closely. I will be laying out my own thoughts on digital asset legislation imminently.

John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, both R-Wyo., joined U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT), and 33 Republican colleagues, in a letter to President Biden requesting an accounting of how the federal government has allocated trillions in taxpayer funds to combat COVID-19.“Recent news reports indicate the Administration is poised to request an additional $30 billion from Congress for its response to COVID-19,” the senators wrote. “While we have supported historic, bipartisan measures in the United States Senate to provide unprecedented investments in vaccines, therapeutics, and testing, it is not yet clear why additional funding is needed.”“All told, the nearly $6 trillion in spending on COVID-19 is the single greatest expenditure of public funds on one effort in the history of the nation. However, since passage of the American Rescue Plan in February, questions are mounting about where exactly the additional money has gone,” the senators continued. The full text of the letter can be found here and below. Dear Mr. President:Recent news reports indicate the Administration is poised to request an additional $30 billion from Congress for its response to COVID-19. While we have supported historic, bipartisan measures in the United States Senate to provide unprecedented investments in vaccines, therapeutics, and testing, it is not yet clear why additional funding is needed.Since March 2020, the federal government has borrowed trillions of dollars to combat the virus and provide relief to families and businesses. By March 11, 2021, the day you signed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act into law, Congress had already approved over $3.8 trillion in COVD-19 relief. All told, the nearly $6 trillion in spending on COVID-19 is the single greatest expenditure of public funds on one effort in the history of the nation.However, since passage of the American Rescue Plan in February, questions are mounting about where exactly the additional money has gone.A recent investigative report from the Washington Post headlined, “’Immense fraud’ creates immense task for Washington as it tries to tighten scrutiny of $6 trillion in emergency coronavirus spending” details the federal government’s shocking failure to provide the American public with a faithful accounting of how it has spent its money.“Nearly two years later, however, the stimulus data is voluminous yet vexing — for the public and the government alike. The spending portal does not offer a real-time, detailed view as to the way cities, states, schools, hospitals and others actually have deployed broad swaths of the cash they received. In education, for example, federal records show more than $81 billion set aside for school districts in response to the pandemic. Yet the information is 90 days old in some cases and offers no insight as to what those communities actually did once they obtained the grants.”“By 2021, Biden’s top aides intensified the work to improve the oversight process, particularly after the passage of the American Rescue Plan last March. Yet the efforts failed to satisfy lawmakers, federal watchdogs, health professionals and ethics experts, a dozen of whom said in interviews that they have struggled to answer the most basic questions — including how much money has been spent, and how, in critical areas such as testing.” (emphasis added)Before we would consider supporting an additional $30 billion for COVID-19 relief, Congress must receive a full accounting of how the government has already spent the first $6 trillion.In an effort to better understand your reported request for supplemental appropriations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we respectfully ask the Administration to answer the following questions:We strongly believe Americans should continue to take precautionary measures to protect against the pandemic, and it must be an urgent priority that the trillions of taxpayer dollars already appropriated are being spent effectively. ###"

This would simplify the federal rules that are currently straining dozens of banks in Wyoming. Community banks and credit unions are a backbone of Wyoming’s financial system, and I’m proud to work with my colleagues Mike Rounds and Tim Scott to support them.”The TAILOR Act would require federal banking regulators to tailor rules and supervision of banks to account for business model, risk profile, and size, allowing for simplified rules and lighter regulations for community banks and credit unions. Federal banking regulators would also have to issue an annual report on the modernization of bank regulations to account for changing bank business models, technology, and community banks. These requirements apply not only to future regulations, but also to regulations adopted within the last seven years.Senator Lummis sits on the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. As a longtime advocate for Wyoming community banks, she has used this role to champion local banks and credit unions by pressing President Joe Biden’s nominee to the Federal Reserve Lael Brainard about whether she would impose environmental, anti-energy requirements on community banks. Brainard confirmed that if confirmed she would not require community banks to meet environmental requirements.To watch Senator Lummis question Brainard, click here.###"

The energy producers in Wyoming have made our state the top net energy supplier in the country. We want to help America become the energy supplier for the free world. Instead, under President Biden, the U.S. has actually been an importer of Russian energy. This is unacceptable.“If President Biden wants to lower energy prices for cars and homes, I have some ideas: Restart the Keystone XL Pipeline project. Fast-track energy infrastructure projects around the country. Get energy regulators out of the way so states can more easily approve natural gas pipelines.“He should fast-track energy production on federal lands. Wyoming is rich in energy resources, and we can move quickly if the federal government is our partner, not our opponent. We also need to prevent America’s big banks and financial regulatory agencies from black-listing the energy sector so energy producers can get the loans and services they need to start new projects and increase production.“Instead of tapping our strategic petroleum reserves, we should be unleashing our energy production potential. Instead of trying to spend more on progressive policies, we should be working together to address inflation and our national debt. There are Democrats who want to work on these issues with Republicans. I just wish President Biden were one of them.“I was pleased to see President Biden voice his concern for the way that social media is influencing our children. I’m proud to be sponsoring the NUDGE Act to start reining in Big Tech by targeting their algorithms in a content agnostic manner. I hope Democrats and Republicans can work together on this issue, to protect our kids.“Thankfully, Republicans and Democrats have been united in our support for the people of Ukraine, and our opposition to Vladimir Putin and his cronies in Russia. While President Biden waited too long to sanction Russia, I’m glad to see the efforts that he and our European allies have taken since the Russian invasion to punish Putin for his actions. We must continue using sanctions, while supporting Ukraine with our aid.”###"

This hurts ranchers, but it also hurts Wyoming families at the grocery store. I am happy to stand up for Wyoming ranchers and Wyoming families by signing onto this important, bipartisan legislation.” The hyper-concentration of meat packing facilities in the United States has led to unfair market practices. Due to a lack of transparency and accountability in the cattle markets, beef costs more at the grocery store, but those profits aren’t getting passed along to cattle producers.This legislation would create monetary minimums regionally on the price of cattle to make sure that the market is responsible and fair. This means lower prices at the grocery store for Wyoming families and a fair price for cattle producers across Wyoming. ###"

The pipeline was expected to provide 11,000 high-paying jobs, and up to 60,000 other jobs over the course of its use and construction. The Biden administration has continually sacrificed America’s energy independence and the wellbeing of the people of Wyoming and our energy industry while bowing to extreme environmentalists, and we have a right to know the true cost these actions are having on our economy.”In June 2021, Senator Lummis and ten of her Senate Republican colleagues introduced the Defending Keystone Jobs Act, which would require the Biden administration to submit a report to Congress on the number of jobs lost as a direct or indirect result of the Biden administration’s move to cancel construction of the Keystone XL pipeline within 90 days of enactment. A modified version of the legislation became law as part of the bipartisan American Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.In the letter, the senators wrote, “The closure [of the Keystone XL Pipeline] erased thousands of real, high-paying jobs and approximately $800 million in wages. Significant prospective spending for rural communities and small businesses, as well as tax revenue for local schools and public safety, disappeared with the stroke of a pen. President Biden’s Executive Order destroyed numerous jobs and changed countless lives. It also strained relationships with Canada and put the United States at a strategic disadvantage when it comes to energy security for us and our allies. Knowing the full impact of the President’s actions is important to the American people.”Senator Lummis sent the letter with Senators Mike Crapo (R-ID), John Barrasso (R-WY), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), John Hoeven (R-ND), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Steve Daines (R-MT), and Jim Risch (R-ID).Click here to view the letter.###"

From there, we can build guardrails to protect children in Wyoming from the negative effects of social media. We can build a healthier internet without the federal government dictating what people can and can’t say.”“Social media is affecting our society in profoundly negative ways, and yet the Big Tech companies continue to pursue one goal: they want us to spend as much of our lives on their platforms as humanly possible. Advertisers are the consumer — users are merely the product. And as we learned in the Facebook Papers, this unapologetic pursuit of profit comes at a steep cost: millions of users, including children, have been exposed to psychological manipulation and other harms. Senator Lummis recognizes the direct threat to families posed by the reckless behavior of these Big Tech companies. That’s why she and Senator Klobuchar have introduced a bill to hold them accountable and protect users from some of these harms, such as algorithmic amplification and social media addiction. We are proud to endorse the NUDGE Act and work with Senator Lummis on this important issue,” said Jon Schweppe, of the American Principles Project.“Although the impacts big tech’s services have on our mental health and even political discourse are well documented, there is still much we don’t know concerning how they fully use their algorithms. The NUDGE Act brings us a significant step closer to shedding light on large tech platforms’ opacity. I applaud the efforts of Senator Lummis for taking this practical, bipartisan approach when bringing this issue to the fore,” said Joel Thayer of the Digital Progress Institute.Nudging Users to Drive Good Experiences on Social Media (Social Media NUDGE Act) directs the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) to conduct a study to identify interventions on platforms that would reduce the harms caused by their use of algorithms. It would also empower the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to conduct a rulemaking process to better regulate social media companies and the way content is shared on their platforms. This bill would not give the FTC the authority to regulate the speech that occurs on these platforms.Click here to view the bill.###"

https://www.lummis.senate.gov/press-releases/lummis-colleagues-to-doj-we-dont-need-a-no-fly-list-for-unruly-passengers/,"February 14, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) along with her colleagues sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland urging him to reject Delta Airline’s call for a no-fly list for unruly passengers.Of the letter, Senator Lummis said, “TSA no-fly lists have been historically restricted to suspected terrorists, because such individuals are a threat to every airline and every traveler. Expanding the use of no-fly lists to include people who are frustrated about mask mandates would tacitly equate ordinary fliers to violent extremists. This is offensive not only to me but to the people of Wyoming. The Justice Department should be focused on upholding actual law, instead of finding new ways to target ordinary Americans.”The letter states:Dear Attorney General Garland,Your office received a letter from Delta Airlines on February 3, 2022. In that letter, Delta indicated their desire for the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to create a comprehensive “no-fly” list. This list would presumably include any airline passenger who has been convicted of any on-board disruption. As a result, those passengers would subsequently be banned from using any commercial air service provider moving forward. We write today to express our strong opposition to the creation of such a list.While airlines are currently free to deny service to any individual over past transgressions on their flights, the federal government’s role in denying access to the commercial aviation network has been limited to ensuring that suspected terrorists remain off of domestic flights. According to data from the Federal Aviation Administration, the majority of recent infractions on airplanes have been in relation to the mask mandate from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). While we strongly condemn any violence toward airline workers, there is significant uncertainty around the efficacy of this mandate, as highlighted by the CEO of Southwest Airlines during a recent Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee hearing. Creating a federal ‘no-fly’ list for unruly passengers who are skeptical of this mandate would seemingly equate them to terrorists who seek to actively take the lives of Americans and perpetrate attacks on the homeland. The TSA was created in the wake of 9/11 to protect Americans from future horrific attacks, not to regulate human behavior onboard flights.Congress delegate authority to the TSA to “consider requiring passenger air carriers to share passenger lists” in order to identify “individuals who may pose a threat to aviation safety or national security.” The TSA’s existing ‘no-fly’ list for suspected terrorists is already controversial due to its lack of transparency and its due process concerns. However, the TSA has rightly chosen not to create a consolidated ‘no-fly’ list for passengers convicted of non-terrorist, on-board disruptions. The creation of this list by DOJ would result in a severe restriction on the ability of citizens to fully exercise their constitutional right to engage in interstate transportation. It also raises serious concerns about future unrelated uses and potential expansions of the list based on political pressures. If the airlines seek to have such a list created, they would be best served presenting that request before Congress rather than relying on a loose interpretation of a decades-old statue originally written to combat terrorism. Absent any updated expressed directive from Congress, we strongly urge DOJ to reject this request.Senator Lummis was joined by Senators Mike Lee (R-UT), James Lankford (R-OK), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ted Cruz (R-TX), John Hoeven (R-ND), and Rick Scott (R-FL).Click here to view the letter.###"

He was tough as nails, endlessly patient, unwaveringly kind.“When I was elected to the U.S. Senate, I knew I needed Leland on my team because he loved Wyoming people. He loved to help his fellow man. He cared about the challenges our state and its people face. His smile would light up every room and his laugh was infectious. He was a joy to be around. He was my dear friend. He even guided my daughter and me into the Teton Wilderness alongside his own family, on horseback. By every estimation, he was ten feet tall and bulletproof. But, in His own good time, God calls all his children home to be of service there. Leland prepared for his service in heaven each and every day, throughout his entire life in Wyoming.“I am mourning his loss with his wife Anita, children Hunter, Brittany, Simone, Jed and Wyatt, their spouses and his grandchildren. My staff and I, along with the entire Wyoming community, are all praying for them.”Prior to his time in the office of Senator Lummis, Christensen served the people of Wyoming in a number of roles. He was formerly a member of the Wyoming National Guard, a sheriff, a commissioner for Teton County, a state senator, and a deputy director of the Wyoming Office of Homeland Security. ###"
https://www.lummis.senate.gov/press-releases/barrasso-and-lummis-join-fight-to-stop-wotus-overreach/,"February 9, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, both R-Wyo., joined U.S. Senator John Thune (R-S.D.) and the entire Senate Republican Conference in a letter urging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to suspend the pending rulemaking to redefine the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act (CWA).The letter calls for a suspension of rulemaking specifically related to “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), until the Supreme Court completes consideration of Sackett v. EPA. The case is expected to have major implications on CWA scope and enforcement. The senators also criticize the regulatory overreach proposed by the rule that would impose significant uncertainty to stakeholders, especially farmers and ranchers.“Given the severe financial penalties stakeholders could face for conducting standard agricultural or other land development practices under the proposed rule, family farmers and ranchers are understandably alarmed by the administration’s attempted land grab,” the senators wrote. “As you consider our request to suspend the WOTUS rulemaking process, we urge you to listen to these stakeholders and hear firsthand how the proposed revision to the definition of WOTUS will cast a cloud of uncertainty over landowners across the country and snarl American economic sectors in red tape.”The full text of the letter can be found here and below:Dear Administrator Regan and Assistant Secretary Connor:We write to request that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) suspend the pending rulemaking to redefine the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act, specifically “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), until the U.S. Supreme Court completes its consideration of Sackett v. EPA, Case No. 21-454. As you know, this case may have major implications for Clean Water Act scope and enforcement. It would be irresponsible for EPA and USACE to proceed down a regulatory path that could be invalidated or significantly altered as early as this summer.More critically, suspending the rulemaking will permit stakeholders across the country to evaluate how a potential decision will affect their position in this regulatory space. The federal government should not promulgate rules for the sake of political expediency, but rather provide regulatory certainty for stakeholders within the bounds of an agency’s respective statutory authority. Proceeding with the rulemaking at this time, despite the pending litigation and potentially influential ruling, will only deepen uncertainty within the regulated community. We therefore urge EPA and USACE to suspend the WOTUS rulemaking, or at least extend the comment period for the proposed rule published at 86 Fed. Reg. 69372 (Dec. 1, 2021), until at least 60 days after the Supreme Court decides Sackett.In addition to submitting this request, we also write to comment on the WOTUS rule as it is currently proposed. We are foremost troubled to see that the proposed rule exceeds the regulatory authority granted to EPA and USACE by the Clean Water Act. The proposed rule seeks to federalize waters in a land grab that arguably surpasses its 2015 predecessor, improperly encompassing water features traditionally within the sole purview of states, while reverting from the comparative straightforward application of the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. 22250 (Apr. 21, 2020), and interjecting new uncertainties for nearly every private sector stakeholder.In relying on the ambiguous “significant nexus” standard, the proposed WOTUS rule will subject water features not addressed by the mere two categorical exclusions of waste treatment systems and prior converted cropland (a term which is problematically left undefined in the rule) to costly and time-consuming processes to determine whether those features, such as ditches or other ephemeral waters, cause more than speculative or insubstantial effects on the chemical, physical, or biological integrity of the nation’s waters. The limited exclusions and lack of clarity, such as for ditches, prairie potholes, and stock ponds, as well as the failure to define prior converted cropland, are leading concerns for our constituent stakeholders.Given the severe financial penalties stakeholders could face for conducting standard agricultural or other land development practices under the proposed rule, family farmers and ranchers are understandably alarmed by the administration’s attempted land grab. These producers have an especially vested interest in responsible stewardship of their water and land, and they depend on precise, consistent, and durable regulations that can guide such activity. Unfortunately, the proposed WOTUS rule falls short by each measure.As you consider our request to suspend the WOTUS rulemaking process, we urge you to listen to these stakeholders and hear firsthand how the proposed revision to the definition of WOTUS will cast a cloud of uncertainty over landowners across the country and snarl American economic sectors in red tape.Thank you for your prompt consideration of our request.###"

Reserve Trust was the first, and currently the only, non-bank FinTech company to ever obtain master account access. Raskin joined the board of Reserve Trust in 2017, and this non-bank was initially denied access to a master account that same year. Raskin made calls on behalf of Reserve Trust to the Federal Reserve, and Reserve Trust’s application for a master account was subsequently approved in 2018. Raskin was compensated for her position on the Reserve Trust board with stock, which she later sold to one of her coworkers at the Treasury Department, Amias Gerety, for $1.4 million. Gerety now works for QED Investors, which today owns a controlling interest in Reserve Trust. “Two Wyoming-chartered banks have been trying to obtain Fed master accounts for over a year. A master account is critical for banks to be able to access our Federal payment system. But both remain in limbo, though progress is being made. Yet somehow Reserve Trust – a company that had been denied this same access, doesn’t have a Federal regulator and isn’t even a bank – was granted it after Sarah Bloom Raskin joined its board,”Senator Lummis said. “This seems suspiciously convenient that Reserve Trust managed to secure the only Fed master account for a non-bank FinTech company while she was on the board. This requires further scrutiny from this committee and my colleagues in the Senate.” Wyoming’s special purpose depository institution charter (SPDI) remains under review by the Federal Reserve.

https://www.lummis.senate.gov/press-releases/lummis-kelly-introduce-bipartisan-bicameral-commercial-drivers-license-reforms/,"February 2, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Mark Kelly (D-AZ) introduced a bill to help address supply chain shortages and increase the number of truck drivers transporting goods in the U.S. Their bill, the Licensing Individual Commercial Exam-takers Now Safely and Efficiently (LICENSE) Act, would streamline burdensome licensing regulations by making permanent several waivers that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) implemented in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic last November.The bill is sponsored by Reps. Darin LaHood (R-IL), Troy Balderson (R-OH), Henry Cuellar (D-TX), and Josh Harder (D-CA) in the U.S. House of Representatives.The bill would allow state and third-party examiners previously authorized to administer the commercial driver’s license (CDL) skills test to also administer the CDL knowledge test without having to complete the training course. This will help get additional drivers on the road faster without compromising safety.It would also allow licensed drivers who are accompanying commercial learner’s permit (CLP) holders to move from the front seat of a truck cab to its sleeper berth. In many cases, CLP holders have already passed their road tests and are simply waiting to receive the physical copy of their commercial driver’s license, and this change would recognize that.Finally, the bill would allow states to administer driving skills tests to applicants from other states. This will streamline the credentialing process and allow future truckers to get tested where they live rather than only where they received their training.“One of the first steps towards fixing our current supply chain crises is to increase the number of truck drivers delivering goods to stores around the country,” Senator Lummis said. “As a rural state, Wyoming is particularly reliant on trucking, but streamlining commercial driver’s licensing and getting rid of overly burdensome regulations will benefit everyone, whether you live in Manhattan or Cheyenne. I’m proud to work with my fellow western senator, Mark Kelly, to reform the licensing process for America’s truckers.”“The pandemic continues to impact our supply chains and Arizonans are feeling the strain of higher prices at the supermarket and the gas pump. Our bipartisan bill cuts red tape and boosts our trucking workforce so we can safely and quickly deliver essential supplies and goods across the country. I will continue to ensure the federal government uses every available tool to strengthen our economy and bring down costs for Arizonans,” said Senator Kelly.“Some of the biggest issues I hear about in central and west-central Illinois are worker and trucking shortages,” said Congressman LaHood. “As we face unprecedented supply chain challenges, this legislation will help streamline the process to obtain a commercial driver’s license and reduce unnecessary red tape. The downstream economic effects of the driver shortage are immeasurable and American families continue to face further disruption in the delivery of groceries, medical supplies, and business inventories across the nation. I am proud to join this bipartisan and bicameral group to introduce this commonsense legislation that will give companies the ability to hire qualified, safe drivers and strengthen the economy in Illinois.”“This legislation eliminates regulatory barriers to filling in-demand truck driver jobs,”saidCongressman Balderson. “I’m proud to support making these common sense waivers permanent. Doing so provides much-needed relief for our truckers and will help to ensure products arrive on-time to doorsteps and store shelves across the country.”“The LICENSE Act is a critical piece of legislation that will help alleviate stressors on the supply chain and remove burdensome regulatory barriers to obtaining commercial driver’s licenses,” said Congressman Cuellar. “As we look to recover from the pandemic, we must adapt and innovate to the needs of our growing economy. These waivers make our roads safer while removing unnecessary red tape. As the representative for the largest land port of entry, I will continue to prioritize the needs of our truckers who are essential to the success of our national economy.”“I’m laser focused on making it affordable to raise a family in the Valley. Right now the cost of everything from groceries to gas is just plain out of control and we have to fix it,” said Congressman Harder. “This bill cuts through the red tape and gets more truck drivers on the road. More drivers means lower shipping costs, and lower shipping costs means families can actually afford what they need at the grocery store. I’m proud to join my Republican and Democratic friends in introducing this bill.”The American Trucking Associations endorsed the bill, noting in a letter to Senators Lummis and Kelly, “In the context of the current supply chain disruptions, the LICENSE Act is a sensible remedy to the unnecessary regulatory barriers that make the CDL training and testing process so arduous.”To read the bill, click here.To read a one-pager about the bill, click here.To read the American Trucking Associations’ letter of support for the bill, click here.###"

These provisions are set to expire after the pandemic unless congressional leaders act to extend the measures or make them permanent. Telehealth services are essential in rural states like Wyoming, where many residents lack access to nearby healthcare providers. The 47 lawmakers, led by U.S. Sens. Brian Schatz (D-HI) and Roger Wicker (R-MS), sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) calling for these expanded telehealth services to be extended. “We strongly support permanently expanding Medicare coverage of telehealth and removing other barriers to the use of telehealth because of its ability to expand access to care, reduce costs, and improve health outcomes. While Congress prepares to enact permanent telehealth legislation, we urge you to include an extension of the pandemic telehealth authorities in must-pass government funding legislation in February,” the lawmakers wrote.  The full text of the letter is available here. ###"

Without this exemption, smaller refineries cannot compete with the larger ones,” Senator Lummis said. “This will cost thousands of jobs and raise prices for families in Wyoming. This is a tone-deaf decision that is unfortunately becoming all too familiar to the people of Wyoming.  I hope the EPA will consider reversing their decision.” There are four operational oil refineries in Wyoming, and each operate within the parameters of the small refinery exemption. All will be negatively impacted by this decision. Last year, the HollyFrontier refinery in Cheyenne transitioned to a renewable diesel, costing nearly 200 jobs. Prior to its transition, it produced 52,000 barrels of oil per day. The loss of its SRE was a major factor in the decision to transition. To read the letter, click here. ###"

As the Supreme Court recently ruled, this mandate is unconstitutional. Thousands of Wyoming workers can now make their own health care decisions without the fear of losing their job,” said Senator Barrasso. “Now the administration must do the same for millions of health care workers. Health care facilities across the nation are short staffed. We shouldn’t make it even harder for hospitals, clinics and nursing homes to get people the care they need.” “Businesses across Wyoming are working hard to recover from the pandemic and from rising inflation. This mandate would have forced employers to step into the relationship between a patient and their doctor,”Senator Lummis said. “I am vaccinated, and I encourage everyone to discuss the vaccine with their doctor, but it is ultimately a personal decision, and employers shouldn’t be forced to make that decision for their employees. It is irresponsible for the federal government to further burden Wyoming businesses with job-killing mandates.” Earlier this year, Senators Barrasso and Lummis joined 44 of their Senate colleagues and 136 Representatives in filing an amicus brief to the Supreme Court of the United States to support the National Federation of Business’s effort to block the OSHA vaccine mandate on businesses with more than 100 employees. The full text of the brief can be found here. ###"

Cynthia Lummis has stalled confirmation of President Biden’s pick for EPA enforcement chief over concerns about the agency’s handling of coal power plants in her state. Lummis also has placed holds on Biden’s remaining EPA picks, her office confirmed to E&E News.David Uhlmann, Biden’s choice for EPA’s assistant administrator for enforcement and compliance assurance, had been scheduled for a vote Wednesday before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. But Chair Tom Carper (D-Del.) announced at the start of the markup that Uhlmann’s nomination had been pulled from the agenda.Carper said a senator he didn’t name was waiting for information from EPA before considering whether to support Uhlmann. A spokesperson for Lummis told E&E News that Lummis wasthe senator Carper was referring to at Wednesday’s markup.Lummis was waiting to hear from EPA about whether Wyoming’s regional haze plan for the Jim Bridger power plant would be approved, according to the spokesperson. The federal haze program seeks to reduce pollution to increase visibility, which has proved troublesome for the southeastern Wyoming power plant.After Wednesday’s markup ended, EPA released a decision proposing to reject Wyoming’s plan for the power plant. That prompted a backlash from the state’s officials, including Lummis.“The Biden EPA’s decision here is needlessly hurting Wyoming’s energy workers and threatening America’s energy independence as well. It is blatantly political, and I will continue to block President Biden’s EPA nominees over this issue,” Lummis said in a statement.Lummis has a hold on all of Biden’s remaining EPA nominees, including Uhlmann, the senator’s spokesperson confirmed to E&E News.The president currently has four EPA nominees needing Senate confirmation. Those include Carlton Waterhouse, picked to lead the agency’s solid waste office, and Amanda Howe, the choice to head up EPA’s mission support office.“EPA will continue to work with the Senate to confirm our nominees as quickly as possible, and we will continue to work with Sen. Lummis and our partners in Wyoming to ensure they have information about agency action in the state,” EPA spokesperson Tim Carroll told E&E News.The committee did advance other nominees at Wednesday’s markup, including Martha Williams, Biden’s pick for Fish and Wildlife Service director, and Chris Frey, tapped to lead EPA’s science office, on 16-4 and 11-9 votes respectively (E&E News PM, Jan. 12).The Environment and Public Works Committee has approved Uhlmann once before. Last month, the panel advanced the EPA enforcement head nominee on a 10-9 vote. Lummis, an EPW member, did not vote on Uhlmann’s nomination at that time (Greenwire, Dec. 1, 2021).Uhlmann and other nominees were later sent back to the president. Last week, Biden resubmitted dozens of nominees, including Uhlmann, leading to his being scheduled for consideration at Wednesday’s markup.Lummis has had kind words for Uhlmann in the past. At his confirmation hearing last September, the senator said she had heard from Tom Sansonetti, a former Justice Department colleague of Uhlmann’s, who praised the nominee.“His endorsement speaks very highly of your character,” Lummis said at the hearing.The senator then asked Uhlmann about Wyoming’s plan for the coal plant, saying the state had worked with EPA on the plan but the agency was now stalling on moving forward.“This is no way to treat partners in our federalist system,” Lummis said.Uhlmann said he was not familiar with the plan but planned to learn more.“I would commit to you, if I am confirmed, I would like to be able to have the opportunity to be briefed on this issue and then visit with you more about it,” Uhlmann said.EPA’s haze program, authorized by Congress in 1977, aims to restore unclouded natural visibility to 156 national parks and wilderness areas — most of them in the West — by 2064.Coal-fired power plants are a prime source of haze-forming pollution. During the Obama administration, EPA used the program to prod utilities into installing scrubbers and other pollution controls on older plants, often over the objections of regulators in Republican-run states (E&E Daily, March 21, 2016).Under President Trump, the agency flip-flopped, approving state plans even as environmental groups charged that they would do little or nothing to cut haze-forming emissions (Greenwire, June 13, 2017).The tension has been acute in Wyoming, by far the nation’s biggest coal producer. In summarizing its preliminary decision to reject the revised haze plan, EPA said yesterday that state regulators had unjustifiably dropped requirements for the Bridger plant to install new controls on nitrogen oxides on two of its four coal-fired generating units.While PacifiCorp, the plant’s owner, has signaled its intent to convert those units to natural gas in 2024, “the company’s intentions are not part of Wyoming’s proposed revisions to its regional haze plan, thereby precluding the planned conversion from EPA consideration and analysis,” the summary said.As it became clear that the Biden administration was preparing to reject the revised plan, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon (R) last month took his concerns directly to EPA Administrator Michael Regan.While appreciative of the opportunity to speak, “I am disappointed that our conversation was not more productive,” Gordon wrote in a follow-up letter.During the Trump administration, Greg Sopkin, then the EPA Region 8 administrator, had approved the revised plan in 2020, Gordon wrote. In now moving to reverse the earlier approval, he said, EPA appears intent on forcing the shutdown of one of the units in question, resulting in “jobs lost, incomes wrecked and careers terminated at the plant and the associated coal mine.”The approximately 2,400-megawatt plant was Wyoming’s biggest power-sector polluter in 2020, pumping out more than 6,900 tons of nitrogen oxides and almost 8,800 tons of sulfur dioxide, according to the most recent EPA data. Oregon-based PacifiCorp. is part of the conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc."

Wyoming produces some of the cleanest burning fossil fuels in the world, yet our ability to produce those reliable sources of energy is being stifled by this administration’s radical climate agenda. Letting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline continue unencumbered is bad for America’s foreign policy and energy sector, the global environment, and the geopolitical atmosphere in Europe. This is completely unacceptable.” The Nord Stream 2 pipeline is a Russian natural gas pipeline that runs from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea. It continues to receive fierce criticism from western nations because it would expand Russian influence over Europe. ###"

Senator Lummis asked Governor Brainard about multiple priorities for the state of Wyoming, including potential climate change regulations for community banks that lend to energy companies.The Board of Governors is the central governing body of the Federal Reserve and implements monetary policy and bank regulation in the U.S.In response to Senator Lummis’s questioning, Governor Brainard stated that she would not seek to impose climate regulations on community banks, finding they were not appropriate.“People across Wyoming are struggling due to rampant inflation and endless efforts by this administration to undercut the energy industry, which employs our residents and provides cheap, reliable energy,” Senator Lummis said. “Wyoming powers the nation. I sincerely hope Governor Brainard recognizes the burden climate change regulations could impose on Wyoming’s community banks and energy industry.”Progressive activists in the Biden administration want federal regulatory agencies to force community banks to stop lending money to energy companies and other industries that the Biden administration dislikes. Community banks are the cornerstones of towns around Wyoming, and policies like this would have a damaging impact on Wyoming’s energy industry. ###"

It is blatantly political, and I will continue to block President Biden’s EPA nominees over this issue. Wyoming has worked tirelessly to comply with federal law on its regional haze plan for the Jim Bridger Power Plant. The Biden administration’s decision to reverse course to appease environmental activists, including climate czars in the White House, will not help the people, or the environment, of Wyoming.”###"

This effort, known as eliminating the filibuster, would allow Democrats to force a federal takeover of state election laws without any Republican input. Current Senate rules generally require 60 senators to vote in favor of legislation for passage.“While the House of Representatives is about simple majority rule, the Senate – thanks in part to the filibuster – is defined by the rights of the minority party,” Senator Lummis said. “Simply put, it gives the party not in power a voice to speak for forgotten Americans and for small states like Wyoming.“Today, President Biden and Senate Democrats … are trying to overhaul our voting system by nuking the filibuster and seizing unchecked power.“Our country is divided right now. If we want a more perfect union than we have today, we need more compromise, not less. This is why we have institutional norms, like the filibuster. When one party starts tearing up norms, they might gain in the short term, but they do irreversible, lasting damage to our institutions.”Watch the full speech here.###"
https://www.lummis.senate.gov/press-releases/lummis-presses-fed-chair-powell-over-wyoming-bank-charter-delays/,"January 12, 2022Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) questioned Jay Powell during his nomination hearing to serve a second term as President Biden’s Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the U.S. and monitors financial institutions and their impact on broader financial stability.Senator Lummis pressed Powell over the Fed’s delay in approving master accounts and access to the payment system for two Wyoming special purpose depository institutions (SPDIs), which the state has chartered as banks and which are legally entitled to access under Federal law. The Fed is required by law to respond within one year, and is currently acting in an illegal manner.Powell responded that there were good arguments that the SPDI should be considered a depository institution and that the Federal Reserve would be making progress on the applications soon.“Time and time again, the Federal Reserve has delayed Wyoming’s attempts to promote responsible financial innovation,” Senator Lummis said. “The Fed is simultaneously ignoring its congressionally mandated duty to approve Wyoming’s SPDIs and failing to address inflation, while instead focusing its resources on politically charged issues like climate and race. My job is to ensure the Fed does its job: execute federal law without bias, and focus on our nation’s economy. Right now, the Fed is failing the people of Wyoming on multiple fronts, and Chair Powell is responsible.”In 2019, Wyoming began working with the Federal Reserve to discuss special purpose depository institutions (SPDIs), heavily regulated banks that are intended to bring digital assets into the regulatory perimeter for the first time. Among the questions Wyoming expected the Fed to address in a timely manner was whether SPDIs should be considered “depository institutions” and have access to the Federal Reserve’s payment system. Two years later, the Federal Reserve has yet to provide an answer, which is hurting businesses and preventing Wyoming’s long-sought economic diversification. The Fed’s delay also violates the law. In November, Senator Lummis wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal detailing the Fed’s failures, and how it was impacting her decision whether to support Chair Powell’s nomination.###"

John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, both R-Wyo., joined Senator Mike Braun (R-Ind.), 44 other Senators, and 136 Representatives in filing an amicus brief to the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS). The amicus brief was filed to an upcoming case considering the Biden administration’s recent mandate requiring private employers with over 100 employees to mandate the COVID-19 vaccine or weekly testing. The brief argues that Congress did not give the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) the authority to impose a vaccine mandate and urges SCOTUS to stay the mandate. “Congressional members have an interest in the powers they delegate to agencies not being abused—the legislative authority vested in the federal government belongs to Congress, not the Executive branch. In this case, the promulgation by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) of a sweeping, nationwide vaccine mandate on businesses intrudes into an area of legislative concern far beyond the authority of the agency,” the Members wrote. “And it does so with a Mandate enacted through OSHA’s seldom-used ‘emergency temporary standard’ (ETS) provision that allows for bypass of notice and comment rulemaking under certain circumstances. That OSHA exceeded its authority in enacting the ETS Mandate is not a ‘particularly hard’ question.”The full text of the brief can be found here. Background:###"

While the WHO says they are naming COVID-19 variants after letters in the Greek alphabet, they skipped the letter “Xi,” seemingly to avoid naming a variant after China’s president Xi Jinping.  The senators note that this is just one of numerous examples of the WHO showing deference to the Chinese Communist Party, and putting an emphasis on politics over public health and transparency.“The World Health Organization receives hundreds of millions of dollars a year from the American taxpayers, and the people in Wyoming have a right to know how our taxpayer dollars are being spent,” Senator Lummis said. “My constituents in Wyoming have the right to expect transparency and consistency from the institutions they help fund. The WHO has provided neither.”“It seems the standard for naming viruses is arbitrarily based on names that are most beneficial to favored members of the WHO, particularly China,” the senators wrote. “Indeed, the arbitrary nature of the naming policy only further underlines concerns that the WHO kowtows to the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese General Secretary Xi Jinping that were brought to the surface after the WHO and China’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic began in Wuhan. For too long, the WHO has bowed to pressure from the Chinese Communist Party.

Under his watch, inflation has increased over a 12-month period by more than it has since 1982. It did not have to be like this, but the Biden administration and Democrats have poured their efforts into overspending on the one hand, while holding down the labor market on the other. From an unnecessary stimulus at the start of the year to extra unemployment checks and vaccine mandates, this administration is doing the very opposite of what we should be doing to bring the economy back in a responsible manner. Instead, soaring gas prices and empty shelves are the result. The people of Wyoming deserve better.”The Consumer Price Index measures the change in prices over time for a selection of consumer goods and services, such as food and energy.

Businesses are already facing labor shortages, and families are faced with higher prices for every day necessities. This vaccine mandate only exacerbates those issues. I am pleased this measure passed the Senate, but we must keep fighting until the vaccine mandate is gone once and for all.”On September 8, President Joe Biden announced a vaccine mandate for Americans who work at companies with more than 100 employees. This mandate would force 80 million private sector employees to get vaccinated or comply with weekly testing, in addition to the existing mandates on millions of federal workers and contractors.The mandate repeal will now go to the House of Representatives for a vote.Click here to watch Senator Lummis’s remarks on vaccine mandates.###"

During the hearing before the Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security, Senator Lummis demanded privacy protections for our children using social media. She also highlighted the harms that can come from unlimited data collection gathered by these large platforms through a hypothetical example of a hostile government demanding private data on its citizens from Instagram.“Companies like Instagram often fail to build technology to serve its users’ best interests. Instead, they are often designing technology to maximize the collection of your data and subsequently sell visibility into its users’ private lives and interests,” Senator Lummis said during the hearing. “Congress must not ‘scroll past’ this critical moment without properly addressing the harms our youth are encountering on these platforms.” “People in Wyoming value their privacy above almost everything else. It’s even more important when it comes to their children,” Senator Lummis said. “It’s time that we understand the full breadth of the impact that social media companies like Instagram can have. Congress must install guardrails to both protect user privacy and shield our children from the harms of social media usage.”Senator Lummis is a cosponsor of the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, which would block companies from harvesting children’s internet data and selling it for advertising.###"

Potential solutions include lifting a ban on new oil and gas leasing and drilling on federal land, and allowing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to approve pipeline projects. “In Wyoming, we are paying over a dollar more per gallon at the gas pump. This is already hurting Wyoming workers and families, and it’s going to cause a lot more pain as we heat our homes this winter,” said Senator Lummis. “It’s time for President Biden to focus on the real issues facing Americans – issues like rising inflation and supply chain disruptions that are doing real damage across the country.” In the letter, the senators wrote, “even before colder temperatures set in, natural gas inventories around the nation are 5.5% below the five-year average, and demand has ramped up as the economy continues to recover. Due to lower supply and higher demand, natural gas prices are more than 250% higher than they were this time last year and the Energy Information Agency (EIA) expects natural gas prices to climb even higher this winter due to supply projections.” “After numerous conversations over the last year with domestic energy producers, the number one reason they cite for these higher and increasing prices is depressed investment in our production due to regulatory uncertainty,” the senators continued. “Business leaders are reluctant to make complex, long-term investments in expensive new wells, pipelines, and other infrastructure critical to increasing production and keeping American energy prices low if these projects will be delayed or overly burdened by new, expansive regulations or taxes.” Read the full letter here. ###"

The United States has been plagued by shipping problems this year, which has left cargo ships sitting in ports waiting for space to unload. Skyrocketing inflation and supply chain disruptions have led to empty shelves and higher prices in Wyoming and the rest of the country.“The people of Wyoming are experiencing supply chain issues first-hand, from higher prices for staple foods, to a lack of needed home goods,” Senator Lummis said. “It’s time that President Biden and his administration take action to cut red tape and speed up shipping processes.

https://www.lummis.senate.gov/press-releases/lummis-introduces-bill-to-bring-accountability-to-the-endangered-species-act/,"December 7, 2021WASHINGTON, D.C. –Today, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) along with Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), Jim Risch (R-ID), and Mike Crapo (R-ID) introduced the State, Tribal, and Local Species Transparency and Recovery Act. This legislation amends the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 to require federal agencies, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to provide states, counties, and tribes with the scientific reasoning behind Endangered Species Act determinations.The bill also requires federal agencies to use up-to-date research when making decisions about wildlife protected under the Endangered Species Act, including information that states, tribes, and other stakeholders provide them.There is clear evidence in Wyoming that the ESA needs to be updated. The Greater Yellowstone Grizzly Bear resides predominately in and around Yellowstone National Park in Northwestern Wyoming. This year alone, there have been reports of grizzly bear sightings as far South as southern Lincoln County near the Utah border. The towns of Jackson and Cody are seeing more and more grizzlies wander into their town lines. By the end of October, 42 grizzlies had been killed after being hit by cars, killed in self-defense, or euthanized by wildlife scientists due to aggressive interactions with humans. That’s up from 31 by the same time in 2020.The late Senator Mike Enzi (R-WY) previously sponsored this bill.“This legislation makes sure that local, tribal, and state communities have a seat at the table when actions under the ESA are being considered,” Senator Lummis said. “Congress has heard from local governments, particularly from western states containing a significant portion of federal land, that ESA-implementing agencies often ignore locally-generated science and data provided to them for listing determinations. States and tribes often have actual data that federal agencies may lack. The law already requires agencies to cooperate with the states ‘to the maximum extent practicable,’ yet this is not being done. This legislation will fix that.”“State and local experts are in the best position to collect and report the most accurate data on wildlife in their state. It only makes sense that the federal government would prioritize this information when making listing decisions,” said Senator Barrasso. “Species that go on the endangered species list seem to stay there forever. Our legislation increases transparency in the listing process and makes sure state and local experts are involved in all conservation efforts.”“The Endangered Species Act is well-intentioned but grossly flawed. More often than not, the law creates so much bureaucratic red tape that it comes at the expense of the very species it seeks to protect,” Senator Risch said. “This legislation will make strides to ensure greater transparency, accountability, and local involvement in species listing and recovery.”“I have been a longtime advocate of species recovery, restoration and conservation, but the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is an out-of-control regulatory measure in desperate need of reform. Our legislation takes important steps toward bringing transparency and improving collaboration, efficiency and effectiveness among agencies using the ESA. Our reforms will be critical to improving the ESA’s overall effectiveness, and ensure state, local, and tribal leaders have a seat at the table in the management of endangered species,” said Senator Crapo.To read the full bill text, click here.###"

This plan would promote American domestic energy production and jobs while reducing global emissions by up to 40 percent from today’s levels by 2050.The American Energy, Jobs, and Climate Plan promotes an all-of-the-above energy strategy that preserves traditional energy sources like coal, oil, and natural gas while developing technologies, such as carbon capture, to reduce their emissions. The plan also promotes new energy sources, such as wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear to better secure our domestic energy supply and cut emissions while creating new, sustainable jobs.“Wyoming literally powers the nation, and I am committed to ensuring it stays that way long into the future,” said Senator Lummis. “As the largest net exporter of energy in the United States, it is essential, not only to the well-being of Wyoming, but to the energy security of the United States, to continue to produce and export Wyoming coal, uranium, oil, and natural gas all while investing in new technologies that can make them cleaner and more environmentally friendly. Wyoming, and the United States, can and should be the global leaders in clean and sustainable energy solutions. Wyoming is already leading the way in carbon capture and we have the ingenuity to develop the next clean energy success.”Wyoming is also leading the way in new green technologies for energy production, including carbon capture technology, wind energy technology, and alternatives for methane flaring – including the mining of bitcoin and other digital assets. The American Energy, Jobs, and Climate Plan would allow Wyoming energy producers to build on their success and continue to produce reliable energy for the United States.The framework is built around five key policy priorities: 1) Expand America’s current power and energy production base to leverage U.S. world-class energy resources, to empower American workers, enhance U.S. economic and national security, and reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.2) Support infrastructure, resources, investments, and incentives to build out the American renewable energy manufacturing and electricity sector.3) Leverage America’s energy and natural resource abundance and independence to create millions of good-paying jobs in the energy and manufacturing sectors and empower the American worker.4) Enact permitting reform to make sure all energy, mineral, and infrastructure projects can be built in an efficient, timely, and certain manner.5) Take advantage of America’s abundant energy and natural resources and rebuild the American supply chain to continue to gain comparative advantages against China, Russia, Iran and other foreign adversaries while lowering global greenhouse gas emissions.During the remarks, Senator Lummis said, “China is by far the biggest polluter in the world. By far. India is right behind them and India is going to be the largest population on the globe. If we would export our technology, our liquid natural gas, and help them as the largest democratic republic on earth – we’re the oldest, they’re the largest – we would do more for global climate change than we can do by spending the amount of money the Biden administration wants to throw at the word climate change without solving the problems.“So, what I’m so proud of is the focus that Senator Sullivan, Senator Cramer, and others involved have taken to making sure we move the needle on climate, not move the needle on the rhetoric of climate. That’s what the other side is doing. We want to move the needle on the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.”###"

In her perfect world, the community banks we rely on here in Wyoming would be taken over by the federal government. In her perfect world, every dollar made by residents of Wyoming would be subject to government control. I will not support a nominee that seeks to fundamentally alter our way of life here in Wyoming.”Dr. Omarova has published dozens of articles calling for more government intervention in the economy and industry. She has repeatedly called for an end to the energy industry as we know it. She has been a vocal supporter of the Green New Deal and other progressive policies that would hurt Wyoming families and businesses. She has also advocated for more government bureaucracy to dictate which businesses and industries people can invest in.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency supervises all national banks and will have a role in regulating digital assets, which will deeply impact the new digital asset industry in Wyoming.###"

So far, the Biden administration has been hostile toward state management of wildlife within our borders. Considering her previous state-level work, I hope that Ms. Williams would provide a more state-friendly approach.”Williams is currently serving as Principal Deputy Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service and served as the Director of the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks from 2017 to 2020.

The bill comes in response to press reports that the Department of Justice is considering making payments to illegal immigrants in response to certain Trump administration immigration policies.“People in Wyoming are not interested in bankrolling yet another handout from the federal government, especially to those who broke the law. It’s long past time to secure our borders and begin taking our crippling national debt seriously,” Senator Lummis said. “A $450,000 check to those who crossed our border illegally will not do anything to make our country safer or financially secure. I applaud Senator Daines for standing up for Wyoming citizens, and all Americans, who recognize the absurdity of this proposal from the Biden administration.”“It’s an outrageous insult to the American people to use taxpayer money to support the Biden administration’s failed and dangerous open-border policies,” Senator Barrasso said. “The Biden administration was recently reported to be considering rewarding illegal immigrants who break the law with up to $450,000 each. This is over four times more than what we give the families of our fallen service members – including the family of Wyoming’s own Rylee McCollum. Our legislation will block any money from taxpayers in Wyoming and across the country from falling into the hands of those who break our laws.”“Biden’s open border policies have reached a new crazy level. Montana families are struggling with inflation and skyrocketing costs on everything from gas to groceries because of Biden’s wasteful spending policies, and now the President wants to give hundreds of thousands of dollars to illegal immigrants.

The FARM Act would strengthen the outdated Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938.“Transparency is a vitally important to a functioning democracy,” Senator Lummis said. “It’s essential that we know who is lobbying our elected officials, and which governments are paying them to do so. It’s the 21st century and we need to update our systems in order to protect our nation’s public policy from undisclosed foreign influence.”“America is in a clash of civilizations with foreign kleptocrats and criminals who use secret channels of influence,” Senator Whitehouse said. “Sunlight is the best disinfectant, which is why I’m glad to join this bipartisan effort to modernize FARA and shine the light of transparency on foreign interests.”“The American people deserve to know how foreign countries are attempting to influence our government,” Rep. Buck said. “Due to loopholes in the law and an outdated filing process, the public is left in the dark. It’s time to bring the FARA filing system into the 21st century and ensure that Americans can review any and all efforts by foreign governments to influence our nation’s public policy. I encourage my colleagues to join Rep. Khanna, Sen. Lummus, Sen. Whitehouse and I as cosponsors of this important legislation.”“Every American should be able to easily search for within a few minutes which foreign governments are paying lobbyists to influence our elected leaders,” Rep. Khanna said. “FARA records have exposed the massive Saudi lobbying campaign against my legislative efforts to end US support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. In the 21st century, everyone should have easy access to this info, and it shouldn’t take a research team to dig through cumbersome FARA filings.”Current law requires any individual who is engaging in political work on behalf of a foreign government to register as a foreign agent and biannually report on their activities. Under the FARM Act, the Department of Justice would have to create an electronic database of foreign agents readily accessible and searchable by the American public.The bipartisan bill was originally introduced last Congress in the House by Representative Ken Buck (R-CO) and Representative Ro Khanna (D-CA).To read the FARM Act, click here.###"

The letter presents six potential actions the administration could take to help ease the supply chain crisis and ensure stores have stocked shelves in advance of the Christmas season.“People in Wyoming see empty shelves and long shipping times, and they’re eager for solutions,” Senator Lummis said. “I look forward to hearing from President Biden and finding ways we can address this crisis now to make sure consumers have access to goods and businesses can operate smoothly as they enter into the busiest time of the year.”Rampant inflation and interruptions to U.S. supply chains caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are resulting in empty shelves and high prices in Wyoming and across the country. Senator Lummis’s letter lays out solutions, such as regulatory relief on the trucking and railroad industry, to help ease the pain of the current supply chain crisis.Click here to view the full letter.###"

The Bush, Obama and Trump administrations all recognized that the grizzly population in and around Yellowstone is fully recovered, yet activist groups have prevented their delisting.“The story of the GYE grizzly bear should be one of triumph and success for federal, state, and local conservation efforts,” the letter says. “Instead, it has become another story of government bureaucracy and failure that only casts doubt on the efficacy of the Endangered Species Act. In 1972, population estimates of the GYE grizzly were as low as 136 bears. In 1975, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the grizzly bear as a threatened species in the lower 48 states. In 2019, the Service placed the number of bears at 728, and some estimates put the population closer to 1200 bears.”“The Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team, the group of federal, state, and tribal scientists and biologists responsible for the long-term monitoring and research of the GYE grizzly, have determined that the bears are at or near the carrying capacity of the park,” the letter continues. “Grizzlies are moving well beyond areas where the bears can exist, causing loss of human life, damage to livestock, and eroding public support for the recovery of this iconic and important species.”In March, Senator Lummis introduced the Grizzly Bear State Management Act of 2021, which would direct the Secretary of the Interior to reissue a final rule to remove the GYE grizzly bears from the Endangered Species List. It is currently awaiting a hearing from the Environment and Public Works committee.Read the full letter here.###"
https://www.lummis.senate.gov/press-releases/lummis-statement-on-presidents-working-group-report-on-stablecoins/,"November 1, 2021WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis issued the following statement about today’s release of the President’s Working Group report on stablecoins:“I appreciate the effort that the President’s Working Group put into their report. I agree with many of their recommendations, including the need for Congressional legislation and prudential risk management. However, proposing that only insured depository institutions may issue a stablecoin is misguided and wrong. As of now, it’s not even clear that FDIC insurance is available for stablecoins. There are other, safer ways of achieving the same objectives. For example, we could require 100% of stablecoin reserves to be maintained off-balance sheet, or require stablecoin reserves to be maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank, which is, by definition, risk-free. We already have a case study in this – Wyoming’s special purpose depository institutions are already doing this.  I am concerned that this recommendation will only serve to benefit big banks and will restrict innovation. We should all be able to agree that startups should have the same chance as Wall Street institutions to succeed. As the report clearly states, though, Congress will, and should, have the final say.”###"
https://www.lummis.senate.gov/press-releases/lummis-introduces-legislation-requiring-federal-employees-to-return-to-work/,"October 28, 2021HERD Act mandates federal employees at agencies including the IRS, SSA and VA return to duty to serve Wyoming constituentsWASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), and Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Rick Scott (R-FL), Mike Rounds (R-SD) and Roger Marshall (R-KS) introduced the Having Employees Return to Duty Act of 2021 (HERD). This bill would mandate all federal employees, with the exception of the Department of Defense, that are complying with President Biden’s Executive Order 14043, return to their duty station and the hours they were working prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. While providing for CDC social distancing recommendations, the bill will help constituents in Wyoming, and citizens across the country, who are currently being underserved by federal agencies due to remote work and a backlog of casework issues. “It’s long past time for federal workers to be back in the office helping the people of Wyoming, and constituents across the United States. There is a huge casework backlog, and that is negatively impacting our veterans, our seniors, our business owners and American citizens,” Senator Lummis said. “It’s time to put aside politics, follow the science and get back to work. Americans across the country have been returning to in-person work, and the federal bureaucrats who work for them should do the same.” “The federal government’s slow return to normal work conditions is negatively affecting the lives of thousands of citizens across Wyoming and the country. The American people are ready to get back to work safely and the government should do the same,” said Senator Barrasso. “It is past time federal agencies get employees back to their posts to help the American people as soon as possible.” “We’ve learned a lot over the past 19 months through best practices, science, and vaccines for federal workers to return to their duty stations safely.  The limitations of prolonged absences from offices is affecting casework and other services on which seniors, veterans, and others in Mississippi rely,” Senator Hyde-Smith said.  “I think it makes sense for folks to get back to the office.” “Tennesseans have spent the past 18 months showing up to work and keeping America running. Now, it’s time for bureaucrats in the federal government to do the same,” said Senator Blackburn. “It’s time for America to get back to work.” “I’ve heard from families across Florida who are facing issues due to backlogs at federal agencies,” Senator Scott said. “Americans everywhere are expected to go to work each day and are able to do so safely – the federal government shouldn’t be any different.  We must get the government back to work for the American people and I hope all of my colleagues will support this good bill.” “From obtaining drought assistance from the Farm Service Agency to receiving military service documents from the National Personnel Records Center, South Dakotans are experiencing lengthy delays at our federal agencies,” saidSenator Rounds. “I have heard directly from South Dakotans whose applications and requests are on the back burner as some federal agencies are not fully staffed and have not returned to the office. These delays result in real-world consequences for those who obtain VA or Social Security benefits, receive a federal tax return and look for immigration help. It is time for all federal workers to return to their work stations to fix ongoing backlogs and serve the needs of our constituents.” “For over a year and a half, my office has heard from constituents across Kansas who have struggled to get the timely assistance they need from federal agencies due to remote work policies,” saidSenator Marshall. “From stories of extreme backlogs at USDA and the IRS to difficulties accessing assistance from the VA or Social Security Administration, it’s clear that the federal government is failing to serve the American people because of remote work policies that no longer make sense. It’s time for federal employees to return to in-person service. It’s why I introduced the Return Act in August, and why I’m proud to join Sen. Lummis and my colleagues in introducing this bill today.” Senator Lummis has heard from many Wyoming constituents frustrated with the lack of critical services being provided due to closed offices, or limited hours, at agencies including the Social Security Administration, Internal Revenue Service, National Personnel Records office, Veteran’s Affairs offices, U.S. Department of State Visa Processing Center and the Western Passport Center, among many others. In May 2021, The New York Times published an article highlighting that over 1,200 Social Security Administration offices were shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn stopped lower-income individuals from seeking help and applying for benefits. These constituents deserve better service from their government, and this bill will make sure that happens. To read the bill, click here. ###"

This follows a recent hearing where former Facebook employee Frances Haugen testified before the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee on which Senator Lummis sits. “The documents that Ms. Haugen shared provided alarming insight to internal research conducted at Facebook and the harm its platforms, including Instagram, causes kids and teenagers,” Senator Lummis wrote. “In light of Ms. Haugen’s testimony, it is evident that these reports only scratch the surface of the detailed research that Facebook has withheld from policy makers. This practice must end. Sunlight disinfects, and it is my hope that congressional oversight of Facebook’s internal research will bring appropriate accountability to these platforms.”In the letter, Senator Lummis asks Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to provide information and research related to harmful effects Facebook and Instagram can cause on children including depression, eating disorders, and image dysmorphia. Additionally, the letter requests information about Facebook’s awareness of parents’ inability to assist their children when they confront these issues online. Earlier this year, Haugen released thousands of pages of internal Facebook documents and research to the Wall Street Journal, prompting congressional oversight. To read the full letter, click here. ###"

Her vote made her the pioneering woman who cast the first legal vote in a general election under Wyoming law. She later moved to Maryland, and was laid to rest in Baltimore.“As the first woman to serve Wyoming in the U.S. Senate, it is an honor to have my first bill that passes the U.S. Senate be one that commemorates a true pioneer from the states of Wyoming and Maryland,” Senator Lummis said about her bill. “I can’t think of a better name for a federal building in the first state to recognize this right and enshrine full suffrage for women in law. It’s been an honor working with colleagues in Wyoming and Maryland on this bill to honor a pioneer so important to both of our states.”“Louisa Swain broke new ground in the fight for women’s suffrage, and her work to push our nation towards greater democracy must not be forgotten. Maryland is proud that after her historic vote, Ms. Swain went on to call our state home and was laid to rest at the Friends Burial Ground in Baltimore.

The Foreign Adversary Risk Management (FARM) Act will give agriculture representatives more oversight and say on the Committee of Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The committee oversees and reviews foreign investment and ownership in domestic businesses with national security implications. Similar legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Ronny Jackson (R-TX-13) and Representative Filemon Vela (D-TX-34). “As a Wyoming rancher, I understand the importance of the agriculture industry and having knowledgeable voices involved in any decision affectingagriculture,” Senator Lummis said. “This legislation will give the Department of Agriculture the ability to defend our agriculture industry from foreign control. In today’s world of global industries and supply chains, we need to make sure that the people of Wyoming and America know those at the top of America’s agricultural industry really care about our needs, and this bill will help do that.”Currently, CFIUS does not directly consider the needs of the agriculture industry when reviewing foreign investment and ownership in domestic businesses. The FARM Act would change that. Among other things, it would give the Secretary of Agriculture a seat on CFIUS, and ensure foreign corporations and investors involvement in the US agriculture industry, including actions like mergers and acquisitions, are in the best interest of the United States.“The pandemic has underscored the critical contributions of our farmers, ranchers, and agriculture community to ensure our country remains food secure even in the face of unprecedented times,” Senator Tuberville said. “Food security is national security, which is why the agriculture industry needs a seat at the table for the foreign investment vetting process. By adding agricultural supply chains as a covered transaction for CFIUS review, we can safeguard our food supply chains and agriculture industry from bad actors.” ###"

As the national debt approaches $29 trillion, both Democrats and Republicans are moving forward with plans to raise the debt limit and allow new spending without addressing the impending crisis.“We cannot go on like this. It is irresponsible at the deepest levels,” Senator Lummis said. “Now I understand and appreciate the concerns that have led to this short-term debt limit deal. But the fact of the matter is, unless we actually address the spending problems driving our national debt, and soon, we are already saddling future generations of people in Wyoming with a debt they will never be able to repay. And soon, interest payments on that debt will crowd out other spending. This is, frankly, unforgivable.” “Instead of finger pointing, what I’d really like to do is get together with my colleagues, in both parties, and come up with a way to finally balance our budget, contain these massive interest payments, and start paying down this debt,” Senator Lummis continued. “Because this problem isn’t one that only affects one party. When the time comes to pay the bill, our debt holders won’t care if you’re Republican or Democrat. They’ll only care about getting that check covered. And we’re swiftly approaching a time when we will be unable to do so.” Senator Lummis has introduced multiple bills addressing the national debt, including the Pay Down the Debt Act which would allow states to return federal grant money and earmark it for payments on the national debt and the Sustainable Budget Act which would create a bipartisan commission to create a plan to address the national debt. To watch the Senator’s full floor speech, click here. ###"
