Vagins, President and CEO of the National Network to End Domestic Violence:“The National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV) and our member state and territorial domestic violence coalitions are deeply grateful to Senators Feinstein, Ernst, Durbin, and Murkowski for their leadership and commitment to domestic and sexual violence survivors by championing the passage of the bipartisan Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. This VAWA reauthorization provides survivors, the thousands of local programs that serve them, and communities with much-needed resources for housing, legal assistance, alternatives to criminal responses, and prevention programming. The bill also includes critical economic justice and non-discrimination provisions, restores tribal sovereignty to hold non-native abusers accountable, and makes important investments in culturally specific service providers to ensure all survivors are supported. These lifesaving protections will give survivors greater access to safety, justice, and services on their path to healing after abuse.” Ruth M. Glenn, President/CEO of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence:“The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) is integral to our nation’s response to domestic violence and sexual assault. VAWA funds everything from housing to victim advocates to legal services training to prevention. VAWA is critical to ensuring that when survivors reach out for help, someone is there to help them. The enhancements in this bill seek to increase the responsiveness of systems to survivor needs by providing additional avenues for them to seek safety and justice and investing in prevention. NCADV and the programs and survivors we represent commend Congress, and particularly Senators Feinstein, Ernst, Durbin, and Murkowski, for taking a stand to support victims, survivors and advocates.” Margaret Mitchell, CEO of YWCA USA:“For over 160 years, YWCAs have been on the ground and see first-hand the importance of maintaining protections for all survivors in the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA),"" said Margaret Mitchell, CEO, YWCA USA. ""As we continue to address the prolonged effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to see increases in demand for services. The reauthorization of the VAWA will ensure survivor safety by providing the safety, resources, and protections critical to all survivors, particularly women of color and other marginalized communities. We applaud the reauthorization of this long-awaited bipartisan bill and look forward to continue working with Congress to support survivors."" Esta Soler, President and Founder of Futures Without Violence:“We are proud to stand with Senators Durbin, Ernst, Murkowski and especially our home state Senator, Dianne Feinstein celebrating the passage of the Violence Against Women Act. VAWA is life-saving, and needs to get to President Biden's desk as soon as possible. We were particuarly pleased to see the focus on prevention and new programs that address the needs of children and youth, in particular Bree's Law. No parent should have to bury their child because of dating violence.” Katie Ray-Jones, CEO of The National Domestic Violence Hotline:“All survivors should have a variety of options to meet their evolving and complex needs for services and support. We applaud this VAWA re-authorization bill, especially because of the critical enhancements that invest in services, prevention, and accountability. We are deeply thankful to the bill co-sponsors and appreciate their commitment to uplifting the nuanced needs of survivors,” said Katie Ray-Jones, CEO of The Hotline. “Survivors need support more than ever—since 2015, demand for our services has increased 46% and in December we answered our 6 millionth contact since our inception.” Patti Tototzintle, CEO and President of Esperanza United:""We need to pass the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) with key enhancements. It hasn't been reauthorized since 2013 and so much has changed since then. As we emerge from the pandemic, Latinas and immigrants are experiencing the continued effects of increased isolation, misinformation, lack of access to health care and workplace protections, and lack of sufficient access to community-based resources and support. All of this increases risks to domestic violence and makes efforts to access safety and well-being so much harder. An improved and reauthorized VAWA will save lives by providing advocates, practitioners, and survivors of domestic and sexual violence with updated and more comprehensive resources and options. As an organization, we applaud the leadership of Senators Feinstein, Ernst, Durbin, Murkowski, and the advocates that work so hard to get the Violence Against Women Act of 2022 signed into law by President Biden."" Monika Johnson Hostler, President of the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence:“This moment, a day to truly celebrate, is the culmination of the work of so many survivors, advocates, policy leaders, and congressional staff and has been almost 10 years in the making. VAWA is an essential tool in our work to address and end gender-based violence, and we are thrilled our collective work has come to fruition. We’re grateful for the leadership of Senators Feinstein, Ernst, Durbin and Murkowski, and all of the VAWA co-sponsors and supporters who’ve made this day a reality.” Lucy R. Simpson, Executive Director of the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center:“The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) is an important step forward in addressing jurisdictional gaps that leave Native women and children vulnerable. By strengthening and restoring Tribal jurisdiction and providing necessary resources to Tribal governments through VAWA, Tribes will be better equipped to keep their communities safe and ensure justice for Native women.” Carol Moody, President & CEO of Legal Momentum, the Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund:“The passage of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2022 is a crucial, overdue, and positive step towards better protecting all survivors of gender-based violence. Each reauthorization of VAWA provides an opportunity to improve our response and meet the real and current needs of victims and survivors. As one of the earliest advocates for VAWA, we are proud that the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2022 includes critical enhancements and investments to serve the needs of all survivors and impacted communities.” Meredith Jacobs, CEO of Jewish Women International:""The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2022 does so much to address the gaps and fill the needs felt by women and girls nationwide. It is by far the most significant reauthorization of VAWA to date and Jewish Women International (JWI) is proud to be part of the coalitions that helped bring it to bear. Ending violence against women must be a national priority. When a woman is not safe, her home, her workplace, her community, is not safe. The ripple effects of the violence and trauma are deeply felt by her children and everyone in its wake. Far too often, we look at mass shootings, homelessness, and incarceration of survivors and find at the center violence against women. For JWI, VAWA is personal — it has been for forty years — since one of our members was shot and killed by her estranged husband. That horrific event drives our mission. We have worked to bring the voice of the Jewish community into the many reauthorization efforts, but this is legislation desperately needed by every person, regardless of faith. As an organization working to ensure the safety of all survivors, we celebrate VAWA’s reauthorization and look forward to the Violence Against Women Act of 2022 being signed into law by President Biden.” Mónica Ramírez, President and Founder of Justice for Migrant Women:""Increasing access to safety and support for all survivors is a priority for Justice for Migrant Women, and passing The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2022 is a critical step toward creating a safer space for survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment. As we imagine and fight for a world free from violence, we support VAWA and continue to advocate for policies that protect immigrant survivors and survivors from historically marginalized communities.” Sheila Katz, CEO of the National Council of Jewish Women:""Each VAWA reauthorization is an opportunity to strengthen the law based on our increased understanding of gender-based violence. This time is no different. Informed by survivors and advocates, VAWA would invest in prevention; increase access to services for survivors, including community-specific services and legal services; maintain existing protections for all survivors, including immigrant, LGBTQ, and Native survivors; improve housing access for survivors; expand access to safety and justice for Native survivors; sustain vital non-discrimination provisions; improve access for culturally specific communities; and address the needs of incarcerated women. It is an important step in the right direction for survivors."" Karma Cottman, Executive Director/CEO of Ujima Inc., The National Center on Violence Against Women in the Black Community:“Ujima Inc. applauds the passage of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2022 and deeply appreciates the dedication of Congress to prioritize the needs of survivors. Women and children of color are disproportionately impacted by domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. The increased funding for communities of color, particularly for culturally specific organizations, will increase access to services and resources and undoubtedly save lives.” ### "

http://www.ernst.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/columns?ContentRecord_id=78B64FB4-2367-48B7-85E2-7D556B0D6545,"After weeks of dragging their feet, and under bipartisan pressure, on Tuesday the Biden administration finally took steps to ban imports of oil and natural gas from Russia. As Putin continues his assault on freedom and slaughters innocent men, women, and children in Ukraine, the president made the right decision to end purchasing of Russia’s bloody oil. But what took so long?It’s important to remember that in his first days in office, President Biden took unilateral action to reduce American energy production. He ended the Keystone XL pipeline, paused leasing of federal lands and waters for drilling, and prioritized far-Left climate priorities like electric vehicles. As a result, the United States shifted from a net exporter of energy to becoming reliant on adversaries, like Russia. In fact, last year, the United States imported over 670,000 barrels a day from Russia. And as gasoline prices continued to rise for Americans across the country, the Biden administration refused to turn to America’s own energy production and instead stayed the course on their out-of-touch climate agenda.Hardworking Iowans share the concerns of folks across the country about higher gas prices. They also know the answer is not to turn to our adversaries, either to import energy or the materials and batteries used for electric vehicles—which are often Chinese-made and mined by Chinese companies using slave labor. Iowans know the answer is to take immediate, decisive action to unleash the American energy sector to protect both our national security and consumers at the pump.Our state can play a vital role in reducing our dependence on Russia. This week, Senator Chuck Grassley and I put forward bipartisan legislation to replace Russian oil with clean, American-made renewable fuels that are available right now. Our new bill, the Home Front Energy Independence Act, puts into law a ban on Russian oil and couples it with opening up the use and production of biofuel that’s grown in the American heartland. It will make E15 available year round, establish an E15 and Biodiesel Tax Credit, direct EPA to finalize their E15 labeling rule, and provide for biofuel infrastructure and compatibility with retailers. The current excess ethanol capacity domestically is nearly the same as the amount of Russian gas the U.S. had been importing, and we have the capability to ramp up production. It’s time Congress takes action to allow our renewable fuels industry to fill the gap and provide consumers with a more affordable choice at the pump.Energy security is national security, and the Biden administration’s misguided energy policies have no doubt impacted the crises we’re seeing unfold both abroad and here at home. We need to return to American energy independence and Iowa biofuel is ready to play its part. This effort has the support of Democrats and Republicans, will be a boost for the hardworking farmers and producers across the Midwest, and will help punish Putin and his cronies."

   On her experience in Ukraine and action needed from the Biden administration: 
    “I spent some time in Ukraine while it was part of the Soviet Union in 1989, and what I learned from the Ukrainians at that point was they wanted to be free—that remains true today—Ukrainians want to be free. And what we see—this aggression shown by Russia, by Vladamir Putin, it is absolutely unacceptable and it should be unacceptable across the world stage. We have to do more to provide lethal aid to the Ukrainians, we need to cut of Russian energy sources, we need to become energy independent, and we need to make sure we are doing absolutely everything we can to allow the Ukrainians freedom and democracy.”On Putin ordering Russian nuclear forces on high alert: 
    “This would be a catastrophe and it would be the end of the Russian Federation. This type of action—going to nuclear war—would absolutely not be tolerated by anyone around this globe. And we certainly need to hear President Biden speak out against these types of actions. Vladamir Putin has gone a step too far making these threats, and we need our president to step up and be a leader, not a follower, but a leader and decry these types of announcements by Vladamir Putin. But again, this would truly be the end of the Russian Federation as the rest of the world would step up and destroy him.”On the importance of regaining American energy independence: 
    “We have decreased American independence when it comes to our fuel sources and instead become much more reliant upon Russia. And now we see the United States negotiating with Iran and offering to lift sanctions on Iran as we work through a new nuclear agreement with them. This is ludicrous. This president and the climate alarmists that are out there—they need to take that and move a different direction. We should be producing our own energy here in the United States of America, providing for American jobs, driving down energy prices right here at home, and not relying on our near peer adversaries like Russia and Iran…energy security is national security.”On Governor Reynolds giving the Republican response to President Biden’s State of the Union: 
    “I am so proud of our governor and our wonderful state of Iowa. Kim Reynolds has been a true patriot and a leader through so many difficult challenges. She is striving to of course lower taxes for Iowans, make sure that our teachers and our students and our families have a path forward through COVID. She’s done an admirable job there. She has opened our economy and was one of the first state leaders to do that during COVID-19, and I am just very thankful that she has the opportunity to highlight Iowa and push back on this disastrous Biden administration.”###

This bipartisan bill, now law, will ensure employers in our state, and across the country, get their fair shot in the federal contracting process,” said Senator Ernst. “Every small business in Michigan and across the nation should have an equal opportunity to help serve the American people. That is why it is essential that these businesses – which are the foundation of our economy – have a fair opportunity to win federal contracts,” said Senator Peters. “I’m grateful to President Biden for signing this important legislation into law so that disadvantaged small businesses can compete on a level playing field when it comes to the federal contracting process.”Small businesses that want to compete in the federal marketplace often face hurdles to participating in government procurement. This is especially true for women-owned, veteran-owned, minority-owned, and other disadvantaged small businesses. The Promoting Rigorous and Innovative Cost Efficiencies for Federal Procurement and Acquisitions (PRICE) Act will ensure that small businesses are front and center in the acquisition process by encouraging government entities to adopt new and innovative practices, increase small business participation in government contracting, modernize the federal acquisition process, and report on how to improve mission outcomes and save taxpayer money.The law is supported by a broad coalition of groups including Small Business Majority, Association of Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (APTAC), GovEvolve, HUBZone Contractors National Council, and the Women Veterans Business Coalition.“The HUBZone Contractors National Council commends Senator Peters for leading the PRICE Act. Small business participation in the federal marketplace is key to ensuring a strong industrial base, however, small businesses find that agencies continue to be reluctant to utilize these programs,” said Michelle Burnett, Executive Director. HUBZone Contractors National Council. “The PRICE Act provides increased opportunities for HUBZone companies by encouraging the acquisition workforce to share innovative best practices to increase small business participation across the federal government.”“Small IT companies are at the forefront of innovation, but often face barriers when selling to the federal government,” said Eminence Griffin, Executive Director, GovEvolve. “The PRICE Act addresses the need for modernizing the federal acquisition system and will be transformative for small business IT contractors around the country. GovEvolve is thrilled to support the PRICE Act and thanks Senators Peters and Ernst for championing this important issue.”“APTAC is proud to support the PRICE Act. APTAC believes in sharing best practices and the difference it can make for all concerned,” said Terri Williams, President, APTAC. “APTAC members frequently share their own best practices with each other, which lends itself to invaluable information gained from the experience of others.  APTAC and its members applaud actions taken for the betterment of Government contracting—for our Government and the private sector.”###"

I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to hold Vladimir Putin accountable for this needless bloodshed and, most importantly, ensure the protection of the American people and American interests.”###"

RED OAK, Iowa—As Putin further invades Ukraine, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) is supporting an effort to reduce global dependence on Russia and unleash American energy. The bill, the Energy Security Cooperation with Allied Partners in Europe Act (ESCAPE Act), would supplement European energy needs with American liquid natural gas, removing a lever of Russian influence.“The Biden administration has made us more reliant on Russia for our energy needs, and their appeasement of our adversaries has led to Putin’s continued aggression towards Ukraine. This bill will unleash the American energy sector and help reduce our NATO allies’ dependence on adversaries, and in turn boost our economic interests and protect our national security,” said Senator Ernst.The Energy Security Cooperation with Allied Partners in Europe Act or the “ESCAPE Act”:###"

RED OAK, Iowa—U.S. Senator Ernst (R-Iowa), Republican leader of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, is backing legislation to re-impose terrorism sanctions on the Iran-controlled Houthis after a series of terror strikes on civilian targets in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia.This follows the Biden administration’s announcement that it would lift terrorism-related sanctions on the Houthis and three of their leaders: Abdul Malik al-Houthi, Abd al-Khaliq Badr al-Din al-Houthi, and Abdullah Yahya al-Hakim. The bill reverses the decision, re-designating the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and the group and their leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists.“President Biden’s decision to lift sanctions on the Iran-backed Houthis is yet another example that his doctrine of appeasement continues to fail and threaten America. Since his administration backed off sanctions, we’ve seen an uptick in terrorism activities and targeting of American allies. If President Biden isn’t going to take our adversaries’ threats seriously, Congress needs to act, and this legislation will reinstate commonsense sanctions to help protect our partners abroad and Americans here at home,” said Senator Ernst.Background: 
Last month, Ernst joined nine of her Senate colleagues in a letter to President Joe Biden demanding that he enforce mandatory sanctions against the growing fleet of oil tankers selling Iranian oil and against the entities purchasing this oil.Senator Ernst joined an effort to impose human rights sanctions on the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the regime's President Ebrahim Raisi. Ernst has continued to oppose the Biden administration’s efforts to rejoin the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). She backed a bill that would enable Congress to approve—or block—any effort by the administration to suspend or terminate U.S. sanctions against the Iranian regime. She also urged the Biden administration to work with our allies and partners to impose a new arms embargo on Iran.In addition, Ernst helped introduce legislation that would curb President Biden’s ability to re-enter the JCPOA.Ernst has been outspoken in calling on the Biden administration to make it a top priority to keep our nation and the world safe from the threat of Iran, penning an op-ed in the Washington Examiner.###

In Iowa, we have seen what proven leadership looks like under our governor and my friend, Kim Reynolds, someone who is cutting taxes, expanding opportunity, and standing up for our students and families.

Ernst is also leading bipartisan legislation to put limits on taxpayer-funded benefits for future former U.S. presidents, including expenses for their travel, personal staff, office space, and communications after they leave office.“Our Founding Fathers recognized the dangers of massive federal spending and national debt, but never could they have imagined the levels at which we borrow today—with a debt now exceeding $30 trillion. Since I came to the Senate, I’ve been sounding the alarm on this spending crisis. This Presidents’ Day, I can think of no better way to honor the likes of Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison than by making these commonsense reforms that will save taxpayer dollars, help pay down our national debt, and end welfare programs for politicians and unnecessary perks for future former presidents,” said Senator Ernst.The Eliminating Leftover Expenses for Campaigns from Taxpayers (ELECT) Act: The ELECT Act would eliminate the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and redirect the money remaining in the fund to reducing the deficit.Currently, candidates for president may seek public funding provided by federal tax dollars in exchange for agreeing to limit private donations and overall campaign spending.
