Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) today released the following statement after
cosponsoring the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement
Act of 2022. “The poor drafting of the 1887 Electoral
Count Act endangered the transition of power from one Administration to the
next. Unfortunately, in the over 100 intervening years, individual Democratic
and Republican Members of Congress have occasionally attempted to exploit the
ambiguities in this law to cast doubt on the validity of our elections,
culminating in the debacle of January 6, 2021. It is past time Congress act.
This legislation would make commonsense changes to clarify the role of
Congress, the Vice President, and the courts in the certification of
presidential elections to give the American people more confidence it will be
their voice that chooses the next executive and those that follow,” said
Senator Toomey. Background on the Electoral Count Reform
and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022:·      
Clarifies confusing language from the
original Electoral Count Act of 1887·      
Adds important guardrails to protect
results from partisan interference·       Respects
and preserves the bifurcated election process set forth in the Constitution·       Clarifies
that the Vice President’s role in certifying an election is purely ministerial·       Increases
the threshold to file an objection during congressional certification from one
member of each chamber to at least 1/5 of each chamber ·       Prevents
any state from changing their laws after an election in an attempt to overturn
a previous election’s results ·      
Clarifies which state official must submit
an electoral slate to Congress in order to avoid a situation where a state submits
two competing slates of electors to Congress·

D.C. – U.S.
Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) issued the following statement regarding U.S.
Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm’s visit to Pittsburgh.“Secretary
Granholm comes to Pittsburgh to tout and celebrate billions in corporate
welfare for ‘green’ energy, but these policies are not about fighting climate
change—it’s about benefiting the politically favored few at the expense of the
many.“This
new law does essentially nothing to move the needle on Democrats’
self-proclaimed climate goals. Even the United Nation’s preferred climate model
projects this law might reduce the Earth’s temperature by only a measly 0.028
degrees Fahrenheit by 2100.“In
the meantime, the Biden Administration’s partisan reckless tax-and-spending
spree is pouring fuel on the inflationary fire and further hiking prices for
American families.”Background
on the Inflation Reduction Act:The
Inflation Reduction Act Will NOT Reduce Global Temperatures·       
The UN’s preferred climate model projects the
Democrats’ new law might only reduce the Earth’s temperature by a measly 0.028
degrees Fahrenheit by 2100. “While the administration talks up its
emission reductions, it never seems to tout the law’s impact on temperature and
sea level—for good reason. If you plug the predicted emissions decline into the
climate model used for all major United Nations climate reports, it turns out
the global temperature will be cut by only 0.0009 degree Fahrenheit by the end
of the century. This is assuming the law’s emission reductions end when its
funding does after 2030. But even if you charitably assume they’ll somehow be sustained
through 2100 without any interruption, the impact on global temperature will
still be almost unnoticeable, at 0.028 degree Fahrenheit.” (Bjorn Lomborg, “The
Inflation Reduction Act Does Little to Reduce Climate Change,” Wall Street
Journal,
Aug. 23, 2022)The
Inflation Reduction Act Will NOT Reduce Inflation·       
According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, IRA’s
“impact on inflation is statistically indistinguishable from zero for either
[Congressional Budget Office or PWBM] estimate.” (“Inflation Reduction
Act: Comparing CBO and PWBM Estimates, Penn Wharton
Budget Model,
August 5, 2022)·       
The New York Times reported: “Price Pressures Remain
Stubbornly High.” “Inflation
did not ease as much as expected in August, with an 8.3 percent rise in the
Consumer Price Index showing that the squeeze on consumers remains acute.” (“US
Inflation Rose 8.3 Percent in August: CPI Report, New York Times, September 13,
2022)The
Inflation Reduction Act Includes Destructive Tax Increases while Revenues are
at All-Time Highs·       
The 15 percent minimum tax on corporate book income is
economically damaging. “The proposed 15 percent minimum tax on
corporate book income is the most economically damaging provision in
the bill, reducing GDP by 0.1 percent and costing about 20,000 jobs.”
(“Details & Analysis of the Inflation Reduction Act Tax Provisions,” The Tax Foundation, August 12, 2022)·       
Even the board that develops the standards upon which
the minimum tax is based opposes the policy. “FASB’s chair has
previously opposed a minimum corporate tax. Last year, Jones said in
a speech that he was against basing a minimum corporate tax on book
income. He said the group’s role was to set accounting rules that best convey
the health of a company. Using book income to determine tax payments would
inject public policy into financial accounting, Jones said, making it hard for
his organization to do its job. “It would be an additional pressure, there’s no
doubt, on our mission and what we do.”” (“The New Deciders on Corporate Taxes,” New York Times, August 4, 2022)·       
As a share of GDP, federal tax collections are on
track to hit a multi-decade high of about 20.2 percent in FY2022. “As a share of
GDP, federal tax collections are on track to hit a multi-decade high of about
20.2 percent in FY 2022, up from 18.1 percent last fiscal year and exceeding
the last peak of 20 percent set during the dot-com bubble in FY 2000. Federal
tax collections are approaching the all-time high of 20.5 percent of GDP set in
1943 during World War II. Compared to average federal tax collections in the
post-war era of 17.2 percent of GDP, this year’s collections are set to exceed
that level by 3 percentage points.” (William McBride, “Inflation is Surging, So
Are Federal Tax Collections,” Tax Foundation, September 19,
2022)The
Inflation Reduction Act Is About Benefiting The Politically Favored Few At The
Expense Of The Many·       
Politically connected green energy companies are the
biggest beneficiaries while the average American will struggle with higher
energy prices.
“The bill’s $370 billion in climate spending provides a panoply of tax credits
for wind, solar, carbon capture, hydrogen, biofuels, critical minerals,
sustainable aviation fuel, green-energy manufacturing and battery storage,
among other things. The losers are fossil fuels. The bill imposes a new
16.4 cents a barrel tax on crude oil and doubles the current excise tax on coal
production. It also includes a new methane fee, though it’s unclear how it will
be administered. These taxes along with multitudinous subsidies for renewables
will reduce fossil-fuel investment. That’s clearly the goal. The tax credits
are intended to redirect business investment from fossil fuels to green energy
by making the latter much more profitable and the former more costly. The
result will be higher energy prices.” (The Editorial
Board,  “The Inflation
Reduction Act’s Energy Winners and Losers,” Wall Street Journal, Aug. 19,
2022)·       
Billions in electric vehicle tax credits that
primarily benefit those with higher incomes. “Most of the tax credits (78%) are
claimed by filers with adjusted gross income (AGI) of $100,000 or more, and
those filers receive an even higher proportion (83%) of the amount of credits
claimed.” (“The Plug-In Electric Vehicle Tax Credit,” Congressional Research Service, May 14, 2019).·       
Billions in Obamacare subsidies for those with higher
incomes. “The
American Rescue Plan Act juiced subsidies for ObamaCare, and those earning more
than 400% of the federal poverty line became eligible, depending on the cost of
a “benchmark” plan. A family of four with a 60-year-old head of household
earning $265,000 could end up eligible for more than $7,800 a year in taxpayer
subsidies.” (The Editorial Board, “When ‘Temporary’ ObamaCare Subsidies Are

D.C. –
U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) today criticized the Biden Administration’s
decision to force taxpayers to pay for the cancellation of student debt. President
Biden’s plan will use questionable executive authority to cancel up to $20,000
in student loans for families making up to $250,000 annually.“President
Biden’s student loan bailout scheme is a government handout to Americans making
up to $250,000 annually and the higher education industrial complex. Taxpayers
will foot the bill for this massive expenditure, including the vast majority of
Americans who already paid off their loans, paid for tuition out of pocket, or
do not even have post-secondary education nor enjoy the higher lifetime
earnings associated with it,” said Senator Toomey.“This
decision will have wide-reaching, negative ramifications across America’s
economy, including increasing already disastrous inflation, exacerbating
America’s spending problems, and encouraging higher education institutions to
raise the cost of going to college.”

fund new ‘green’ corporate welfare and give Obamacare subsidies to wealthy
Americans, this legislation forces short-sighted tax hikes on American
businesses and imposes innovation-crippling price controls on life-saving
medicines. And contrary to the bill’s name, non-partisan analysts have
confirmed that it does nothing to alleviate the inflation tax Americans are

D.C. – U.S.
Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) today spoke on the Senate floor advocating for his
amendment to fix a budget gimmick in the Promise to Address Comprehensive
Toxins Act (PACT) Act that would enable $400
billion in spending completely unrelated to veterans’ care.Senator Toomey’s
remarks are available here.The
PACT Act as written includes a budget gimmick that would allow $400 billion of
current law spending to be moved from discretionary to mandatory spending. This
provision is completely unnecessary to achieve the PACT Act’s stated goal of
expanding health care and other benefits for veterans. This gimmick would allow
for an additional $400 billion in future discretionary spending completely
unrelated to veterans over the next 10 years. Senator
Toomey’s amendment does not reduce spending on veterans by a single dollar or
affect the expansion of care and benefits in the underlying bill. The amendment
simply ensures that the $280 billion expansion of veterans benefits, all
classified as mandatory and unoffset, does not also include a transfer of
current law spending to mandatory that would enable $400 billion of spending
for items completely unrelated to veterans.As
Senator
Toomey said on Monday:“The oldest trick in Washington is to
craft a bill to help vulnerable Americans, and then sneak in an unrelated
provision that would never pass on its own. That’s exactly what Democrats are
doing with the PACT Act.”

(R-Pa.) today opposed efforts to proceed to Senate consideration of a massive
new federal intervention into commercial manufacturing. At the time of the vote,
legislative text was still unclear, but the one area that will be included in
the ultimate bill is over $75 billion to subsidize the semiconductor
industry—commonly known as the computer chips industry.“Tonight, the Senate
failed at even the most basic of functions: being able to disclose what it was
voting on prior to doing so. Unfortunately, the one item that is certain
to be included is a corporate welfare hand out of more than $76 billion to an
extremely sophisticated, profitable industry in the U.S.

manufacturing,” said Senator Toomey.
“As history has taught us, centrally planning economies never works. When the
government allocates capital, it inevitably drives investments to the
politically well-connected at the expense of taxpayers. It’s not the government’s
job to pick winners and losers, yet that is exactly what this effort is
intended to do.
“If
we truly want to beat China, we can’t emulate Beijing’s semi-socialist economic
model. The best way to encourage investment, spur economic growth, and enhance
American competitiveness is to create policies that benefit all industries,

Pleas. Kelley Hodge has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to equal justice
under law not only as the first Black woman to serve as Philadelphia’s District
Attorney, but also as a former public defender and school safety expert. John
Murphy will also bring an important and unique perspective to the federal bench

Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) commended the Senate Finance Committee for
advancing three of his bills as part of the Enhancing American Retirement Now
(EARN) Act, the Committee’s comprehensive, bipartisan package of legislation
that expands access to retirement resources and encourages saving for the
future. Senator Toomey’s legislation—the Protecting Public Safety Employees’
Timely Retirement Act, State and Local Corrections Officer Retirement Fairness
Act, and a compromise version of the Long-Term Care Affordability Act—will aid
law enforcement, public safety officials, and individuals looking to plan for
their futures by purchasing long-term care insurance.“Saving
for retirement reflects smart, long-term planning by American workers. I
appreciate Senators Wyden and Crapo including in the EARN Act three bills I’ve
authored that will enhance retirement security for many Americans: the
Protecting Public Safety Employees’ Timely Retirement Act, the State and Local
Corrections Officer Retirement Fairness Act, and an amended version of the
Long-Term Care Affordability Act. I’d also like to thank Senator Bennet for his
partnership on the Protecting Public Safety Employees’ Timely Retirement Act
and the State and Local Corrections Officer Retirement Fairness Act,” said Senator
Toomey.Background
on Senator Toomey’s bills:The Protecting
Public Safety Employees’ Timely Retirement Act amends the
federal tax code so law enforcement officers can access their retirement funds
penalty-free upon reaching retirement age. The tax code currently allows
eligible law enforcement and public safety officers to withdraw from their
retirement if they retire at or after the age of 50 due to the taxing nature of
these jobs. However, federal officers are eligible for retirement prior to the
age of 50 if they have completed 25 years of service. Under current law, when
an officer retires prior to the age of 50 with 25 years of service, they are
not allowed access to their retirement funds penalty free until the age of 59
½, which is the age average Americans are able to withdraw from retirement
accounts penalty free. Senator Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) introduced the
Protecting Public Safety Employees’ Timely Retirement Act with Senator Toomey.The State and Local Corrections Officer Retirement Fairness Act would require the
federal tax code to treat state and local corrections officers the same as
their federal counterparts by providing an exemption from a federal tax penalty
imposed on early withdrawals from qualified retirement accounts. Due to the physically taxing nature of this
profession, many officers retire prior to age 59 ½, which is the age in which
individuals can withdraw from qualified retirement accounts without facing a 10
percent early withdrawal penalty. In 2015, Senators Toomey and Bennet
introduced the Federal Public Safety Retirement Fairness Act, which made all
federal law enforcement officers eligible for an exemption to the early
withdrawal penalty. With the State and Local Corrections Officer Retirement
Fairness Act, eligibility for this exemption would expand to include state and
local corrections officers. Senator Bennet partnered with Senator Toomey to
introduce the State and Local Corrections Officer Retirement Fairness Act.Senator
Toomey’s Long-Term Care
Affordability Act as introduced would allow individuals to pay up to $2,500
each year for long-term care insurance with their 401(k), 403(b), and IRAs
without a tax penalty. Retirement accounts give a tax benefit to workers who
set aside money now for use during retirement. Early withdrawals from these
accounts are generally treated as income and taxed accordingly and are also
subject to an additional 10 percent tax on early distributions.
The
Chairman’s mark includes a compromise version of the Long-Term Care
Affordability Act. Under the Chairman’s mark, retirement plans are permitted to
distribute up to $2,500 per year for the payment of premiums for certain
specified long term care insurance contracts and such distributions would be
exempt from the additional 10 percent tax on early distributions. Contactnav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

the following statement commending the Hungarian government for its decision to
veto a European effort to impose a 15 percent global minimum tax on employers.
The veto will halt implementation of Pillar Two of the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) International Agreement in the
European Union and slow momentum on the Biden administration’s proposed tax
hikes.“As Hungary acknowledges,
punishing workers and businesses with a global minimum tax would be a
counterproductive step for economic growth around the globe. It would be a
profound mistake for the United States to adopt this global tax increase, as it
makes our workers and businesses less competitive. The only reason the Biden
administration is pursuing this tax agreement is to justify corporate tax
increases in the U.S., which will be necessary to partially cover the enormous
costs of their reckless, inflation-fueling spending plans.
“The Biden administration
describes competition among developed countries to get to a tax code that
attracts investment and maximizes growth as a ‘race to the bottom’. We should
be leading that race—not trying to prevent it.”Contactnav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

D.C. – U.S.
Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) is calling for action from the Department of
Education after the department released their report on state policies to protect
students from educators who engage in sexual misconduct. Under Section 8546 of the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act (ESEA)—which Senators
Toomey and Manchin originally introduced—states
receiving federal education funding must enact policies or procedures to prevent
academic institutions from allowing an educator who sexually abused a child
from moving to another academic institution. This practice, commonly known as
“passing the trash,” allows an educator to seek other educational jobs and
continue the practice of assaulting students.   “While I
appreciate that the Department of Education has finally fulfilled its
obligation to investigate whether states have implemented policies, laws, or
regulations to stop the heinous practice of ‘passing the trash,’ I am deeply
concerned with these findings,” said Senator Toomey. “Any educator who engaged in
sexual misconduct with a child should be barred from ever teaching in a
classroom again, yet too many states do not have policies to ensure that is the
case. Releasing this report is only the first step—the department must hold
states accountable and use the tools at its disposal to enforce the law.” Seven years

closer ties between the United States and Taiwan is a strategic win for both,
and this initiative is a good first step towards enhancing our trade relationship

initiative currently excludes market access provisions – including bilateral
import tax cuts – that are traditionally the cornerstone of free trade
agreements. Without market access, the direct benefits of this initiative for
American workers, manufacturers, and consumers will be limited.“Further, I
am concerned that the Biden Administration appears to be following the Trump
Administration’s lead in pursuing an ‘executive agreement’ that would not
require approval by Congress and could be amended or revoked by executive fiat.
In order to ensure a lasting trade relationship that provides crucial economic
certainty to importers and exporters alike, the administration should submit to

Ranking Member of the Senate Banking Committee; Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Ranking
Member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee;
and Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.) sent
a letter to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Charles Rettig
demanding clarity on its proposal to illegally expand the Affordable Care Act’s
premium tax credit (PTC), which would cost taxpayers billions more each year
and give the federal government an even larger role in families’ health care
decisions. One estimate projects this unilateral move could cost the taxpayers
$45 billion over the next ten years.  On April 5, 2022, the Biden
Administration proposed a change to the affordability test of
employer-sponsored insurance by basing affordability on the cost of family
coverage, not self-only coverage, in clear violation of existing law. Given
ongoing concerns about the ability of the IRS to act as a non-partisan enforcer
of tax law, the Senators question the IRS’ decision to reverse its long-held
practice of following the law, as written. “The proposal in question runs
contrary to the long-held position of the IRS, including under former President
Obama,” the Senators wrote. “This not only runs counter to the plain
reading of the law, but would dramatically expand spending on Obamacare plans
and result in a significant shift of individuals out of employer-sponsored
insurance and into government-designed and subsidized Obamacare coverage.” The Senators also criticized the
Administration for its unconstitutional attempt to unilaterally change existing
law and for failing to provide necessary analyses of the rule’s effects on
government spending and health coverage. Past estimates from the Urban
Institute and Congressional
Budget Office project the proposal will cost taxpayers tens of billions
over the next decade.The senators continued, “According to Article I, Section 8
of the U.S. Constitution, Congress is empowered to ‘lay and collect Taxes,
Duties, Imposts and Excises.’ The IRS has no constitutional basis for
unilaterally changing the laws Congress has enacted.“Moreover, in its proposal the IRS
did not include necessary projections of its impacts on cost and coverage.
President Biden and White House officials are touting estimates that nearly 1
million Americans who already have insurance would receive additional
subsidies, while just 200,000 previously uninsured Americans would gain
coverage under the proposal. This would suggest an analysis has been conducted,
raising questions as to why such an analysis was not published in the
proposal.”To read the full letter, click here. Background: During consideration of the
Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, several provisions were included to prevent
the erosion of employer-sponsored health insurance. One specific provision
prevented individuals from receiving subsidies for Obamacare plans if they had
an offer of “affordable” coverage from their employer. Obamacare specified that
if a family received an offer of employer-sponsored health insurance, each
family member is considered to also have an offer of “affordable” coverage if
the employee’s premium contribution for self-only coverage – not family
coverage – is less than 9.5 percent of income. The IRS’ proposed rule reverses this
long-held practice of following the law, as written, and threatens Americans’
access to employer-sponsored insurance. Contactnav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

D.C. – U.S.
Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) is urging Congress to create an exclusion process
for 301 tariffs as the House and Senate come together to reconcile the
differences between the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA)
and the America Creating Opportunities, Pre-Eminence in Technology, and
Economic Strength (COMPETES) Act.“American
manufacturing must be able to effectively compete with everyone, including
China. With a Section 301 tariff exclusion process, American manufacturers will
be better positioned to obtain the materials they need for production. As the
conference committee coalesces to improve USICA and the COMPETES Act, I
strongly urge its members to prioritize the reestablishment of this exclusion
process. Failure to allow this remedy will harm our own manufacturers,
disadvantaging these companies relative to foreign competitors at a time when
we should be enabling their success,” said Toomey.Senator Toomey
offered a motion to instruct (MTI) this week, which recommends the
conference committee reestablish an exclusion process for 301 tariffs as part
of the consolidated legislation. MTIs serve as nonbinding recommendations for
the conference committee.The prior
administration created a Section 301 tariff exclusion process, which allowed
American manufacturers to apply for temporary tariff relief on imported
components which they were unable to procure from alternate sources. The Biden
Administration has thus far failed to fully reinstate this exclusion process,
which has resulted in many American manufacturers being unduly burdened by the
tariffs even on inputs with no viable domestic source. 
When the
Senate considered USICA, Senators Wyden and Crapo introduced an amendment that,
among other things, would reestablish the Section 301 exclusion process. This
amendment passed the Senate 91-4 with strong bipartisan support; yet, the House
failed to include the 301 exclusion process in their own version of the bill. Contactnav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

congressional appropriators instead have withheld this money as a budget
gimmick to fund other projects. To stop this injustice, I along with nine
Senate colleagues introduced the Fairness for Crime Victims Act, which would
require a minimum annual distribution of CVF funds to the rightful recipients,”
said Senator Toomey.  The CVF was created to provide crime victims with the money
the federal government collected through fines and penalties from convicted
criminals as a result of their crimes. Taxpayer dollars do not contribute to
this fund. For years, billions from the CVF have not been
allocated in an intentional attempt by Congressional appropriators to create a
façade of savings. No money leaves the CVF, but it creates the appearance that
this money is saved, which allows Congress to appropriate funds towards other
projects instead of distributing the CVF where it belongs — to victims.Senators Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Rob Portman (R-Ohio),

Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today called
on President Biden to lift the 25 percent tariff on steel imports from
Ukraine. Ukraine is one of the largest steel producers in the world and exports
as much as 80 percent of the steel it produces. President Trump in 2018 imposed a tariff of 25 percent on steel imports from
countries including Ukraine. When the war in Ukraine ends, the senators wrote,
the nation’s steel industry will be a key part of its economic recovery, and
lifting U.S. tariffs will help speed that effort.“We respectfully request that you remove the 25 percent U.S. tariff on steel
imports from Ukraine to help it eventually stabilize and rebuild its economy,” the senators wrote
in a letter to President Biden. “The United States should do everything it
can to ensure that the Ukrainian people can effectively rebuild after the war.
Lifting the U.S. tariff on steel from Ukraine is a small but meaningful way for
the U.S. to signal support for Ukraine and to provide stability and improve the
country’s long-term economic outlook.”Full text of the letter follows and is available here: April 5, 2022The
PresidentThe
White House1600
Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington,
D.C. 20500 Dear
Mr. President:            
We write in appreciation of the actions you have taken thus far to punish
Russia amid its unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, and to help Ukraine
counter Russia. However, there is more that must be done. In line with these
actions, we respectfully request that you remove the 25 percent U.S. tariff on
steel imports from Ukraine to help it eventually stabilize and rebuild its
economy.           
As you know, in 2018, President Trump used Section 232 of the Trade Expansion
Act of 1962 to impose a tariff of 25 percent on certain imports of steel
from numerous countries, including Ukraine. We believe the costs of these
tariffs to U.S. families, manufacturers, and other businesses have outweighed
their benefits, and we appreciate the initial steps you have taken with the
European Union and Japan to reduce their impact.           
Russia’s aggression in Ukraine provides you an opportunity to go farther. Metal
production is a cornerstone of the Ukrainian economy. Ukraine is the 13th
largest steel producer in the world and 80 percent of
the steel the country produces is typically exported. Steel
and related sectors comprise nearly 12 percent of Ukraine’s gross domestic
product, and the steel industry is a source of employment and income for many
Ukrainians.
Ukraine is experiencing the destruction of large sections of its
residential and productive capacity, which has severely disrupted its ability
to export.
However, when the war ends and Ukraine’s economy reopens,
Ukraine’s steel industry will be an integral part of its economic recovery.           
The United States should do everything it can to ensure that the Ukrainian
people can effectively rebuild after the war. Lifting the U.S. tariff on
steel from Ukraine is a small but meaningful way for the U.S. to signal support
for Ukraine and to provide stability and improve the country’s long-term
economic outlook. We appreciate your consideration of this request.Sincerely,Dianne

released the following statement announcing his decision to oppose President
Biden’s Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.“While Judge Jackson undoubtedly has an impressive
educational and professional background, her inability to define her
own judicial philosophy makes it difficult to understand how she might approach
the most important cases facing the nation today, tomorrow, and far into the
future. Rather than confine herself to one philosophy, Judge Jackson has only
offered a ‘methodology’ that is ultimately unhelpful for determining what her
foundation is for interpreting statutory and Constitutional text.“Judge Jackson’s history of judicial activism is also highly concerning,
and has led to at least two unanimous decisions by separate panels of the D.C.
Circuit overturning her rulings for reaching beyond the scope of her authority. “In addition, the fact Judge Jackson has consistently imposed
sentences for offenses
related to child pornography not only far below those recommended under the
Sentencing Guidelines, but also below the recommendations of prosecutors and
the sentences imposed by some of her peers on the federal judiciary, is
baffling to me.
“Due to Judge Jackson’s admitted lack of judicial

D.C. – During
today’s Senate Finance Committee Hearing with U.S. Trade Representative
Katherine Tai, Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) questioned the Biden Administration’s
inaction on free trade agreements (FTAs) and the implication that FTAs are not
a tool for the 21st century. On
the importance of free trade agreements:“Every
single presidential administration since Reagan has initiated negotiations on a
new [free trade agreement]. They’ve done this to increase market access and to
help U.S. industries and workers grow and thrive.“The
U.K., Kenya, Taiwan, Indo-Pacific countries are just a few of the countries
that have reached out to us. They want to strengthen their trading
relationships. That includes having more market access, and, thus far, we are
not taking them up on it.”On
U.S. Trade Representative Tai’s recent implications that FTA isn’t a modern
trade tool:“You
may think this is a 20th century tool, [but] it looks like the rest
of the world thinks this is a 21st century tool.“This
means that China and the European Union are expanding market access for their
producers and competition for their consumers. They’re getting market share
that we are going to miss out on.”On
the importance of free trade and the “net outcomes” of it:“The
data is very, very clear—there’s all kinds of studies that show that trade
agreements lead to more jobs, higher pay, increased economic growth, more
options and lower costs for consumers. It’s all kinds of great net outcomes.”On
the cost of inaction on free trade by the Biden Administration:“Without
putting market access on the table, lowering tariffs, and eliminating barriers,
we just aren’t’ going to make the progress [America] could be making—that other
countries want to make—that [the U.S.] should want to make.”On
history of U.S. negotiating free trade agreements:
“In
the 40 years since the U.S. began negotiating our first free trade agreement
with Israel, every single U.S. Trade Rep has worked on or completed
negotiations of an FTA. My concern is you might be on track to be the first
Trade Rep. not to continue that streak, and that would come at a big cost to
our country. I just hope that you will be an advocate for this really important
tool to expand trade.”Contactnav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

https://www.toomey.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-toomey-presidents-budget-would-worsen-our-nations-fiscal-health,"Washington, D.C. – During today’s Senate Budget Committee Hearing with
Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young, Senator Pat Toomey
(R-Pa.) corrected the Biden Administration’s mischaracterizations of a “sound
fiscal course” and questioned the substantial tax hikes included in President
Biden’s budget proposal. On President Biden’s false
claim that his budget would “keep our Nation on a sound fiscal course”:
“Our nation is not on a sound fiscal
course and hasn’t been for quite some time. After reviewing this budget
request, it’s clear to me that the president’s budget would worsen our nation’s
fiscal health. The budget proposes $72.7 trillion of total spending and $58.3
trillion of total revenue over the next 10 years. That results in $14.4
trillion of total deficits. Publically held debt balloons in this budget from
over $23 trillion currently to $40 trillion by 2032 and that assumes no
recession, no unforeseen emergency spending. . .” “How does making the ten year
budget deficit window worse by $2 trillion dollars, despite two huge tax
increases, put us on a stable or sustainable path? President Biden’s boastful
claim about reducing the 2021 and 2022 deficits compared to 2020 is completely
disingenuous and totally context free. In 2020, Congress passed five bills to
respond to the public health and economic crisis posed by COVID. The
unprecedented bills resulted in $3.1 trillion of budget deficits for 2020 alone
. . . The decline from 2020’s record high deficit should be attributed to the
expiration of the extraordinary, unprecedented spending that was in response to
COVID.”  On reducing defense
spending while Putin wages war in Ukraine:“This Budget calls for a 14
percent year-over-year increase in non-defense—this big, massive increase in
the federal bureaucracy and the welfare state well beyond even current
inflation. Meanwhile, the budget calls for an inflation adjusted cut to our
defense budget. The budget calls for only a 4 percent nominal increase in
spending, which is an unrealistic and dangerous level considering inflation
running much higher than that and a very dangerous situation around the world
that we’re reminded of constantly.”  On major lapses in the
budget:“[Biden’s budget] of course
proposes nothing at all to address the looming insolvency and the general
unstainable growth of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, which now account
for 50 percent of total spending. It also hides the various tax-and-spend
proposals featured in the so-called Build Back Better Bill, which is still
contemplated by the administration.”   On the tax hikes included
in Biden’s proposed budget:“So the top one percent of [Americans]
make about 20 percent of all the income, pay about 40 percent of all the taxes.
[Yet,] you [Director Young] and the president’s budget say ‘that’s not their
fair share, their fair share must be much higher.’” 
“I’m quite sure we won’t’
hear what the ‘fair share’ would be if paying twice the proportion of the
income earned isn’t a ‘fair share.’ It makes middle class Americans wonder just
what kind of tax increase you’re going to hit them with to make them pay their
so-called ‘fair share.’”Contactnav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"
https://www.toomey.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-toomey-on-squawk-box-bidens-budget-proposal-is-a-gesture-to-the-radical-left,"Washington, D.C. – In case you missed it, U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.)
joined CNBC’s Squawk Box this morning to discuss President Biden’s proposed
budget for fiscal year 2023, including the White House’s plan to restrict stock
buybacks and implement new tax hikes. On President Biden’s budget proposal, including restricting stock
buybacks: “When I look at these
proposals: the huge tax increase on income, on corporate income, the so-called
billionaires’ tax, the stock buyback [restriction] . . . this is not going to
happen. This is a big gesture to the radical left—the wing of the Democrats that
don’t like capitalism . . .“This is terrible policy,
terrible ideas. A stock buyback is simply the economically rational, sensible,
responsible thing to do when the management of a company decides they cannot
productively employ marginal capital. They have an obligation to return it to
the people who own the company. The beauty of the mechanism is you as an
investor can decide whether you want to sell or not. That’s exactly what should
happen in a free society, in a free market economy. This vilification of stock
buybacks is completely ridiculous.”On taxing unrealized gains:“Our Democratic colleagues
usually justify all of their various, creative ways of raising taxes as a way
to make sure that the wealthy are paying their ‘fair share.’ The top 1% of
Americans earn about 20% of all of the income and pay about 40% of all the
income taxes. Paying twice the rate of what their income is in terms of the
percentage of total taxes is somehow not fair. . . It’s worth asking the
question to my Democratic colleagues ‘what is fair?’”On tax policy shifting based on the party divide in Congress:“I think anything that
gets 50 Democrat Senate votes and [Vice President] Kamala Harris breaking a tie
will pass the House would then get signed by President Biden. But, I think that
gig is up at the end of this year. I think Republicans are going to take
control of the House and the Senate. Then we aren’t going to be having
conversations about these crazy new ways to raise taxes on people who already
pay a lot of taxes. That’s why our Democratic colleagues feel a lot of pressure
to do something quickly. They know the clocks running.”

statement after the Biden administration with the European Commission announced
a joint task force to reduce Europe’s reliance on Russian energy:“The joint task force’s
timeline for reducing Europe’s dependence on Russian energy is too long to
cripple Putin’s war machine in Ukraine. In order to effectively sever his

UkraineRussia takes in up to $7 billion a
week from energy exports. Sever Putin’s revenue stream.By Pat
Toomey
March 21,
2022 6:19 pm ETBy
starting the largest land war on the European continent since World War II,
Russia, a nuclear power, has unleashed the greatest threat to global security
in recent memory. Not only are the Ukrainian people’s lives and livelihoods at
stake, but so is the security of people around the world.If Vladimir Putin does not conclude that his invasion was a
disastrous mistake, the consequences for U.S. national security and the
security of Europe, especially the Baltics and Poland, are grave. An
insufficient Western response could be seen as a permission slip by other revisionist
authoritarians, such as Chinese President Xi Jinping, for their own territorial
ambitions.The
sanctions imposed by President Biden—at Congress’s urging—have been
economically damaging to Russia, but not crippling. The ban on American imports
of oil minimally harms Mr. Putin, as Americans buy only 5% of Russia’s crude
oil.Since the
sanctions imposed by the U.S. and Europe purposely allow Russia to continue
exporting oil and gas, between $5 billion and $7 billion in hard currency funds
Mr. Putin’s war machine each week. Severing this revenue stream now, together
with helping Ukraine’s heroic defense, is the best chance the U.S has to
convince Mr. Putin that this war was a calamitous blunder that he should
immediately abandon.To cut
off Mr. Putin’s oil and gas sales globally, the administration and Congress
should impose secondary sanctions on the entirety of Russia’s financial sector.
These penalties would effectively prohibit foreign banks anywhere in the world,
under the threat of U.S. sanctions, from making payments to Russian banks,
including for oil and gas. They would force the world to make a choice: Do
business with the U.S. or do business with Russia. But you can’t do both.Europeans have begun to
take modest steps toward ending their dependence on Russian energy. But some
private companies in Europe can’t cut off their purchases until sanctions are
imposed. Ørsted, a Danish power
company, said it would like to reduce its intake of Russian energy but is
contractually obligated to buy it until 2030. Only sanctions would allow the
company to break its contract with Gazprom legally.Russia
could turn to China for exports to offset its declining trade with the rest of
the world. But with secondary sanctions, China would be obligated, like every
other country, to stop doing business with Russian banks. If the Chinese chose
to violate these sanctions, they would then lose access to the U.S. financial
system.The Biden
administration expressed concerns that secondary sanctions could hurt America’s
relationships with European allies. But there’s a potential solution. As the
Treasury Department is already doing with existing sanctions, the U.S. can work
with foreign governments to create so-called wind-down periods. These
transitions will give European allies a say in how these secondary sanctions
are implemented.It would
be temporarily costly for Europe to adapt to a world without Russian energy,
but it is manageable. With warm spring weather arriving, European demand for
Russian gas is about to drop precipitously. Economists and analysts predict
that the higher prices Europeans will pay for non-Russian energy won’t come
close to being economically catastrophic for the eurozone. And Europeans can
begin reducing their dependence on Russian gas by building new liquefied
natural gas terminals, improving continental gas pipeline connectivity, and
suspending the phase-out of nuclear power.The U.S.
must accelerate efforts to bolster its own energy independence. While President
Biden claimed in a recent press conference that the current crisis “should
motivate us to accelerate the transition to clean energy” and reduce our
dependence on fossil fuels, this can’t—and won’t—happen overnight. It would
take decades to develop the technology needed to produce consistent and
reliable green energy at such an enormous scale. The administration implicitly
acknowledged this by going on bended knee to plead with Venezuela’s dictator to
produce more oil.The
administration should instead bolster America’s energy independence by
reversing its disastrous anti-fossil-fuel policies: restart the Keystone XL
pipeline, expedite approvals of natural gas pipelines and LNG facilities
approvals, and repeal its broad and punitive regulations and restrictions on
U.S. oil and gas production.There is
an undeniable cost to energy consumers from cutting off Mr. Putin’s oil and gas
revenue. But the price of thwarting his assault on the Ukrainian people isn’t
as expensive as allowing him to reconstitute a Russian empire. Secondary
sanctions will give Ukraine a fighting chance to win this war, and defeating
Mr. Putin now will prevent the next one.Mr. Toomey, a Pennsylvania
Republican, is ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee.

Committee, and Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Chair of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, today introduced bipartisan legislation to add Ireland to
the E-3 non-immigrant visa program.  The bill would allow Irish nationals
annual access to any unused E-3 visas from the previous fiscal year.  In
exchange, Ireland intends to provide Americans expanded access to work visas in
Ireland.“The
United States has long benefited from people coming here to work hard and

with me on this bipartisan immigration bill, which will strengthen America’s
relationship with Ireland.”
“The United States and Ireland have long championed the ideals of liberty and
freedom, which has allowed our nations to form an unshakeable bond that
nurtures these ideals,” Durbin said.  “I thank Senator Toomey for
again partnering with me on this bipartisan bill, which is a vital reiteration
of not only our commitment to these principles, but also to our invaluable
friendship with Ireland and its citizens.  I remain committed to working
to quickly pass this bipartisan legislation, as well as other critically-needed
fixes to our broken immigration system.”Toomey
and Durbin introduced this
bipartisan bill in the previous Congress.  An identical companion bill led
by Congressman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), Chair of the House Committee on Ways
and Means, passed the House of Representatives last Congress by voice
vote. The
E-3 treaty professional visa is a temporary work visa currently limited to
citizens of Australia.  Up to 10,500 E-3 visas may be granted each year
and the visas are valid for up to two years on a renewable basis.

trillions in unfunded liabilities, Congress should be working to make this
important program sustainable instead of undermining it further.
“For
the last 15 years, the Postal Service has run a net financial loss and amassed
$188 billion of unfunded liabilities, largely related to retiree benefits.
Given the critical service USPS provides, it is imperative that any reform
legislation update its outdated business model, stop the annual financial
hemorrhaging, and create a long-term solution to rein in excessive operating
expenses. Today’s bill, however, falls short of even these modest goals.”Contactnav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

D.C. – U.S.
Senators Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) today wrote President
Biden requesting an accounting of how the federal government has allocated
trillions in taxpayer funds to combat the pandemic. Specific answers to these
questions are vital before Congress considers additional COVID-19 funding
requests from the White House.“Recent
news reports indicate the Administration is poised to request an additional $30
billion from Congress for its response to COVID-19. While we have supported
historic, bipartisan measures in the United States Senate to provide unprecedented
investments in vaccines, therapeutics, and testing, it is not yet clear why
additional funding is needed,” the senators wrote.“…Since
passage of the American Rescue Plan in February, questions are mounting about
where exactly the additional money has gone,” the senators continued. “A
recent investigative report from the Washington Post headlined, ‘‘Immense
fraud’ creates immense task for Washington as it tries to tighten scrutiny of
$6 trillion in emergency coronavirus spending’ details the federal government’s
shocking failure to provide the American public with a faithful accounting of
how it has spent its money.”“Before
we would consider supporting an additional $30 billion for COVID-19 relief,
Congress must receive a full accounting of how the government has already spent
the first $6 trillion,” the senators concluded.Full

U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) released the following statement condemning
Democrats for prioritizing their extreme abortion policy agenda:“As Russian aggression continues to fuel a war abroad,
Senate Democrats are choosing to prioritize extremist policies to make abortion

this legislation reveals just how far Democrats are willing to go to force
their radical views on the American people regardless of the fact that a
majority support certain restrictions on abortion, many of which would be
prohibited under this bill. “The Democrats’ bill priority this week goes well
beyond codifying Roe v. Wade to actually expand abortion
access by nullifying duly enacted state laws, such as parental notification and consent laws for minors, which the Supreme
Court has found to be constitutional, and by making
it easier to obtain an abortion at any point in pregnancy. Fortunately,
Democrats’ latest effort to radicalize their base will fail.”

https://www.toomey.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/toomey-submits-amicus-brief-supporting-congressional-limits-on-presidential-trade-authority,"Washington,
D.C. –
U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) with Senators Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Bill
Cassidy (R-La.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) filed an amicus
brief today with the U.S. Supreme Court requesting that the Court review
Transpacific Steel LLC’s lawsuit against the federal government.In
this case, President Trump—claiming Section 232 authority—doubled existing
tariffs on the imports of Turkish steel months after the mandatory time periods
for selecting and implementing such action had expired. Transpacific Steel and
several other companies affected by the tariff are challenging this action,
arguing that in adjusting Section 232 tariffs outside of the
statutorily-designated time periods, the president was acting in a way that
exceeded the authority Congress gave to the executive branch.The
U.S. Court of International Trade agreed with Transpacific Steel, ruling that a
president’s Section 232 authority to adjust imports is not indefinite. However,
in a two-to-one decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
overturned the ruling. “The
ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Transpacific
Steel’s case regarding Section 232 tariffs has significant constitutional and
economic ramifications that warrant Supreme Court review,” said Toomey.“Section
232 ‘national security’ tariffs are already often misused for matters with little
to no national security relevance. The executive branch has now effectively
claimed nearly unlimited authority to adjust tariffs on an ongoing basis and
based on a single, outdated Section 232 report. Not only is this action
constitutionally suspect and in direct contravention of Congress’s intent in
authoring the statute, but it also causes unnecessary economic harms to
American workers. I strongly urge the Supreme Court to hear this case and to
reconsider this misguided ruling by the Federal Circuit.”Background
on the amicus:The
U.S. Constitution gives Congress exclusive power to lay and collect taxes and
tariffs. While Congress can delegate some of its authority to the president, it
must provide sufficient guidance to direct presidential action under that
authority. Under Section 232, this guidance takes the form of both reporting
requirements and specific time limits for action. Yet, in a ruling by the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the Court upheld a clear executive
branch workaround of the Section 232 time limitations, functionally nullifying
one of the key preconditions set by Congress. In
the amicus brief, the Senators argue (1) the Federal Circuit, in ruling that
Section 232 was not violated by the president’s adjustment to tariff rates
outside of the permissible time period set by Congress, failed to properly
interpret and enforce the laws as Congress had written them and (2) the Federal
Circuit’s ruling that the president need not comply with Congressional
procedural limits failed to comply with the nondelegation doctrine, which
prohibits Congress from transferring to a coordinate branch of government power
vested in Congress.The
Senators encouraged the Supreme Court to hear the case, as part of its duty to
correctly enforce the laws as Congress has written them and to prevent the
executive’s extralegal exercise of power outside of that authorized by
Congress.The
full amicus brief is available
here.Earlier
this year, Senator Toomey with Senator Mark Warner (D-Va.) introduced the Bicameral
Congressional Trade Authority Act, which would reinstate congressional
authority over trade. The Bicameral Congressional Trade Authority Act would
make any presidentially-proposed tariffs or quotas applied for national
security purposes (via Section 232 authority) subject to review and approval by
Congress prior to going into effect.

I arrived to the Senate in 2011, the then Obama Administration and members of

spending and enacted some modest, but meaningful reforms. At that time, the
national debt was approaching $15 trillion.“Today,
as we approach $30 trillion—a modern record in debt in both absolute numbers
and as a percentage of our economy—the only debate the Biden Administration and
Congressional Democrats are willing to engage in is how much worse to make it.“This
increase of the debt limit by $2.5 trillion, inflated by hundreds of billions
to cover the partisan March package and the next proposed liberal wish list,
will likely be the last of my Congressional career.“From
my first day in Congress to today, I am steadfast in my belief that raising the
debt ceiling is only a reasonable option when coupled with reforms, and today’s

D.C. –
Congress’ annual defense policy bill will include legislation authored by U.S.
Senators Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) to hold accountable
countries that are facilitating America’s fentanyl-fueled opioid crisis.The
Toomey-Hassan legislation, the Blocking Deadly Fentanyl Imports Act, is
sec. 6610 of the National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA).
The NDAA is expected to pass the Senate in the coming days.“Nations
where fentanyl traffickers and producers operate freely are on notice: help
stop the illegal flow of fentanyl into our country or face consequences for
your complicity in the opioid crisis,” said Senator Toomey. “After
losing far too many Americans to fentanyl and other opioids, it is beyond time
we hold countries accountable for allowing fentanyl to be produced and exported
to the U.S. I appreciate Senator Hassan working with me on this critical
amendment, and I look forward to the Senate passing and the President signing
this legislation into law.”""Let
there be no mistake, the inaction of the Chinese government in tackling
fentanyl trafficking has hurt communities right here in New Hampshire. When I
visited China, I called on Chinese officials to take swift action,” said
Senator Hassan. “Two years later, China still needs to do more to combat
drug trafficking — and the U.S. will continue making sure we hold China and
other bad actors accountable for pushing this lethal, dangerous drug to our
borders. The fact that our bill was included in this year's NDAA reflects the
severity of the threat that the substance misuse crisis poses to the safety and
security of our communities, and I look forward to seeing the NDAA passed and
signed into law.”The
amendment requires the United States to publicly identify countries that are
major producers or traffickers of illicit fentanyl—something the government
already does for heroin, marijuana, and cocaine but has not yet done for
fentanyl. Illicit fentanyl-exporting countries would risk losing certain
American taxpayer-funded foreign aid unless they schedule fentanyl and its
analogues as a class and take steps to prosecute drug traffickers within their
borders.Senator
Toomey began working on this effort in 2016, when he first
introduced legislation to hold illicit fentanyl producing countries
accountable.Senator
Hassan is focused on stemming the illegal flood of drugs such as fentanyl that
have helped fuel the substance misuse crisis. In 2019, the Senator traveled to
China to stress the importance of strengthening efforts to combat fentanyl
trafficking from China.

Blumenthal (D-Conn.) introduced the Food Donation Improvement Act to
expand food donation efforts across the country. Ambiguous, outdated, and
limited liability protections often prevent many businesses and organizations
from donating food. The Food Donation Improvement Act would encourage
food donation efforts by extending liability protections to food donors when
food is either given directly to a person in need or when a recipient pays a
deeply reduced cost.“Food donations make a big
difference in the lives of many Americans, and Congress should make donating
food to the less fortunate as easy as possible,” said Toomey. “The
bipartisan Food Donation Improvement Act will reduce food waste and help
get more food to those who need it most by shielding good faith donors from frivolous
lawsuits.”“This bill will eliminate
legal roadblocks that discourage food donations by restaurants, retailers, and
others,” said Blumenthal. “Nearly 40 percent of our nation’s food goes
to waste – creating a clear opportunity and imperative to help Americans going
hungry every day. I’m proud to partner with Senator Toomey on this bipartisan
effort to enable timely and efficient food donations to Americans facing food
insecurity.”The Food Donation
Improvement Act would extend liability protections to food donors when food
is given directly to a person in need rather than a nonprofit intermediary, or
when food is given at a deeply reduced cost. Expanding these protections would
allow retail grocers, wholesalers, agricultural producers, restaurants,
caterers, school food authorities, and higher education institutions to
increase the quantity and efficiency of their food donation efforts. The bill
would also clarify labeling standards that food products must meet to be
eligible for liability protections. The text of the

U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) joined CNBC’s Squawk Box this morning to
discuss Democrats’ $4.6 trillion tax-and-spend bill and the nomination of
Professor Saule Omarova, President Biden’s nominee for top banking regulator.
  On Democrats’ $4.6 trillion tax-and-spend
spree:“This
is radical stuff. Let’s be honest. This is transformative by design. It’s
intended to be. And, that is just wildly out of step with the Democrats’
majority. They didn’t get a mandate to transform America. Joe Biden’s mandate
was to return to normal, [and] to be a reasonable person and to bring both
sides together. But, then, he has governed from the very far radical left, and
this bill is part of it.”“The
Wharton School says this is $4.6 trillion of spending, and . . .  it’s
mostly about expanding the welfare state to the middle class. [Democrats have]
got all kinds of new programs—some don’t even have any income limitation and
those that do it is extremely high. This kind of total transformation of the
relationship between middle income Americans and the federal government is not
what people were voting on in last election.”“The
American people are not on board on this, so we are continue to drive the
message about how damaging this would be, how much this would cost, how much it
would add to inflation, to our deficits, the tax increase. And, this is part of
the political process: Have this debate.”On the nomination of Professor Saule
Omarova to serve as top banking regulator:“Let’s
be honest: Her policy positions are socialist positions. She has advocated for
the abolition of banking, and to have the Fed replace all retail banking. She’s
advocated for price controls across the economy established by the Fed . . .
She’s advocated that the Fed directly allocate credit throughout the
economy—not private banks. She’s carried on about how badly the private players
allocate capital and resources and why the Federal government has to replace
that and needs to play an activist role on the part of regulators. And here
she’s nominated to be the top regulator of America’s banks. It’s just
shocking.”

considerable steps to encourage vaccination among its staff to be penalized,
cut employees, or even close its doors. I will be joining many of my Republican

U.S. Senators Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), and 41 senators sent
a letter to the heads of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the General
Services Administration (GSA), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to
request immediate action to transition federal workers back to in-person
operations.In
the letter, the senators cite the “widespread lack of responsiveness and
accessibility across the federal government on account of current agency work
plans,” which have kept workers out of the office and have contributed to huge
delays for government services.“Businesses have now reopened, children and teachers
have returned to in-person learning, and health care and public safety workers
continue to show up for work. Yet we continue to hear from constituents in our
states about a lack of responsiveness from federal agencies,” the senators
wrote.The
letter follows months of delays from the Biden Administration on implementing
plans for agencies to return their workforce to the office and to address the
mounting backlog of cases that arose while workers were working from home.The
senators cite several examples of the impact this extended absence has had on
government services:On
June 10, 2021, GSA, OMB, and OPM issued a memo regarding the return of federal
employees and contractors to physical workplaces. The deadline to submit their
plans was July 19, 2021. However, given President Biden’s new vaccine mandate
and the spread of the Delta variant, many agencies have had to produce new
plans, which are currently still unavailable to the general public and to
Congress despite ongoing requests. As
the senators write, only one agency out of 20 that were recently contacted was
able to provide a plan for its employees.“We
understand the unique challenges that COVID-19 has presented, but Americans
continue to face unprecedented delays in accessing their federal government.
This is unacceptable,” the senators wrote.The
senators also expressed their view that the federal government should consider
the costs to taxpayers of paying for office space that is not used, saying it
is a “drain on taxpayers who are ultimately paying the price for empty
offices.”“It
is now time to bring back our federal workers and deliver the service that the
American people have been promised and expect of their government,” the
senators concluded.In

https://www.toomey.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/toomey-statement-on-biden-administration-deal-with-eu-on-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) released the following statement after the Biden Administration announced a new deal with the European Union to replace steel and aluminum tariffs applied via Section 232 authority with tariff-rate quotas (TRQs).“The Biden Administration’s agreement with the EU to lessen the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum and suspend the EU’s retaliatory tariffs is a step in the right direction, and it will bring much-needed relief to many American workers.“However, while this is a positive first step, tariff-rate quotas are not an acceptable long-term solution. For three long years, American workers, consumers, and manufacturers have been bearing the burden of protectionist tariffs—costing over 75,000 manufacturing jobs thus far. Continuing to label our allies a ‘national security threat’ through tariff-rate quotas is unwarranted and will only continue to cost Americans jobs and opportunities.“Additionally, using Section 232 tariffs as negotiating leverage to enact concessions on climate change is inappropriate and outside the scope of the original Section 232 investigation. I encourage the Biden administration to fully remove the Section 232 tariffs on the EU and our other allies and instead work to address the legitimate national security threats facing our country.“These actions further underscore the need for Congress to take up my legislation to reassert congressional authority over these important decisions.""Contactnav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"
https://www.toomey.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/toomey-hassan-working-to-stop-counties-from-turning-a-blind-eye-to-illicit-fentanyl-exports,"Washington,
D.C. –
Today, Senators Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) introduced a bipartisan
amendment to this year's National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to help
stop the influx of illegal fentanyl into the United States from drug
traffickers.The
amendment would require the United States to publicly identify countries that
are major producers or traffickers of illicit fentanyl—something that our
government already does for heroin, marijuana, and cocaine but has not yet done
for fentanyl. Illicit fentanyl-exporting countries would risk losing certain
American taxpayer-funded foreign aid unless they schedule fentanyl and its
analogues as a class and take steps to prosecute drug traffickers within their
borders.“Illicit
fentanyl is seeping into the United States and killing tens of thousands of
Americans every year. Countries, like China, that are the primary sources of
illicit fentanyl must take action or face consequences for their tacit role in
the distribution of this deadly synthetic opioid,” said Senator Toomey.
“This amendment to the NDAA would pressure these countries into taking
commonsense measures to stop the flow of illicit fentanyl into the United
States.”  “When
I visited China, I pushed Chinese officials to take aggressive action to crack
down on fentanyl trafficking. Fentanyl trafficking out of China has helped fuel
the substance misuse crisis in New Hampshire and across the country,” Senator
Hassan said. “Fentanyl is a dangerous, addictive drug, and the United
States should publicly report which countries are pushing this lethal drug to
our borders. I am glad to partner with Senator Toomey on this measure to help
stem the flow of deadly drugs into our communities.”

https://www.toomey.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/toomey-to-yellen-poorly-targeted-biden-spending-proposal-makes-bipartisan-agreement-harder,"Washington, D.C. – At today’s Senate Finance Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) discussed why President-elect Biden’s proposed spending package doesn’t help Americans most in need, slows the economic recovery, and makes it harder to come to bipartisan agreement.When questioning Dr. Janet Yellen, President-elect Biden’s nominee to lead the Treasury Department, Senator Toomey said:“Dr. Yellen, welcome and thank you for your past service to the country and for your willingness to serve in this capacity.“I look forward to working with you, but I have to admit that the contours of the stimulus bill proposed by the Biden administration are going to make that difficult. The ink is barely dry on the second-largest stimulus package in American history, nearly a trillion dollars, after nearly three trillion dollars earlier in the year, and we’re looking at another spending blowout. The only organizing principle that I can discern is it seems to spend as much money as possible, seemingly for the sake of spending it.“An additional $1,400 per person, regardless of the person’s circumstances, guaranteeing that there will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who’ve had no income interruption whatsoever just makes absolutely no sense. Increasing unemployment benefits such that a majority of unemployed workers will make more money unemployed than they make working can only slow the return to a normal, healthy labor market. Sending states more money than they’ve lost in revenue or in additional spending is just not a good idea.“And I completely agree with Senator Scott. Obviously, an arbitrary government-mandated minimum wage increase is going to cost jobs. If not, then we’d just raise the minimum wage to $20, or $30, or $50 an hour. Obviously, it will result in some job losses. So, these proposals are not targeted at those who really need them, they can’t be justified on the grounds of effectiveness, and it’s going to be hard to get to a bipartisan agreement based on this.“I will say, I am pleased to hear your testimony that you think that the tax increases, the really massive tax increases that President-elect Biden is proposing, will be delayed. Which, by the way is an implicit acknowledgement of the economic damage that those tax increases will do.“It’s quite a staggering list.”You can watch Senator Toomey’s full discussion with Dr. Yellen here and here.###Contactnav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

https://www.toomey.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/toomey-and-mchenry-statement-on-treasury-changes-to-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Pat Toomey
(R-Pa.), the incoming Ranking Member of the Senate Banking Committee, and U.S.
Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-N.C. 10th), Ranking Member of the House
Financial Services Committee, issued the following statement regarding actions
taken by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and Federal Housing Finance Agency
(FHFA) to begin the process of exiting the Federal National Mortgage
Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie
Mac) from conservatorships: “Over a decade after the financial crisis, America’s housing
finance system remains in urgent need of reform. Today’s announcement by
Treasury and the FHFA represents a positive step towards the long overdue exit
from conservatorships for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.“For years, the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) have been
woefully undercapitalized. Ending the profit sweep and raising the cap on
retained earnings will allow the GSEs to begin correcting this problem.
Additionally, safeguards against risky lending will make future taxpayer
bailouts less likely and protect borrowers from loans they cannot afford.“While it is a missed opportunity that we have not made more
progress in restructuring and reforming the GSEs, Congress and the incoming
Biden administration must use these actions as a springboard to do more. Hard
work will be required to foster an innovative and competitive housing finance
market funded by private capital, driven by competition, and less susceptible
to needing taxpayer bailouts.”

https://www.toomey.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/toomey-statement-regarding-the-certification-of-the-presidential-election-results,"Allentown,
Pa.
– U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) issued the following statement regarding the
intent of some Republican senators to oppose certifying the presidential
election results:“A
fundamental, defining feature of a democratic republic is the right of the
people to elect their own leaders. The effort by Senators Hawley, Cruz, and
others to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in swing
states like Pennsylvania directly undermines this right.“The
senators justify their intent by observing that there have been many
allegations of fraud. But allegations of fraud by a losing campaign cannot
justify overturning an election. They fail to acknowledge that these
allegations have been adjudicated in courtrooms across America and were found
to be unsupported by evidence. President Trump’s own Attorney
General, Bill Barr, stated ‘we have not seen fraud on a scale that could
have effected a different outcome in the election.’“I
acknowledge that this past election, like all elections, had irregularities.
But the evidence is overwhelming that Joe Biden won this election. His narrow
victory in Pennsylvania is easily explained by the decline in suburban support
for President Trump and the president’s slightly smaller victory margins in
most rural counties.
“I
voted for President Trump and endorsed him for re-election. But, on Wednesday,
I intend to vigorously defend our form of government by opposing this effort to
disenfranchise millions of voters in my state and others.” Contactnav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"
