https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/collins-colleagues-urge-energy-department-release-funding-help-states-improve-energy,"Washington, D.C. – As home heating and electricity prices skyrocket, U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Jack Reed (D-RI), and Chris Coons (D-DE) sent a letter urging the U.S. Department of Energy to quickly release funds through the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) and State Energy Program (SEP).  The bipartisan infrastructure package that was signed into law in November included $3.5 billion for WAP and $500 million for SEP.  “As you know, Americans face the potential for significantly increased home heating bills this winter, particularly if prolonged cold snaps challenge constrained supplies for natural gas, propane, heating oil and other energy sources,” the Senators wrote. “Weatherization is a critically important tool to partner with Low-Income Housing Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funding to help families avoid financial hardship caused by increased energy costs. The State Energy Program provides crucial funding and technical assistance to states that allow for the implementation of clean energy projects, improve the energy efficiency of public buildings and hospitals and foster energy innovation in the private sector.” “The $3.5 billion provided in the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act for WAP and the $500 million for the State Energy Program are also critical job creators for our states. As the most recent U.S. Energy and Employment Report shows, the energy sector was hit hard by the economic impacts of the pandemic with more than 839,000 jobs lost in this sector in 2020,” continued the Senators. “Prior to the pandemic, we saw an energy sector growing at a rate faster than the economy as a whole. This was especially true for energy efficiency, which employs more than 2 million Americans, often through small businesses. With the investments from the bipartisan infrastructure law, jobs in energy efficiency and other parts of the energy sector are primed for growth.” The EIA’s Winter Fuels Outlook reports households nationwide will spend more on energy this winter compared with the past several winters due to higher energy prices.  Maine is disproportionally affected by this rise in cost since 60 percent of Maine’s households use fuel oil as their primary energy source for home heating, compared to only four percent of households nationally.  A typical Maine household will spend nearly $1,000 more this year on home heating oil.  Senator Collins was one of the 10 Senators who negotiated the bipartisan infrastructure package that includes an historic $3.5 billion for WAP, which helps low-income families make energy efficiency upgrades to their homes that cut their energy bills.  For every dollar invested by WAP, $4.50 is generated in combined energy savings and non-energy benefits such as job creation.  She has previously urged the Administration to quickly release this critical funding.  Senator Collins also secured $500 million for SEP, which enhances energy security, advances state-led energy initiatives, and maximizes the benefits of decreasing energy waste. As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Collins has also long led the effort to fully fund the LIHEAP program – a critical lifeline that helps prevent low-income families and seniors from having to make the impossible choice between paying for heat or buying food or medicine.  As a result of her efforts this year, Maine will receive $35 million in LIHEAP funding to help households keep warm during the long winter months.  Click HERE to read Senators Collins and Shaheen’s letter. ### "
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senators-collins-lujan-introduce-bill-spur-research-neurological-diseases-alzheimer%E2%80%99s,"Washington, D.C.—In a bipartisan effort to accelerate the prevention, treatment, and cure of neurological diseases, U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) introduced the Neuroscience Center of Excellence Act.  The legislation would establish a Neuroscience Center of Excellence at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is modeled after the FDA’s successful Oncology Center of Excellence.  The new Neuroscience Center of Excellence will establish several programs aimed at supporting innovative research that will encompass more than 20 neurological diseases, from conditions that are tragically all too common, such as Alzheimer’s disease, to conditions that are very rare, such as Huntington’s disease.  These diseases not only exact a human toll, but a financial toll as well.  According to researchers at the University of South Florida, the nine most prevalent and costly diagnosed neurological disorders have an annual total cost of nearly $800 billion. “Neuroscience is an area of medicine where there is tremendous unmet need, and neurodegenerative diseases are particularly challenging from both a research and a drug development perspective,” said Senator Collins.  “We desperately need to change the trajectory of neurological diseases and renew our focus on promoting research to find effective means of prevention, treatments, and cures for these debilitating conditions that affect millions of Americans and their families.  This legislation Senator Luján and I have introduced would make critical advances for those living with neurological diseases.” “I’m honored to join Senator Collins to introduce bipartisan legislation to establish a Neuroscience Center of Excellence to address Central Nervous System diseases that impact millions of Americans,” said Senator Luján. “Building on the success of existing Centers of Excellence, this legislation will aid the development of new therapies to better treat Americans.” The Neuroscience Center of Excellence Act has several components:      Click HERE to read the text of the bill. ### "
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/bill-co-sponsored-collins-king-combat-als-expand-research-and-access-treatment-be-signed," Washington, D.C. – Legislation to improve ALS patients’ access to treatments is headed to the President’s desk to be signed into law.  U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King, members of the Senate ALS Caucus, co-sponsored the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies (ACT) for ALS Act, which passed both chambers of Congress by overwhelming margins. The bipartisan legislation will fund essential research into fast-progressing, rare neurodegenerative and terminal diseases, like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and promote early access to promising investigational therapies for patients.  The bill will authorize $100 million annually to implement these priorities. “ALS is a terrible, debilitating, and ultimately fatal disease that affects far too many Americans,” said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement. “This legislation will create a new grant program to research and improve access to investigational ALS treatments for patients not participating in clinical trials. We look forward to this bill being signed into law, which will bring promising new treatments to patients as quickly as possible.” ALS affects 1 in 300 people, often leaving patients with no more than three years to live following their diagnosis, and disproportionately impacts U.S. military service members. ACT for ALS authorizes new grants to support expanded access and research programs. This will help bring investigational treatments for rapidly progressing diseases beyond their ongoing clinical trials to patients with diseases for which effective therapies don’t already exist and allow for additional research into the effectiveness of those interventions. The legislation also creates a new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Rare Neurodegenerative Disease Grant Program to support research and development on ALS and other life-threatening or severely debilitating neurodegenerative diseases. The legislation was introduced by U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK). The House companion bill was introduced by U.S. Representatives Mike Quigley (D-IL) and Jeff Fortenberry (R-NE). +++ Senators Collins and King co-sponsored the ALS Disability Insurance Access Act that was signed into law last December. The law eliminates the five-month waiting period before ALS patients can receive the Social Security Disability Insurance benefits they earned by contributing into Social Security.  ### "

https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senators-collins-king-recognize-wreaths-across-america-day,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King recognized today, December 18th, as Wreaths Across America Day. The day marks an important national effort in which thousands of volunteers across the country and the globe will place wreaths on the graves of American veterans. In the largest laying of the wreaths, a convoy of volunteers will travel from Maine to Arlington National Cemetery to lay Maine-made balsam wreaths at the headstones of American veterans interred there. Senators Collins and King unanimously passed a Senate resolution earlier this month to designate the day. “From Arlington to Normandy, Wreaths Across America is part of our national responsibility to honor the service and sacrifice of the men and women who served in our Armed Forces,” said Senators Collins and King. “For thirty years, the fields of Maine-made wreaths laid in December have served as a solemn reminder of the sacrifices of America’s veterans, and that we must never forget all they have done to protect our country. The longevity and expanding reach of this event is a testament to the spirit of Maine people, our overwhelming gratitude to our nation’s servicemembers, and the extraordinary dedication of all those who’ve made the tribute possible. We’re deeply grateful for all the efforts of Wreaths Across America, their volunteers, and of course to all our military servicemembers and their families who have undertaken great personal risk in the defense of our nation.” Wreaths Across America coordinates wreath-laying ceremonies at more than 2,200 locations across the United States and abroad. In 2019, approximately 2.2 million wreaths were laid, including more than 13,300 which were placed at the American Cemeteries in Luxembourg and the Netherlands, in remembrance of those lost their lives during World War II. Each wreath is made in Maine, along with the boxes they come in. Senators Collins and King have long passed a Senate resolution designating a Saturday in December as Wreaths Across America Day.

Collins’ Q&A on Medical Supply Chain. Click HERE to download high-resolution.Click HERE to watch Sen. Collins’ Q&A on Type I Diabetes Therapies. Click HERE to download high-resolution. Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a member of the Senate Health Committee, questioned Dr. Robert Califf at a hearing to consider his nomination to serve as Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Senator Collins commended Dr. Califf’s pledge to improve the FDA’s preparedness for future public health emergencies if he were confirmed to lead the agency.  She remarked that one way to accomplish this goal would be to reduce the United States’ reliance on foreign manufacturers to produce pharmaceuticals. “For a number of years, I have been very concerned that the United States’ drug market is increasingly reliant on the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients at facilities overseas,” said Senator Collins.  “In fact, the FDA in 2019 testified that 72 percent of the facilities that manufacture APIs are located overseas, a lot of them in China and in India.  In addition, we know that China has virtually cornered the market on the manufacture of antibiotics.” Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Senator Collins raised the alarm that countries like India and China were hoarding medicines destined for the United States.  At the hearing, she emphasized the importance of reforming the medical supply chain and incentivizing manufacturers to relocate their facilities back in the United States.  She also asked Dr. Califf to express his thoughts on the vulnerabilities in the supply chain. Dr. Califf agreed that bringing back manufacturing jobs is part of the supply chain solution.  “We need the supply chain to be secure and resilient in multiple directions and a transparent system for knowing where things are in the supply chain, which we currently do not have. I would mention one other thing: manufacturing in place is an exciting technology that people have been working on, and the idea that you can make a pill now with a small machine in a local area is something that I believe is coming and we need to accelerate that as quickly as we can,” Dr. Califf responded. Senator Collins, who is the founder and Co-Chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, also raised the issue of the lack of medical therapies for patients living with Type 1 diabetes.  She observed that the FDA has reviewed and held two advisory committee hearings on therapies coming down the pipeline.  One potential therapy would delay the onset of Type 1 diabetes and improve insulin production in high-risk individuals.  Another cellular therapy created from a donor pancreas would help those suffering with severe hypoglycemia. Senator Collins asked Dr. Califf, “How would the FDA under your leadership continue to foster cutting-edge science at the various centers we have created for Type 1 diabetes therapies and devices?” Dr. Califf answered, “We would like to continue this very healthy relationship between the patient community, the industry that makes products, and the regulators who have to determine if the products are safe and effective.” Dr. Califf went on to emphasize the importance of an engaged patient community, which incentivizes individuals to participate in clinical trials and creates a reliable, evidence-based model for practitioners.  ### "
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senate-passes-collins-colleagues%E2%80%99-bill-award-congressional-gold-medal-world-war-ii-ghost,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Ed Markey (D-MA) and Representative Annie Kuster (D-NH-02) applauded Senate passage of their bipartisan and bicameral legislation to award a Congressional Gold Medal to the 23rd Special Headquarters Troops and the 3133rd Signal Service Company, classified U.S. Army units that served in World War II, known widely as the “Ghost Army.” These units were instrumental to Allied successes at the Battle of the Bulge and the final battles in Italy’s Po Valley. The efforts and contributions of the “Ghost Army” were classified for more than 40 years. Senator Collins’ father, Don Collins, was a World War II veteran who was wounded twice in the Battle of the Bulge. He earned two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star for his courageous service. “Our nation will always be grateful to the members of the ‘Ghost Army,’ the soldiers of top-secret Army units who served with distinction during World War II,” said Senator Collins. “I am pleased that the Senate has passed this important bill, which would recognize these soldiers by bestowing Congress’ highest civilian honor for their courage and resourcefulness, which were pivotal in the European theater and likely saved many American lives.” “The Ghost Army will no longer be unseen in the shadows. The flesh and blood and brains and courage of the men of this company will finally get the public recognition they deserve,” said Senator Markey. “These soldiers embodied the courage, skill, and bravery that our nation treasures in American heroes. During World War II, their spirit and sacrifice saved the lives of countless U.S. soldiers, and guided America towards the Allied victory, the liberation of millions, and the safe return home of our troops. Today’s legislative victory in the Senate will help lift their contributions out of the darkness and honor these patriots for their service to our country.”“The Ghost Army saved thousands of allied lives during humanity’s darkest hour by conducting creative, innovative, and risky maneuvers to deceive the Nazis and draw forces away from allied troops, but because their missions were kept secret for decades, they were never recognized for their extraordinary service,” said Representative Annie Kuster. “I commend Senator Markey for his leadership moving this legislation through the Senate, and look forward to the House once again passing this legislation to award these brave Americans with the Congressional Gold Medal and ensure they receive the long-overdue recognition they deserve.” Ghost Army soldiers represent nearly every state in the nation, and the units were handpicked, top secret units containing some of America’s most promising artists, engineers, and signals professionals. The 23rd, composed of a mere 1,100 men, impersonated up to two divisions (30,000 men) physically, sonically, and radiographically to the enemy. The 23rd was so effective, they held a position in the middle of the line for eight days, allowing General George S. Patton to throw all the fighting forces at German defenses. Captured German officers and documents related to the operations of both units demonstrate that the Germans were utterly convinced by the units’ deceptions and redeployed units and assets in response. The missions and tactics of the units were classified for more than 40 years, and have not received formal recognition. Without the 23rd, it is estimated that between 15,000 and 30,000 American soldiers and 10,000 German soldiers would not have made it home. Click HERE to read the bill text. ###"

https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/bill-co-authored-collins-address-sexual-misconduct-merchant-marine-advances,"Washington, D.C. – The Senate Commerce Committee advanced the Improving Protections for Midshipmen Act. The bipartisan legislation, which was co-authored by U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), would strengthen Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) prevention, response, investigation, and accountability in the maritime industry and provide additional safeguards for the midshipmen at the United States Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA). “In light of the troubling allegations that recently surfaced at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, it is imperative that we do all that we can to protect students who have chosen the path of service and ensure they are able to continue their important work,” said Senator Collins, the Ranking Member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee.“Our legislation would strengthen sexual violence prevention, response, investigation, and accountability measures to improve cadets’ safety. Congress must remain committed to reducing the instances of sexual assault at our service academies and providing appropriate care for victims.”  Provide Accountability for SASH Offenders: ·         Give the Coast Guard authority to suspend or revoke a mariner’s license if the individual is found to have committed sexual harassment or sexual assault;·         Include commission of sexual assault as an independent and explicit ground for suspension or revocation, and add sexual harassment as a new form of misconduct on which a license could be lost; and·         Require the Maritime Administration and the Coast Guard to assess the applicability of the DoD’s Catch a Serial Offender program to the merchant marine, and, if so, how such a program would be implemented.    Track incidents of SASH and collecting student feedback: ·         Establish a sexual assault and sexual harassment database at the USMMA to track reports of harassment and assault in a systematic way; and·         Require exit interviews from students after Sea Year and include information from these exit interviews into the database. Provide information, training, and resources to students: ·         Require the USMMA to create a training program specifically designed for midshipmen going onboard ships, which would focus on the full continuum of SASH in the at-sea environment, including prevention, identification, reporting, and available support;·         Codify the position of Special Victims Counsel at the USMMA; and·         Allow the Department of Transportation the authority for direct hire of employees of the SASH office, to prevent unacceptably long gaps in staffing. Set up a framework to improve the USMMA’s SASH policies and procedures: ·         Establish a Sexual Assault Advisory Council, with members including USMMA Alumni and SASH experts, to provide feedback to the USMMA for improvements on SASH policy and implementation; and·         Require the USMMA to promulgate a student support plan aimed at improving midshipmen well-being by improving the climate and sharing available mental health resources at the Academy. Click HERE to read the bill text. ### "
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/collins-king-announce-more-244-million-maine-roads-and-bridges,"Senator Collins was a member of the core group of 10 Senators who negotiated the infrastructure package Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Angus King (I-ME) announced that Maine will receive a total of $244,550,089 to maintain and reconstruct roads, highways, and bridges across the state.  This funding was authorized through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and provided through the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).  Senator Collins, the Ranking Member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, was part of the core group of 10 Senators who negotiated the text of the bipartisan infrastructure law.  This funding will help to address the backlog of repairs needed for Maine’s transportation network.  Maine currently has over 1,438 miles of highway in poor condition and 315 bridges considered to be “structurally deficient.” “Deteriorating roads cost Mainers hundreds of dollars each year on average in vehicle repairs and wasted gasoline due to congestion.  In addition, poor road designs can create hazardous conditions for pedestrians and bicyclists,” said Senator Collins.  “As a co-author of the bipartisan infrastructure law and a leader of the Transportation Appropriations Committee, I have long supported investments to improve Maine’s transportation network.  These projects would help all users of Maine roadways reach their homes and jobs safely and more quickly.” “Go for a drive basically anywhere in the State of Maine, and you’ll see why our state so desperately needs investments in roads and bridges. Whether it’s potholes, erosion damage, or rusty bridges, our infrastructure is aging – which contributes to traffic, unsafe conditions, and an average of more than $500 in annual repair costs for Maine drivers. Fortunately, thanks to funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, historic investments are on the way,” said Senator King. “These funds will make a major difference for Maine people, bolster our state’s economy by creating good-paying jobs, and help create a more resilient infrastructure for decades to come. I’m pleased to see this significant investment in Maine’s important infrastructure needs, and look forward to this legislation’s continued support for Maine communities.” FHWA announced today that it is providing $52.5 billion in funding to all 50 states and the District of Columbia.  This apportioned funding for Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 represents an increase of more than 20 percent as compared to Fiscal Year 2021 for Federal-aid Highway Program apportionments.  This funding is distributed annually by FHWA for the Federal-aid Highway Program based on a statutory formula contained in the bipartisan infrastructure law.  This investment will help reduce the backlog of major repairs for highways and bridges and support communities’ efforts to reduce traffic deaths and serious injuries. Federal-aid Highway Program funds are authorized periodically by Congress in multi-year laws to assist the States in providing for construction, reconstruction, and improvement of highways and bridges on eligible Federal-aid routes and for other special purpose programs and projects.  The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law establishes or continues FHWA programs and authorizes funding for those programs from the Highway Trust Fund.  As the first step, FHWA is distributing these funds through a process known as an apportionment, using a statutory formula to determine the amount available to each State.  In addition to the apportionment of funding, FHWA will issue obligation limitation, which allows States to commit a portion of their apportioned funding, for the period through February 18, 2022, when the current Continuing Resolution for Federal Fiscal Year 2022 appropriations ends.    ### "

https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senators-collins-rosen-introduce-bipartisan-bill-strengthen-stem-education-schools,"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV) introduced the STEM Education in Accounting Act, a bipartisan bill that would establish the accounting profession as a valuable STEM career pathway and promote diversity within the field. The bill comes at a time when the accounting profession, like many sectors of the economy, is finding itself with a shortage of talent to fill the available jobs. While the problem has been exacerbated amid the pandemic in many sectors, the accounting profession has long faced such a shortage. “Mathematics is a critical skill that can help students unlock countless doors to high-paying, in-demand fields. One of those doors leads to the accounting profession, whose work plays a key role in providing capital markets with confidence and assurance in financial reporting,” said Senator Collins. “Our bipartisan bill would designate accounting as a STEM subject. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in promoting accounting education, improving students’ finance skills, and strengthening the pipeline of future accountants, who play such a vital role in our financial system.” “Working across party lines to improve access to STEM-focused classes and careers is one of my top priorities because we know this will strengthen Nevada’s workforce and our economy,” said Senator Rosen. “This bipartisan legislation will promote and expand access to accounting education programs and jobs, ensuring future accountants are prepared to support businesses and financial institutions in today’s technological world.” “For years, the AICPA has championed the inclusion of accounting in STEM programs and we are grateful to Senators Collins and Rosen for their leadership in recognizing the connection between accounting and technology,” said AICPA President & CEO Barry Melancon, CPA, CGMA. “The technological skills CPAs learn help them make informed decisions, solve complex problems and enhance the delivery of services throughout the audit, finance and tax arenas. As the profession continues to evolve its services in areas like cybersecurity, information integrity and systems controls and its use of emerging technologies and techniques, such as blockchain and data analytics, the integration of this knowledge with quantitative reasoning skills enhances accountants’ value to their clients, to the profession and to the finance and tax industries. This bipartisan legislation is a recognition of the value the accounting profession provides and will help to diversify and expand the profession.” The STEM Education in Accounting Act would designate accounting as a STEM subject and amend the Every Student Succeeds Act to add accounting education programs as an allowable use of K-12 grant funding. The bill would also promote high-quality accounting instruction for members of groups underrepresented in accounting careers. Click HERE to read the bill text. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/collins-golden-announce-maine-loggers-approved-more-123-million-covid-19-relief,"Washington, D.C. — U.S. Senator Susan Collins and Congressman Jared Golden announced today that more than 350 Maine timber harvesting and hauling businesses have been approved for a total of $12,348,389 in COVID-19 relief. The funding was awarded through the Pandemic Assistance to Timber Harvesters and Haulers (PATHH) program, which was created by a law Senator Collins and Representative Golden co-authored.  Last year, Senator Collins and Representative Golden introduced the Loggers Relief Act to establish the PATHH program at the USDA to provide direct payments to loggers who have been seriously impacted by the pandemic.  Their bill was co-sponsored by Senator Angus King and Representative Chellie Pingree.  Senator Collins, a lead negotiator of the COVID-19 relief bill that was signed into law in December 2020, successfully secured the inclusion of the Loggers Relief Act and $200 million in funding in the final package.  Following a push led by Senator Collins and Congressman Golden, the U.S. Department of Agriculture opened the application process for the PATHH program in July.  “Maine’s forest products industry supports good-paying jobs, drives local economies, and strengthens rural communities,” said Senator Collins.  “In addition to a changing 21st century economy, unfair trade practices, the explosion at the Jay mill, and the shutdown of the #9 paper machine and biomass boiler at Sappi in Westbrook, the pandemic made 2020 an extremely challenging year for our forest products industry.  That is why I worked with Congressman Golden to secure $200 million for loggers and timber haulers in the COVID-19 relief package last December.  I am pleased that, following our advocacy, this much-needed support is finally being disbursed to Maine family logging and log hauling businesses.” “Maine loggers deserve the same kind of support during tough times that farmers and fishermen receive. And there’s no doubt the last two years have been tough on this industry,” said Congressman Golden. “I’m glad that Maine loggers and log haulers are finally starting to get the relief dollars they applied for to replace revenue lost during the pandemic. Senator Collins and I worked together to write the legislation to create this program and get the funding signed into law, and I’ll continue to work with the Department of Agriculture to follow through and make sure the program delivers a real benefit to Maine loggers.” “In the past two years, Maine's logging industry has faced unprecedented challenges that threatened the survival of hundreds of small family logging and trucking businesses in our rural economy.  Without the funding provided by PATHH through the efforts of Senator Collins and Congressman Golden with the support of Senator Angus King and U.S. Representative Chellie Pingree, there is no doubt fewer of these businesses would still be operating today,"" Dana Doran, Executive Director of the Professional Logging Contractors of Maine, said. ""Timber harvesters and haulers for the first time were able to access relief funds designated specifically for their industry rather than being left behind, and we thank Sen. Collins and Congressman Golden for leading the effort to secure those funds.” Paper mills drastically slashed output or shut down their operations altogether during the pandemic – which the American Loggers Council estimates caused a reduction of $1.83 billion (or 13 percent) in the value of logger-delivered wood.  Timber harvesting and hauling businesses were eligible to apply for the $200 million available in relief funding through the PATHH program if they experienced at least a 10 percent loss in revenue from January 1, 2020, through December 2020, as compared to the same timeframe in 2019. These direct payments will be equal to 10 percent of their gross revenue from 2019, with the funds to be used for operating expenses, including payroll.  The PATHH program proved to be extremely popular among the industry and was significantly oversubscribed.  Additional federal funding is needed to cover all of the eligible losses by applicants.  Maine’s logging industry is a linchpin of the state’s economy, generating an estimated $619 million in economic output and providing $342 million in income to around 9,000 Mainers, most of whom live in rural communities.  ### "

We thank Sens. Cory Booker, Rob Portman, John Hickenlooper, Susan Collins, and Jacky Rosen, and Reps. Don Beyer, Vern Buchanan, Paul Tonko, Ken Calvert, and Tony Cárdenas for their leadership on the Humane Cosmetics Act, which will align the United States with 41 countries and eight states that have already passed laws to end the cruel and unnecessary use of animals in cosmetics testing.”   The Humane Cosmetics Act was introduced by Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Rob Portman (R-OH) and co-sponsored by Senators Collins and Jacky Rosen (D-NV).  Companion legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressmen Don Beyer (D-VA) and Vern Buchanan (R-FL) and co-sponsored by 74 members of the House. The Humane Cosmetics Act is supported by a number of animal protection organizations and industry leaders, including The Humane Society, the Personal Care Products Council, Cruelty Free International, and Procter & Gamble. Click HERE to read the bill text. +++ In April, Senator Collins introduced the Animal Freedom from Testing, Experimentation, and Research (AFTER) Act, bipartisan legislation that would ensure that every federal agency that uses animals for research has policies in place to facilitate the relocation of retired, healthy lab animals to private homes, animal rescues, or reputable sanctuaries. ###"

This funding was awarded through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Administration for Children and Families’ Office of Head Start. “Every child deserves the opportunity to thrive, and early childhood education is a key building block for long-term success. Head Start and Early Head Start programs provide children and families across our state with invaluable educational opportunities, reduce the impacts of poverty, and build skills that will last a lifetime,” said Senators Collins and King. “This grant is an important investment in the families of Hancock and Washington counties, and we look forward to seeing Downeast Community Partners’ continued good work during these challenging times.” “Downeast Community Partners, the Head Start grantee for Hancock and Washington counties, is excited to enter into our 52nd year of providing comprehensive services to children and families across our service area. Now more than ever it is critical for children and families to have access to the holistic approach we provide in our early care and education services along with our integrated whole family coaching supports,” said Melissa Mattes, Downeast Community Partner’s Director of Early Childhood Programs. “We have remained open during the pandemic so that children have consistency and stability in their daily lives and parents can remain in the workforce to support their family and the community. Along with our public school partners we are continuing to provide high quality early education experiences in schools across both counties. The federal Head Start funding combined with state, local, and private funding supports our mission to improve the quality of life and reduce the impact of poverty in our communities.” Downeast Community Partners is one of Coastal Maine’s premier child and family support organizations. This funding will specifically be used to build on their partnership with Child Development Services to provide a supportive classroom for children with developmental delays and to support their hard working staff as they continue to build their capacity and professional development during challenging times. Head Start was established in 1965 to promote school readiness and provide a comprehensive array of health, nutritional, and social services to eligible four- and five-year-old preschoolers and their families. Early Head Start services are available for eligible children age zero to three and pregnant women. Head Start services include early learning, health, and family well-being. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senator-collins-urges-colleagues-protect-americans-inflation-caused-reckless-government," Washington, D.C.—U.S. Senator Susan Collins spoke from the Senate floor today to urge her colleagues to reject trillions of dollars in proposed additional spending that would exacerbate the soaring inflation that is hurting Americans. Despite assurances from the Administration earlier this year that inflation would be “transitory,” the Consumer Price Index, which measures the price of goods and services, ballooned by nearly seven percent.  That’s the highest rate since 1982 and the sixth consecutive month of inflation exceeding five percent. After passage of the Administration’s $1.9 trillion stimulus this spring, the price of goods and services went up.  Last week, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projected that making the social spending programs in the Build Back Better plan permanent would cost $4.9 trillion over a decade.  Doing so would add $3 trillion to the deficit, unless paid for with new taxes beyond those that Democrats propose in the bill.  “Inflation is a regressive tax – it does not discriminate among the rich and the poor.  It does not take into account the ability to pay,” said Senator Collins.  “It is a cruel tax, one that punishes thrift by diminishing the value of savings.  This is damaging to families that are saving to buy a home or for their children’s education.  It can devastating to our seniors, who can do nothing but helplessly watch as the retirement funds that they worked for their whole lives don’t go nearly as far as they had expected.” “Americans are seeing and feeling the consequences of Washington overheating the economy.  We have an obligation to address this historic inflation crisis with the highest priority,” Senator Collins continued.  “But instead of doing so, we are considering trillions in additional macroeconomic stimulus in the President’s Build Back Better plan.  The consequences for an already overheated economy could be devastating.  Given the clear link between recent extraordinary government spending and rampant inflation, we should not be adding more fuel to the fire.  Our economy is ailing, so it would be wise to begin with the maxim that guides medical professionals: ‘First, do no harm.’” In her remarks, Senator Collins cited some of the escalating costs that are walloping families’ wallets and small businesses’ budgets:        “Like the pandemic itself, we do not know for certain whether this inflation crisis will abate, be prolonged, or even accelerate,” Senator Collins concluded.  “Our immediate focus should be on measures that we know will have a lasting and beneficial impact on our economy, such as implementing the bipartisan infrastructure law, opening up and repairing our supply chains, getting more Americans back to work, and protecting the earnings of hardworking Americans.  What we should not do is pass trillions of dollars in additional spending in the Administration’s Build Back Better bill that would exacerbate the toll that inflation imposes on seniors, working families, and small businesses.  We should not take that risk.” ### "

The Senators emphasized that the mandate will further exacerbate the ongoing supply chain crisis and force American workers out of their jobs. The restrictions on essential travel across the border will begin on January 22nd. “Trucking is the largest mode of surface trade with Canada; every day, there are approximately 14,000 total truck entries along the U.S.-Canada border hauling more than $846 million of goods. Any disruptions to the continuity of U.S.-Canada trade would likely have far-reaching consequences that extend beyond our shared border,” the Senators wrote. “…we fear that the imposition of vaccination mandates as a requirement to cross the land border will exacerbate the existing challenges facing our freight networks and supply chain, and could further fuel inflation and rising prices on top of what Americans are already seeing. Our nation’s truck drivers worked diligently during the pandemic to facilitate critical cross-border freight movements that helped to feed and clothe American communities. Now, implementing these policies could cost them their jobs,” the Senators continued. In addition to Senator Collins, the letter was co-signed by Senators Steve Daines (R-MT), John Thune (R-SD), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), John Hoeven (R-ND), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Jim Risch (R-ID), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Mike Braun (R-IN), Roger Wicker (R-MS.), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Jerry Moran (R-KS) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). Click HERE to read the full letter. +++ Senator Collins has repeatedly pushed to adjust or reevaluate restrictions on non-essential travel across the U.S.-Canada border.

Last month, Senator Collins joined 42 of her colleagues in sending a letter to the heads of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to request immediate action to transition federal workers back to in-person operations. “Social Security is a bedrock of our nation’s social safety net, especially for our nation’s seniors aged 62 or older who comprise more than four-fifths of all Social Security beneficiaries,” wrote the Senators. “On March 17, 2020, the Social Security Administration (SSA) suspended in-person services because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This suspension created a disruption to the millions of new applicants and beneficiaries receiving Social Security benefits.” “On behalf of the nearly 70 million Americans who receive benefits from SSA, we reiterate the need to reopen the field offices as quickly as possible. Our nation’s seniors and beneficiaries of SSA programs deserve no less,” the Senators continued. In early 2020, the SSA suspended in-person services because of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the SSA reportedly submitted its reentry plan to the Office of Management and Budget in July of 2021, it has still failed to fully reopen its offices to the public.

The Coastal Fellowships Act of 2021 supports two essential programs that boost critical workforce capacity for coastal zone management programs that coastal states depend on to protect their communities from unique hazards. “Maine has thousands of miles of coastline as well as diverse ocean and intertidal ecosystems that support the livelihoods of many Maine families and are an integral part of our state’s character,” said Senator Collins. “NOAA’s fellowship programs help to keep communities strong by supporting postgraduate students’ work with states to increase coastal resilience, protect the environment, and promote a strong ocean economy.

https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/heeding-calls-collins-shaheen-senate-sends-legislation-delay-payment-cuts-health-care,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) issued the following statements after the Senate cleared legislation that extends the Medicare sequester moratorium, as well as the 2021 Medicare physician payment adjustment until next year.  This legislation follows a bipartisan letter the Senators sent earlier this week, urging Senate leadership to delay these payment cuts as providers fight to stay afloat during the pandemic.  The legislation originated in the House of Representatives and will next go to the President to be signed into law. “At a time when our country is relying so heavily on our health care providers to help get us back to normal, we cannot ignore the financial realities they face.  Almost half of Maine hospitals finished last year with a negative operating margin, and many providers are struggling to stay open,” said Senator Collins.  “I am pleased that, following our advocacy, Congress took action to avert harmful payment cuts to hospitals, physicians, home health providers, and others.  I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Shaheen to support health care providers as we respond to this public health and economic crisis.” “As New Hampshire grapples with the worst rate of new COVID infections in the nation, our frontline providers need to use every resource available to respond to the surge and treat patients.  The last thing they should have to worry about is their bottom line when they’re working around the clock to save lives,” said Senator Shaheen.  “I appreciate Senate leadership heeding calls from Senator Collins and me to make this a priority. As we face a new, highly contagious variant, we need to ensure that Congress is responding to needs and conditions on the ground.  Delaying these Medicare payment cuts is crucial so our providers have the breathing room and financial resources necessary to get to the other side of the pandemic.  I’m glad Congress got this done and look forward to the President swiftly signing it into law.” Specifically, this bill includes legislation Senators Collins and Shaheen have championed that would prevent Medicare payment cuts to health care providers from taking effect at the end of the year.  Both the current moratorium on Medicare sequestration and the 2021 Medicare physician payment adjustment of 3.75 percent are scheduled to expire on December 31, 2021.  Without immediate congressional action, these changes will result in a 5.75 percent reduction in provider payments and billions lost in vital funding.  The legislation passed today would provide relief from the 2% Medicare sequester through March 31, 2022, reducing to 1 percent relief from April 1 – June 30, 2022. The Senators have historically partnered on this bipartisan priority and successfully delayed these cuts from going into effect last year, which threatened hospitals, nursing homes, physicians and other frontline health care providers from facing $12.3 billion in Medicare payment cuts over nine months at a time when providers desperately needed more financial resources to fight the pandemic.  Additionally, Senators Collins and Shaheen have spearheaded efforts in Congress to protect the Provider Relief Fund, which has helped prevent medical providers from closing their doors. ### "

https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/collins-colleagues-introduce-firefighter-sprinkler-safety-measure,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Michael Bennet (D-CO) and Representative Bill Pascrell (D-NJ-09) introduced bipartisan legislation to help place more sprinklers in older high-rise residential buildings where fires are especially dangerous.  The High-Rise Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act would amend the tax code to create a new incentive for building owners to install sprinklers in their structures erected before fire codes required sprinklers. “The annual cost of fires is enormous, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Americans and causing billions of dollars in property damage.  Fortunately, state-of-the-art sprinkler systems can help avert these tragedies by controlling and extinguishing fires, protecting firefighters, and saving countless lives,” said Senator Collins, Co-Chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus.  “Our bipartisan bill would create a tax incentive for property owners to modernize their high-rise buildings and help better protect the community.” As a direct result of Senator Collins’ efforts, tax reform included deductions for businesses that install fire protection systems.  The High-Rise Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act builds on those efforts by allowing for tax deductions to recover the cost of fire sprinklers over 15 years, instead of 39 years.  The total cost of fire in the U.S. is well over $328 billion and rising.  Fires in high-rise buildings (over 75 feet in height) claim the lives of many civilians and firefighters.  The widespread adoption of fire sprinklers in the last 40 years is one of the elements that has led to an almost 50 percent reduction in fire deaths in the U.S. Senator Collins has been a longstanding advocate for Maines’ first responders.  When the pandemic first hit early last year, she led a bipartisan effort to include $100 million in the CARES Act for the Assistance to Firefighters Grants Program, emergency funding that has helped improve firefighters’ safety while they continue to serve during the public health crisis.  She also annually leads a bipartisan letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee urging robust funding for FEMA’s firefighter grant programs, which she helped create. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/collins-shaheen-push-senate-leaders-delay-payment-cuts-help-providers-stay-afloat-during,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) sent a bipartisan letter to Senate leadership urging the extension of the Medicare sequester moratorium as well as the 2021 Medicare physician payment adjustment.  The letter was signed by 22 Senators, including Senator Angus King (I-ME). As the end of the month approaches, hospitals and doctors face a shortfall of billions of dollars in Medicare payments that have helped them cope with surging costs during the pandemic – unless these cuts are pushed back.  “Both the current moratorium on Medicare sequestration and the 2021 Medicare physician payment adjustment of 3.75 percent are scheduled to expire on December 31, 2021,” wrote the Senators. “Without immediate Congressional action, these changes will result in a 5.75 percent reduction in provider payments and billions lost in vital funding. Without immediate action, these cuts will begin just as providers are likely see a surge of patients in the new year.” “As we continue our work through the end of the year, we urge you to ensure that the moratorium on sequestration and the 2021 Medicare physician payment adjustment are extended through the end of the public health emergency,” the Senators concluded. In addition to Senators Collins, Shaheen, and King, the bipartisan letter was signed by Senators Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK). In April, President Biden signed into law legislation led by Senators Collins and Shaheen to prevent Medicare payment cuts to health care providers from taking effect for the rest of the year, while health care providers are grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic.  The bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in the House and Senate.  The month prior, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services – heeding calls from Senators Collins and Shaheen – instructed Medicare contractors to hold claims with dates of April 1st, 2021, and after to ensure providers are not harmed by Medicare payment cuts while Congress worked on legislation to avert those payment reductions.  Additionally, Senators Collins and Shaheen have spearheaded efforts in Congress to protect the Provider Relief Fund, which has helped prevent medical providers from closing their doors. Click HERE to read the full letter. ###"

This funding was awarded through the Health Resources and Services Administration’s (HRSA) Health Center Cluster Program. “Access to affordable care is key to protecting the health and well-being of Mainers, particularly amid the ongoing pandemic,” said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement. “We welcome this funding to support health centers in Lubec and Portland as they work to serve members of their communities. We will continue to advocate for necessary resources to help Mainers stay healthy through this public health emergency and beyond.” The funding was allocated as follows:   The health centers will use the funding to improve access to health care by building healthy communities, strengthening the health care workforce, and achieving health equity. The program targets the economic and medically vulnerable as well as the geographically isolated. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senator-collins%E2%80%99-statement-passing-former-senator-bob-dole,"Bangor, ME—U.S. Senator Susan Collins issued this statement on the passing of Bob Dole, the former Senate Majority Leader: “On Dec. 4, 2018, President George H. W. Bush lay in state in the United States Capitol.  Among the mourners was Senator Bob Dole.  In a moment that will live forever in our national memory, the 95-year-old rose from his wheelchair and with his left arm – the only arm his heroism in World War II allowed him to use – saluted his fellow patriot. “Today, we salute Senator Bob Dole and celebrate the courage, determination, and devotion to duty he demonstrated not just on that unforgettable day, but throughout his remarkable life.  At the same time, I offer my deepest condolences to Senator Elizabeth Dole. “Senator Dole defined the term ‘The Greatest Generation.’  Growing up in Russell, Kansas, during the Great Depression, he came from a family that was poor in material possessions but rich in the values of integrity, decency, hard work, and service to others. “In 1942, with America plunged into war, Bob Dole enlisted in the United States Army and became a Second Lieutenant in the legendary 10th Mountain Division.  On April 14, 1945, while engaged in combat in Italy, he was grievously wounded while saving a comrade.  His recovery was painfully slow – more than three years – and left him with an outlook on life that still inspires us.  Rather than dwell on what he had lost, he said later, he made up his mind to ‘focus on what I had left and what I could do with it.’  “When I first came to the Senate in 1997, I had the opportunity to hear a speech given by Senator Dole, which made an indelible impression.  Bearing the wounds of his courageous service in World War II for more than a half-century, he said this: ‘We need to make our deepest commitments clear: that aging should not mean poverty; that disabilities should not mean indignity; that diversity should not mean discrimination.’ “Working together, Bob and Elizabeth Dole turned those words into action.  The Elizabeth Dole Foundation they have led provides crucial support to both our wounded warriors and their family caregivers. “During his 35 years in Congress, including 27 in the Senate, and throughout his 1996 presidential campaign, Senator Dole demonstrated time and again his love of our country and his devotion to its highest ideals.  His sacrifice in war and his long and difficult recovery earned him the right to a life of personal pursuits.  Instead he chose to continue to serve his country. “Senator Dole’s Republican colleagues elected him Leader in 1985, including two stints as Majority Leader, until he resigned to run for President in 1996.  His record as the second-longest serving Republican Leader in the history of the Senate demonstrates the respect he earned from his side of the aisle.  But it was his willingness – indeed, his commitment – to reach across the aisle that produced such landmark achievements as saving Social Security, strengthening America’s hunger and nutrition programs, and reforming the tax code to better reward hard work and investment.  Senator Dole’s bipartisan spirit is a vital part of his enduring legacy of leadership. “For his heroism in Italy, Bob Dole received two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star.  For his service to our nation, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal, among many other accolades. “I am certain, however, that the honor he most cherished is the affection and respect he earned from the American people.  It is with affection, respect, and a heavy heart that I join men and women throughout our nation in saluting a true hero, Senator Bob Dole.”"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/collins-colleagues-press-usda-hold-hearings-federal-dairy-milk-marketing-order-address,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced the Dairy Pricing Opportunity Act, a bipartisan bill that would require the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to hold hearings within six months on the Federal Milk Marketing Order (FMMO).  This would allow producers and industry to consider and review proposals that could change Class I skim milk pricing. “Maine dairy farmers are resilient, and for years they have been weathering the storms of market instability and industry consolidation. The Dairy Pricing Opportunity Act would help restore some stability to this sector by ensuring that USDA holds public hearings to receive farmers’ input on ways to correct the unintended consequences of a pre-pandemic pricing policy. Our dairy farmers have always worked tirelessly to provide high-quality, nutritious products for Maine people, and we must address the obstacles that threaten to prevent them from carrying on that tradition,” said Senator Collins. “When the dairy pricing system isn’t working for farmers, the economic ramifications are felt across the country. I heard from producers across the industry firsthand during my subcommittee hearing on dairy pricing and the message was clear– our dairy pricing system is inadequate, out of date, and working against producers,” said Senator Gillibrand. “That’s why I introduced the Dairy Pricing Opportunity Act, a bill that would put the power back in farmers’ hands and bring the industry together to build a system that works for the 21st century dairy farmer. This bill is a great first step and I look forward to continuing efforts on broader FMMO modernization.” “Even before the coronavirus pandemic upended the dairy economy, producers in Vermont and throughout the Northeast were already struggling through years of price volatility, market consolidation, and rising costs,” said Senator Leahy. “Small- and mid-sized farms, the very same farms that have underpinned Vermont’s rural communities for generations, have long borne the brunt of these market forces. As Congress and USDA help farmers recover from the pandemic’s immediate impacts, it’s a critical time to reexamine the federal milk pricing system and ensure it works equitably for all farmers.” Experts agree – the current milk pricing system is one of the most complicated economic systems in the country and leaves too many farmers without adequate pay, especially as costs rise and competition intensifies. Even before the pandemic, dairy farmers across the nation were facing the challenges of volatile milk prices, as well as increased competition from non-dairy “milk” products. This has led to a substantial loss of licensed dairy herds, with the United States losing almost 40,000 dairy herds since 2003. The Dairy Pricing Opportunity Act would allow dairy producers and industry to consider and review proposals that could change Class I skim milk pricing, while also creating the opportunity for hearings to be held on other areas of the Federal Order system that are in need of reform. The Dairy Pricing Opportunity Act has been endorsed by the American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Dairy Coalition, and the Maine Dairy Industry Association. Click HERE to read the bill text. +++ Senator Collins has been a longstanding supporter of the dairy industry. In October, she pressed USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack for an update on the efforts being taken to protect dairy farmers from harmful PFAS chemicals. In June, she co-sponsored a bipartisan resolution to recognize the important role dairy plays in a healthy diet and the exceptional work of dairy producers in being stewards of the land and livestock. Earlier this year, she co-sponsored bipartisan legislation to combat the unfair practice of mislabeling non-dairy products using dairy names. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/maine-delegation-challenges-department-education-decision-deny-funding-umaine-farmington,"GEAR UP Maine has served more than 29,000 low-income Maine students but now lacks funding to continue WASHINGTON — Maine’s congressional delegation today challenged the U.S. Department of Education’s decision to reject the University of Maine Farmington’s application for a renewed Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) grant. GEAR UP Maine, run by UMaine Farmington and Syntiro, has helped prepare Maine students for college since 1999, including 29,000 students served since 2007. This decision leaves GEAR UP Maine with no further funding to continue its program. As part of their letter, Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), Senator Angus King (I-ME), Congresswoman Chellie Pingree (ME-01), and Congressman Jared Golden (ME-02) highlighted a legal requirement to prioritize GEAR UP Maine as an established state program. The Department of Education appears to have violated statutory requirements in awarding funding to a non-established state program.  “We are writing to express our concern about the Department of Education’s rejection of the University of Maine at Farmington’s (UMF) fiscal year 2021 application for funding for its Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) state program, leaving Maine as one of seven states with no further GEAR UP funding moving forward,” wrote the members of Congress. “Specifically, we are troubled by indications that, in its award decisions, the Department appeared to depart from its statutory requirements. While it is the Department’s job to decide which program applications to fund, the Department must do so in the manner required by law.” The Department of Education has not provided a justification for why it didn’t prioritize GEAR UP Maine over a non-established state program, or why the Department awarded less than 40 percent of the state awards and award funding it had estimated for this year. Next year would be the first year since the program’s founding in 1999 that it could not serve more Maine students. GEAR UP Maine has prepared economically disadvantaged students in Maine for college by providing tutoring, mentoring, academic and career counseling, and exposure to college campuses. Many of the participants of the program go on to earn college scholarships. The program’s seven-year grants allowed it to follow cohorts of seventh graders through the first year of their post-secondary experience. “As part of our commitment to supporting the success of all students —especially those who are from rural communities, the first in their families to pursue postsecondary education or otherwise historically underserved—the University of Maine at Farmington has been proud to partner in the delivery of the GEAR UP program since 1999. In that time, GEAR UP has transformed the futures of thousands of Maine students by raising their aspirations and preparing them to affordably attend and complete college,” said UMaine Farmington President Edward Serna. “On behalf of the 6,500 students GEAR UP planned to serve over the next seven years in some of the state’s most economically disadvantaged districts, we thank Senators Collins and King and Representatives Pingree and Golden for their leadership in inquiring about the apparent inconsistencies in the U.S. Department of Education's process and ensuring we have a fair shot at helping more of Maine’s young people reach their full potential through this proven program.” “When I think of the many benefits that Woodland Junior and Senior High School students have received because of GEAR UP, I tear up because as the guidance counselor for grades preK-12 (over 350 students), I cannot do it all and GEAR UP helped to fill those holes,” said Baileyville Schools Guidance Counselor Janice E. Rice. “The thought of not having GEAR UP saddens me as we are one school that embraced all that GEAR UP had to offer our students and our students benefited greatly.” “GEAR UP has helped me so much this past year and I will forever be thankful for them. I had so many fears and questions about college that I didn't know who to ask. Then, GEAR UP showed up at my school and answered all of them and more,” said Nicholas DiBuono, a GEAR UP Scholar from Woodland High School and a Loring Job Corps Student. “They believed in us when we didn't believe in ourselves. GEAR UP is there when you need them the most, they are just a text, call or email away and they are willing to help you in any way they can. We need GEAR UP to continue to be a thing for as long as it can so it can continue helping generations to come. Please keep GEAR UP running for us, students, we need it more than you’ll ever know.” “I’ve been part of GEAR UP for many years, and the people I’ve been able to meet because of this program are invaluable,” said Antonio Gomez, a GEAR UP Scholar from Caribou High School and a first year student at University of Southern Maine. “I hope they can continue to give mentorship and financial aid to those who need the extra help.” Read a copy of the letter here. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/helping-maine-families-stay-warm-winter,"A recent report that inflation has hit a 30-year high confirmed what the American people have been feeling in their wallets for months.  The soaring cost of virtually everything, from gasoline to groceries, is a growing crisis that affects families across our nation. One of the most alarming increases is in the cost of heating oil, which is up by approximately 60 percent nationally from this time last year.  I have heard from many Mainers who are worried that they will not be able to afford to heat their homes given this increase.  The average price of heating oil in Maine currently is $3.16/gallon, compared to $2.11/gallon this time last year. Unfortunately, the cost is expected to rise.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration is predicting that families that heat primarily with propane, natural gas, or heating oil could spend significantly more on their heating costs this winter, including spending up to 94 percent more for households that use propane. While the amount of heating oil a household uses varies greatly, a typical Maine household will spend nearly $1,000 more this year on home heating oil.  This is a 50 percent increase from last year.  Maine is disproportionally affected by this rise in cost since 60 percent of Maine’s households use fuel oil as their primary energy source for home heating, compared to only four percent of households nationally. I have long championed the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program that helps low-income families pay their energy bills.  Maine was awarded more than $35 million in LIHEAP funding in early November.  Given the current state of energy markets and the lingering economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic – and in preparation for the cold weather season – I am pleased that this funding appropriated by Congress has been distributed. Nationwide, an estimated 5.3 million households received assistance with heating and cooling costs through LIHEAP in 2020, including 33,000 households in Maine.  This federal funding is particularly critical this year given that the average cost of home heating will be unaffordable for so many low-income American households.  In addition to supporting LIHEAP, I continue to advocate for improving energy efficiency to permanently reduce heating costs.  Earlier this year, I introduced the bipartisan Home Energy Savings Act to encourage energy-efficient improvements for homes.  This bill would help lower energy costs as well as carbon emissions by expanding and extending a tax credit. As one of the 10 Senators who negotiated the bipartisan infrastructure package that was signed into law in November, I advocated for the inclusion of $3.5 billion for the Weatherization Assistance Program.  This bill funds energy efficiency upgrades for the homes of low-income families to help them reduce their energy bills.  For every dollar invested by the Weatherization Assistance Program, $4.50 is generated in combined energy savings and non-energy benefits such as job creation. I have also taken other actions to address the skyrocketing cost of energy.   These include leading a bipartisan letter to President Biden urging his administration to increase domestic energy production as well as to release inventory from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve.  Furthermore, I have opposed the administration’s policies that have exacerbated energy supply issues, such as shutting down a key pipeline project to bring oil from Canada to the United States. Families and seniors should not have to make the impossible choice between paying for heat and paying for food or medicine.  I will continue to work to alleviate the serious hardships many Mainers may experience this winter. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/collins-king-announce-nearly-225000-expand-sustainable-nutritious-meal-options-maine,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King announced that the University of Maine has received a total of $224,963 to create a new Maine Farm to School Institute, which will connect schools with locally grown food and educate rural middle and high school students about nutrition.  This funding was awarded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). “Farm-to-school programs have proven to be successful at providing schools with nutritious food, supporting family farms in the community, and teaching students about agriculture and wellness,” said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement.  “This investment will expand access to this initiative to help more students across our state have access to local, healthy foods while supporting Maine farmers.” The proposal, “Farm to School THYME: Training for Healthy Youth in Maine,” is supported by five partnering organizations: the University of Maine Cooperative Extension, the Maine Farm to School Network, Maine Agriculture in the Classroom, ReTreeUs, and the Cumberland County Food Security Council.  The Maine Farm to School Institute will train school communities and other stakeholders to establish their own farm-to-school programs and explore approaches to promote student nutrition education programs, including school gardens and local food sourcing.  Currently, the nearest farm-to-school training facility is located in Vermont and only has capacity for one Maine school to attend annually. This project will scale-up existing farm-to-school initiatives and thereby increase knowledge of agriculture and nutritional health, while empowering youth to be leaders in their school communities.  The Maine Farm to School Institute will convene 6 school teams for a 3-day in-person intensive workshop, followed by a year-long implementation.  The Maine Farm to School Institute is built on a service learning model that trains college students to mentor middle/high school students and assist them with implementing farm-to-school programming in their own schools.  By serving rural schools across Maine, thousands of students and families who are currently not reached will be impacted by system and program changes that are proven to improve nutritional health, increase knowledge of agriculture, and build partnerships with rural producers in order to holistically address school food security. ###"

Collins, Sen. Duckworth, and President Biden Washington, D.C. – Today, the Protecting Moms Who Served Act – a bill authored by U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and U.S. Representative Lauren Underwood (D-IL-14) – was signed into law.  The legislation, which passed both chambers of Congress by overwhelming margins, will help to address the maternal mortality crisis among women veterans by helping improve care at VA facilities and shed light on the scope of this crisis, particularly among women of color. There are more than half a million women veterans in our nation who are under the age of 40.  The Protecting Moms Who Served Act will commission the first-ever comprehensive study on the scope of America’s maternal health crisis among women veterans—with a focus on racial and ethnic disparities on maternal health outcomes—while also supporting maternal care coordination programs at Department of Veterans Affairs facilities. “Providing support to our veterans and those who serve today is among our greatest obligations. The U.S. has an unacceptably high maternal mortality rate with stark racial disparities, and the impact of this crisis on women veterans is not well understood,” said Senator Collins.  “This legislation Senator Duckworth and I partnered on will help examine ways to improve care coordination, identify gaps in coverage, and eliminate racial disparities.  Now that our bill has been signed into law, the U.S. can help ensure that the brave women who have served in our military receive the maternal care they have earned.” “It’s a tragedy every time a mother dies from a preventable cause related to pregnancy or childbirth, and it’s shameful that far too often these moms are women of color whose pain or symptoms have been overlooked or ignored,” said Senator Duckworth.  “I’m so proud that President Biden signed this bipartisan bill I introduced with Senator Collins and Representative Underwood—which would help address our nation’s growing maternal mortality crisis by helping ensure the pregnancy complications of all women Veterans are not overlooked or ignored—into law today.” The maternal mortality rate has been climbing in the U.S. even while it has been declining in other high-income countries.  This year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the maternal mortality rate for 2019 was 20.1 deaths per 100,000 live births, which was significantly higher than the rate of 17.4 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2018.  Considerable racial disparities in pregnancy-related mortality exist.  During 2014–2017, the maternal mortality rate for Black women was 41.7 deaths per 100,000 live births and the mortality rate for American Indian or Alaska Native women was 28.3 deaths per 100,000 live births, while the rate was 13.4 deaths per 100,000 live births for non-Hispanic White women. Specifically, the Protecting Moms Who Served Act would address this crisis by:         The Protecting Moms Who Served Act has been endorsed by over 150 organizations, including: American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses; NAACP; Society for Women’s Health Research; Women Veterans Interactive; and Wounded Warrior Project.  ###"

This funding was awarded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Meat and Poultry Inspection Readiness Grant Program. “Significant supply chain disruptions have placed financial pressure on Maine’s meat and poultry processors, created difficulties for farmers, and increased prices for consumers,” said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement. “This funding will help meat and poultry processing facilities across the state improve the efficiency of their operations by expanding facilities, modernizing equipment, and ultimately helping to better serve customers. These awards will not only bolster local businesses and strengthen our local food systems, but it will also help reduce the impact on families’ grocery budgets.” With this grant funding, meat and poultry processing businesses will be better able to meet packaging, labeling, and food safety requirements needed to achieve a Federal Grant of Inspection under the Federal Meat Inspection Act or the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or to operate under a state’s Cooperative Interstate Shipment program. Achieving a Federal Grant of Inspection or operating under a Cooperative Interstate Shipment program allows meat and poultry processors to ship products across state lines, pursue new market opportunities, and better meet consumer and producer demand along the supply chain. The funding was allocated as follows:        ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senator-collins-announces-nearly-130-million-covid-19-relief-314-maine-health-care,"Washington, D.C. – Following a bipartisan push co-led by U.S. Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), 314 Maine health care providers received a total of $129,052,464 from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  The funding was awarded through the Provider Relief Fund (PRF), which assists health care providers facing financial difficulties due to COVID-19.  HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra spoke with Senator Collins this morning to notify her that the funding had been released. HHS’ announcement follows a bipartisan call led by Senator Collins and Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) to swiftly distribute these federal dollars to providers on the frontlines of the COVID crisis. Hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living providers, clinics, and other health care providers have relied on the PRF to help weather the financial difficulties created by the pandemic.  In rural areas in particular, the PRF has prevented facilities that struggled before and during the pandemic from falling into bankruptcy or closing entirely.  “Over the course of the pandemic, numerous Maine health care providers—particularly in rural areas—have told me about the difficulty and expense of paying for additional staff, along with COVID-related facility improvements, personal protective equipment, and other financial challenges.  I have also heard from patients of long-term care facilities and their families who have been displaced or fear they may have to move due to nursing home closures,” said Senator Collins.  “I was proud to partner with Senator Shaheen to champion the Provider Relief Fund, which has been a lifeline for hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living centers and physician practices across the country.  The release of this additional funding will help prevent more health care facilities from closing their doors and protect patients’ access to care.” When the pandemic began, an estimated 70 percent of rural hospitals’ income dried up when patients avoided doctor’s appointments and states halted elective procedures.  Almost half —17 out of 36—of Maine hospitals finished last year with a negative operating margin.  Four Maine nursing homes announced in September that they would be shutting their doors, displacing more than 100 residents, and many other long-term care facilities are struggling to stay open.  To address this crisis, Congress appropriated $178 billion for the PRF last year. The PRF is designed to be a lifeline for hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living centers, and physician practices that have sustained significant losses.  Congress also provided an additional $8.5 billion for rural providers.  A report by the Government Accountability Office in June, however, criticized HHS for its lack of transparency in distributing funding and revealed that 25 percent of the PRF remained unspent. Senator Collins worked across the aisle to protect this funding and ensure that it was available for providers that desperately need it.  Earlier this year, a bipartisan amendment she authored with Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) to strengthen the PRF was adopted by a near-unanimous vote of 99-1.  In addition, as a lead negotiator of the bipartisan infrastructure package, Senator Collins successfully opposed attempts to slash funding from the PRF.  Senator Collins has also urged HHS Secretary Becerra on multiple occasions to support the Provider Relief Fund.  "

https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senators-collins-king-announce-23-million-help-combat-maine%E2%80%99s-opioid-epidemic,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King today announced that the Department of Justice (DOJ) is awarding the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Penquis Community Action Agency a total of $2,302,864 to combat the opioid crisis and confront substance abuse disorders in Maine youth. This life-saving funding comes as the state sees a spike in overdose fatalities due to challenges created by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  “For years, the opioid epidemic has devastated our communities and robbed families across our state of loved ones. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this heartbreak by increasing isolation and creating barriers to traditional support networks, contributing to a record overdose death toll of more than 500 Mainers in 2020,” said Senators Collins and King. “These important Department of Justice funds will give Maine’s government and community partners additional resources to confront substance abuse disorders and enhance treatment efforts for our most vulnerable youth. We’re grateful for all the work the Maine DHHS and Penquis have done to combat the devastating impact of opioids, and we will continue to work alongside them to save lives.” “The opioid epidemic has impacted public health and safety, devastated families, and deeply affected our children and youth. The isolation and disruption in services and supports resulting from the pandemic have exacerbated the already significant challenges we face here in Maine,” said Kara Hay, Penquis CEO. “This funding will provide crucial programming for affected youth, supporting the efforts of Penquis and fifteen community partners representing health, law enforcement, local government, social service, and victim service agencies. Together, we will deliver trauma-informed and trauma-responsive services, including community resource navigation for children, youth, and adults; engage youth through activity groups and evidence-based programming to increase prosocial skills and resilience; and develop comprehensive community approaches to supporting youth health, safety, and wellbeing.” The funding will be allocated as follows: ·The Maine Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)    ·The Penquis Community Action Agency  Senators Collins and King have both been committed to combatting the opioid epidemic during and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic separated Americans from their loved ones and made it more difficult to access traditional support systems, the Senators have worked to improve resources and increase awareness of the crisis. Last December, in the bipartisan COVID-19 relief package, they secured $4.25 billion to support services for mental health and substance use disorders. Earlier this year, they announced $2.5 million to combat the opioid epidemic in Aroostook County and $6.28 million to support Maine disaster-relief jobs in areas affected by the crisis. Senator King also introduced a bipartisan resolution to officially recognize September as “National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month,” and earlier that month announced that the state would receive nearly $1 million in American Rescue Plan funds to support substance use treatment. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senators-collins-reed-urge-administration-release-funding-help-americans-make-energy,"Washington, D.C.—As home heating prices skyrocket and winter approaches, U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Jack Reed (D-RI) sent a letter to President Biden today to urge his administration to quickly release funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program.  The bipartisan infrastructure package signed into law last week included $3.5 billion for this program.  Projects funded by the Weatherization Assistance Program have helped single-family homes save an average of $283 annually on energy costs. “The $3.5 billion for [the Weatherization Assistance Program] included in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is a historic level of investment in home energy efficiency that is particularly vital today,” Senators Collins and Reed wrote.  “With prices surging worldwide for heating oil, natural gas, and other fuels, this additional money is critical in helping New Englanders keep energy costs down.”  “Weatherizing homes is a one-time investment that can permanently lower a household’s energy bills and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” Senators Collins and Reed continued.  “We urge your administration to prioritize releasing the funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program and look forward to working with you and the Department of Energy to get this money into the hands of local providers that can begin weatherizing homes as soon as possible.” The EIA’s Winter Fuels Outlook reports households nationwide will spend more on energy this winter compared with the past several winters due to higher energy prices.  Maine is disproportionally affected by this rise in cost since 60 percent of Maine’s households use fuel oil as their primary energy source for home heating, compared to only four percent of households nationally.  A typical Maine household will spend nearly $1,000 more this year on home heating oil.   Senator Collins was one of the 10 Senators who negotiated the bipartisan infrastructure package that includes an historic $3.5 billion for the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP), which helps low-income families make energy efficiency upgrades to their homes that cut their energy bills.  For every dollar invested by WAP, $4.50 is generated in combined energy savings and non-energy benefits such as job creation. As senior members of the Appropriations Committee, Senators Collins and Reed have also long led the effort to fully fund the LIHEAP program – a critical lifeline that helps prevent low-income families and seniors from having to make the impossible choice between paying for heat or buying food or medicine.  As a result of their efforts this year, Maine will receive $35 million in LIHEAP funding and Rhode Island will receive nearly $22 million to help households keep warm during the long winter months. Click HERE to read Senators Collins and Reed’s letter.  The full text of the letter is below. November 22, 2021 The Honorable Joseph R. Biden, Jr.President of the United States of AmericaThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NWWashington, DC 20500 Dear President Biden, We join you in celebrating the enactment of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. With energy prices reaching alarmingly high levels, we write to urge swift release of the historic $3.5 billion investment included in this bill for the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). Extending this funding to households in need will help bring needed relief to families, particularly during the winter months. The Weatherization Assistance Program helps low-income families, seniors, and individuals with disabilities make lasting energy efficiency improvements to their homes. The reduced energy costs free up limited financial resources for essentials such as food and medicine. Throughout the history of the program, which has spanned more than four decades, WAP has helped more than 7.4 million low-income households reduce their energy bills. An independent study of WAP by Oak Ridge National Laboratory found that each dollar spent on weatherization produces $4.50 in benefits, including energy savings. Using WAP, single-family homes have saved an average of $283 annually on energy costs.  The $3.5 billion for WAP included in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is a historic level of investment in home energy efficiency that is particularly vital today. With prices surging worldwide for heating oil, natural gas, and other fuels, this additional money is critical in helping New Englanders keep energy costs down. The EIA’s Winter Fuels Outlook reports households nationwide could see their heating bills jump as much as 54 percent over last winter. Without financial assistance through WAP, families will continue to live in leaky, inefficient homes, which will only raise their energy prices even more. Weatherizing homes is a one-time investment that can permanently lower a household’s energy bills and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  We urge your administration to prioritize releasing the funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program and look forward to working with you and the Department of Energy to get this money into the hands of local providers that can begin weatherizing homes as soon as possible. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely,"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senator-collins-co-sponsors-bipartisan-bill-address-critical-doctor-shortage-maine,"Washington, D.C. – In order to address the shortage of medical professionals in Maine and across the United States, which has been underscored most recently by the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) co-sponsored theRural Physician Workforce Production Act to attract more doctors to rural areas. “This legislation would extend an important program to address the shortage of primary care doctors, which has been exacerbated in rural and underserved communities by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” said Senator Collins. “I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation to help train the next generation of physicians and ensure all Americans have access to quality health services.” One of the greatest indicators of where a doctor will practice is the location of their residency, but some rural hospitals cannot afford to take on new residents, despite the need for more physicians. The Rural Physician Workforce Production Act addresses the geographic misdistribution of physicians across the U.S. stemming from the current structure of Medicare-funded graduate medical education (GME). The bill lifts the current caps on Medicare reimbursement payments to rural hospitals that cover the cost of taking on residents, eliminating the serious disadvantage that rural hospitals face when recruiting new medical professionals. The bill also allows Medicare to reimburse urban hospitals that send residents to train at rural health care facilities during a resident rotation, and it establishes a per resident payment initiative to ensure rural hospitals have the resources to bring on additional residents. The Rural Physician Workforce Production Act is supported by the Council of Academic Family Medicine, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the National Rural Health Association, and the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine. In addition to Senator Collins, the legislation was co-sponsored by Senators Jon Tester (D-MT), John Barrasso (R-WY), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), John Boozman (R-AR), and Shelley Capito (R-WV). Click HERE to read the bill text. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/collins-colleagues-introduce-bipartisan-bill-grow-and-support-infectious-disease-and,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) introduced the Bolstering Infectious Outbreak (BIO) Preparedness Workforce Act to address retention and recruitment issues facing vital clinicians and public health professionals and better prepare the American health care system for future public health emergencies. The bipartisan legislation would establish a new student loan repayment program for infectious disease (ID) clinicians and other public health preparedness and response professionals who work in health care settings. “We need to encourage students to pursue careers in health care and eliminate barriers to getting this vital training -- such as nursing faculty shortages or financial disincentives to pursuing certain specialties,” said Senator Collins.  “The ongoing public health emergency has underscored the importance of investing in a robust medical workforce.  Our bipartisan bill would establish a new student loan repayment program for infectious disease professionals, attracting more students to this critical field and helping our nation prepare for future crises.” “The COVID-19 pandemic put a major strain on our health care system, especially among our infectious diseases clinical workforce and public health professionals who specialize in bio-preparedness. This bipartisan legislation will strengthen our workforce to help get through this pandemic, and make sure we are better prepared for future public health emergencies,” said Senator Baldwin. “We need to use all the tools in the tool box to be better prepared, and that starts with making sure we support and grow our infectious disease and pandemic preparedness workforce.” “The American Medical Association appreciates Sens. Baldwin and Collins for introducing legislation that would help address critical physician shortages and strengthen our nation’s preparedness for public health emergencies,” said Gerald A. Harmon, MD, President of the American Medical Association. “We need additional programs for physician student loan forgiveness to ensure that we have an adequate physician staff and a prepared health care professional workforce that can protect us against health emergencies we encounter in the future.” “The American Hospital Association (AHA) thanks Senators Baldwin and Collins for leading this important bipartisan effort to support the infectious disease and outbreak preparedness workforce, including those in America’s hospitals and health systems,” said Stacey Hughes, Executive Vice President of AHA. “This legislation will also help attract new workers to these critical professions, including by incentivizing them to practice in areas with workforce shortages and in communities dealing with sustained hardship. We look forward to working with the sponsors to move this bill forward.” The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed gaps and weaknesses in our nation’s preparedness for public health emergencies related to infectious disease outbreaks, including insufficient workforce capacity focused on outbreak preparedness and response in health care settings. Prolonged, significant additional work (including both direct patient care and system-focused preparedness and response activities) in an environment of health risks, uncertainty, and overwhelming loss of patient lives has contributed to severe burnout among physicians, nurses, laboratory professionals and others. This has led some to consider early retirement, exacerbating existing workforce concerns and threatening the future of this critical workforce. A June 2020 study in the Annals of Internal Medicine, authored by now-Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, found that 208 million Americans live in areas with little or no access to an ID provider. In 2020, only 75 percent of infectious diseases training programs were able to fill all their slots, in part due to significantly lower salaries for ID providers than nearly all other specialties, including general internal medicine. Given that the average medical student debt is over $200,000, the ID specialty and related bio-preparedness work are a financially infeasible choice for many. The BIO Preparedness Workforce Act would establish a new student loan repayment program for infectious disease clinicians and bio-preparedness health care professionals including physicians, clinical pharmacists, physician assistants, and advanced practice registered nurses. For each year of service, qualified individuals may receive up to $50,000, up to a total of $150,000 in loan repayment, with $50 million authorized for the program. In addition to Senators Collins, Baldwin, Rosen, and Murkowski, the bipartisan legislation has been co-sponsored by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). Click HERE to read the bill text. Click HERE for the full list of support organizations. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/canada-adjusts-border-testing-requirements-vaccinated-travelers-following-push-senator,"Washington, D.C.—U.S. Senator Susan Collins released a statement following today’s decision by the Canadian government to adjust its testing requirement for vaccinated travelers beginning November 30th.  Under the updated policy, vaccinated Canadians who have spent less than 72 hours in the United States will not need to present a negative COVID-19 test prior to returning to Canada.  Last week, Senator Collins joined a bipartisan group of Senators in sending a letter to Canada’s Minister of Foreign Affairs to push for Canada to ease its testing requirement. “Today’s announcement is another positive step toward reuniting communities that were harmed by the prolonged closure of the U.S.-Canada border,” said Senator Collins.  “The reopening of the border to vaccinated individuals on November 8th was a cause for celebration, but the testing protocols imposed by Canada continued to be a barrier to crossings.  I heard from Mainers about how this requirement created a significant inconvenience and financial burden for individuals traveling between our two nations, deterring Canadians from shopping at small businesses in our state and making it costly to visit family and friends.” “I strongly urged the Canadian government to align its testing requirement with current U.S. policy,” Senator Collins continued.  “Although today’s decision will make it easier and more seamless for vaccinated Americans and Canadians to travel across our northern border, it will continue to create an unnecessary obstacle to tourists and other Canadians who wish to visit the U.S. for an extended period.  I continue to urge Canada to remove its testing requirement for vaccinated individuals.” +++ On November 8th, Senator Collins released a statement heralding the official reopening of the U.S. and Canada land border to fully vaccinated Canadians.  The reopening followed efforts Senator Collins led to adjust or reevaluate restrictions on non-essential travel across the U.S.-Canada border.  In October, she joined a group of six Senators in calling on the Biden Administration to provide the medical justifications for continued U.S.-Canada land border restrictions.  In July, she joined the rest of the Maine Delegation in sending a letter to U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, urging the Administration to take steps to allow fully-vaccinated Canadians to cross the U.S.-Canada border for business or leisure given current health conditions.  In May, she participated in a call with U.S. Senators and Canadian members of Parliament to discuss the importance of reopening the border.  Earlier this year, Senator Collins sent a letter urging Secretary Mayorkas to ease restrictions on U.S.-Canada travel and included copies of correspondence she had with both former President Trump and former Acting Secretary Chad Wolf advocating for limited border crossing exemptions based on localized risks. ### "

https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senators-collins-durbin-introduce-clean-cooking-bill-improve-global-environment-public,"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Dick Durbin (D-IL), introduced the Clean Cooking Support Act, a bill that would address the health, environmental, and economic problems caused by exposure to smoke from traditional cookstoves and open fires.  The bipartisan legislation reinforces the U.S. government’s commitment to spurring the adoption of clean cookstoves around the world and seeks to take a whole-of-government approach to address household air pollution. “Our bill aims to address a serious global public health and environmental issue where leadership by the United States can make a real difference.  It would directly benefit some of the world’s poorest people, including the women and girls who are disproportionately affected, and reduce harmful pollution that affects us all,” said Senator Susan Collins.  “I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Durbin in supporting the Clean Cooking Support Act.” “The U.S. should take a leadership position in creating and implementing climate solutions that support a cleaner, healthier planet for all,” said Senator Durbin.  “With the Clean Cooking Support Act, we can reduce harmful emissions and protect people from the dangerous health risks of inefficient and unsafe cookstoves and fuels.  I’m proud to join Senator Collins in introducing this bipartisan legislation to ensure that American development assistance and expertise helps in this timely effort.”  This legislation has received strong bipartisan support from more than 50 organizations throughout Maine and across our country. At an event during the COP26 international climate conference, the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Michael S. Regan said, “The U.S. government will work with the Clean Cooking Alliance, other country governments, and partners at every level of government to reduce emissions from home cooking and heating that contribute to climate change and directly affect the health and livelihoods of almost 40 percent of the world’s population.” “The message from COP26 was clear: we need climate solutions that not only reduce harmful emissions, but also help address health, economic, and gender inequities,” said Dymphna van der Lans, Chief Executive Officer of Clean Cooking Alliance.  “This transition cannot happen without significant increases in funding and dedicated resources.  We thank Senator Collins and Senator Durbin for their leadership on this important issue, and we look forward to working together to pass this legislation and help make universal access to clean cooking a reality.” “Everyone deserves the opportunity to breathe clean, healthy air,” said Harold Wimmer, President & CEO of the American Lung Association. “Helping people transition from old, polluting cookstoves to newer versions that emit less particle pollution will have immediate health benefits, especially for the women, young children and the underserved communities who disproportionately suffer the effects of household air pollution. Thank you to Senators Collins and Durbin for their continued leadership on this issue.”  Nearly three billion people, or one-third of the global population, rely on “dirty cooking,” such as open fires or inefficient, polluting, and unsafe cookstoves that use agricultural waste, coal, dung, wood, charcoal, or other solid fuels, to cook their meals.  The majority of people using these types of cookstoves and fuels are in developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.  Exposure to smoke from these traditional cooking methods and open fires causes chronic and acute diseases such as lung cancer, heart disease, and stroke.  Household air pollution caused by traditional cookstoves and open fires causes 4 million premature deaths annually, including 400,000 children younger than five years of age, most of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa. Traditional cookstoves also create serious environmental problems, contributing to more than 10 percent of global ambient air pollution.  According to the EPA, greenhouse gas emissions from non-renewable wood fuels for cooking amount to two percent of the global CO2 emissions, on par with the global CO2 emissions from the aviation or shipping industries. Since 2010, the Clean Cooking Alliance, an innovative public-private partnership hosted by the United Nations Foundation, has supported the adoption of clean cooking worldwide, with the goal of achieving universal access to clean cooking by 2030.  The Clean Cooking Support Act would support this effort by:  Click HERE to read the bill text. Click HERE for the full list of supporting organizations. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/collins-duckworth%E2%80%99s-bipartisan-protecting-moms-who-served-act-be-signed-law,"Washington, D.C. – Bipartisan legislation introduced by U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and U.S. Representative Lauren Underwood (D-IL-14) that will help address the maternal mortality crisis among women veterans passed both the Senate and House by overwhelming margins and is now headed to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law. “Providing support to our veterans and those who serve today is among our greatest obligations. The U.S. has an unacceptably high maternal mortality rate, and the impact of this crisis on women veterans is not well understood,” said Senator Collins. “Our legislation will help examine ways to improve care coordination, identify gaps in coverage, and eliminate disparities. I look forward to this critical bill being signed into law to help ensure that the brave women who have served in our military receive the maternal care they have earned.” “It’s a tragedy every time a mother dies from a preventable cause related to pregnancy or childbirth, and it’s shameful that far too often these moms are women of color whose pain or symptoms have been overlooked or ignored,” said Senator Duckworth. “There has never been a comprehensive evaluation of how our nation’s growing maternal mortality crisis is impacting our women Veterans, even though they may be at higher risk due to their service. I’m so proud that this bipartisan bill I introduced with Senator Collins and Representative Underwood—which would commission the first-ever comprehensive study on this issue in relation to the Veteran community while also making sure mothers who have served our nation can access the maternal care they need and have earned—passed the House, and I look forward to President Biden signing it into law.” There are more than half a million women veterans in our nation who are under the age of 40. The Protecting Moms Who Served Act will commission the first-ever comprehensive study on the scope of America’s maternal health crisis among women veterans—with a focus on racial and ethnic disparities on maternal health outcomes—while also supporting maternal care coordination programs at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities. Specifically, the Protecting Moms Who Served Act will: ·         Invest $15 million in maternity care coordination programs at VA facilities that will help: o   Ensure effective coordination between VA facilities and non-VA facilities in the delivery of maternity care and other healthcare services; o   Facilitate access and referrals to resources in the community to address social determinants of health; o   Identify mental and behavioral health risk factors in the prenatal and postpartum periods, and ensure that pregnant and postpartum veterans get the help and treatment they need; and o   Offer childbirth preparation classes, parenting classes, nutrition counselling, breastfeeding support, lactation classes and breast pumps. ·         Commission a comprehensive GAO study, submitted to Congress, on maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity among veterans, with a particular focus on racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes that will: o   Make recommendations for the improvement of maternal health data collection processes; o   Include steps on how to reduce adverse maternal health outcomes among veterans, including those with coverage through the VA, their employers or other private insurance plans, Tricare or Medicaid, as well as uninsured veterans. The Protecting Moms Who Served Act has been endorsed by more than 150 organizations, including: American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses; NAACP; Society for Women’s Health Research; Women Veterans Interactive; and Wounded Warrior Project. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senate-passes-collins-manchin-resolution-designate-november-national-homeless-children-and,"Washington, D.C.  – The Senate passed a bipartisan resolution that brings attention to children and youth experiencing homelessness across the country. U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) led 12 of their colleagues in authoring the resolution recognizing November as National Homeless Children and Youth Awareness Month. In the United States, more than 1.4 million students experienced homelessness during the 2018-2019 school year. In Maine, approximately 2,500 students experience homelessness each year. “Growing up is challenging enough without young people having to worry about where they will sleep each night. Without the proper support, these children are at risk of dropping out of school and are in greater danger of exploitation. We must make sure our nation’s homeless youth have the same opportunity to succeed as their peers,” said Senator Collins, Ranking Member of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee. “I’m pleased that the Senate has passed this bipartisan resolution to raise awareness for this critical issue and recognize the hard work being done by businesses, organizations, schools, and volunteers to prevent youth homelessness.” “Youth and child homelessness is a national crisis requiring a new approach that centers the needs of our youngest citizens. NN4Y applauds that Senators from both sides of the aisle have come together in support of this Senate Resolution. Through a cross-system approach, we can end child and youth homelessness in America,” said Darla Bardine, Executive Director, National Network for Youth. “Children and youth living without a home suffer trauma, inequity, and instability, yet remain largely out of sight. America’s promise of ‘opportunity for all’ requires seeing and prioritizing children and youth who experience homelessness – a large, yet often hidden population. I am pleased at this federal recognition of their plight, and hope it is the first of many steps in supporting their needs, resilience, and success. I look forward to continuing to work with youth, families, advocates, businesses, community members, and policymakers to ensure that every child and youth has the opportunity to thrive,” said Barbara Duffield, Executive Director, SchoolHouse Connection. The COVID-19 pandemic has compounded children and youth homelessness with high unemployment, unstable living conditions, and job insecurity – resulting in higher rates of children, youth and families experiencing homelessness. The COVID-19 pandemic also kept many students at home during the 2020 school year, and schools struggled to track those students experiencing homelessness. The resolution was supported by SchoolHouse Connection, National Network for Youth, First Focus for Children, National Association of School Phycologists, AFT, National Association of Secondary School Principals, Family Promise, National Alliance to End Homelessness, National Low Income Housing Coalition and Opportunity Starts at Home Campaign. In addition to Senators Collins and Manchin, the resolution was supported by Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Chris Coons (D-DE), Gary Peters (D-MI), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Jack Reed (D-RI). Click HERE to read the text of the resolution. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/bill-crack-down-deceptive-tactic-used-robocallers-advances-senate,"Washington, D.C.— Today, the Senate Commerce Committee unanimously approved the Anti-Spoofing Penalties Modernization Act of 2021, legislation authored by U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Josh Hawley (R-MO), and Gary Peters (D-MI) to aid Americans who are being inundated with robocalls.  Their bipartisan bill would double the penalties for illegal caller-ID “spoofing,” a tactic scammers often use to trick victims into answering their phone calls.  By disguising their true identity, scammers can masquerade as government officials or well-known businesses and convince consumers to share their personal and financial information.  “Older Americans lose billions of dollars each year to an ever-growing array of financial exploitation schemes.  These scams vary in nature, from COVID-19 scams to government imposter scams to prize, sweepstakes, and lottery scams,” said Senator Collins.  “We must work together to stop the criminals who use illegal robocalls and spoofing to steal Americans’ hard-earned savings and personal information.  By increasing penalties for spoofing violations, the bipartisan Anti-Spoofing Penalties Modernization Act would provide an additional tool in this fight.  I am pleased that the Commerce Committee advanced our legislation today, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.” “By strengthening penalties we’re ensuring fraudsters are held accountable and all Arizonans, especially seniors, are protected from illegal robocalls, scams, and harassment,” said Senator Sinema. “I often hear from Missourians that nonstop robocalls constantly interrupt their daily lives.  Even worse, the fraudsters behind these robocalls are exploiting and taking advantage of senior citizens,” said Senator Hawley.  “This legislation takes an important step in holding criminal robocallers accountable.  I fought these invasive robocalls as Missouri’s Attorney General and am proud to see this bipartisan effort advance in the Senate.” “Not only are robocalls annoying, but they are often predatory and seek to scam Michiganders. Unfortunately, scammers are using ever-sophisticated methods to better ensure their robocalls are answered,” said Senator Peters. “We must keep working to crack down on these robocalls and increase penalties for illegal spoofing, which is why I’m pleased to see this bipartisan bill advance in the Senate.” “Spoofing” of caller-IDs is commonly used by criminal robocallers to mask their true identity.  Con artists use this technique to boost their credibility and fool victims by making it appear as though they are calling from the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the local police department, or another legitimate source.  The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to new phone, text, and email scams that seek to trick or frighten consumers into sharing personal information and financial details. In 2010, Congress passed the Truth in Caller ID Act, which prohibits the use of misleading or inaccurate caller-ID information to intentionally defraud, cause harm, or wrongfully obtain anything of value.  The use of this deceptive tactic has exploded since then, however, underscoring the need for stronger deterrent measures. The bipartisan Anti-Spoofing Penalties Modernization Act would double the penalties for illegal spoofing under existing law, increasing the fine per violation from $10,000 to $20,000 and increasing the maximum fine from $1 million to $2 million.  Consumers can help protect themselves from fraud by:     ###"

This road is a vital connection for the local tribal community, particularly for local farms that experience challenges in transporting farm equipment that is too large to be safely accommodated by the current width. Improving the connectivity of this area will also provide safer access to tribal housing, recreational, health care, and administrative facilities year-round, as well as create a sustainable long-term connection between the primary tribal lands of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and the Town of Houlton. ·         $1.65 million for Broadway Roadway and Intersection Improvements in Bangor.  This project will improve safety at the Broadway intersection by realigning the northbound and southbound I-95 ramps with Broadway and making other improvements.  Within the Bangor area, Broadway (State Route 15) is a vital transportation corridor that provides access to employment, educational institutions, emergency and nonemergency medical services, professional services, and businesses.  There are several locations along Broadway where the combination of high traffic volumes and poor intersection geometry, layout, and operation contribute to a high number of vehicle crashes along the corridor.  This project will improve roadway and intersection geometry, upgrade traffic signal equipment, and improve safety for motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists. As the Ranking Member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Collins has championed robust funding for the RAISE program.  Since 2009, when Senator Collins became a member of the Appropriations Committee, she has secured more than $800 million in competitive transportation grants for the State of Maine.  This year, the Department of Transportation received 765 eligible RAISE applications requesting more than $10.3 billion in funding.  Fewer than 100 applications were funded this year for the highly competitive RAISE program. ###"

Commute times are up 1.9% since 2011 in the state and bad roads cost drivers an average of $543 per year in repair costs.   ·         Bridges o   The bill provides $225 million to Maine for bridge construction, maintenance and repair. o    Additionally, Maine can compete for the $12.5 billion Bridge Investment Program for economically significant bridges and nearly $16 billion of national funding in the bill dedicated for major projects that will deliver substantial economic benefits to communities.  o   Maine currently has 315 bridges considered to be “structurally deficient.”  ·         Broadband o    Based on a preliminary estimate, Maine stands to receive approximately $300 million to help expand high-speed Internet service to nearly every corner of our state, helping provide access to the at least 42,000 Mainers who currently lack it.  o   Additionally, more than 300,000 Mainers will be eligible for the Affordability Connectivity Benefit, which will help low-income families afford internet access.  ·         Airports  o   The bill provides $15 billion in formula funding—of which Maine will receive $73.5 million—for FAA Airport Infrastructure Grants which supports Airport Improvement Program (“AIP”) projects, such as runways and taxiways, as well as terminal development projects, multimodal, or airport-owned towers.  This funding provides flexibility for airports such as Portland International Jetport (PWM) and Presque Isle International Airport (PQI) to address their specific airside or landside needs. o    The bill provides $5 billion for FAA’s Facilities and Equipment Program, which includes funding for FAA-owned Air Traffic Control facilities and contract towers.  o    The bill provides $5 billion in grants for a new Airport Terminal Improvement Program, a new competitive discretionary grant program which includes set asides for small hub airports, nonhub, and nonprimary airports, ensuring airports in communities of all sizes benefit. ·         Railroads o   The bill provides $5 billion for the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvement (CRISI) program to assist with critical capital projects and rail safety technologies. o   The bill provides $3 billion for the Grade Crossing elimination grant program. o   The bill provides funding for Amtrak’s National Network, which supports upgrades to rail lines, facilities, and trainsets that operate on State-supported routes like the Downeaster. ·         Public Transportation o   The bill provides $250 million to Maine over five years to improve public transportation options. ·         Clean Water o   The bill authorizes $254 million to Maine in water revolving funds.  This includes the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act, which passed the Senate overwhelmingly this year. ·         Electric Vehicles o   The bill provides $19 million to Maine over five years to support the expansion of an EV charging network in the state.  Maine will also have the opportunity to apply for the $2.5 billion in grant funding dedicated to EV charging in the bill.  ### "
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/collins-colleagues-introduce-amendment-annual-defense-bill-strengthen-public-and-private,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), a senior member of the Intelligence Committee, along with Senators Gary Peters (D-MI), Rob Portman (R-OH), and Mark Warner (D-VA), introduced a bipartisan amendment to the annual defense authorization bill to require critical infrastructure owners and operators and civilian federal agencies to report to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) if they experience a cyber-attack.  Most entities would be required to report if they make a ransomware payment.  The amendment is based on the Cyber Incident Reporting Act and Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2021. “Having a clear view of the dangers the nation faces from cyberattacks is necessary to prioritizing and acting to mitigate and reduce the threat,” said Senator Collins.  “My 2012 bill would have led to improved information sharing with the federal government that likely would have reduced the impact of cyber incidents on both the government and the private sector.  Failure to enact a robust cyber incident notification requirement will only give our adversaries more opportunity to gather intelligence on our government, steal intellectual property from our companies, and harm our critical infrastructure.  I urge my colleagues to pass our amendment, which is common sense and long overdue.” The amendment would require critical infrastructure owners and operators to report to CISA within 72 hours if they are experiencing a substantial cyber-attack.  Many other organizations, including businesses, nonprofits, and state and local governments, would also be required to report to the federal government within 24 hours if they make a ransom payment following an attack.  Additionally, the amendment would update current federal government cybersecurity laws to improve coordination between federal agencies, force the government to take a risk-based approach to security, as well as require all civilian agencies to report all cyber-attacks to CISA, and major cyber incidents to Congress.  It also provides additional authorities to CISA to ensure they are the lead federal agency in charge of responding to cybersecurity incidents on federal civilian networks. +++ Following the hack of IT management firm SolarWinds, which resulted in the compromise of hundreds of federal agencies and private companies, Senator Collins joined Senators Warner and Marco Rubio (R-FL) in introducing a bipartisan bill in July that would require federal agencies, government contractors, entities that provide cybersecurity incident response services, and critical infrastructure owners and operators to report cyber intrusions within 24 hours of their discovery. In 2012, Senator Collins introduced a bipartisan bill with former Senator Joe Lieberman that would have encouraged companies that operate critical infrastructure — such as water plants, electric companies and transportation networks — to take steps to boost the security of their computer systems and networks. It also aimed to make it easier for industry to share information about cyber threats spotted on their networks with the government. ###"

This will become especially urgent in the coming months as businesses attempt to secure H-2B visas for additional workers needed during the 2022 tourism season.” “I appreciate the challenges posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including the fact that in many cases the State Department must follow host nation guidance and restrictions which are out of the control of U.S. policymakers.  Since May, however, the State Department has made vaccinations available to our entire overseas consular workforce, helping to protect the safety of consular staff,” Senator Collins continued.  “I request an update from the State Department on actions it is taking to fully open U.S. embassies and consulates, to include consultations with host nation governments, as well as efforts the Department is undertaking to address the ongoing backlog of visa interviews. I believe the State Department can support the needs of American citizens and employers while mitigating the risks posed by the pandemic.” As of mid-October, 60 percent of consulates remained fully or partially closed to non-emergency appointments for nonimmigrant visa applicants, while 40 percent are completely closed to non-emergency, nonimmigrant visa appointments.  Open consulates are reporting wait times of, in many cases, six months or longer for some nonimmigrant visas.  For immigrant visa applicants, the State Department recently reported a backlog of 494,566 applicants who had completed their documentation but were waiting for a visa appointment, which is eight times the backlog reported by the Department in 2019. Click HERE to read Senator Collins’ letter. ###"

https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senate-passes-collins-duckworth-bill-address-maternal-mortality-crisis-among-women-veterans,"Washington, D.C. – The Senate passed legislation that would help address the maternal mortality crisis among women veterans. The Protecting Moms Who Served Act, which was authored by U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and U.S. Representative Lauren Underwood (D-IL-14), would commission the first-ever comprehensive study on the scope of America’s maternal health crisis among women veterans.  The legislation would also support maternal care coordination programs at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities. There are more than half a million women veterans in our nation who are under the age of 40. “Providing support to our veterans and those who serve today is among our greatest obligations.  The U.S. has an unacceptably high maternal mortality rate, and the impact of this crisis on women veterans is not well understood,” said Senator Collins. “Our legislation would help examine ways to improve care coordination, identify gaps in coverage, and eliminate disparities.  I’m pleased that the Senate has passed this critical bill to help ensure that the brave women who have served in our military receive the maternal care they have earned.” “It’s a tragedy every time a mother dies from a preventable cause related to pregnancy or childbirth, and it’s shameful that far too often those moms are women of color whose pain or symptoms have been overlooked or ignored,” said Senator Duckworth. “There has never been a comprehensive evaluation of how our nation’s growing maternal mortality crisis is impacting our women Veterans, even though they may be at higher risk due to their service. I’m so proud that this bipartisan bill I introduced with Senator Collins and Representative Underwood—which would commission the first-ever comprehensive study on this issue in relation to the Veteran community while also making sure mothers who have served our nation can access the maternal care they need and have earned—passed the Senate.” “The U.S. suffers unacceptable rates of preventable maternal mortality, and veterans are uniquely at-risk. With the Protecting Moms Who Served Act, we can make sure that the Department of Veterans Affairs provides the highest quality maternal health care and support for moms who have served,” said Representative Underwood. “I'm so thrilled to see the first bill in my Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act pass the Senate. I am thankful for the partnership of Senators Duckworth and Collins on this bipartisan effort, and I look forward to seeing this critical legislation to save moms’ lives pass the House and get signed into law.” Specifically, the Protecting Moms Who Served Act would: ·         Invest $15 million in maternity care coordination programs at VA facilities that would help: o   Ensure effective coordination between VA facilities and non-VA facilities in the delivery of maternity care and other healthcare services;o   Facilitate access and referrals to resources in the community to address social determinants of health;o   Identify mental and behavioral health risk factors in the prenatal and postpartum periods, and ensure that pregnant and postpartum Veterans get the help and treatment they need; ando   Offer childbirth preparation classes, parenting classes, nutrition counselling, breastfeeding support, lactation classes and breast pumps. ·         Commission a comprehensive GAO study, submitted to Congress, on maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity among Veterans, with a particular focus on racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes that would: o   Make recommendations for the improvement of maternal health data collection processes; ando   Include steps on how to reduce adverse maternal health outcomes among veterans, including those with coverage through the VA, their employers or other private insurance plans, Tricare or Medicaid, as well as uninsured veterans. The Protecting Moms Who Served Act has been endorsed by over 150 organizations, including: American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses; NAACP; Society for Women’s Health Research; Women Veterans Interactive; and Wounded Warrior Project. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/reopening-border-reuniting-families-and-rejuvenating-maine-businesses,"At long last, the U.S.-Canada land border reopened November 8th for fully vaccinated Canadians.  For many Maine families and small businesses, this day was long awaited. The United States and our ally Canada have a long history of cooperation, which is fortunate given that our two countries share the longest international border in the world.  This relationship is especially important to Maine, where our Atlantic Canada neighbors often are friends and family.  In addition, residents on both sides of the border regularly need to cross to reach stores, medical care, churches, and other essential services. These personal, social, and economic connections were threatened by ongoing and unjustified restrictions on land travel to the U.S. from Canada.  In March 2020, during the early days of the pandemic, the Department of Homeland Security imposed a temporary limit on Canadians entering the United States at land ports of entry for any reason other than “essential travel.”  That month, bans on air travel from certain foreign countries were also put in place. I heard from many Mainers about the harm that the extended closure of America’s land border had on their families, such as a Canadian grandmother who was not able to attend two weddings for her grandchildren and another Canadian woman who was not able to visit her disabled brother in Maine.  In addition, Maine small business owners, particularly in border communities, told me that they were losing significant revenue without their Canadian customers.  Our hospitality businesses also experienced losses due to the absence of Canadian tourists. I repeatedly pushed our government to adjust or reevaluate restrictions on travel across the U.S.-Canada border.  In May, I participated in a call with U.S. Senators and Canadian members of Parliament to discuss the importance of reopening the border.  In July, I joined the rest of the Maine Delegation in urging Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas to take steps to allow fully-vaccinated Canadians to cross the U.S.-Canada border for business or leisure given current health conditions.  In September, the Biden Administration announced that fully vaccinated travelers who tested negative for COVID-19 would be able to enter the U.S. via air travel.  Inexplicably, however, the ban for travelers entering the United States for “non-essential” purposes via land was left in place. It simply made no sense to allow vaccinated air travelers to come to the U.S. but not allow vaccinated Canadians to drive across the northern border.  It was baffling that vaccinated Canadians could enter the U.S. by air, but not by land.             This decision was also unneighborly since Canada, which has a high rate of vaccinations, began allowing U.S. citizens and permanent residents to enter their country for non-essential purposes, including tourism, in August. After the Administration’s announcement, I joined a coalition of Senators from northern border states calling on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide medical justification for the continued ban on most travelers entering the country via land.  We emphasized that we support efforts to curb the transmission of COVID-19, but we shared the concerns of our constituents and communities along the U.S.-Canada border who were being harmed by the restriction of non-essential travel at land border crossings. Following this bipartisan advocacy, the Administration finally reopened the U.S.-Canada land border.  This long-overdue action will help to reunite tight-knit border communities and provide a boost to Maine small businesses that suffered significant revenue losses without Canadian customers. "

https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-negotiated-senator-collins-and-nine-other-senators-be-signed,"Washington, D.C.—U.S. Senator Susan Collins released a statement following the House’s passage of the bipartisan infrastructure package by a vote of 228-206. The legislation, which passed the Senate by a strong, bipartisan vote of 69-30 in August, now heads to the President’s desk to be signed into law. Senator Collins, the Ranking Member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, was part of the core group of 10 Senators who negotiated the text of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.  She focused on the funding for highways and bridges and also spearheaded the broadband working group with Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), which reached an agreement to provide $65 billion for the deployment of high-speed Internet to unserved and underserved areas. “After months of delay, I’m pleased that the House finally took action and passed the landmark bipartisan infrastructure bill.  “This infrastructure package is good for America.  “Earlier this year, I joined a group of 10 Senators—five Republicans and five Democrats—who were determined to break through the partisan gridlock and pass this long-overdue infrastructure investment for the American people.  After months of working night and day, our bipartisan negotiations resulted in a truly transformational package for our country that will make the most significant investment in American infrastructure since the establishment of the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s.   “One of the many provisions that will have a significant impact on Maine is the $65 billion investment for broadband, which will expand high-speed Internet access to rural and unserved areas of our state.  I negotiated this section of the bill with Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), along with our colleagues and the Administration.  It has become increasingly clear in recent years – and especially in light of the pandemic – that broadband is not a luxury, but a necessity. “I look forward to this bill being signed into law.” In addition to Senator Collins, the leaders of the infrastructure negotiations included Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Mark Warner (D-VA), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), and Jon Tester (D-MT). Key provisions that will benefit Maine include: ·         Roads and Highways o   The bill authorizes $1.3 billion to Maine for federal-aid highway apportioned programs over five years to construct, rebuild, and maintain its roads and highways.  o   Maine has over 1,438 miles of highway in poor condition. Commute times are up 1.9% since 2011 in the state and bad roads cost drivers an average of $543 per year in repair costs.   ·         Bridges o   The bill authorizes $225 million to Maine for bridge construction, maintenance and repair. o   Maine can also compete for the $12.5 billion Bridge Investment Program for economically significant bridges and nearly $16 billion of national funding in the bill dedicated for major projects that will deliver substantial economic benefits to communities.  o   Maine currently has 315 bridges considered to be “structurally deficient.”  ·         Broadband o   The bill authorizes at least $100 million to Maine help provide high-speed Internet coverage across the state, helping provide access to the at least 42,000 Mainers who currently lack it.  o   Maine is very well positioned to receive significantly more broadband buildout funding through the State Deployment Grant formula that targets unserved and high-cost areas.  o   Additionally, more than 300,000 Mainers will be eligible for the Affordability Connectivity Benefit, which will help low-income families afford internet access.  ·         Airports o    The bill authorizes $15 billion in formula funding for FAA Airport Infrastructure Grants which supports Airport Improvement Program (“AIP”) projects, such as runways and taxiways, as well as terminal development projects, multimodal, or airport-owned towers.  This funding provides flexibility for airports such as Portland International Jetport (PWM) and Presque Isle International Airport (PQI) to address their specific airside or landside needs. o    The bill authorizes $5 billion for FAA’s Facilities and Equipment Program, which includes funding for FAA-owned Air Traffic Control facilities and contract towers.  o    The bill authorizes $5 billion in grants for a new Airport Terminal Improvement Program, which includes set asides for small hub airports, nonhub, and nonprimary airports, ensuring airports in communities of all sizes benefit. ·         Railroads o   The bill authorizes $5 billion for the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvement (CRISI) program to assist with critical capital projects and rail safety technologies. o   The bill authorizes $3 billion for the Grade Crossing elimination grant program. o   Funding for Amtrak’s National Network which supports upgrades to rail lines, facilities, and trainsets that operate on State-supported routes like the Downeaster. ·         Clean Water o   The bill authorizes $254 million to Maine in water revolving funds.  This includes theDrinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act, which passed the Senate overwhelmingly this year. ·         Electric Vehicles o   The bill authorizes $19 million to Maine over five years to support the expansion of an EV charging network in the state.  Maine will also have the opportunity to apply for the $2.5 billion in grant funding dedicated to EV charging in the bill.  ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senator-collins-visits-maine-medical-center-thank-workers-discuss-plans-build-four-cardiac,"Click HERE, HERE, HERE, and HERE for high-resolution Portland, ME – Today, U.S. Senator Susan Collins visited Maine Medical Center to thank health care providers and staff for their selfless work during the pandemic. She also discussed the hospital’s plan to construct, modernize, and expand cardiovascular operating rooms.  Senator Collins, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, recently secured $3 million for this project in an Appropriations bill, which must still be voted upon by the full Senate and House. Senator Collins was joined by Jeff Sanders, President of Maine Medical Center, and Katie Fullam Harris, Chief Government Affairs Officer for MaineHealth. “Maine Medical Center’s dedicated health care providers and staff worked selflessly and tirelessly throughout the pandemic.  During this ongoing public health emergency, these frontline workers have treated more than 1,000 COVID-19 patients with courage, compassion, and skill,” said Senator Collins.  “As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I have strongly supported their efforts by championing the Provider Relief Fund, which has provided Maine Medical Center with $74 million to continue to provide excellent care to patients.  I was also delighted to secure $3 million that would be used to expand the number of state-of-the-art hybrid operating rooms at the hospital, allowing more Mainers to access minimally invasive and highly effective treatments for heart disease, coronary valve disease, and other cardiac issues.  I will continue to champion this funding as the appropriations process moves forward.” “We are grateful to Sen. Collins for coming to Maine Medical Center and meeting with our care team members to thank them for their extraordinary contributions throughout the pandemic,” said MMC President Jeff Sanders.  “We appreciate her advocacy in pursuing federal support for our care team members and the patients we will serve in our cardiac procedure rooms in the new Malone Family Tower, currently under construction on Congress Street.  As MMC and the health care industry continue to grapple with the ongoing workforce shortage, it will take efforts like this for us to succeed in pursuing our vision of working together so our communities are healthiest in America.”  Maine Medical Center is the largest private employer in Cumberland County, with 9,500 employees, including 450 physicians.  To date, Maine Medical Center has received more than $74 million through the Provider Relief Fund (PRF), a program championed by Senator Collins that has helped prevent health care providers from permanently closing their doors during the pandemic. The hospital’s Cardiovascular Institute performs complex, minimally invasive heart surgeries known as Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) and MitraClip Percutaneous Mitral Valve Repair System (MitraClip).  TAVR and MitraClip, as well as vascular surgeries such as aortic and thoracic aneurysm repair, require an operating environment that supports both advanced imaging as found in a cardiac catheterization lab and a sterile field as found in traditional operating rooms.  The combination of these technologies form what is called a Hybrid Operating Room (Hybrid OR).  Maine Medical Center transformed an existing space into a cardiovascular hybrid operating room, and it is in the process of building four more in the Malone Family Tower.  If the Health and Human Services Appropriations bill is enacted into law, Maine Medical Center will use the $3 million Senator Collins secured to support this project. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senators-collins-king-announce-over-650000-strengthen-maine%E2%80%99s-lobster-industry,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King announced today that three Maine organizations will be receiving a total of $662,405 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Sea Grant American Lobster Initiative to support the long-term health and resiliency of Maine’s lobster industry. The funds, which have been awarded to the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve, the University of Maine, and the Maine Department of Marine Resources, will help increase our understanding of the impacts of warming in the Gulf of Maine on lobsters in various stages of life. “The lobster industry is an integral part of Maine’s economy, plays a central role in our communities, and represents our state around the world,” said Senators Collins and King. “It is more than a fishery – it is part of who we are. These funds will give three Maine institutions the resources they need to better understand the threats facing our lobster industry and help provide lobstermen the data and support they need to succeed. We are pleased to see NOAA investing in the long term health and success of our coastal communities, and look forward to seeing how these grants contribute to a thriving lobster industry in the decades ahead.” The Sea Grant American Lobster Initiative, funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Sea Grant College Program, addresses critical knowledge gaps about American lobster and its iconic fishery in a dynamic and changing environment. The initiative, which began in 2019 after Sen. Collins secured its inclusion through her work on the Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Subcommittee, supports both scientific research and a regional Sea Grant extension program in the Northeast. Together, the research and extension components of this initiative develop and share new knowledge and understanding with industry stakeholders and resource managers from Maine to New York. The funding will be allocated to the three Maine organizations as follows: The Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve is receiving $134,489 to evaluate the overall health and quality of egg-bearing lobsters with respect to their egg production and examine how environmental drivers of climate change in the Gulf of Maine may be impacting this key life history phase. The University of Maine is receiving $399,036 to expand its decades-long work in collaboration with the industry and regulators to model the distribution of larval lobster in the Gulf of Maine. Specifically, the study will seek to answer questions regarding changes in ocean conditions, larval distribution, and their relationships to the larval lobsters’ optimal food supply. The Maine Department of Marine Resources in partnership with the Maine Center for Coastal Fisheries is receiving $128,880 to explore the existence of current and new lobster predators in the Gulf of Maine. The research will provide data on potential seven different species of predators and allow managers to update stock assessments and improve ecosystem models for the Gulf of Maine. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senator-collins-questions-dr-fauci-maine%E2%80%99s-high-number-covid-19-cases,"Washington, D.C.—Today, U.S. Senator Susan Collins questioned two of the nation’s top public health officials, Dr. Anthony Fauci and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky, at a Senate Health Committee hearing about the federal government’s ongoing response to COVID-19.  Today’s hearing, titled “Next Steps: The Road Ahead for the COVID-19 Response,” was the Committee’s fourth hearing with federal officials on the pandemic this year. Senator Collins began by asking Dr. Fauci why COVID-19 is taking such a heavy toll on the State of Maine.  Maine is one of the most highly vaccinated states in the country, and 95 percent of Mainers over age 65 have been fully vaccinated.  Nevertheless, over the past seven days, Maine has the 15th highest current Covid-19 case rate on a per capita basis and the 22nd highest death rate on a per capita basis among U.S. states.  In addition, Maine has recently experienced a six percent increase in hospitalizations, an 18 percent increase in people in the ICU, and a 37 percent increase in people on ventilators. “First, let me make clear that I believe in the efficacy of vaccines and have encouraged my constituents to become vaccinated,” said Senator Collins.  “But I'm hoping you can explain what appears to be a contradiction when I look at the data for the State of Maine. Maine ranks in the top five states in the [percentage] of people…who have been vaccinated.  Can you explain to me why a state that has done a terrific job in getting people vaccinated is seeing this surge in cases that is overwhelming our hospitals and causing great fear, and pain, and loss?” Dr. Fauci responded that Maine’s high caseload is due to COVID-19 infecting unvaccinated populations as well as breakthrough cases among the vaccinated.  Dr. Fauci went on to say, “[A] vaccinated compared to an unvaccinated person has a multifold less likelihood of being infected, a multifold less likelihood of being hospitalized or dying.  I think there were probably confounding multiple factors going into the difficult situation that your citizens in your state are going through, but there's no doubt that the vaccines are clearly much better in the sense of protecting you from infection, hospitalizations, or death compared to the unvaccinated.” Turning to Dr. Walensky, Senator Collins raised the promising “test-to-stay” approach that allows asymptomatic students who test negative for COVID-19 to remain in school rather than quarantining after another student or a staff member has tested positive for the virus.  A study in the peer-reviewed British medical journal The Lancet found that case rates were not significantly higher at schools that allowed close contacts of infected students or staff members to remain in class with daily testing than schools that required students to quarantine at home.  Senator Collins previously pressed the Secretary of Education to consider this method in September. “Dr. Walensky, parents, teachers, and pediatricians have all talked to me about the learning loss, the emotional and behavioral health problems, that have occurred among children due to their not being in school,” said Senator Collins.  “Brown University professor Emily Oster has expressed great frustration with the CDC being slow to take a stronger position in favor of test-to-stay... Another public health expert said simply ‘It's madness to quarantine school children.  The CDC policies hinder learning and provide no meaningful reduction in COVID transmissions.’ My question for you is, why doesn't the CDC issue guidance or recommendations to encourage school districts to adopt test-to-stay in order to avoid these highly disruptive quarantines of students who are asymptomatic and could be tested?” In response, Dr. Walensky said the CDC is “working with local jurisdictions now to demonstrate the domestic data here in the United States that this practice works, it's safe, it's effective, [and] it gets our children back to school. And importantly, we recognize that jurisdictions are actually doing this and other jurisdictions may want to.  And in that context, we're doing peer-to-peer matching of schools that are interested in doing the test-to-stay practice and having them talk to schools that are also doing it so they can use the implementation strategies that a school has already used.  So we're actively studying this so that we can provide the data on it working, and we're actively encouraging it as a promising practice.” ###"

https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senator-collins-announces-35-million-liheap-funding-maine,"Washington, D.C. – Following a bipartisan push by U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Jack Reed (D-RI), the State of Maine has been awarded a total of $35,028,729 through the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which provides funding to help low-income households pay their energy bills.  “During our long winters, vulnerable Mainers rely on the LIHEAP program to keep warm during the colder months,” said Senator Collins. “This funding will help ensure that low-income families and seniors do not have to make the impossible choice between paying for heat and paying for food or medicine, especially with the sharp increase in energy prices this year. As we combat the ongoing public health and economic crisis, I am pleased that the Administration has distributed these critical funds appropriated by Congress.” The federal funding is particularly critical given that the average cost of home heating is unaffordable for millions of low-income households, costing over $900 per year nationally. Nationwide, an estimated 5.3 million households received assistance with heating and cooling costs through LIHEAP in 2020. Last year, Maine was awarded more than $40 million in annual federal LIHEAP appropriations, which served nearly 33,000 households in Maine.  LIHEAP is a federally funded program that helps low-income households with their home energy bills by providing payment and/or energy crisis assistance to pay for gas, electric, and other methods customers use to heat their homes. LIHEAP is administered by states and accessed through local Community Action Agencies. Eligibility for LIHEAP is based on income, family size, and the availability of resources. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/icymi-senator-collins-pens-column-about-former-maine-police-officer-who-became-havana,"Washington, D.C.—In a column published in the Maine Sunday Telegram, U.S. Senator Susan Collins described the harrowing, life-altering story of a former Maine police officer who was a victim of a likely directed energy attack in Havana, Cuba.  This is the first time that this incident has been publicly shared and represents one of the most detailed, publicly available accounts of a Havana Syndrome case. The HAVANA Act Senator Collins authored, which was signed into law last month, will provide Havana Syndrome victims with the support they deserve.  Senator Collins is also continuing to push for a whole-of-government approach to identify and stop the heartless adversary who is harming U.S. personnel. Havana Syndrome victims need support – and answersA mysterious disease first reported by embassy employees stationed in Cuba is the subject of a new law authored by Maine's senior senator.Maine Sunday Telegram | By: Sen. Susan M. Collins As a former police officer in southern Maine, “Adam” had long been accustomed to dangerous, high-pressure situations. But nothing could have prepared him for the effects of “Havana Syndrome” or his struggle to receive support from his government agency employer for the adverse health consequences that he has endured since.  Adam was one of the first Americans to be affected by the Havana Syndrome, a mysterious illness that received its name because it first surfaced among dozens of U.S. government personnel in Havana, Cuba, in 2016. Since then, upwards of 200 intelligence community personnel, State Department employees, and others have reportedly been afflicted. Havana Syndrome is likely caused by a directed energy attack and is characterized by debilitating injuries that include severe headaches, visual and hearing problems, and cognitive difficulties. These horrific events are growing in number and have reportedly occurred both abroad and on U.S. soil, including near an entrance to the White House. After hearing his harrowing story and those of other brave Americans, I authored the HAVANA Act – legislation that provides additional compensation for U.S. government employees, their dependents, and other designated individuals who suffer brain injuries in connection to their service to our country. It passed Congress unanimously and was signed into law last week. To mark this important progress and raise awareness about these likely attacks, Adam gave me permission to share his experiences publicly for the first time. We have changed his name to comply with the recommended national security protocols. After working as a police officer for nearly a decade, Adam desired to continue serving his country. He applied and was accepted by a U.S. government agency that stationed him in Havana in the fall of 2016. From the outset of his posting, it was evident that he was under close surveillance. Adam recalls heavy-handed tactics that were designed to provoke and intimidate him, which are not entirely unexpected for U.S. personnel operating in a hostile part of the world. Drawing on the mental reserve he developed as a Maine police officer, Adam resolutely refused to lose his composure, knowing that any sign of weakness would only embolden the assailants. That is why, when an intense, penetrating noise began filling his bedroom one evening, he assumed it was another form of harassment and was determined not to leave the room. At first, Adam believed that someone was using an LRAD, a device that emits a powerful sound wave that is occasionally employed by ships to repel pirates, yet it was highly localized and inaudible to his neighbor. The noise continued unabated for half an hour, and he was unable to suppress it with his hands or a pillow. Eventually, the stabbing pain he felt in his eardrums became unbearable, and he started to black out. He managed to roll off the bed and crawl out of the room where the noise stopped, but he temporarily lost his hearing. After this terrifying episode, Adam visited the embassy doctor, who conducted a thorough examination to check for signs of a stroke or another medical ailment that could possibly explain the strange incident. The doctor could not find a cause, but he did make a startling disclosure: He had heard a similar noise several weeks prior. Later on, Adam confided with another friend about what had happened, and he revealed that he and his wife had the same experience. At this point, it was abundantly clear that these were not isolated incidents: They were part of a pattern that was having a devastating effect on U.S. government personnel. Over the next few months, Adam heard the same piercing noise several more times, and the attacks continued even when he tried moving to a different apartment. Throughout this ordeal, Adam alerted his supervisors, but given the novelty and unexplained nature of these cases, his warnings either went unheeded or were dismissed as psychosomatic. Meanwhile, the repeated exposure took a physical toll. Adam would wake up in a pool of blood from his nose and ears. Memos that once took him 20 minutes to write now took hours and were incomprehensible to those that read them. He often felt off balance, and his vision blurred. Eventually, a summary of his medical history and a recording he took of the noise were elevated in his chain of command, and it was confirmed that the sound he kept hearing could cause serious injury or even death. Shortly thereafter, he was pulled out of Cuba and began receiving treatment for a traumatic brain injury. Adam continued working and became an advocate for other victims from within his agency, creating an informal support network. He also advocated for his superiors to formally acknowledge and respond to Havana Syndrome. Forced to battle the bureaucracy and grapple with his own mounting health challenges, Adam contemplated taking his own life. Moreover, he was facing significant expenses due to his symptoms, such as needing to hire outside help to assist him with daily tasks he could no longer accomplish on his own. One evening, he lamented to his wife that the limitations of the federal workers’ compensation program meant he could only receive partial benefits because there was simply no precedent for providing assistance for this type of injury. “Then you should change the system,” his wife encouraged him. It was then that Adam contacted me and described the challenges he was enduring. I invited him to come to Washington, D.C., where he shared his compelling story with my colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee. I repeatedly discussed this issue with CIA Director Burns, and I have also raised it with Secretary of State Blinken. I also authored the HAVANA Act, which will provide financial support to U.S. government employees, their dependents and other designated individuals who suffer brain injuries in connection to their service to our country. I am pleased to say that Adam has received the much-needed additional treatments for which he so strongly advocated. He still struggles with the lasting effects of the traumatic brain injury and was forced to medically retire; however, he has found a new purpose in helping newly affected personnel navigate their injuries and the system. Because of people like Adam and others who have spoken up about their injuries, the intelligence community has made great strides to better support personnel in the years since Havana Syndrome was first reported. CIA Director Burns, in particular, has been a breath of fresh air on this issue and has met personally with many of the victims, improved their access to medical treatment, and pledged to get to the bottom of the attacks. Americans who have suffered from Havana Syndrome while serving our country should be treated the same way we would treat a soldier who suffered a traumatic brain injury on the battlefield. Now that the HAVANA Act is signed into law, Adam and others who have suffered from Havana Syndrome will finally receive the financial assistance that they deserve. As we continue our efforts to support victims, we must also redouble our whole-of-government approach to identify and stop the heartless adversary who is harming U.S. personnel. Click HERE to read Senator Collins’ column online. ###"

Additional secondary payments are expected to be disbursed in the coming weeks after the remaining pending applications are processed by November 15.  ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senator-collins-applauds-launch-able-benefit-accounts-mainers-disabilities,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Susan Collins applauded Bangor Savings Bank’s launch of the Maine ABLE Benefit CheckingSM account, which is the first account of its kind in the nation to be administered by a bank.  The account will ensure people living with disabilities have greater access to financial products and services, while protecting eligibility for federal and state means-tested benefits.  Senator Collins was a co-sponsor of the Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act, signed into law in 2014, that created these savings accounts for individuals with disabilities. “Far too often, Mainers living with disabilities are faced with barriers to economic security.  Being able to save money to make necessary modifications to a car, or a home, or just to pay for unexpected life events, is key to independence and security,” said Senator Collins.  “ABLE Savings Accounts empower individuals with disabilities to plan and save for their future without risking the loss of federal and state benefits.  They also give parents added peace of mind that their children’s futures will be secure as they enter their own retirement years.  I welcome this exciting and unique partnership between the State of Maine and Bangor Savings Bank, which will provide Mainers with disabilities access to their accounts online and at local branches.” “As a community bank, we have a unique opportunity and responsibility to identify and create more equitable access to financial resources for our customers and communities.  As a result, we can better help our customers’ achieve economic empowerment and mobility, said Bob Montgomery-Rice, President and CEO of Bangor Savings Bank.  “Maine ABLE Benefit CheckingSM is a nationally first-of-its-kind account that assists Maine’s people with disabilities in managing their daily qualified disability expenses with ease and freedom, without impact to other essential benefits and services.  We are grateful for the vision and support of Senator Collins in co-sponsoring the ABLE Act, and for our subsequent collaboration with the State of Maine Office of the State Treasurer to make this important program available for Maine residents.” Americans with disabilities have half the rate of workforce participation as the general population despite more than 70 percent wishing to work.  They are also twice as likely to be living in poverty compared to the general population.  The average annual income for a worker with a disability is one-third less than a worker without a disability. Federal law caps the assets of a single person with disabilities who receives Supplemental Security Income, better known as SSI, at just $2,000.  The ABLE Act allowed for the creation of created ABLE Programs, which are established and managed at the state level.  They allow individuals with a disability diagnosis by age 26, and their families, to establish tax-advantaged savings accounts.  Similar to the 529 college savings plans, these savings accounts can be used to set aside contributions not to exceed $15,000 a year to cover qualified expenses such as education, housing, and transportation. In partnership with the Office of the Maine State Treasurer, which oversees and maintains the program locally, Bangor Savings Bank serves as the administrator of the ABLE ME program.  A Maine ABLE Benefit CheckingSM account can be opened at any Bangor Savings Bank branch and is available to qualifying Maine residents. +++ Senator Collins has been a longstanding champion for improving financial security for individuals with disabilities.  In 2018, she chaired an Aging Committee hearing to examine the significant barriers that people with disabilities face to economic health and employment.  In particular, she highlighted ABLE Accounts as a mechanism for individuals with disabilities to save and continue to receive Social Security Insurance benefits. ###"

Other statistics show that the odds that a woman received a breast cancer screening were 20 percent lower in 2020 compared to 2019, and during the early months of the pandemic, health screenings for children decreased in frequency by 40 percent. “Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant decrease in routine medical visits. These procedures, screenings, and immunizations are not only crucial to the wellbeing of individuals and families, but they can also help reduce Americans’ overall health care costs,” said Senator Collins. “Our bipartisan bill would strengthen education and outreach initiatives, particularly in rural and underserved communities, to encourage people to visit their medical providers and receive their regular check-ups.” “As more than one in three adults reported delaying or forgoing health care during the pandemic, we must take action to make sure people are getting the preventive care they need. This bill would help us do this by launching a grant program, public health campaign, and task force to encourage the use of preventive care services,” said Senator Klobuchar. “Following my breast cancer diagnosis earlier this year, this issue is personal to me. While I was fortunate to have caught the cancer at an early stage, that is not the case for many.

https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/maine-delegation-announces-key-step-towards-groundbreaking-new-veterans-mental-health,"WASHINGTON — The Maine delegation announced today that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has awarded a design for a new Substance Abuse Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program (RRTP) building at Togus. The firm Triple C - The A&E Group, LLC will design the project. The new facility was announced last year after dogged work from Congressman Jared Golden (ME-02), along with Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Angus King (I-ME) and Congresswoman Chellie Pingree (ME-01), to advocate for its creation. “Maine veterans who need long-term mental health and substance use care shouldn’t have to travel out of our state and far from their families to get treatment,” the Maine delegation said in a statement. “That’s why we worked hard to push for this new VA facility at Togus. The design award we’re announcing today brings us a big step closer to providing this crucial care to veterans right here where they need it. We’re pleased to see the VA making progress and being responsive to our appeals for urgency.”The new facility was announced in 2020, but was at risk of delay as of April, when new guidance put out by the VA threatened to slow down construction. The delegation repeatedly pushed the VA to stick to an aggressive timeline and to expedite work on the new facility.  Maine veterans in need of long-term mental health and substance use treatment currently have to travel out of state for care and on average wait upwards of 132 days to get into treatment programs. The new facility, the first of its kind in the state, would treat over 300 of these veterans per year, keeping them close to their family and friends and cutting down the wait time to access treatment."
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/collins-casey-introduce-bipartisan-bill-improve-disaster-preparation,"Washington, D.C. – To help improve disaster preparations, U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Bob Casey (D-PA) introduced bipartisan legislation that would correct an undercount in emergency medical services (EMS) personnel. The EMS Counts Act would require the U.S. Department of Labor to collect accurate occupational data on first responders in order to ensure a correct count of EMS personnel across the nation. Under their current classification system, the Department of Labor does not accurately classify firefighters whose primary job is being a paramedic or EMT, leading to a chronic and significant undercount of EMS personnel. Many firefighters whose primary jobs are paramedics or EMTs are undercounted, making it challenging for communities to plan for emergencies and disasters. The EMS Counts Act would rectify this oversight by allowing firefighters to identify themselves as cross-trained EMS providers and paramedics. “Whether an automobile accident, a fire, a health crisis, or another catastrophe, emergency responders are there in those first critical minutes when courage, skill, and compassion are most needed,” said Senator Collins. “Our bipartisan legislation would support these first responders by requiring the Department of Labor to accurately categorize cross-trained providers, such as firefighters whose primary job is being a paramedic. As a senator representing one of the most rural states in the country, I will continue to support the brave men and women who work multiple roles around the clock to protect our communities.” “Emergency medical services personnel and paramedics are on the front lines of emergencies and disasters, making them an absolutely essential workforce,” said Senator Casey. “It is important that we have the most up-to-date information about emergency medical services personnel, especially firefighters who take on multiple roles. This legislation takes an important step to ensure that our EMS personnel are best equipped to carry out their vital missions and our communities are taken care of.” “I thank Senator Casey and Senator Collins for introducing the EMS Counts Act. This bill will better describe America’s fire and EMS workforce. As the nation’s first responders face workforce issues, this legislation will help us to better understand how many firefighters, firefighter/EMTs, firefighter/paramedics, and other types of firefighters serve their communities every day,” said Fire Chief Kenneth Stuebing, President and Board Chair of the International Association of Fire Chiefs. “NAEMT applauds Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) for introducing the EMS Counts Act of 2021. The bill will require the Secretary of Labor to revise the Standard Occupational Classification System to more accurately count the number of Paramedics and EMTs in the United States. This legislation will improve the ability of state and federal government agencies to effectively utilize and support our nation’s EMS workforce in caring for the sick and injured and responding to major disasters, public health crises and mass casualty incidents. We look forward to working with Senators Casey and Collins on this foundational bill. We call on Congress to pass this legislation in short order,” said Bruce Evans, Fire Chief, Upper Pine River Fire Protection District of Bayfield, Colorado and President of the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians. The EMS Counts Act is supported by the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians, International Association of Fire Chiefs, International Association of Fire Fighters, American Ambulance Association, National Association of State EMS Officials, National Association of EMS Physicians, National Association of EMS Educators, International Academy of Emergency Dispatch, National EMS Management Association, National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians and the Association of Air Medical Services. U.S. Representatives Susan Wild (D-PA) and Fred Keller (R-PA) introduced companion legislation in the House. Click HERE to read the bill summary. +++ In June, Senators Collins and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) introduced the Protecting Access to Ground Ambulance Medical Services Act, bipartisan legislation that would ensure that all communities, including rural and underserved areas, have access to quality emergency health care. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senators-collins-smith-introduce-bipartisan-bill-improve-care-americans-serious-mental,"Washington, D.C. – In a bipartisan effort to improve mental health care across the nation, U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Tina Smith (D-MN), members of the Senate Health Committee, introduced the Medicare Mental Health Inpatient Equity Act, legislation that would permanently repeal the Medicare 190-day lifetime limit for inpatient psychiatric care. “During their life, people with serious mental illnesses may need repeated psychiatric inpatient hospital stays to manage their condition and regain quality of life in their community of choice,” said Senator Collins.  “Medicare’s 190-day lifetime cap on inpatient services in psychiatric hospitals can hurt people by arbitrarily ending coverage and can disrupt care from a provider who is most familiar with the patient.  Moreover, when individuals with mental illness cannot receive care in the right setting, they often end up in hospital emergency rooms, in jails, or on the streets—leading to worse long-term outcomes for the individual, more pain and suffering for family members, and a greater cost to the taxpayer.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to bring greater mental health parity to the Medicare program and give those suffering with serious mental illness access to the care they so desperately need.” “Millions of Americans are living with serious and persistent mental health issues and many need ongoing care in an inpatient setting,” said Senator Smith.  “Unfortunately, many of them hit the 190-day lifetime cap on coverage for care before they complete their inpatient treatment, disrupting their care and potentially setting them back.  Our legislation would end this cap and allow them to get the inpatient care they need.” ""The Alliance applauds Senator Collins on her work to enhance our mental health system of care.  The elimination of this 190-day inpatient psychiatric care limit will bring Medicare one step closer to parity in mental health coverage, as well as increase access to care and improve continuity of care for those with serious and persistent mental illness,” said Malory Shaughnessy, Executive Director of Maine Alliance for Addiction and Mental Health Services.  “It is time to change this discriminatory policy and ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receive the care they need and deserve."" “The 190-day lifetime limit on coverage for inpatient psychiatric treatment under Medicare remains an obstacle to parity between behavioral and physical health.  With the nation’s population aging and an increasing number of seniors and people with disabilities seeking inpatient care to address their behavioral health needs, now is the time to repeal this discriminatory policy and ensure Medicare beneficiaries can receive the inpatient psychiatric care they need,” said Stacey Hughes, Executive Vice President of the American Hospital Association.”  The American Hospital Association is grateful for the leadership of Senators Collins and Smith in working to enact this long overdue change.”  “Access to care and elimination of barriers in coverage is an important tenant in preventing suicide. We commend Senator Collins and Senator Smith for introducing the Medicare Mental Health Inpatient Equity Act, which will allow Medicare beneficiaries to receive the parity protections they deserve,” said Laurel Stine, J.D., M.A., Senior Vice President for Public Policy, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. “This important legislation eliminates one of the most discriminatory provisions of federal law. Medicare beneficiaries deserve the protections parity provides.  Eliminating the 190-day lifetime limit ensures our seniors can access the benefits they need and deserve,” said Shawn Coughlin, President and CEO of National Association for Behavioral Healthcare. An estimated 13.1 million adults aged 18 or older in the United States are living with serious mental illness, representing 5.2 percent of all adults nationwide.  These illnesses, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are chronic conditions that require ongoing treatment and care over a lifetime.  When left untreated, they can be some of the most debilitating and destructive illnesses afflicting Americans. The Medicare Mental Health Inpatient Equity Act would remove the 190-day lifetime limit on inpatient psychiatric hospital services under Medicare.  This lifetime limit does not apply to psychiatric units in general hospitals, and no other Medicare inpatient service has these types of arbitrary caps, which is why its elimination was a recommendation of the 2016 White House Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force. Most Medicare beneficiaries treated in psychiatric hospitals qualify because of a disability.  Consequently, the current restriction disproportionately impacts non-elderly Medicare beneficiaries—mainly those living with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder who may be diagnosed at a younger age and stay on Medicare longer as a result.  Sadly, it is young adults aged 18 to 25 years who currently have the highest prevalence of serious mental illness of any age group. The bipartisan legislation is supported by a wide range of organizations, including the American Hospital Association and the Mental Health Liaison Group, which represents a coalition of 57 national organizations including consumer groups and mental health and addiction providers. Click HERE to read the bill text. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/collins-colleagues-introduce-bill-block-democrats%E2%80%99-irs-snooping-proposal,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Susan Collins joined a group of her colleagues in introducing the Prohibiting IRS Financial Surveillance Act, legislation that would prevent the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from implementing Democrats’ plan to give the agency access to Americans’ bank transaction information. “Allowing the IRS to monitor hardworking Americans’ bank accounts is not only an invasion of privacy, but also a vast overreach by the federal government,” said Senator Collins.  “This intrusive measure would grant the IRS access to essentially every American’s financial information.  Our legislation would block the Administration from implementing this terrible proposal.” One of the proposals included in the partisan reconciliation bill currently under consideration would require financial institutions to report to the IRS each and every withdrawal and deposit if the total of all transactions for the year is more than $10,000.  Under this reporting regime, a family whose monthly transactions total just $834 would still be reported to the IRS.  The Joint Committee on Taxation has analyzed the proposal and found that it is likely to impact taxpayers in every income bracket.   The Prohibiting IRS Financial Surveillance Act would bar the IRS from instituting any new requirements that would force financial institutions to report on the account activity of Americans.  It would allow individuals and small businesses to make normal financial transactions without fear of increased and unnecessary scrutiny from the federal government. In addition to Senator Collins, the bill is co-sponsored by Senators Tim Scott (R-SC), Rob Portman (R-OH), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Mitch McConnell (R-KY), John Thune (R-SD), John Barrasso (R-WY), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Roy Blunt (R-MO), John Cornyn (R-TX), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Steve Daines (R-MT), John Kennedy (R-LA), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Richard Shelby (R-AL), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Richard Burr (R-NC), Todd Young (R-IN), John Hoeven (R-ND), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Jim Risch (R-ID), Mike Braun (R-IN), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Mitt Romney (R-UT), James Lankford (R-OK), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Rick Scott (R-FL), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Rand Paul (R-KY), John Boozman (R-AR), Mike Lee (R-UT), and Deb Fischer (R-NE). Click HERE to read the text of the bill. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senator-collins-urges-usda-secretary-help-dairy-farmers-affected-pfas,"Washington, D.C.—U.S. Senator Susan Collins wrote to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack to request an update on the efforts being taken to protect dairy farmers from harmful PFAS chemicals.  PFAS contamination from wastewater sludge that was spread as fertilizer has prevented some Maine farms from selling their products, creating financial hardship for these family farmers and concern among the broader dairy community.  On October 18, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released its PFAS Strategic Roadmap, which details planned actions for that Agency’s work to address PFAS, but it does not address how USDA will assist farmers who have been affected by PFAS contamination. “I raised this issue with you before your confirmation, and again during a Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee hearing in June 2021,” Senator Collins wrote.  “During these conversations, you assured me that PFAS contamination is a high priority for USDA.  Some press reports indicate that USDA is considering changes to the Dairy Indemnity Program to make it easier for farms to recover following the discovery of PFAS, but there has been no action taken thus far.  I am seeking an update from you about USDA’s plans to assist farmers who have experienced PFAS contamination, and how USDA’s actions may fit within EPA’s Roadmap.” “I look forward to receiving this information on behalf of farmers in Maine and across the country whose livelihoods have been disrupted due to PFAS contamination,” Senator Collins continued. PFAS are a class of man-made chemicals—sometimes referred to as “forever chemicals”—that can bioaccumulate in bodies over time.  They are traditionally found in food packaging, nonstick pans, clothing, furniture, and firefighting foam and have been linked to cancer, thyroid disease, liver damage, decreased fertility, and hormone disruption.   In 2016, a dairy farmer in Arundel discovered that the milk produced on his farm contained some of the highest levels ever reported for a PFAS contaminant.  In 2020, a dairy farm in Fairfield found PFAS levels in its milk were 153 times higher than the Maine standard for determining whether it was fit for sale. At an Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee hearing in June, Senator Collins urged Secretary Vilsack to take action to support dairy farmers who have been harmed by PFAS contamination.  Additionally, Senator Collins recently secured $1.6 million in the draft Fiscal Year 2022 Interior Appropriations Bill to support the installation of a PFAS treatment system in Madison.  The facility would accept and treat contaminated manure from dairy farms across the state. Click HERE to read Senator Collins’ letter.###"

She has taught fourth grade at the Gerald Talbot School in Portland for 20 years, instructing a large number of English language learner students.  She also partners with community organizations to teach the fundamentals of STEM and serves as a representative on the Portland Schools Literacy Committee.  Heather Whitaker was named Maine’s 2020 Teacher of the Year by the Maine Department of Education. She has taught alternative education to students with special needs at Gorham Middle School for the past 18 years.  During this time, she started her school’s garden, which donates over 800 pounds of produce for the local food pantry each year.  She also was a founding member of the Gorham BackPack Program, which provides students in her community experiencing chronic hunger with food over the weekend.  ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senator-collins-secures-funding-havana-act-appropriations-bill,"Washington, D.C.—U.S. Senator Susan Collins announced today that she secured funding to implement the HAVANA Act and assist Havana Syndrome victims in the draft Department of Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2022.  She also included committee report language in the Department of State Appropriations bill directing the Department to adequately fund assistance for State Department personnel and their family who have been impacted by Havana Syndrome.  The bills must still be voted on by the full Senate and House.  The HAVANA Act, which was authored by Senator Collins and signed into law on October 8th, authorizes the Director of the CIA and the Secretary of State to provide additional financial support for American public servants who have incurred brain injuries likely from directed energy attacks.  The law requires both the CIA and State Department to create regulations detailing fair and equitable criteria for payments. “U.S. diplomats and members of the intelligence community who work both at home and abroad make many personal sacrifices to represent and protect America’s interests.  They deserve our strong support when they are harmed in the line of duty just as we care for our soldiers when they are injured on the battlefield,” said Senator Collins.  “As the government investigates the source of previous attacks and seeks to prevent future ones, the HAVANA Act I authored will provide critical relief to Americans who are experiencing debilitating symptoms likely caused by a directed energy weapon.  I will continue to push for the full implementation and funding of the HAVANA Act during the ongoing Appropriations process to ensure that victims receive the support they deserve.” Following Senator Collins’ advocacy, the Defense Appropriations bill includes funding to begin making these payments authorized by the HAVANA Act.  In addition, the Department of State Appropriations bill includes report language championed by Senator Collins directing the Secretary of State to adequately fund assistance for Havana Syndrome and detail the Department’s efforts to address the incidents.   The bill stipulates that a report must be given to Congress within 180 days that 1) details the Department of State’s actions to investigate and monitor cases, 2) estimates the number of people who have been afflicted, 3) describes the actions that have been taken to counter these attacks, and 4) provides an update on the personnel and family members who have received support for impacted personnel and family members, including for healthcare needs. “Havana Syndrome” is the term given to an illness that surfaced among more than 40 U.S. Embassy staff in Havana, Cuba, beginning in 2016.  Since then, upwards of 200 intelligence community personnel, State Department employees, and others have reportedly been afflicted with symptoms that a study by the National Academy of Sciences found are consistent with the effects of directed, pulsed, radiofrequency energy.  Symptoms have included severe headaches, dizziness, tinnitus, visual and hearing problems, vertigo, and cognitive difficulties, and many affected personnel continue to suffer from health problems years after the attacks.   ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/collins-king-co-sponsor-legislation-support-family-caregivers,"Washington, D.C. –U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Angus King (I-ME) joined a bipartisan effort to provide working family caregivers in Maine and across the country with a tax credit of up to $5,000 to assist with out-of-pocket caregiving expenses. The Credit for Caring Act that Senators Collins and King co-sponsored would provide relief for those who are taking on added financial responsibilities as family caregivers supporting a loved one.  The nonrefundable tax credit could be used toward expenses such as transportation, home modifications to accommodate a family member, medication management services, and training or education for the caregiver.  Senator King previously cosponsored the measure in the 115th and 116th Congresses. According to AARP, there are approximately 180,000 family caregivers in Maine who provide $2.2 billion in uncompensated care annually to their loved ones.  Nationally, family caregivers provide $470 billion in unpaid care.  “Millions of Americans devote enormous time and attention and make many personal and financial sacrifices to ensure that their loved ones have the high-quality care they need day in and day out.  These individuals know all too well the compassion, commitment, and endurance that it takes to be a caregiver and help loved ones remain in the comfort and safety of their own homes,” said Senator Collins.  “This legislation would support family caregivers by easing the financial burdens that many face.” “The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted just how vital Maine’s family caregivers are to our communities – especially our seniors,” said Senator King. “These homecare providers allow vulnerable citizens to continue living in the comfort of their own homes. This work isn’t easy, requiring caregivers to give their own time and money – which is why we should help them make ends meet. By easing the financial strain on these family caregivers who already sacrifice so much, we can let these local heroes focus their time and energy on helping the ones they love. I’m thrilled to be part of this bipartisan effort, and hope this bill can provide real relief to working families across the state and country.” “AARP thanks Senators Collins and King for cosponsoring the Credit for Caring Act and recognizing America’s over 48 million family caregivers are the backbone of this country’s care system. Family caregivers help save taxpayer dollars by delaying or preventing expensive nursing home care. The Credit for Caring Act will help offset some of the more than $7,200 that family caregivers typically spend out-of-pocket each year on care-related expenses,” said Noël Bonam, AARP Maine State Director. The Credit for Caring Act would create up to a $5,000 nonrefundable tax credit adjusted to inflation for family caregivers. The amount of the credit would be 30 percent of the qualified expenses paid or incurred by the family caregiver above $2,000, up to a maximum credit amount of $5,000. Under the bill, qualifying care recipients must have been certified by a health care practitioner to be in need of long-term care for at least 180 consecutive days.  Eligibility is limited to a caregiver of a qualified care recipient who must pay for caregiving expenses and has earned income in excess of $7,500.  Credit is phased out when income exceeds $150,000 for joint filers or $75,000 for individual filers. The bill was introduced by Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senator-collins-visits-corinna-fire-department,"Corinna, ME – Today, U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a co-chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, visited both the current and future sites of the Corinna Fire Station.  The station will be relocated to a larger, town-owned site that will ensure the station is able to meet the town and surrounding communities’ emergency and safety needs.  Senator Collins was joined by representatives from the fire department and the town. Senator Collins secured $1.725 million for the project in the Agriculture Appropriations bill, which passed the Appropriations Committee by a vote of 25-5 in August.  As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, she is continuing to advocate for this funding through the ongoing appropriations process. “The Corinna Fire Department plays a critical role in protecting lives and property in the town and surrounding communities,” said Senator Collins.  “I enjoyed speaking with Corinna firefighters and town leaders today about how the new, modern fire station will enhance their ability to respond to emergencies.  As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I strongly advocated on Corinna’s behalf to include this critical project in the funding bill, and I will continue to champion this investment as the process moves forward.” The Corinna Fire Department serves the towns of Corinna and Exeter and has mutual aid agreements with multiple surrounding towns. Corinna's roster maintains 35 on-call firefighters and responds to an average of over 100 calls per year. The current Corinna Fire Station is small, crowded, and in need of repair, making it difficult for the fire department to operate at peak effectiveness.  The proposed new location that was donated to the Town of Corinna has an existing structure that can be re-commissioned as a fire station.  Through the decades, Corinna has invested in infrastructure and equipment, including a new fire truck last year.  This important infrastructure conversion will support all fire apparatuses Corinna currently owns and will benefit the town through reduced maintenance costs.               ###"

I will continue to champion this funding as the appropriations process moves forward.” “Without affordable, accessible, and quality childcare entire segments of our community are removed from employment or education opportunities – holding back families from becoming financial stable and shrinking our workforce,” said Liz Cotter Schlax, President & CEO, United Way of Southern Maine.  “The pandemic has shone a spotlight on the fragility of our childcare system and exacerbated the extreme need in Southern Maine. This federal support could not come at a more crucial time, and we thank Senator Collins for her leadership in securing $95,000 to enable six entrepreneurs to open new childcare businesses, which will support more than 70 children and their families.”  If the Fiscal Year Financial Services bill is enacted into law, this funding will help United Way of Southern Maine to expand their Childcare Workforce and Entrepreneurship Initiative, which helps new childcare entrepreneurs successfully navigate their journey, with the necessary support, training, technical assistance, and financial investment to open their own childcare business.  ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senators-collins-king-announce-maine-locations-2021-drug-take-back-day-0,"Washington, D.C. – Ahead of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency’s (DEA) National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day this Saturday, October 23rd, U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Angus King (I-ME) announced the locations of the Maine collection sites. “Unused prescription drugs that collect in our homes can fall into the wrong hands, creating unintended gateways to opioid addiction, particularly as we continue to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement. “Maine is one of the top 10 states that have disposed the most prescriptions through the DEA’s Drug Take-Back Program, and we are confident that our state will continue to lead efforts to stop the misuse of unused drugs that pose a serious threat to our children, our homes, and our environment.” National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day aims to provide a safe, convenient, and responsible means of disposing prescription drugs, while also educating the general public about the potential for abuse of medications. In 2020, the collection sites began accepting vaping devices and associated substances. At a previous Take-Back Event in April 2021, federal, state, and local government entities took back more than 839,000 pounds of unused, expired, or unwanted drugs at more than 5,000 locations across the United States. Over the course of the program, more than 14.5 million pounds of prescription drugs have been safely collected across the country, including nearly 480,000 pounds of medication in Maine alone. Federal regulations allow pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, and other authorized collectors to serve as collection points for unused prescription medication. In 2014, following a bipartisan effort led by Senators Collins and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), the Department of Justice granted the Departments of Defense (DoD) and Veterans Affairs (VA) the ability to participate in prescription drug take-back programs at DoD and VA facilities. This initiative has helped to address the role of prescription drug abuse in many military and veteran suicides. In 2018, a sweeping opioids package known as the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act was signed into law. Senator Collins, a member of the Senate Health Committee, authored two provisions included in the final legislation that will help to ensure that unused prescription drugs do not fall into the wrong hands and to bolster peer support networks for long-term recovery. The legislation also included provisions championed by Senator Collins and Senator King to expand opioid treatment capabilities, including a permanent authorization for nurse practitioners and physicians assistants to provide medication-assisted treatment and removing an arbitrary limit to allow residential treatment facilities to expand their efforts to save lives. Click HERE for the complete list of locations. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/maine-delegation-and-governor-mills-urge-commerce-secretary-rescind-right-whale-rule-and,"Washington, D.C. –Following the U.S. District Court of Maine’s order blocking the Lobster Management Area (LMA) 1 restricted area closure, which is a component of the National Marine Fisheries Service’s (NMFS) flawed and unfair Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Rule, U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King, Representatives Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden, and Governor Janet Mills sent a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.  In their bipartisan letter, the Maine Delegation and Governor Mills applauded the U.S. District Court of Maine’s decision halting the enforcement of the LMA 1 closure and urged Secretary Raimondo to use her authorities to immediately resolve the rule’s many shortcomings. “Throughout the rulemaking process, we have raised concerns expressed by Maine’s lobstermen and other industry stakeholders about the flawed and incomplete data upon which the final rule ultimately relied. Moreover, NMFS’s decision to impose a sudden fisheries closure will cause irreparable harm to the industry, while doing little to achieve meaningful protections for the right whale population,” Maine’s Congressional Delegation and Governor Mills wrote. “In light of the District Court’s order and the many flaws with the rule, particularly with respect to the LMA 1 closure, we urge you rescind the rule and resolve these issues.” “We fully agree with the Court’s determination that ‘the record presented thus far does not indicate that right whales actually congregate in or pass through the LMA 1 Restricted Area with nearly enough frequency to render it a ‘hotspot’ for whale and buoy line co-occurrence, contrary to the agency’s characterization,” Maine’s Congressional Delegation and Governor Mills continued. “The District Court’s decision is a sound and welcome development, and underscores the many shortcomings with the Agency’s final rule. We urge you to withdraw this rule and to use whatever authorities you have to immediately resolve the LMA 1 restricted area component, which does not reflect the reality of the conditions in the Gulf of Maine.” The letter underscored many of the shortcomings of NMFS’ rule that were pointed out in the District Court’s decision, such as: ·         NMFS’ predictive models forecast very low-percentages of right whale presence during the closure period. ·         Prior area closures imposed elsewhere by NMFS have been designed to coincide with the actual presence of right whales and have relied on predictable whale aggregations in specific areas and seasons. ·         NMFS’ own data – or lack thereof in some instances – support the conclusion that right whales are present in the Northern Gulf of Maine less and less frequently as waters warm and the species’ primary food source moves further offshore and northward into colder Canadian waters. ·         The record of known entanglements and vessel strike cases between 2010 and 2019 includes zero known incidents in LMA 1, which means there is sparse evidence to support an immediate and preemptive closure of this area. +++ The Maine Delegation and Governor Mills have been steadfastly opposed to undue burdens that would threaten the lobster fishery – an important economic driver for Maine – but which do not meaningfully protect whales.  Following the release of the final rule in late August, the Maine Delegation and Governor Mills issued a statement in opposition to the rule and highlighting the Maine lobster fishery’s record of repeatedly making significant improvements to their practices and modifications to their gear to protect right whales.   They previously wrote to Commerce Secretary Raimondo, urging her to oppose last-minute changes to this rule that would significantly harm the livelihoods of communities that depend on fishing and lobstering without meaningfully protecting whales. The Delegation also urged both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump to act on their pledges to protect lobstermen’s livelihoods, citing the lack of data to support claims that the lobster fishery presents an extreme risk to whales compared to other marine activities such as ship strikes.  Governor Mills has repeatedly stood up for Maine’s vital lobster industry and its working men and women in the face of the Federal government’s right whale proposal. Last year, she wrote to the Commerce Department urging it to deny a petition by Pew Charitable Trusts that asks for three seasonal offshore closures in the Gulf of Maine and that would prohibit the use of vertical lines in the American lobster and Jonah crab fisheries in four areas of the New England coast. The Maine Delegation sent a similar letter in opposition to the Pew petition. She also filed comments with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the draft Biological Opinion for ten fishery management plans in the Greater Atlantic Region, focusing on the North Atlantic Right Whale, expressing “grave concern” and warning it will be economically devastating and will fundamentally change Maine’s lobster fishery.  The Governor also filed for, and was granted, intervenor status in the pending litigation Center for Biological Diversity v. Ross in the U.S. District Court in the D.C. Circuit. If decided in the plaintiff’s favor, the lawsuit could close the Maine lobster fishery altogether. Governor Mills sent a letter to Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo urging swift action by NOAA Fisheries to reduce the unnecessary economic harm to Maine fishermen that the recently announced Federal whale protection rule will cause. Click HERE to read the full letter. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/collins-king-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-prevent-servicemember-suicide,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Angus King (I-Maine) have joined a bipartisan group of their Senate colleagues to introduce the Save Our Servicemembers (S.O.S.) Act, which would work to improve Department of Defense suicide prevention efforts. The legislation – which comes shortly after an alarming report revealed a 15% increase in military suicides in 2020 – would direct the Pentagon to evaluate the effectiveness of their suicide prevention efforts, improve its data collection, reduce bureaucratic duplication, and strengthen collaboration between its offices.  “America’s servicemembers have made extraordinary sacrifices for our nation – they embraced the call to serve and put their lives on the line to protect our country. Now, we have an obligation to serve these men and women with the same dedication that they served us,” said Senator Collins and King. “With military suicides rising at an alarming pace in 2020, too many in our armed forces are fighting yet another battle – and this time, they need our help. We need to do everything in our power to address this worsening crisis, and that starts with improving the Department of Defense’s prevention efforts. The Save Our Servicemembers Act is important, bipartisan legislation that will help ensure that our heroes can access the mental health resources they deserve and that no servicemember is left without the support we owe them.” This past spring, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a nonpartisan watchdog agency, released the findings of a review of the Department of Defense’s (DOD) suicide prevention programs. The report identified three areas that DOD should address to improve suicide prevention efforts. The S.O.S. Act directs DOD to implement those GAO recommendations, which include: ·         Assessing DOD’s individual non-clinical prevention efforts to determine their effectiveness.·         Improving DOD’s data collection by reducing duplication and developing consistent suicide-related definitions to be used department-wide. This is in response to concerns that inconsistent definitions could be impeding the ability to access and improve prevention programs.·         Strengthening collaboration between Pentagon offices, specifically between the Defense Suicide Prevention Office (DSPO) and the Psychological Health Center of Excellence on the production of the annual suicide reports, to minimize duplication of efforts. The S.O.S. Act is cosponsored by a bipartisan group of over 30 senators, and is supported by the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and the American Legion. As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Collins has consistently supported robust funding for mental health services in the Department of Veterans Affairs. The fiscal year 2022 Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill, which advanced out of the Appropriations Committee in August, included $13.2 billion for mental health, including $2.3 billion for suicide prevention and $256 million for the Veterans Crisis Line. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator King has worked to prevent servicemember and veteran suicide, and suicide nationwide. Last year, the Senate unanimously passed legislation cosponsored by Senator King that will designate 9-8-8 as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Veterans Crisis line.

https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/collins-king-urge-hhs-prioritize-rural-health-care-providers%E2%80%99-access-critical-federal,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Angus King (I-ME) joined Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Jon Tester (D-MT), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), and Michael Bennet (D-CO) in calling on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to protect rural health care providers’ access to funds set aside for them in the Provider Relief Fund (PRF). In their bipartisan letter, they urge the agencies to follow Congressional intent behind language included in the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) – which was passed in March  – approving applications for rural funding only for those providers that meet the clear statutory definition of ‘rural provider.’  During consideration of the FY2021 budget resolution, an amendment Senator Collins authored with Senator Manchin to strengthen the PRF was adopted by a vote of 99-1.  In September, following a successful push led by Senators Collins and Shaheen and joined by Senator King, HHS began distributing the remaining PRF funding to health care providers. “The COVID-19 pandemic has had disproportionate impacts on rural communities, which were already experiencing staffing shortages and financial difficulties before COVID-19,” wrote the Senators. “In addition, rural communities are home to more vulnerable populations that are on average older, face higher rates of chronic health conditions and broadly lack access to the high-quality, affordable health care services that residents of urban areas enjoy.” “Despite this obvious need, rural providers are often excluded from accessing federal funds by flawed definitions of ‘rural’ that are used by the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP) to determine whether entities are eligible to receive rural health grants from HRSA,” the Senators continued.   To address this oversight, lawmakers negotiated language with the Biden Administration in the ARPA that more clearly defined the definition of a ‘rural provider’ and noted that certain facilities located in metropolitan areas with smaller populations that serve rural patients are not required to be classified as rural providers, which can help ensure more frontline health care facilities located in rural areas are able to access this critical funding.  The Senators concluded by urging HHS to consider Congressional intent for the ARPA-Rural fund when approving applications for this funding to ensure rural health care providers have the resources they need to remain in the fight against COVID-19.  Click HERE to read the full letter. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senator-collins-secures-funding-additional-ddg-51-defense-appropriations-bill,"Washington, D.C.—U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, announced that the draft fiscal year (FY) 2022 Defense Appropriations Bill includes funding for which she strongly advocated to construct two DDG-51 destroyers.  The legislation, which still must be voted on by the full Senate and House, provides $3.68 billion, $1.66 billion above what was sought in the Department’s budget request, for DDG-51 construction.  The Navy identified the restoration of the DDG-51 cut from the budget as its number one unfunded priority, indicating the Navy still believes it requires the ship, but budgetary constraints forced the service to prioritize other programs in its formal budget request.  This additional funding would reverse the administration’s flawed proposal to cut the construction of a destroyer from the FY 2022 budget and break the Navy’s current multiyear contract.  Moreover, the bill includes $120 million for DDG-51 advanced procurement, which was not included the in the Department’s budget request.  “The administration's proposal to reduce defense funding in real terms and eliminate the procurement of a DDG-51 was not only unwise, but dangerous, particularly given China’s military buildup and aggressive actions in the Pacific,” said Senator Collins.  “In addition, cutting the construction of a destroyer could have created an imminent workload cliff for Bath Iron Works, which could have led to a loss of jobs and a setback in productivity gains. “This funding I championed for two DDG-51 destroyers will help keep our nation safe.  DDGs are the workhorse of the Navy, and the Flight IIIs will be the most capable ships in the world,” Senator Collins continued.  “As the appropriations process moves forward, I will continue to prioritize our nation’s shipbuilding programs and support BIW workers.” The Office of Naval Intelligence estimated that the Chinese Navy had about 360 ships in 2020, and China is expected to have a 400-ship fleet in 2025.  Today, the United States Navy has 294 battle force ships. +++ This year, Senator Collins has hosted Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro, Former-Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Harker and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Mike Gilday in Maine so that they could see firsthand the important work being done at Bath Iron Works. As a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Collins has strongly pushed back against the Administration’s proposal to cut funding for destroyers.  Following reports that fiscal year 2022 budget request would propose procuring only one DDG-51, the Maine Delegation wrote to President Biden to emphasize their opposition to this plan.  After the release of President Biden’s budget request, the Maine Delegation released a statement underscoring their commitment to increasing procurement for DDG-51s.  In March, Senator Collins co-led a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks urging them to support a robust shipbuilding budget. In separate hearings in June, she urged Secretary Austin as well as Secretary Harker and Admiral Gilday to reverse the proposal to cut a Navy destroyer.    Earlier this year, Congresswoman Chellie Pingree, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, secured funding for the construction of an additional destroyer in the House Defense Appropriations bill. ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/funding-portsmouth-naval-shipyard-infrastructure-projects-secured-senator-collins,"Washington, D.C.—U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, announced today that the fiscal year (FY) 2022 Defense funding bill included an additional $180 million above the President’s request for facilities improvements at public shipyards, including Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNSY) in Kittery.  The bill must still be voted on by the full Senate and House. With Senator Collins’ support, an additional $510 million above what was requested in the Department of Defense’s budget request is provided for maintaining and modernizing facilities across the Navy, which includes $180 million specifically for restoration and modernization projects at the Navy’s four public shipyards identified in the Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Program (SIOP).  The SIOP is the Navy’s 20-year investment plan for infrastructure investments needed to modernize the nation’s public shipyards. In addition to public shipyard infrastructure investments, Senator Collins secured report language that directs the Navy to induct a class of no fewer than 100 apprentices at each of the Navy’s four public shipyards. Senator Collins champions this provision annually. “The significant investments this legislation makes in our public shipyards, including Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, are essential to maintaining our Navy fleet and enhancing our national security.  I have long advocated for the Navy to address the modernization needs at PNSY, and this legislation will help build on funding I have previously secured for critical upgrades,” said Senator Collins.  “Additionally, I am pleased that the bill includes language I championed to support the Navy’s apprenticeship program.  PNSY has trained hundreds of hardworking and skilled shipbuilders through this program, which has helped it remain the gold standard among the nation’s public shipyards.” This funding in the Defense Appropriations bill builds upon funding Senator Collins previously secured for infrastructure upgrades at PNSY, including the $475 million for PNSY’s Dry Dock #1 project in the FY 2022 Military Construction funding bill that advanced out of the Appropriations Committee in August.  Senator Collins also secured report language to that bill which pushes the Navy to continue to prioritize timely funding of the SIOP.  ###"
https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senators-collins-burr-press-cdc-fda-insufficient-data-efficacy-covid-19-vaccines,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Richard Burr (R-NC) wrote a letter to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock asking for more data on the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines, particularly with respect to breakthrough cases. The Senators acknowledged that the CDC has started to make some additional information available in tracking the rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths by vaccination status and vaccine product. However, they noted that data on hospitalizations by vaccine product remain unavailable to the public. In addition, they emphasized that only a handful of public health departments appear to be reporting information on breakthrough cases that result in hospitalizations or death to the CDC. “We have heard from vaccinated health care professionals, seniors, and individuals who are immunocompromised or have certain chronic conditions who have questions about the data surrounding serious breakthrough infections and how the different vaccine products compare in protecting against hospitalizations and deaths,” the Senators wrote. “They also have questions about how these data have informed the recent FDA and CDC announcements on booster shots and how they will be taken into account on recommendations on the mixing and matching of vaccines.” “At a time when there has already been public confusion on the decision making process around boosters, it is crucial that the CDC and FDA be trusted sources of accessible information on the efficacy of the three vaccines,” the Senators concluded. “The public would benefit from more robust data on which vaccine was received by fully vaccinated individuals who are hospitalized due to a breakthrough case, in addition to more data overall on breakthrough cases.” The Senators asked CDC Director Walensky and FDA Acting Commissioner Woodcock: ·         Do the CDC and FDA collect nationwide data on which vaccine was received by fully vaccinated individuals who nevertheless contract COVID-19 and are hospitalized? o   If not, what are the barriers to collecting and disseminating this vital information?  ·         Are there limitations on the ability of the CDC and FDA to make such data publicly available? ·         How are the CDC and FDA assessing trends in breakthrough infections and the variant or variants that are resulting in such breakthroughs? Click HERE to read the full letter. ###"

The mutual trust between our police force and the local community can be further strengthened by using body cameras,” said Senator Collins. “The Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office will use this funding to purchase these critical tools, helping to keep our brave law enforcement officers and the local communities they serve safe. I will continue to champion this funding as the appropriations process moves forward.” ###"
