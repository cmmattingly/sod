https://www.hawley.senate.gov/new-hawley-bill-empower-states-deport-illegal-immigrants-protect-american-communities,"Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the Empowering States to Deport Illegal Immigrants Act, new legislation that will give authority for states to enforce federal immigration laws and prosecute anyone who illegally enters the country that is residing in their state. With a rise in illegal drug trafficking and a surge in illegal border crossings over the past year, this bill will help protect American families and communities.

Due to the Biden Administration’s disastrous immigration policies, the United States is experiencing an unprecedented wave of illegal immigration. In 2022, there were more than 2 million border encounters, up nearly 470% since 2020. This does not account for illegal immigrants who entered our country without being encountered by Customs and Border Protection. Democrats fought hard to end President Trump’s Remain-in-Mexico policy, and doing so has contributed to a rise in crime, drug trafficking, and human trafficking across the southern border into the United States. 

“The Biden Administration’s extreme open border policies have had a devastating effect on the people of Missouri and the entire country. States have had limited ability to fight back during this period of record-breaking illegal border crossings. My bill would finally give states the ability to enforce federal immigration law and deport illegal immigrants. If Joe Biden won’t secure the border, then it’s time to give states the power to do it,” said Senator Hawley.

The Honorable Merrick Garland Attorney General United States Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20530 Dear Attorney General Garland: If the shocking reports about the FBI arresting a man Friday in rural Pennsylvania are true, then you have a lot to answer for. These reports state that federal authorities obtained a warrant under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act to arrest Mark Houck for allegedly committing a single count of simple assault by pushing a man near an abortion clinic. Houck contends that he only did so to defend his child against the man, and local authorities have already dismissed a separate criminal complaint against Houck for the same conduct. Not only did your office turn a local dispute into a national case, but the FBI reportedly executed the search warrant in as extreme a manner as one can imagine. Reports state that the FBI sent as many as 20 to 25 agents to conduct the arrest. And the FBI allegedly arrested Houck at gunpoint early in the morning in front of his seven children. The FBI admitted, in a statement, that as many as 20 agents were present with their guns drawn. As Houck’s wife said, when they saw 20 or more agents arrest their father at gunpoint, “the kids were all just screaming.” To say the least, using this kind of force to make an arrest for a single charge of simple assault is unprecedented. The reports are especially shocking given that your office has so far turned a blind eye to the epidemic of violence across the country by pro-abortion extremists against pregnancy resource centers, houses of worship, and pro-life Americans—violent acts that are prohibited by the very same law under which you are charging Mark Houck. One group reports 104 incidents of extremist violence against pregnancy resource centers, churches, and pro-life Americans since the leak of the Supreme Court draft opinion on May 3.1 Those attacks include fire-bombings and arsons. Just last week, an 83-year-old woman was shot while engaging in pro-life activism.2 Despite my repeated requests, you still have not identified a single prosecution the Department of Justice has taken in response to this epidemic of violence against pro-life Americans. All of this comes after more than a year of your office repeatedly weaponizing the FBI and other arms of the federal government against political opponents. If you are trying to inspire confidence in your department, you are failing magnificently. I believe you must testify, under oath, before the Senate Judiciary Committee about your selective use and apparent political weaponization of the FACE Act. In addition, within 10 days, please provide answers to the following questions:Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Mr. Sundar Pichai 
Chief Executive Officer 
Google, LLC 
1600 Amphitheater Parkway 
Mountain View, CA 94043 

Dear Mr. Pichai: 

As part of their mission, pregnancy resource centers in my home state of Missouri seek to reach women considering abortion, in order to offer both alternatives to abortion and support during and after their pregnancies. That outreach takes a number of forms, including online ad campaigns focused on a number of abortion-related search terms. 

But recently, your company appears to have throttled that outreach. Following steep declines in online traffic to their sites, they sought further information—and documentation provided to my office indicates that some of their ads now “aren’t eligible to show for keywords that relate to restricted products or services.” To be clear, those are your company’s words, not mine. I am concerned that, in the name of providing “clarity” in search results, your company is deliberately limiting pregnancy resource centers’ outreach efforts. 

By doing so, Google has joined the far left’s campaign to punish pregnancy resource centers, following the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization earlier this year. When those attacks first began to materialize, 17 state Attorneys General wrote to you to stress that “Google’s search results must not be subject to left-wing political pressure, which would actively harm women seeking essential assistance.” 

Yet your company doesn’t seem to have heeded that warning. Just two months ago, Sen. Mark Warner bragged that Democrats had successfully partnered with Google: as he put it, “Soon, those who search for ‘abortion clinics near me’ will only see facilities that have been verified to provide abortions in the local search box on Google, meaning that far fewer women will be mistakenly led to ‘crisis pregnancy centers[.]’” Apparently, numerous pregnancy resource centers across Missouri have now fallen victim to this smear campaign. 

It strikes me as vanishingly unlikely that your company would impose similar restrictions on other advertisers offering “substitute goods.” And the consequences of this unequal treatment will be grim: mothers and infants deterred from accessing crucial support in their time of need. That outcome is unacceptable. 

Please provide my office with responses to the following questions as soon as possible: 

1. Has Google adopted a general policy restricting the range of advertising keywords available to pregnancy resource centers, or other organizations that seek to reach individuals considering abortion by offering relevant alternatives to the procedure in question? 

2. When and how often are individual organizations seeking to target abortion-related keywords required to undergo Google’s “certification” process? 

I look forward to your reply. 

Sincerely, 
Josh Hawley

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-calls-release-investigation-dod-denial-vax-mandate-religious-exemptions,"Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to Department of Defense (DoD) Acting Inspector General Sean O’Donnell calling on him to release all information related to his office’s investigation into DoD’s refusal to grant servicemembers religious exemptions to DoD’s Covid vaccine mandate.

On June 2, 2022, Inspector General O’Donnell’s office reportedly sent Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin a memo raising serious concerns about DoD’s processes for reviewing servicemembers’ requests for religious exemptions. Thousands of servicemembers filed for religious exemptions but DoD reportedly only approved a fraction of the requests.

“Servicemembers commit their lives to the defense of our nation. As part of that compact, they are assured they will have the right to petition the Department of Defense for exemptions to certain requirements that violate their sincerely held religious beliefs. The Department’s apparent failure to honor that compact is a betrayal of those servicemembers’ trust. It also endangers our nation’s defense by forcing servicemembers and those considering joining the military to question whether this is really an institution to which they are comfortable dedicating their lives,” wrote Senator Hawley.

Senator Hawley requested Inspector General O’Donnell provide the Senate Armed Services Committee with the June 2 memo, all material associated with the investigation described in the memo, and any response received from Secretary Austin or his staff, by Sept. 30, 2022.

September 22, 2022 

Sean O’Donnell 
Acting Inspector General 
Office of Inspector General 
U.S. Department of Defense 
4800 Mark Center Drive 
Alexandria, VA 22350-1500 

Dear Mr. O’Donnell, 

I write to request information regarding the Office of the Inspector General’s investigation into how the U.S. military handled servicemembers’ requests for religious exemptions to the COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Public reporting this week is cause for serious concern that the Biden Administration has not reviewed such requests in a fair and lawful manner. 

A public report states that you sent a memo to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on June 2, 2022, raising concerns about the military services’ processes for adjudicating religious exemption requests.[i] According to the report, you wrote, “We found a trend of generalized assessments rather than the individualized assessment that is required by Federal law and DoD and Military Service policies…. Some of the appellate decisions included documentation that demonstrated a greater consideration of facts and circumstances involved in a request.” You reportedly went on to inform the Secretary: 

“The volume and rate at which decisions were made to deny requests is concerning…. Assuming a 10-hour workday with no breaks or attention to other matters, the average review period was about 12 minutes for each package. Such a review period seems insufficient to process each request in an individualized manner and still perform the duties required of their position.” 

These findings are alarming. If true, not only do they suggest that the military services failed to satisfy all legal and regulatory obligations when reviewing servicemembers’ requests for religious exemptions to the COVID-19 vaccine mandate. They also raise very serious concerns about the Office of the Secretary of Defense’s apparent failure to promulgate or enforce lawful guidance for reviewing such requests. This is not to mention concerns about Department leaders’ apparent attempt to conceal these failures. Indeed, it is not lost on me that you reportedly sent this memo on June 2, yet Congress is only now learning of it. 

Servicemembers commit their lives to the defense of our nation. As part of that compact, they are assured they will have the right to petition the Department of Defense for exemptions to certain requirements that violate their sincerely held religious beliefs. The Department’s apparent failure to honor that compact is a betrayal of those servicemembers’ trust. It also endangers our nation’s defense by forcing servicemembers and those considering joining the military to question whether this is really an institution to which they are comfortable dedicating their lives. This implication is particularly concerning now as the U.S. military struggles to meet recruiting goals. 

Given the stakes at hand, it falls upon Congress to investigate how the U.S. military handled requests for religious exemptions. To that end, please provide the June 2 memo and all material associated with the investigation described in the June 2 memo to the Senate Armed Services Committee no later than September 30. Please modify such material only as required to safeguard servicemembers’ identities or other protected information. Please also provide any response from the Secretary or his staff to the June 2 memo. This material will allow the committee to conduct all appropriate oversight, including hearings. 

Thank you for your cooperation on this important matter.

The Hon. Alejandro Mayorkas 
Secretary 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave SE 
Washington, D.C. 20528 

Secretary Mayorkas,

I write with alarm over record-setting levels of illegal immigration into our country. According to your own department’s statistics, Customs & Border Protection agents have now encountered over 2 million illegal immigrants crossing our southern border this fiscal year. This is substantially higher than last year’s record 1.7 million encounters, and the year is still not even over. This number represents more than a four-fold increase in illegal immigration compared to FY 2020. And these are only the official statistics, which fail to capture the many got-aways who evaded detection. After two years on the job, you have demonstrated that you have no intention of enforcing our immigration laws. 

Your total abdication of responsibility to secure the border has consequences. It has resulted in a record 78 individuals on a terror watchlist entering our country this year alone. And those are only the ones we know about. 

Those entering our country are also smuggling lethal drugs, like fentanyl, that are destroying our communities. In my state of Missouri, the leading cause of death among adults ages 18 to 44 is drug overdose—and 70% of these deaths involve opioids. As I recently wrote to the Drug Enforcement Administration, we are now seeing the proliferation of so-called rainbow fentanyl, specifically manufactured to resemble candy and appeal to children and teenagers. These drug cartels apparently believe they are clear to operate at our southern border. 

One year ago, on September 21, 2021, you testified under oath before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, in response to my questioning, that “We have a plan, we our executing on our plan, and we will continue to do so.” You went so far as to say your plan “is in fact working.” At the time, our country was experiencing 200,000 illegal immigrant encounters per month. I asked you whether you considered this a “success.” Now, we have already eclipsed last year’s records. So let me ask you again, exactly one year later, was this your plan? Do you consider 2 million illegal immigrants crossing our border to be a success? 

Sadly, I think you do. This was the predictable result of your open border policies. Your intentional disregard for our country’s immigration laws makes you unfit to remain in office. You should resign. 

Sincerely,  

Josh Hawley

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-introduces-new-legislation-hold-universities-accountable-rising-tuition-costs-and-student,"Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the Make the Universities Pay Act -- new legislation to reform the nation’s higher education financing system and put universities on the hook for the creditworthiness of future student loans and the debt of students who default.

College tuition increases consistently outpace the rise of inflation, the nation’s student loan debt balance has skyrocketed to almost $2 trillion, and lackluster student performance calls into serious question whether ballooning costs and indebtedness are worth the investment: only about half of college enrollees complete a degree within six years.

“For decades, universities have amassed billion-dollar endowments while teaching nonsense like men can get pregnant. All while charging extortionary tuition,"" said Senator Hawley. ""Now Joe Biden wants to give away another $1 trillion to prop up the system. That’s wrong. Instead, it’s time to put universities on the hook and give students the information they need to make informed decisions.”

On August 24, 2022, President Biden announced a series of executive actions on student loan debt. These actions usurp authorities given to Congress in the Constitution, constitute an estimated $1 trillion wealth transfer from those who have attended college to the majority of Americans who have not, and lack much-needed reforms to the nation’s broken higher education financing system.Senator Hawley’s Make the Universities Pay Act will:

Janet Yellen
Secretary
U.S. Department of the Treasury
1500 Pennsylvania Ave, NW 
Washington, DC 20220 

Dear Secretary Yellen, 

I write with alarm about recent reports that actors in China have repeatedly accessed the data of U.S. citizens who used the social media app TikTok. Last week, the Chief Operating Officer of TikTok testified in response to my questions that TikTok indeed has engineers in China who are able to access American user data and that the company has taken no measures to ensure that the employees in China accessing this data are not members of the Chinese Communist Party. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which you chair, should require TikTok to sever all ties from Chinese companies. TikTok should be entirely divested from ByteDance.

I have long warned about this problem. As I explained during a hearing I chaired on this issue in 2020, “TikTok is owned by a Chinese company that includes Chinese Communist Party members in leadership, and it is required by Chinese law to share user data with Beijing. TikTok has admitted that it has sent user data to China. To put it bluntly, this is a major security risk for the American people.”

TikTok has responded by saying that it no longer sends data to China. TikTok says, “We store all TikTok US user data in the United States,” and in sworn testimony before a Senate subcommittee, TikTok executive Michael Beckerman quoted a Citizen Lab report that said, “In our testing, TikTok did not contact any servers within China.” 

Subsequent reports paint a different picture: TikTok is in fact sending data on Americans to China, where it is vulnerable to spying by the Chinese Communist government. BuzzFeed News reported that at least “nine different TikTok employees” have “indicat[ed] that engineers in China had access to US data between September 2021 and January 2022.” Leaked recordings indicate that “Everything is seen in China,” including by one Beijing-based engineer who “has access to everything.” The report concluded that “the company may have misled lawmakers, its users, and the public by downplaying that data stored in the US could still be accessed by employees in China.”

Last week, I questioned TikTok COO Vanessa Pappas during her testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Contrary to TikTok’s previous statements, Ms. Pappas acknowledged that TikTok has employees based in China who do access users’ data. She also said that TikTok takes no steps to prevent employees accessing this data from being members of the Chinese Communist Party.

This shocking testimony calls for action. I am therefore writing to you to exercise your responsibilities as Chair of CFIUS to ensure that the Chinese company ByteDance fully divests TikTok and that TikTok sever any connections with any other Chinese company. President Trump issued an order requiring divestiture in August 2020, but President Biden declined to enforce it when he took office. That was a mistake. Fortunately, it is not too late for a correction.

I am copying Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan so the FTC can determine whether TikTok has violated federal laws, including by engaging in “unfair or deceptive acts or practices.”

Thank you for your prompt attention to this important matter. 

Sincerely, 

Josh Hawley

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-rubio-colleagues-introduce-felony-murder-deadly-fentanyl-distribution-act,"Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and 12 Republican Senate colleagues in introducing the Felony Murder for Deadly Fentanyl Distribution Act to combat the rise of fentanyl being trafficked across our southern border and into our communities.

The Illicit use of fentanyl is now the leading cause of death among Americans aged 18-45. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, drug dealers are increasingly targeting children and young people with fentanyl pills made to look like candy.

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/icymi-senator-hawley-speaks-national-conservatism-conference,"This week U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) delivered a speech at the National Conservatism Conference in Miami, Florida.""Whatever your own beliefs, whatever your background, the revolution of the Bible is worth defending. It is worth preserving. It is the true source of the rights of man and the liberties we cherish. It has taught us what we know of dignity and equality. The Bible has made us who we are. And it is critical to our future,"" said Senator Hawley. [. . .] 

The Bible gave us also the idea of a state ruled by men, not by gods. It gave us the distinction between church and state. It gave us equality between men and women. And more, much more. But you get the idea. 

These were revolutionary notions that upended the ancient world. And they found their purest political expression in the United States of America. 

The biblical revolution is right there in the Declaration of Independence, which proclaims that “all men are created equal,” that we are endowed by our Creator with “unalienable” rights. These confessions would take centuries to realize in this country, but we recognized them as true from the first. 

The biblical revolution is there in our Constitution, which separates powers among offices and stations to ensure the common person can rule, and no clique or elite. 

It is there in the Bill of Rights that guarantees freedom to worship, to speak, to assemble, and to exercise one’s faith free from government interference. 

The biblical tradition echoes in the great tent revivals of the frontier, where hardscrabble folks with little to their name heard from the itinerant preachers that they too were called by God. They too could be God’s servants. You didn’t need a fancy education or a landed estate to be God’s child. And those revivals helped spawn a populist political movement that reverberates to this day. 

America as we know it, America as we love it, is the product of the revolution of the Bible. But now that biblical inheritance is under siege. 

[. . .] 

The woke left now controls the commanding heights of American culture: the media, the entertainment industry, the corporations, academia, and government. They seek to marshal their combined cultural power against those who disagree. 

They seek to shame us, to isolate us—to silence us, if they can. They seek to protect their power. And they can succeed—but only if we allow them. 

In truth, their vision is bleak and their ideology is brittle. They do not understand the deep strength of the American people, because they do not understand the deep goodness of their character. They see only deplorables who must be re-educated. 

They do not understand our history and our ideals because they do not appreciate the truths on which this nation is based. They do not realize these truths have made us good and made us strong. And truth is their problem. The woke ideology, this warmed-over cultural Marxism, is not true. 

Race and class do not define all that we are. Society is not an unending struggle for power and domination. And America is not structurally defective. America is the best and freest nation in the history of the world. And it is so largely because of the biblical revolution that made us what we are. 

And now we need that inheritance again. In this time of fear and despair, we need to hear again that our lives matter—that we are loved by God—that we are called by God to great purpose—and that eternity beckons. What we do now can last. What we do here can matter. 

We need to hear again of the dignity of ordinary life, of work and hearth and home, of the joys of marriage and family, and the power of these things to shape the future.Read the full speech here.555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

This move has been described by multiple media outlets as “a major win for gun control advocates,” and they are not wrong. This new system is ripe for abuse and brings to mind similar policies of Big Tech companies and payment processors that have targeted law-abiding Americans for engaging in constitutionally protected activities. I urge you to immediately reverse course. Too often, companies have abused their market power to target the constitutional rights of conservatives and others with minority viewpoints. Big Tech companies systematically deplatformed those who sought to discuss the efficacy of masks and vaccines or raise concerns about the integrity of our elections. The crowdfunding platform GoFundMe blocked donations to the Canadian “Freedom Rally” trucker convoy. And WePay, a payment processor subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase—the largest bank in the United States—refused to do business with Missouri conservatives seeking to host an event with Donald Trump, Jr. Your proposal to track firearm-related purchases further threatens Americans who are simply exercising their constitutional rights. The Second Amendment is clear: the right of the people to keep and bear arms is guaranteed to law-abiding citizens and “shall not be infringed.” Whether this infringement is by the federal government or powerful corporations seeking to ostracize citizens for exercising their rights, I will oppose all attempts to undermine the Second Amendment’s protections. Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and other payment card companies should not distinguish lawful firearm-related purchases from other retail purchases. Americans have had enough of massive companies using their market power to drive ordinary people out of the public square.

This is in response to your August 4, 2022 letter requesting that the Department of Defense (DoD) Office of Inspector General (OIG) review whistleblower allegations that hundreds of Afghan evacuees were allowed to enter the United States despite appearing on the DoD’s Biometrically Enabled Watchlist, and that officials at the National Security Council and DoD did not follow proper procedures when processing evacuees in Afghanistan and at staging bases. 

As part of our ongoing body of work on Afghan evacuees, we are initiating an evaluation, to commence in the first quarter of FY 2023, to address your questions pertaining to the DoD’s role in reviewing DoD databases for information on Afghan evacuees when requested by other agencies. In February 2022, we issued Report No. DODIG-2022-065, “Evaluation of the Screening of Displaced Persons from Afghanistan,” that detailed the extent to which the DoD managed and tracked displaced persons from Afghanistan through the biometric enrollment, screening, and vetting process. In addition, we have an ongoing evaluation on security and life support practices for Afghan evacuees at Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo. 

For the remainder of the questions in your letter, we determined that the OIGs for the respective agencies with jurisdiction over those matters, copied on my response, are better suited to respond. 

We appreciate your interest in our work and we will keep you informed about the progress about our current and future work.

The DEA recently issued a warning on the deadly drug.

""Issuing a warning is a step in the right direction. But it is not enough. We should stop the flow of deadly drugs across from the southern border, seize all rainbow fentanyl contraband, and imprison all who manufacture and distribute these horrible drugs,"" said Senator Hawley. Read the entire letter here and below: September 7, 2022 

The Honorable Anne Milgram 
Administrator 
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
8701 Morisettte Drive 
Springfield, VA 22152 

Dear Administrator Milgram, 

I write with concern over recent reports of seizures, including in Missouri, of so-called rainbow fentanyl. This new form of brightly-colored fentanyl is particularly concerning as it seems designed to resemble candy and appeal to children and teenagers. 

The United States continues to grapple with an epidemic of overdose and addiction in Missouri and across the nation. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 107,622 Americans died of drug overdoses in 2021, a new annual record. Fentanyl, due to its potent addictiveness and lethality, is the main driver of this epidemic and was responsible for the deaths of 71,238 Americans last year, a 23 percent increase over 2020. In Missouri, fentanyl and its analogs were responsible for 1,204 overdose deaths in 2020, constituting 64 percent of all overdose deaths in the state. 

On August 30, 2022, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issued a warning about so-called rainbow fentanyl, which your agency says is a “deliberate effort by drug traffickers to drive addiction amongst kids and young adults.” The warning noted that the DEA has seized brightly-colored fentanyl in 18 states and that the drug is being found in all forms, including pills, powder, and blocks resembling chalk. Two of the recent seizures occurred in St. Louis, Missouri. 

Issuing a warning is a step in the right direction. But it is not enough. We should stop the flow of deadly drugs across from the southern border, seize all rainbow fentanyl contraband, and imprison all who manufacture and distribute these horrible drugs. 

So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, please provide the following information by September 15, 2022: 

1. Please detail how the DEA is working with state and local law enforcement to raise awareness of rainbow fentanyl. 

2. Please detail how the DEA is working with primary and secondary schools to inform parents and their children about the prevalence of rainbow fentanyl and how to identify it. 

3. The DEA’s recent warning about rainbow fentanyl notes that Mexican drug cartels are responsible for the majority of fentanyl entering the United States. What steps is DEA taking to combat fentanyl trafficking by these cartels? 

4. How is the DEA coordinating with Customs and Border Protection to stop the smuggling of rainbow fentanyl and other drugs into the United States? 

5. Is the DEA coordinating with Mexican law enforcement to trace the origins of this new form of fentanyl? 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response. 

Sincerely, 

Josh Hawley

Senator Hawley asked Secretary Wormuth about this issue at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on May 5, 2022. This latest inquiry comes as the Army appears to be going back on its pledge to allocate funding for new homes at Fort Leonard Wood.""Servicemembers at Fort Leonard Wood do vital work to protect our nation. It is the Army’s responsibility to care for those servicemembers and their families, in kind. Yet that does not appear to be happening when it comes to housing,"" said Senator Hawley. Read the entire letter here and below: August 5, 2022

Honorable Christine Wormuth
Secretary of the Army
101 Army Pentagon
Washington, D.C. 20310-0101

Dear Secretary Wormuth,

I am writing to request information on the Department of the Army’s plans to replace aging homes at Fort Leonard Wood.

Fort Leonard Wood is the proud home of the U.S. Army’s Maneuver Support Center of Excellence, including the Army Engineer School, Army CBRN School, and Army Military Police School. Fort Leonard Wood is also one of five locations where the Army conducts Basic Combat Training for new recruits. And Fort Leonard Wood provides unparalleled opportunities for joint training to Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps detachments located on the installation.

Servicemembers at Fort Leonard Wood do vital work to protect our nation. It is the Army’s responsibility to care for those servicemembers and their families, in kind. Yet that does not appear to be happening when it comes to housing.

During a Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) hearing on June 15, 2021, I asked you and Army Chief of Staff General James McConville about the Army’s plans to replace aging homes at Fort Leonard Wood. I explained the concerns raised by servicemembers and their families about those homes. You responded with an update on the Army’s efforts to improve housing. General McConville then assured me this issue was one of the Army’s top priorities and promised additional information about the Army’s efforts at Fort Leonard Wood, in particular.

The next week, Army Materiel Command and Army Installation Management Command informed my office that “Balfour Beatty Corporation is working a private investment initiative that will make as much as $340M available to improve BBC housing across the Army portfolio beginning later this year.” My office engaged the Army shortly thereafter to learn exactly how much would be allocated for Fort Leonard Wood. Army officials then informed us that less than $50 million would be made available to meet Fort Leonard Wood’s housing requirements. We informed the Army at the time that this amount was insufficient to meet Fort Leonard Wood’s housing requirements. Army officials agreed with our assessment and assured us they would work to provide a solution as quickly as possible.

But that has not happened. To the contrary, things only got worse over the following year. This culminated with the Army notifying my office on May 3, 2022, that the private investment initiative cited by the Army in earlier exchanges was no longer viable. As a result, Army officials told us, the $50 million originally intended for Fort Leonard Wood was no longer available. Put succinctly, the Army had neither funds nor any idea how it was going to generate funds to meet Fort Leonard Wood’s housing requirements.

I raised this issue with you – again – at a SASC hearing on May 5, 2022. During our exchange, you committed to investigate the matter and provide me with an update on the Army’s plan to meet Fort Leonard Wood’s housing requirements. Nearly three months have passed, and I have received no update.

No doubt many of the housing challenges facing the Army are a result of public-private partnerships that have failed to perform as expected. And private companies should be held responsible for their failures to meet their obligations to provide quality housing to our servicemembers. But it is Army – not these companies – that is ultimately responsible for caring for servicemembers and their families at Fort Leonard Wood.

- With these concerns in mind, I request your written responses to the following questions no later than August 12, 2022:

- What is the Army’s assessment of the total number of homes at Fort Leonard Wood that need to be replaced?

- What is the Army’s assessment of how much it will cost to replace those homes?

- How does the Army plan to fund the replacement of all the homes at Fort Leonard Wood that need to be replaced?

- What is the Army’s timeline for replacing all of the homes at Fort Leonard Wood that need to be replaced?

Ensuring quality housing for servicemembers and their families at Fort Leonard Wood is a top priority for the people of Missouri. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Sincerely,

Josh Hawley

Acting Inspector General

4800 Mark Center Dr. 
Alexandria, VA 22305 

Dear Acting Inspector General O’Donnell, 

We write to you with concern over new allegations raised by a Department of Defense (DoD) whistleblower. This information may show the Biden Administration’s failure to vet those evacuated from Afghanistan was even worse than the public was led to believe. The following allegations demand an immediate investigation by your office. 

 You previously issued a report titled “Evaluation of the Screening of Displaced Persons from Afghanistan.”Among other things, you found that “Afghan evacuees were not vetted by the National Counter-Terrorism Center (NCTC) using all DoD data prior to arriving in” the United States. In particular, we were troubled to learn that DoD “personnel identified Afghans with derogatory information in the DoD [Automated Biometric Identification System] database who were believed to be in the United States.”At the time of the report, DoD “personnel had identified 50 Afghan personnel in the United States with information in DoD records that would indicate potentially significant security concerns,” but we understand that number has risen to at least 65.  These individuals need to be immediately located, fully vetted, and, if appropriate, deported. 

A patriotic whistleblower paints an even darker picture. According to new allegations, 324 individuals evacuated from Afghanistan were allowed to enter the United States, despite appearing on the DoD’s Biometrically Enabled Watchlist (BEWL). The BEWL—commonly known as “the watch list”—identifies individuals whose biometrics have been collected and determined by analysts to be threats or potential threats to national security, including known suspected terrorists (KST). This is in addition to the reportedly 65 individuals who are known to have entered the country without adequate vetting. 

Furthermore, the whistleblower alleges that political appointees at the National Security Council (NSC) and DoD instructed agency personnel to cut corners when processing evacuees in Afghanistan and at staging bases in Europe, also known as “lily pads.” According to the whistleblower rather than administer fingerprint tests on all ten fingers, personnel were told to abbreviate their tests in order to promote the rushed evacuation from Afghanistan. 

Finally, it is alleged that personnel at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) who work on vetting Afghan evacuees have been authorized to delete old biometric data, whenever they personally believed that such information is out of date. This is a troubling development that could threaten national security and public safety. 

We write to request you open an immediate investigation into these alarming allegations and specifically respond to the following:

May 10, 2022The Honorable Merrick Garland 
Attorney General 
United States Department of Justice 
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. 
Washington, D.C. 20530 

Dear Attorney General Garland: 

Across the nation, radical pro-abortion activists have begun a campaign of violence, destruction, and intimidation in response to the leak of a draft document from the Supreme Court. You must vigorously investigate and prosecute the crimes committed in recent days. The rule of law demands no less. 

Video evidence shows dozens of pro-abortion activists surrounding the homes of Supreme Court Justices in an attempt to influence those Justices to change their decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the case that asks the Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. News outlets report that one individual has targeted Justice Kavanaugh in this manner at least five times, and has targeted at least one other Justice. Neighbors have described her conduct as “dangerous.” 

This conduct has only one purpose: intimidation. It is also flagrantly illegal. Federal law makes it a crime for a person, “with the intent of influencing any judge, juror, witness, or court officer, in the discharge of his duty,” to “picket[] or parade[] … in or near a building or residence occupied or used by such judge.” 18 U.S.C. §1507. The First Amendment is no shield to this illegal conduct. Those upset by the leaks have plenty of places to protest that do not involve intimidation and do not place the Justices and their families at risk. And the Supreme Court already upheld a statute similar to this one, stressing that these laws are critical to democracy. Because “influence or domination by either a hostile or friendly mob … is the very antithesis of due process,” Cox v. State of La., 379 U.S. 559, 562 (1965), the unlawful picketing by these radical activists is nothing less than an attack on the Court itself. 

Meanwhile, harrowing reports have arisen in recent days of radical pro-abortion activists attacking pro-life persons and organizations. Over the weekend, criminals firebombed a pro-life organization in Madison, Wisconsin. Along with the arson, they left a threatening note that stated, “If abortions aren’t safe, then you aren’t either.” Luckily, nobody was killed in the violent attack. But next time, the victims might not be so lucky. Your office must investigate and prosecute. 

Additionally, radical activists have targeted religious organizations in the past week because those organizations hold pro-life religious beliefs. Those activists vandalized a Catholic church in Boulder, Colorado, with pro-abortion slogans and anti-religion messages. Anti-religion vandalism in recent days also goes well beyond mere spray paint on doors. One radical organization suggested that its members had already stolen from a Catholic church the holiest of its contents—the Eucharist—and intend to destroy it in an act of gross sacrilege. These acts of vandalism are not just hateful; they also clearly violate federal law, which prohibits “intentionally damag[ing] or destroy[ing] the property of a place of religious worship.” 18 U.S.C. §248(a)(3). 

Activists around the country also have prevented religious Americans from participating in religious services and plan to do so in the future. Radicals interfered with religious services in Los Angeles this past weekend. This, too, is brazenly illegal under federal law. 18 U.S.C. §248(a)(2). 

You must not allow this brazen and unlawful intimidation to go unchecked. Last fall, your Department committed substantial resources to investigating parents at school board meetings. Failure to vigorously investigate and prosecute these crimes would send the message that your Department is only interested in prosecuting the Biden Administration’s political opponents—like parents speaking at school board meetings—leaving victims of actual crimes committed by the far left to fend for themselves. Within two weeks, please respond to my office with a full report about whether you have opened investigations into these cases and the status of those investigations.

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-introduces-bill-strip-disney-special-copyright-protections,"Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the Copyright Clause Restoration Act, a new bill to strip woke corporations like Disney of special copyright protections. Senator Hawley’s bill would limit new copyright protections to 56 years and make the change retroactive for massive corporations like Disney that have been granted unnecessarily long copyright monopolies.Senator Hawley said, “the age of Republican handouts to Big Business is over. Thanks to special copyright protections from Congress, woke corporations like Disney have earned billions while increasingly pandering to woke activists. It’s time to take away Disney’s special privileges and open up a new era of creativity and innovation.”Under Congress’s current sweetheart deal, companies like Disney have been granted certain copyright protections for up to 120 years—well beyond the original maximum of 28 years. Senator Hawley’s bill would crack down on copyright monopolies to ensure they only last long enough to encourage innovation.Bill text can be found here.Background The Copyright Clause Restoration Act would:555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-urges-biden-admin-keep-china-tariffs-place-open-investigation-unfair-trade-practices,"Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai calling on the Biden Administration to maintain tariffs on Chinese goods and to initiate a new investigation into the Chinese Communist Party’s unfair trade practices. 

""China repeatedly violates the rules of international trade and unapologetically steals and cheats in its economic relationship with the United States,” wrote Senator Hawley. “The objective of these tariffs was to recalibrate the nation’s bilateral trading relationship with our primary economic competitor, and to level the playing field for American workers and communities which have long suffered from unfair practices perpetrated by China after its accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001.”

He continued, “Tariffs on Chinese goods are important tools our nation must use as part of a long-term strategy in its geoeconomic competition with China. I therefore urge you in the strongest possible terms to use your influence within the Biden Administration to reject the short-sighted position advocated by your colleagues.”Although tariffs on Chinese imports are critical tools for leveling the playing field for American workers, Biden Administration officials in recent weeks have expressed a desire to cut them. Senator Hawley urged Ambassador Tai to keep the tariffs in place, and asked why her office has yet to open a new investigation into malicious Chinese practices that have harmed American industry.Read the letter here and below:   
The Honorable Katherine Tai 
U.S. Trade Representative 
Office of the United State Trade Representative 
600 17th Street NW 
Washington, D.C. 20508 

Dear Ambassador Tai, 

I write with concern about recent comments from Biden Administration officials that indicate a desire to cut tariffs on goods imported from China. I urge you to reject this misguided policy proposal. I further write to inquire about the status of a new Section 301 investigation into the malicious economic practices deployed by the Chinese Communist Party, which harm American workers and industry and must be combatted with the full weight of your office. 

Following an investigation conducted under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, the Trump Administration documented what many Americans have long known: China repeatedly violates the rules of international trade and unapologetically steals and cheats in its economic relationship with the United States. Pursuant to the findings of the investigation, the Trump Administration levied tariffs on a broad basket of Chinese goods. The objective of these tariffs was to recalibrate the nation’s bilateral trading relationship with our primary economic competitor, and to level the playing field for American workers and communities which have long suffered from unfair practices perpetrated by China after its accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001.  

Tariffs on Chinese goods enjoy broad support among the American people. Unfortunately, certain officials within the Biden Administration seem to disfavor them, and have, in recent weeks, suggested they be cut. Deputy National Security Adviser Daleep Singh has said that tariffs on consumer goods from China “serve no strategic purpose.” In addition, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, a longtime critic of using tariffs to rebalance our trading relationship with China, has said that scaling back tariffs on Chinese goods is “worth considering.” 

Tariffs on Chinese goods are important tools our nation must use as part of a long-term strategy in its geoeconomic competition with China. I therefore urge you in the strongest possible terms to use your influence within the Biden Administration to reject the short-sighted position advocated by your colleagues. As you told Congress earlier this year, cutting tariffs would relinquish leverage at the negotiating table with China—leverage you must maintain and fully deploy, especially after China’s failure to abide by the purchase agreements it made under the Phase One trade deal. To cut tariffs at this juncture would be a strategic blunder. Not only would it reward China for its latest act of deceit, but it would give them a green light to do so again in the future. 

In addition to maintaining the existing tariffs on Chinese goods, I further write to inquire about the status of a new Section 301 investigation into China’s economic practices, which includes state-directed industrial subsidies in strategically important sectors which unfairly benefit Chinese firms and degrade their American competitors. The possibility of such an investigation has been reported since at least September 2021. However, as of yet, your office has failed to act. This is unacceptable. The longer you wait to investigate and address these practices, the more damage will be done to American workers and industry. You must act with haste. 

I request your written responses to the following questions no later than May 16, 2022: 

     1. Do you plan to reduce Section 301 tariffs on goods imported from China? If so, please explain how doing so will strengthen the United States’ long-term position in its geoeconomic competition with China.   
  
     2. Would reducing Section 301 tariffs on goods imported from China increase or decrease our nation’s trade deficit with China? 
  
     3. Why have you delayed a new Section 301 investigation into China’s economic practices, and when do you plan to initiate it? 

                          Sincerely,  

                          Josh Hawley

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-demands-answers-housing-crisis-fort-leonard-wood,"In a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) pressed Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth and Chief of Staff of the Army General James C. McConville for answers about military housing at Fort Leonard Wood.  Last June, Senator Hawley asked the Secretary and General McConville for information about the Army’s plans to replace housing on base. Following that exchange, the Army confirmed it had allocated funding for housing at Fort Leonard Wood. More recently, however, the Army informed the Senator's office that funding was no longer available. Concerned by the Army's lack of progress, Senator Hawley demanded answers directly from the Army's leaders.

Senator Hawley said, “I asked you and General McConville both last year, at this hearing, about the Army’s plans to replace aging homes at Fort Leonard Wood. You both assured me that that would be a priority. Army Materiel Command followed up with my office afterward and said that the Army would be earmarking funds for this. However, as of this week, I am not aware that the Army has allocated any funds toward replacing housing at Fort Leonard Wood – zero. So, my question is why hasn’t the Army put together a plan to replace the again housing at Fort Leonard Wood, despite agreeing that they needed to be replaced?”He continued, ""I was told last year there were $341 million that were going to be allocated towards replacing housing. Then I was told later only $50 million would be available for Fort Leonard Wood. Then I was told after that it would be zero. So you can imagine, I’m not very happy about it.”

“In Missouri, it’s a pressing issue. And when I’m told that there’s going to be funds available for housing in Missouri, and then there aren’t, I’m not happy about it. And I am not happy about getting the runaround about what it’s going to be and what it’s not going to be. And frankly, what I want to hear is that Fort Leonard Wood is going to be a priority, and that it is going to get done,” he concluded.555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

During the first round of questioning, Secretary Mayorkas provided no answers as to why he hired Jankowicz, whom Senator Hawley described as “human geyser of misinformation.” Senator Hawley then called on Secretary Mayorkas to turn over all agency records related to the formation of the Board and the appointment of Jankowicz. In the final round of questioning Secretary Mayorkas was unable to defend Jankowicz’s blatant partisanship and political bias. Senator Hawley also asked Mayorkas to dissolve the Biden Administration’s disinformation board:

“Why don’t you just dissolve this board? I mean, you haven’t heard a single Senator support this board,” said Senator Hawley. “It is an abomination, it is unconstitutional, and frankly it is embarrassing. And the fact that you’ve chosen this person to lead it is appalling.”Senator Hawley introduced legislation today to dissolve the board and wrote to the Secretary on President Biden’s Disinformation Governance Board last week.555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

 I once clerked at the Supreme Court. Over the years, I’ve litigated there too, and I’ve never seen anything like the leak of the Supreme Court’s draft opinion in the abortion case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Justice Alito’s draft majority opinion is powerful, overturning Roe and returning the question of abortion to the people. The opinion is everything a constitutionalist could hope for. This leak looks like an effort to derail it, and delegitimize the Court in the process. [...]And now the left is celebrating the individual who leaked this draft opinion, whoever it was. Brian Fallon, executive director of the dark-money activist group Demand Justice, theorized that a ""brave clerk"" was responsible for the leak, and claimed that ""[a]ll Democrats need to show the same urgency."" Ian Millhiser, senior correspondent for Vox, proclaimed ""shout out to whoever the hero was within the Supreme Court who said ‘f*** it! Let’s burn this place down.’"" Elie Mystal, writer for the left-wing magazine The Nation, bragged that ""it has at times been my literal job to try to cultivate the kind of sources who would leak this."" Tellingly, not one Democrat Senator has denounced the leak. Nor has President Joe Biden. [...] At the end of the day, all this left-wing talk of killing the filibuster, packing the Court, and taking to the streets amounts to the same thing: a brazen attempt to bully at least one Justice into backing down for fear of potential blowback.[...]No more. This time around, the Court’s majority must stay the course, and defy the left-wing pressure. In fact, the Court should issue its opinion immediately so that far-left agitators cannot try to obstruct official proceedings. The longer the Court waits, the more tricks Democrats can attempt. Justice Alito’s draft is a model of legal and historical clarity, one that devastates the false notion that a ""right to abortion"" is deeply rooted in our national history and tradition. Roe and Casey were wrong the day they were decided, and it’s long past time for the Court to overrule them, come what may. Today, the American people know that a majority of the Court believes—correctly—that Roe and Casey deserve to go. Those five brave Justices cannot back down now. We are, after all, a nation of laws and not of mobs.

The Court’s very credibility, and millions of unborn lives, hang in the balance.  Read the full piece at FoxNews.com555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

 May 2, 2022The Honorable Josh Hawley 

United States Senate 

Washington, DC 20510 

Dear Senator Hawley: 

Thank you for your letter dated April 28, 2022, to Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland concerning Honor Flight escorts conducted by the United States Park Police (USPP). In your letter, you requested that the USPP continue to provide law enforcement escorts for Honor Flight visits to Washington, DC. We are happy to report that earlier today, the National Park Service and the Honor Flight Network made a public announcement about their continued work together, a copy of which is enclosed. 

This past Friday, leadership from the USPP and the National Mall and Memorial Parks (NAMA) met with the Honor Flight Network and shared some of our concerns. Prior to The Honor Flight Network suspending trips to DC in spring of 2020 it was increasingly difficult for USPP to consistently provide sufficient law enforcement officers to support the nearly 300 honor flight escorts each year. Historically, USPP has also escorted groups to and from all three area airports using emergency lights and sirens to expedite movement through congested traffic, a practice that is now recognized to be inconsistent with modern law enforcement best practices in non-emergency situations. In a shared commitment to a safety-first approach, the Honor Flight Network and USPP will focus law enforcement support around the National Mall and memorials area of USPP jurisdiction in Washington, DC. 

Going forward, the USPP and park rangers from NAMA will meet the Honor Flight group at their chosen memorial, facilitate parking, meet with the veterans, and respond to any calls for emergency services needed by the group. Park rangers will deliver a program about any of the memorials, if desired. USPP will provide a ceremonial escort between memorials. These escorts will facilitate the safe transport of Honor Flights groups between the World War II Memorial, Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and the Korean War Memorial by providing temporary road closures and a law enforcement lead vehicle to guide them to each location. Ceremonial escort support will generally end at Arlington National Cemetery. 

We are immeasurably grateful for the service of our veterans and humbled by the sacrifice of all who have served our country. We appreciate your strong interest in the National Park Service and for your engagement on this issue. Please know that we are committed to continuing to work with the Honor Flight Network. If you have any questions, please contact Acting USPP Chief Chris Stock at Christopher_Stock@nps.gov or by phone at (202) 619-7350. 

A similar response is being sent to the cosigner of your letter.

The first Proposed Rule, which has now evolved into Final Rule 2021R-05F, will unsettle longstanding expectations for Americans everywhere and take steps toward a national gun registry by requiring gun dealers to maintain gun owner and transaction information forever. The second, if promulgated, would upend established practices by reclassifying millions of pistols and AR-15-style firearms as “short-barreled rifles”—thus subjecting them to the rigid controls of the National Firearms Act and making it a federal felony to possess them without going through a byzantine waiver process.  Thousands upon thousands of Americans’ rights are at stake: the Proposed Rule itself anticipates “affect[ing] upwards of 1.4 million individuals.” Given the stakes involved, ATF’s nearly year-long delay in responding is unacceptable and has all the appearances of an attempt by a bureaucracy to evade democratic oversight. Please provide my office with responses to the following questions no later than May 22, 2022:Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response. 

 Sincerely,

1849 C Street, N.W. 
Washington, D.C. 20240

Dear Secretary Haaland:
April 28, 2022We write with serious concern about the Department of the Interior’s apparent decision to stop providing police escorts to American veterans traveling to our nation’s capital as part of the Honor Flight Network.

The Honor Flight Network has brought hundreds of thousands of veterans to our nation’s capital since 2005. As part of these trips, the Honor Flight Network organizes buses to bring veterans to the National Mall, where they can visit memorials for the wars in which they fought, reflect on the sacrifices they and their comrades made in those campaigns, and remember those who never came home. To say that the Honor Flight Network is performing a national service is an understatement. For thousands of American veterans, these trips are a once in a lifetime opportunity for honor, reflection, and remembrance that simply cannot be replaced.

The Department of the Interior has historically played an important role in making these trips possible by providing U.S. Park Police escorts for buses carrying Honor Flight veterans to the National Mall. These escorts are important because of many of these veterans are no longer able to walk long distances on their own. Being able to drive and park close to the memorials they are visiting is therefore essential. Escorts also help to ensure Honor Flight trips are safe and run smoothly without logistical challenges or schedule delays that can impact the trip’s experience for our veterans.

Yet it appears the Department of the Interior has changed its policy about providing these vehicular escorts for Honor Flight trips. For example, in response to an inquiry from Rep. Bill Posey (FL), the Chief of the U.S. Park Police admitted that there had been a “suspension” of these services in part due to the Department’s “policy on escorts.” In addition, we have recently been made aware that Missouri-based Honor Flights have been denied these vehicular services, even though they have received these same services in years past.

Such a policy change is wholly unacceptable and deserves further explanation. It needlessly creates new challenges for Honor Flight groups, including veterans from our home state of Missouri.

Our nation’s veterans represent the best of us. It’s critical that the government do its part to honor their sacrifices by making these trips run as smoothly as possible. With this in mind, we urge you in the strongest possible terms to resume U.S. Park Police escorts for veterans traveling to our nation’s capital with the Honor Flight Network. We ask further for your responses to the following questions no later than Tuesday, May 3, 2022:

1. How many police escorts has the Department of the Interior provided annually for Honor Flight Network trips to Washington, DC? Please provide all relevant data annualized for the years 2005 to 2022.

2. When did the Department of the Interior formally decide to suspend police escorts for Honor Flight trips to Washington, D.C., and why was this decision made?

3. Why does the Department now claim its “policy on escorts” prohibits vehicular services to the Honor Flight Network, when these same services were provided in years past?

4. Were the President of the United States, Secretary of Defense, or Secretary of Veterans Affairs informed of any decision by the Department of the Interior to end police escorts for Honor Flight trips, and if so, when were they informed, and did they support that decision?

5. Will you commit to provide police escorts for all future Honor Flight trips to our nation’s capital? If so, when will those escorts become available and who should the Honor Flight Network contact in order to coordinate trip escorts?Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. We await your timely response.

The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas 
Secretary of Homeland Security 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
245 Murray Lane, S.W. 
Washington D.C. 20528 

Dear Secretary Mayorkas: 

I write with deep concern about the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to create a new Disinformation Governance Board. I confess, I at first thought this announcement was satire. Surely no American Administration would ever use the power of Government to sit in judgment on the First Amendment speech of its own citizens. Sadly, I was mistaken. Rather than protecting our border or the American homeland, you have chosen to make policing Americans’ speech your priority. This new board is almost certainly unconstitutional and should be dissolved immediately. 

For well over a year, your Department has consistently treated competing policy views as disinformation to be monitored or investigated. However, political debates on issues such as immigration, pandemic lockdowns, and foreign policy clearly constitute “core political speech” protected by the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has even gone so far as to say that “Under the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea.” The apparent broad mandate of this new government entity to “coordinate countering misinformation” in America undermines the argument that it can even exist consistent with the Constitution.

Particularly troubling is your choice to lead the new board, Nina Jankowicz, a supposed “expert” with a long history of partisan attacks. Consider:Jankowicz has said the new DHS Board will “maintain the Dept’s committment [sic] to protecting free speech.” This is particularly ironic given Jankowicz’s extensive criticism of free speech and the First Amendment. Jankowicz has claimed that “the ‘free speech vs censorship’ framing is a false dichotomy.” And when Elon Musk announced his acquisition of Twitter, she said “I shudder to think about if free speech absolutists were taking over more platforms, what that would look like for the marginalized communities … which are already shouldering … disproportionate amounts of this abuse.” Jankowicz has even described opponents of social media speech codes as “first amendment zealots.” These statements that question the value of free speech are obviously disqualifying for such a role. 

While Democrats have for years controlled the public square through their Big Tech allies, Mr. Musk’s acquisition of Twitter has shown just how tenuous that control is. It can only be assumed that the sole purpose of this new Disinformation Governance Board will be to marshal the power of the federal government to censor conservative and dissenting speech. This is dangerous and un-American. The board should be immediately dissolved. 

So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, please provide the following responses prior to your expected testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on May 4, 2022:555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-slams-gmails-bias-against-republican-candidates-demands-answers-google,"Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, demanding explanations for a recent academic study finding filtering that Gmail's spam filtering algorithm was significantly more likely to mark Republican fundraising emails as spam than Democrat fundraising emails. The letter comes amid ongoing debates over free speech around the sale of tech giant Twitter and censorship issues that have persisted in the tech industry for years.

In his letter to Google, Senator Hawley wrote, “While 90% of emails from Democratic politicians reached their intended recipients, the number for Republican candidates was only 23% at worst. Even worse, Google’s bias against Republican candidates becomes more pronounced as an election gets closer. […] The study found that Gmail treats Democratic emails much more favorably than Republican emails even though the content of the emails was substantially similar. In other words, Gmail marked emails as spam because of the ‘political affiliation of the sender,’ not because of the content of the email.”

He continued, “Google’s market power across so many sectors of the internet provides it with an unprecedented ability to control what messages ultimately get out. Accordingly, your company should take immediate corrective action in response to these findings. […]  Google’s algorithm should not be dictating the ‘outcomes of an election.’ Preserving the integrity of the 2022 elections demands no less.”

Senator Hawley requested Google explain this pattern of bias and asked for answers to several additional questions, including what steps Google is taking to review its filtering algorithms for implicit or explicit political bias and why the bias against Republicans increases as an election draws nearer.

Senator Hawley has long been critical of big tech companies, including their censorship of users and monopoly power. On the recent sale of Twitter, he noted it would be a major change if Elon Musk returned the company to its original free speech commitments. Last night Senator Hawley sent a letter to Musk calling for a comprehensive public audit of Twitter's past censorship practices.

Chief Executive Officer

Mountain View, CA 94043 

Dear Mr. Pichai: 

The health of our democratic republic depends on voter engagement. And as more and more of our everyday communication shifts online, it’s vital that political campaigns can reliably reach their supporters, particularly in the runup to the 2022 elections. But new research reveals that your company makes it much harder for Republicans to reach their supporters even while your company makes it very easy for Democrats to reach theirs. 

A team of researchers at North Carolina State University uncovered a disturbing pattern of political bias in the spam filtering algorithms used by Gmail. The study reported that “all [spam filtering algorithms] exhibited political biases in the months leading up to the 2020 US elections” but that Google’s bias was substantially worse than any other major provider. While Microsoft’s spam algorithm favored one party by 20% and Yahoo’s algorithm favored one party by 14%, Google’s algorithm favored Democrats by an astonishing 59%. While 90% of emails from Democratic politicians reached their intended recipients, the number for Republican candidates was only 23% at worst. Even worse, Google’s bias against Republican candidates becomes more pronounced as an election gets closer. 

And critically, the researchers noted that there was no reason to think one party was sending out “spammier” emails than the other. The study found that Gmail treats Democratic emails much more favorably than Republican emails even though the content of the emails was substantially similar. In other words, Gmail marked emails as spam because of the “political affiliation of the sender,” not because of the content of the email. As the researchers put it, this is “rather worrying” because it reveals that Google’s algorithm can alter the “outcomes of an election.”  

I am particularly alarmed by this pattern because political dice-loading is nothing new for your company. Back in 2020, in partnership with the dark-money “Center for Countering Digital Hate,” your company abruptly threatened to remove the conservative website The Federalist from the Google Ads platform, based on the contents of its comments section. YouTube routinely deplatforms or demonetizes individuals because of their conservative speech. And a Wall Street Journal investigation found that Google manually adjusts its algorithm and autocomplete suggestions to disfavor certain viewpoints. 

In response to the North Carolina study, your company has stated that “[m]ail classifications in Gmail automatically adjust to match Gmail users’ preferences and actions.” In other words, the only reason these emails are being flagged as spam is that Gmail users tend to treat them as such.  The NCSU research team anticipated this possibility and refuted it. Even controlling for that possibility, Google still has a noticeable, substantial bias. The researchers even stated outright that they “did not find any consistent actions that one could recommend to users to help them reduce the bias in the way the [spam filtering algorithm] treats political emails that are sent to them.” Something else, in short, explains the disparity. That something else, the study concluded, is the “political affiliation of the sender.” 

Google’s market power across so many sectors of the internet provides it with an unprecedented ability to control what messages ultimately get out. Accordingly, your company should take immediate corrective action in response to these findings. As the authors of the NCSU study stated, “[i]t is imperative for the email services to audit their [spam filtering algorithms] to ensure that any properties of the sender that they consider in determining whether any given email is spam or not are not, unknowingly, putting one side at an advantage compared to the other.” Google’s algorithm should not be dictating the “outcomes of an election.” Preserving the integrity of the 2022 elections demands no less.

Dear Mr. Musk: 
  
Congratulations on your acquisition of Twitter. Your commitment to free speech is rare in the world of social media, and I am hopeful you will indeed help Twitter become a platform that values and protects it. 
  
There’s certainly a lot of work to be done. Twitter has largely evaded public accountability over the past several years. Since I’ve been in the Senate, I’ve sent a number of oversight inquiries to the company. These letters cover subjects as diverse as content moderation policies, viewpoint discrimination, suppression of content, and Twitter’s own security. Twitter, not surprisingly, has effectively ignored these requests. 
  
But perhaps most importantly, all the way back in 2019 I sent a letter to Twitter urging the company to “conduct a third-party audit and release the results to the public, in full.” 
  
Now you have the chance to make that kind of audit a reality. In recent years, Twitter has intervened in American discourse with an increasingly heavy hand, attempting to shape the information environment for overtly partisan reasons. Algorithms didn’t make those calls; employees did. And at this point, the American people deserve to know the truth about what went on at Twitter for years behind closed doors. 
  
Some particularly salient questions to investigate in the audit include the following:555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

Corporal Benjamin Lee Cooper of the Joplin Police Department, Police Officer Jake Alexander Reed of the Joplin Police Department, and Patrolman Lane Anthony Burns of the Bonne Terre Police Department lost their lives in service to their communities. 

""The loss of Corporal Cooper, Officer Reed, and Patrolman Burns is a tragedy and their heroic actions will not be forgotten” said Senator Hawley. “I thank the brave men and women who wear blue across our state. They selflessly risk their lives every day for our safety.“

“Every time a law enforcement officer reports for their shift, neither they nor their families know what dangerous situations they may face,” said Senator Blunt. “Law enforcement officers’ selfless dedication is a powerful testament to their courage and character. In recent weeks, three of Missouri’s finest lost their lives in the line of duty. Joplin Police Corporal Benjamin Cooper, Joplin Police Officer Jake Reed, and Bonne Terre Police Officer Lane Burns did not hesitate to put the safety of others ahead of their own. We are grateful they answered the call to serve and we owe a deep debt of gratitude to their families.”

Text of the resolution can be found here and below.

Title: Honoring the lives of fallen Missouri police officers and expressing condolences to their families. 

Whereas police officers, sheriffs and deputies, and other law enforcement officers serve and protect their communities with honor and sacrifice; 

Whereas all individuals in law enforcement put their lives on the line while serving and protecting their local communities; 

Whereas when violent crime increases, law enforcement officers and the communities they serve are directly impacted; 

Whereas, in the month of March 2022, Missouri experienced violent attacks against police officers, especially in rural areas; 

Whereas, in a 20-day period, 6 police officers in Missouri were shot in the line of duty, 3 of whom suffered injuries that were fatal; and 

Whereas these fallen officers include— 

     1.  Corporal Benjamin Lee Cooper of the Joplin Police Department, who passed away in the line of duty on March 8, 2022, after attempting to take a suspect into custody; 

     2.  Police Officer Jake Alexander Reed of the Joplin Police Department, who passed away from injuries sustained in the line of duty on March 11, 2022, after attempting to take a suspect into custody; and 

     3.  Patrolman Lane Anthony Burns of the Bonne Terre Police Department, who passed away in the line of duty on March 17, 2022, after responding to a disturbance: Now, therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the Senate— 

expresses deep condolences for the Missouri police officers who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty; 

recognizes the countless selfless and heroic actions carried out by local law enforcement officers; 
  
expresses strong support for police officers and law enforcement officers in rural areas and across the United States that serve and protect their local communities; 
  
recognizes the need to ensure that rural law enforcement departments have the proper equipment, training, and resources necessary to protect officers and the individuals in the communities they serve; 
  
acknowledges the importance of honoring and remembering fallen police and local law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty; and 
  
expresses condolences to the loved ones of each law enforcement officer across the United States who has made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty and whose sacrifice will not be forgotten.555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-introduces-taiwan-weapons-exports-act,"Today Senator Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the Taiwan Weapons Exports Act, which would fast-track delivery of critical weapons to Taiwan by expediting Congressional approval and eliminating administrative roadblocks. The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is growing rapidly. Critical to deterring such an invasion is ensuring Taiwan has the weapons it needs to defend itself, including naval mines, anti-tank missiles, man-portable air defense systems, and other asymmetric defense capabilities. This legislation would help the United States get these weapons to Taiwan as quickly as possible.""The Biden administration waited for Russia to invade before surging lethal aid to Ukraine,” Senator Hawley said. “We can’t afford to the make same mistake in the Indo-Pacific. That’s why it is so important to fast-track weapons to Taiwan now, while Taiwan still has to time to marshal its defenses and deter a Chinese invasion.” The Taiwan Weapons Exports Act would: As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Hawley has led efforts to deter a Chinese invasion of Taiwan and strengthen U.S.-Taiwan relations. Key legislative initiatives include the Arm Taiwan Act of 2021, which creates a new Taiwan Security Assistance Initiative to accelerate Taiwan’s deployment of critical asymmetric defense capabilities.

Senator Hawley has also introduced two other critical pieces of Taiwan-related legislation: the Taiwan Defense Act, which would require the U.S. Department of Defense to prioritize strengthening deterrence by ensuring American forces maintain their ability to defeat a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and the Taiwan Preclearance Act, which affirms Taiwan’s role as a critical partner in the pursuit of a free and open Indo-Pacific and establishes U.S. Customs and Border Protection preclearance facilities in Taiwan as a way to increase U.S. Taiwan business, cultural, and tourism exchanges.

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-rips-biden-admin-over-dhs-plans-rescind-title-42-allocate-veteran-resources-illegal,"Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a new letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, expressing deep concern with the administration’s decision to rescind the Title 42 order amid an ongoing humanitarian crisis – with numbers surging – at the southern border. Senator Hawley also inquired about disturbing new reports that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has plans to divert resources from veterans to provide free services for illegal immigrants.

“Rather than enforce our immigration laws, the Biden Administration has repeatedly changed existing policy to encourage, facilitate, and obscure illegal immigration. President Biden halted construction of the border wall, reinforced DACA, and limited ICE enforcement actions. He has also illegally reversed the Trump Administration’s Remain in Mexico Policy. Most recently, the Biden Administration announced its plan to rescind its Title 42 policy,” Senator Hawley wrote. “This has led to reports that the annual spring surge of illegal immigration will be even worse than usual.

He continued, “I am particularly alarmed at new reports suggesting that DHS plans to divert doctors from the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide free medical resources to those crossing our border illegally.”

Senator Hawley went on to highlight new reports that DHS plans to provide migrants with free phones, as well as alleged plans “to maximize the ability of illegal immigrants to apply for relief.”

He outlined a list of questions for Secretary Mayorkas, with a deadline of April 29, 2022, to respond.

April 6, 2022 
  
The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas 
Secretary of Homeland Security 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
245 Murray Lane, S.W. 
Washington D.C. 20528 
  
Secretary Mayorkas: 
  
I write with concern at the coming surge of illegal immigration this spring. The Biden Administration has announced that it intends to rescind its Title 42 order, which will only exacerbate the crisis at the southern border. At the same time, new reports and leaked documents suggest that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plans to divert resources from our veterans so that it can provide free services to illegal immigrants. These reports demand answers. 
  
We have a humanitarian crisis at our southern border. In 2021, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported over two million encounters with aliens illegally crossing the southern border—the highest number ever recorded. [1] One Arizona sector has experienced a 579% increase over the last fiscal year. [2] More than 62,000 illegal immigrants evaded Border Patrol agents in March. [3] What is more, some of the immigrants that CBP has caught have been identified as previously deported MS-13 gang members. [4] 
  
Rather than enforce our immigration laws, the Biden Administration has repeatedly changed existing policy to encourage, facilitate, and obscure illegal immigration. President Biden halted construction of the border wall, [5] reinforced DACA, [6] and limited ICE enforcement actions. [7] He has also illegally reversed the Trump Administration’s Remain in Mexico Policy—which is set to be argued before the Supreme Court later this month. 
  
Most recently, the Biden Administration announced its plan to rescind its Title 42 policy, prohibiting entry into the country of individuals carrying communicable diseases. [8] This disastrous policy decision has been widely criticized by both Democrats and Republicans alike. For example, Sen. Kelly called this “the wrong decision,” while Sen. Sinema said that such an action shows a “lack of understanding about the crisis at the border.” [9] Sen. Manchin has said that, “Today’s announcement by the CDC and the Biden Administration is a frightening decision. Title 42 has been an essential tool in combatting the spread of COVID-19 and controlling the influx of migrants at our southern border.” [10] Sen. Hassan has warned that, “Ending Title 42 prematurely will likely lead to a migrant surge that the administration does not appear to be ready for.” [11] 
  
This has led to reports that the annual spring surge of illegal immigration will be even worse than usual. In the words of one CBP agent, “We are expecting to get wrecked.” [12] Even the Washington Post acknowledges that “[t]he predictable effect of lifting Title 42 is a new influx of migrants from Central America and beyond, which would compound an existing surge at the U.S.-Mexican border.” [13] The Editorial Board correctly notes that this “was supposed to be Vice President Harris’s brief, but she appears to have done little to address the problem.” [14] Instead, we must brace for “chaos at the border.” [15] 
  
I am particularly alarmed at new reports suggesting that DHS plans to divert doctors from the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide free medical resources to those crossing our border illegally. In the words of one CBP official, “We’re going to take medical services away from people that really deserve that. Who went to combat… to give free medical attention to illegal migrants.” [16] 
  
There are also reports that DHS plans to provide migrants with free phones. [17] In addition, a leaked memorandum titled “DHS Southwest Border Mass Irregular Contingency Plan” details your plan to maximize the ability of illegal immigrants to apply for relief. [18] 
  
These new reports deserve immediate answers. They should be confirmed or denied promptly. So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, please provide the following information by April 29, 2022:Sincerely,         
Josh Hawley

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/democrats-block-hawley-bill-get-tough-child-sex-offenders,"U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) went to the Senate Floor today to call for unanimous consent to pass his PROTECT Act of 2022, which protects children from sexual exploitation by enhancing the penalties for possessing child pornography and preventing judges from sentencing offenders below federal guidelines. Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) objected and blocked the bill from passing.

Senator Hawley said, “Child sex trafficking is an exploding epidemic in my state, and around our country. Children are exploited, children are trafficked and those who work in this area, those who prosecute in this area, law enforcement who work day in and day out will tell you that the explosion of child pornography is helping to drive this exploding epidemic of child exploitation and child sex trafficking.”

“The fact that the Senate hasn’t acted until now, is, I think, is shameful for the Senate. But why wait another day? […] I am not willing to sit by and tell the parents of my state that I did nothing. I am not willing to dismiss child exploitation as just some conspiracy theory. I am not willing to abandon the victims of this crime,” Senator Hawley continued following Durbin’s objection.Senator Durbin, who rebutted, criticized Senator Hawley’s decision to call for a vote after recently introducing the bill in the Senate. “Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois says that Congress hasn’t acted in two decades, that’s true. I haven’t been here for two decades, he has,” replied Senator Hawley.Senator Durbin, with support from Senators Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Schumer (D-N.Y.), passed similar legislation in 2003. The PROTECT Act worked. But the Supreme Court gutted it in 2005, in a controversial 5-4 decision called United States v. Booker, allowing judges like Ketanji Brown Jackson the ability to impose lenient sentences on child porn offenders. 

The PROTECT ACT of 2022 would create a new mandatory minimum sentence of five years for every child porn offender who possesses pornography, and prohibit judges from sentencing below the Guidelines range for facts found during trial or admitted by the defendant. This change will ensure that judges impose tougher sentences on child pornography offenders.

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/senator-hawley-calls-out-liberal-lies-opposes-judge-jacksons-nomination,"Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) delivered his closing statement in the Senate Judiciary Markup for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Supreme Court nomination.

In his closing statement, Senator Hawley reinforced his stance against Judge Jackson’s record for lenient sentencing for pedophiles, and continued to express his opposition to her nomination. Judge Jackson refused to respond when asked about her sentencing record in various child pornography cases during her confirmation hearings.
Senator Hawley said, “We’ve heard in Judge Jackson’s defense, and I don’t know if it’s really much of a defense – I know she didn’t say these things – but in her defense, by the White House and members of this committee, we’ve been told things like ‘child pornography is actually all a conspiracy, it’s not real, it’s just a conspiracy, it’s made up.’ Let me just say for the record, sex crimes against children are not fiction. They are not a conspiracy.”

He continued, “There are 85 million images of children being exploited available on the internet. I’m a former prosecutor. These are real crimes. I’m a father of three young children. These are real children. And these aren’t victimless crimes. Just because they’re images doesn’t mean real kids aren’t involved. As we heard testimony from prosecutors and experts just two weeks ago, child pornography creates a cycle of trafficking, of exploitation, of abuse. It is the children here who are the victims, not the criminals. On that core point, I disagree fundamentally with Judge Jackson. I wish her well, but I cannot support her nomination.”In response to the growing epidemic of child pornography in the United States, Senator Hawley introduced the PROTECT Act of 2022, which protects children from sexual exploitation by enhancing the penalties for possessing child pornography and by preventing judges from sentencing offenders below federal guidelines.

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-leads-bill-protect-children-toughen-sentences-child-porn-offenders,"U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the PROTECT Act of 2022, which protects children from sexual exploitation by enhancing the penalties for possessing child pornography and by preventing judges from sentencing offenders below federal guidelines. The bill is co-sponsored by Senators Mike Lee (R-Utah), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.). Representative Ken Buck (CO-4) is introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives.

The epidemic of child pornography in the United States is growing exponentially. Just over a decade ago, the number of images of child sexual abuse material online was less than 1 million. That number grew to 45 million in 2018, and to 85 million in 2021.

By federal statute, judges are required to sentence criminals within ranges set by the federal “Sentencing Guidelines,” subject to some exceptions. In 2003, Congress passed the original PROTECT Act to curtail the exceptions—and enhance the penalties—in child pornography cases.

The PROTECT Act worked. But the Supreme Court gutted it in 2005, in United States v. Booker, a controversial 5-4 decision. Since then, some federal judges like Ketanji Brown Jackson have used their discretion to impose lenient sentences on child porn offenders. Sen. Hawley’s bill would prevent judges from doing so in the future.

“The horror of child pornography is exponentially worse than it was a decade ago, and judges handing out lenient sentences for these criminals is a big reason why,” said Senator Hawley. “While the White House continues to dismiss concerns about leniency toward child porn offenders as a ‘desperate conspiracy theory,’ the numbers speak for themselves. Congress must act before this problem becomes even worse.”

Representative Buck said, “The confirmation hearings of Biden’s Supreme Court nominee have exposed a troubling leniency on the left and, most surprisingly, on the right for those who commit sexual offenses against children.  It’s time for Congress to stand with the victims of these offenses, and to ensure that perpetrators receive the severe punishment these crimes deserve.”

Senator Lee said, ""Those who view and share Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) fuel demand for the sexual abuse of children.  Last week’s hearings showed that activist judges will not do their job unless Congress mandates minimum sentences for these violent crimes.  This bill would make the law in this area crystal clear: if you view or share CSAM, you’ll go to prison for a very long time.""

Senator Scott said, “Our communities must be protected from sick individuals who exploit and victimize children, and also from liberal activist judges who abuse their sentencing discretion to let offenders off the hook. Federal sentencing guidelines for these heinous crimes are critical and I am proud to support this good bill to ensure guidelines are strictly enforced.”Senator Tillis said, “There is bipartisan consensus that Congress must act to ensure we impose strong penalties on people in possession of child pornography. The PROTECT Act will protect our children and ensure sexual predators receive the appropriate sentence for receiving or possessing child pornography.”

However, it stated that “despite being in treatment for more than five years,” Hawkins “continues to seek out sexually arousing, non-pornographic material and images of males 13 to 16-years-old.”The petition asked Jackson to order closer supervision to reduce the risk of recidivism and help Hawkins regain independent function.Read the full article here.555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

Senator Hawley writes that while the administration has refused to acknowledge this an anti-Semitic attack, President Joe Biden must do so immediately.“The failure to adequately vet those entering our country is nothing new. The Biden Administration’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan led to the evacuation of tens of thousands of Afghans into the United States,” writes Senator Hawley. “It is past time to begin conducting in-person vetting of immigrants to this country. That is what the 9/11 Commission report strongly recommended. It should now be clear that this is necessary to protect U.S. citizens from terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.”In December 2021, Secretaries Blinken and Mayorkas announced new policies eliminating in-person interviews for visa applicants, which Senator Hawley called on the administration to immediately rescind.In light of these changes, Senator Hawley asked the administration to answer by January 21, 2022 whether the Islamic terrorist had received an in-person interview before being permitted to enter the country, whether federal agencies were aware of his criminal record, and on what basis he was granted a travel visa.Read the full letter here or below.

Secretaries Blinken and Mayorkas,I write with alarm over reports that the Islamic terrorist who took hostages at a Jewish synagogue in Texas this past weekend was granted a travel visa, despite his long criminal record and a series of red flags. This failure comes in the wake of the Biden Administration’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan and failure to vet the tens of thousands who were evacuated to our country. I have repeatedly called on this Administration to require in-person vetting to avoid precisely the sort of terrorist incident we witnessed this weekend. Yet the Biden Administration has moved in the opposite direction, waving in-person vetting for new classes of visa holders. It is time to reverse this trend and begin enforcing our immigration laws. A key step in this effort is understanding how your agencies allowed the terrorist who took hostages in Texas into this country despite his known background.The hostage crisis this weekend was an anti-Semitic attack on the Jewish community in a house of worship. It was perpetrated by an Islamic terrorist who had a criminal history and yet was able to obtain a travel visa to the United States during the pandemic. On December 27, 2021, he traveled from the United Kingdom to John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City, where he was welcomed into this country just weeks before the terrorist attack. But this all could have been averted if your Departments had adequately vetted his visa application and stopped him at the airport.According to reports, [1] the Islamic terrorist had a lengthy criminal history. He was a 44-year British citizen with a number of red flags:According to reports, he was also known to British intelligence and was recently a “subject of interest.” [2] How is anyone with this background allowed to enter our country? Indeed, that was the same reaction that the terrorist’s brother and neighbors had. Either your Departments knowingly allowed entry to someone with demonstrated sympathies for terrorist organizations and predilection toward violence, or they failed to conduct even a cursory background check.Even during the standoff with the terrorist while he was still alive, the Biden Administration was in denial that an anti-Semitic terrorist attack was underway. The FBI’s Special Agent in Charge said, “We do believe from our engaging with this subject that he was singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community.” [3] An Islamic terrorist had a rabbi and other members of the congregation at gunpoint, held as hostages, in the Jewish synagogue, and yet the Biden Administration could not bring itself to recognize this abhorrent anti-Semitic attack.The failure to adequately vet those entering our country is nothing new. The Biden Administration’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan led to the evacuation of tens of thousands of Afghans into the United States. We now know that these individuals were not adequately vetted and did not undergo in-person vetting, as recommended by the 9/11 Commission.I have repeatedly called on the Biden Administration to address this issue and conduct in-person vetting. Yet at the same time, your Departments have moved in the opposite direction, going to so far as to waive the use of in-person interviews for entire classes of visa applicants—policies that I demanded you rescind in my January 5, 2022 letter addressed to you both. [7]It is past time to begin conducting in-person vetting of immigrants to this country. That is what the 9/11 Commission report strongly recommended. It should now be clear that this is necessary to protect U.S. citizens from terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, please provide the following information by January 21, 2022:Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Zuckerberg, 

Last month, the Tech Transparency Project (TTP) published the results of an investigation which found that drug dealers openly operate on Instagram and sell illicit substances that are easily accessible to teenagers as young as 13 years old. Not only does Instagram allow teenagers to easily search for Xanax, Adderall, ecstasy, and a variety of prescription opioids, some of which are laced with fentanyl, but the report also finds that the “platform’s algorithms helped the underage accounts connect directly with drug dealers” and “started recommending other accounts selling drugs.” 

The findings of the report are horrifying, especially as our nation confronts a drug overdose epidemic of historic proportions and an alarming deterioration of teenagers’ mental health precipitated by the coronavirus pandemic and misguided mitigation measures to it. According to provisional data from the National Center for Health Statistics released in November, more than 100,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in the 12-month period between May 2020 and April 2021—a record high and a 30 percent increase over the previous year.Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that emergency department visits for suspected suicide attempts were 51 percent higher for adolescent girls in early 2021 compared to the same time period in early 2019. 

It is unconscionable that any company would aid and abet this epidemic of death and despair. Unfortunately, given Instagram’s blatant disregard for the mental health of its young users, the findings from TPP’s investigation are not shocking. The findings further demonstrate the need to pass legislation to hold social media companies like Instagram accountable for the harm it inflicts on young Americans, as I have proposed. In the meantime, American parents deserve to know the steps your company is taking to ensure that their children do not have access to illicit drugs.

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-demands-answers-after-intel-apologizes-ccp-scrubs-references-chinese-slave-labor,"Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger demanding answers on the company’s failure to condemn slave labor in their global supply chains and their apparent willingness to accommodate the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). This comes after Intel scrubbed all references to Xinjiang from its annual supplier letter and apologized to the CCP for implementing U.S. law.

Senator Hawley wrote, “In its December 2021 annual letter to suppliers, Intel noted that the company is ‘required to ensure our supply chain does not use any labor or source goods or services from the Xinjiang region.’  Apparently, such boilerplate language was too much for the Chinese Communist regime to abide. Only one week after the letter was published in the U.S., Intel posted an apology on Chinese social media, saying the letter was only written to ‘comply with U.S. law.’”

He continued, “Intel’s recent willingness to accommodate Beijing is startling. An objective observer could reasonably assume that your company will look away from human rights abuses if acknowledging them risks provoking the ire of a major commercial interest. And due to these actions, how can we be certain that Intel is serious about implementing requirements set forth by U.S. law with respect to forced labor?”

Senator Hawley called on Intel to clarify how they plan to ensure their supply chain is free of forced labor, whether they removed references to Xinjiang from their letter following pressure from Beijing, and whether they believe the U.S. government should do more to ensure corporate supply chains are slave-free.

Dear Mr. Gelsinger: 

I write today to express my concern that Intel Corporation seems willing to support global slavery in its business practices. I would hope this is not the case, but recent actions taken by your company have not inspired confidence. It’s imperative that you provide Congress and the public with an explanation. 

The State Department’s 2021 Trafficking in Persons Report made clear that forced labor – the use of force, fraud, or coercion to compel individuals to perform labor – remains a persistent challenge globally. Nowhere is this grievous practice more evident than in China’s Xinjiang region, where the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) subjects an estimated one million Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic and religious minorities to slave labor and other human rights abuses. In response to these atrocities, Congress overwhelmingly passed and President Biden signed into law the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, important legislation that strengthens our country’s bans on the importation of goods made with forced labor. 

In its December 2021 annual letter to suppliers, Intel noted that the company is “required to ensure our supply chain does not use any labor or source goods or services from the Xinjiang region.” Apparently, such boilerplate language was too much for the Chinese Communist regime to abide. Only one week after the letter was published in the U.S., Intel posted an apology on Chinese social media, saying the letter was only written to “comply with U.S. law.” 

Worse, Intel has now scrubbed its supplier letter of all references to Xinjiang.[1] Intel’s recent willingness to accommodate Beijing is startling. An objective observer could reasonably assume that your company will look away from human rights abuses if acknowledging them risks provoking the ire of a major commercial interest. And due to these actions, how can we be certain that Intel is serious about implementing requirements set forth by U.S. law with respect to forced labor?  

Please provide my office with written responses to the following questions no later than January 31, 2022:  
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

During a week where you have vociferously condemned those who tried to obstruct congressional proceedings last January 6th, you must also be similarly willing to call out leftist activists who have also engaged in criminal acts to interfere with democracy.""He continued, ""When it comes to political violence and criminal obstruction of government by the left, the silence by Democrats has been deafening. Democrats looked the other way when antifa rioters torched a federal courthouse in Portland. They did the same when left-wing rioters in Seattle seized power from a democratically elected government and tried to secede by creating a breakaway anarchist zone. And they did the same when hundreds unlawfully trespassed into the Senate to disrupt the nomination process of Justice Kavanaugh and then tried to breach the Supreme Court in an attempt to prevent Justice Kavanaugh from taking his oath.""Shut Down DC has engaged in calculated, unlawful harassment campaigns against many government officials. Last year, Shut Down DC showed up at Senator Hawley's house at night to harass his wife and newborn baby. They screamed threats through bullhorns, vandalized property, trespassed, and physically shoved a neighbor who asked them to stop. The group's leader was charged with -- and pled to -- criminal trespass.  ""If in fact you truly believe that attempts to interfere with democracy should be condemned, then you must break from your past silence and begin condemning those actions when they are committed by the left. It is imperative that you ask members of your caucus to shun groups like Shut Down DC and to cancel their plans to speak at their event,"" Senator Hawley concluded.Read the full letter here.555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-demands-dos-and-dhs-rescind-new-policies-eliminating-person-interviews-visa-applicants,"Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to Department of State Secretary Antony Blinken and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas after both departments announced they would dispense with in-person interviews during the vetting process for roughly 49,000 immigrant visa applicants, and eliminate altogether the interview requirement for spouses and children of refugees seeking citizenship.Sen. Hawley is demanding that the departments rescind the new policies, and also called out the Biden Administration for normalizing its historic failures in the Afghanistan withdrawal — including its failure to implement standard in-person vetting of more than 80,000 Afghan refugees. Senator Hawley writes, ""The first and highest priority of our immigration system is homeland security. It is paramount that we ensure that everyone who enters our country does not pose a threat to public safety. But it appears that the Biden Administration is now doubling down on its failed attempt to adequately vet those evacuated from Afghanistan. These new policies are a transparent ploy to normalize that failed vetting process.""You can read the full letter HERE and below: January 5, 2022The Honorable Antony Blinken Secretary of State
U.S. Department of State
2201 C Street NW Washington, D.C. 20520

The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas Secretary
U.S. Department of Homeland Security 301 7th Street, SW
Washington, D.C. 20528Secretary Blinken and Secretary Mayorkas,I write with grave concern over the Department of State and Department of Homeland Security’s unjustifiable decision to dispense with in-person interviews for those wishing to immigrate to our country. These policies are dangerous and transparent attempts to normalize the Biden Administration’s historic failures during the evacuation from Afghanistan. They should be rescinded immediately.

President Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan was one of the worst military fiascos in modern history. On August 26, 2021, thirteen American servicemembers were killed by an explosion at Kabul airport, and hundreds of civilians were injured. During the haphazard airlift, the Biden Administration evacuated over 80,000 individuals from Afghanistan. But we now know that the Biden Administration failed to adequately vet those brought to the United States.

Our nation’s immigration policies have generally required that immigrants undergo an in-person interview so that government officials can review immigrants’ documents and evaluate the truthfulness of their claims. Indeed, the 9/11 Commission’s report emphasized that several would-be terrorists were thwarted by the in-person interview process. For example, “One potential hijacker was turned back by an immigration inspector as he tried to enter the United States. The inspector relied on intuitive experience to ask questions more than he relied on any objective factor that could be detected by ‘scores’ or a machine. Good people who have worked in such jobs for a long time understand this phenomenon well.”1 Examples like this illustrate the critical role that in-person interviews play in our immigration programs.Yet last month, the Department of State announced that it will temporarily waive the interview requirement for roughly 49,000 immigrant visa applications.2 Under this temporary rule, consular officers will have ""discretion to allow this subset of immigrant visa applicants to affirm the accuracy of the contents of their application without appearing in person before a consular officer.""

Also last month, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it is waiving the interview requirement for certain spouses and children. Remarkably, Biden Administration officials have indicated that they now believe the in-person interview requirement is ""inconsistent"" with President Biden’s executive orders calling for a more inclusive immigration system.

The first and highest priority of our immigration system is homeland security. It is paramount that we ensure that everyone who enters our country does not pose a threat to public safety. But it appears that the Biden Administration is now doubling down on its failed attempt to adequately vet those evacuated from Afghanistan. These new policies are a transparent ploy to normalize that failed vetting process.I therefore call on you to immediately rescind these misguided policies and ensure that everyone who enters this country has been adequately vetted.Sincerely,Josh Hawley

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-op-ed-democrats-brought-us-year-fear-2021-2022-let-us-be-not-afraid-and-reclaim-our-american,"On Tuesday, Senator Hawley (R-Mo.) published an op-ed with Fox News on the left's year of fear mongering.2021 was a year of fear instigated by Democrats and the Left. 2022 doesn’t have to be. It can be the year we say no to fear and reclaim our heritage as Americans. 

The fear campaign started on January 6, following the demonstration in Washington that turned violent after some demonstrators breached the Capitol. But that was only the second most surprising thing about that day. The most surprising outcome—and the day’s true legacy—was the Left’s attempt to use the Capitol unrest to foster a permanent climate of fear and repression. ...What interested the Left about the riot on January 6 was that it could be connected to Trump supporters, conservatives. They proclaimed conservatives a threat to public safety and marshaled their institutional power to drive political opposition into silence.

A year later, we know all too well what this looks like.

It looks like the president of the United States brazenly lying about election integrity laws in Georgia and coordinating with Major League Baseball to kill thousands of jobs in that state to the tune of $100 million.

It looks like the Attorney General deploying the National Security Division of the Justice Department against parents who speak out at school board meetings, all while lying about it to Congress.It looks like government lawyers drawing up lists of federal crimes for which these same parents could be prosecuted should they dare raise their voices about their children’s education.

It looks like Big Tech relentlessly censoring citizens’ questions about election integrity, and then about the origins of COVID, and then about the assault on women’s sports, enforcing the Left’s party line.

In sum, it looks like the most powerful members of our government and society deploying their authority against ordinary people exercising ordinary rights, with the purpose of intimidating them into silence. ...2022 can be a new chapter if we take a stand against those who would use their power to terrorize and intimidate. 

This year, don’t give into fear. Don’t be shouted down. Don’t be intimidated. This year, let’s live instead by this maxim: We will not be afraid, because we are Americans.

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sen-hawley-colleagues-introduce-bill-subject-mlb-antitrust-laws,"Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) have introduced a bill to remove the antitrust exemption that has been in place for Major League Baseball to subject them to existing law. Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), with over 20 cosponsors, has produced companion legislation in the House.""MLB and woke mega-corporations have been coddled by government for too long,” said Sen. Hawley. “For decades, the MLB has been given a sweetheart deal by Washington politicians. But if they’d prefer to be partisan political activists instead, maybe it’s time to rethink that. With their capitulation to the left-wing Twitter mob and support for Biden’s big lie about election integrity, they’ve forfeited any right to an anti-trust exemption. They must be held to the same standard as the rest of American business.”Senator Hawley’s comments from the press conference announcing the bill are available here.“Consumers benefit when businesses compete, and baseball is no different. In fact, a professional sports league should understand best of all the benefits of competition,” said Sen. Lee. “Instead, Major League Baseball has used its judicially fabricated antitrust immunity to suppress wages and divide up markets for decades—conduct that is plainly illegal, and sometimes criminal, in any other industry. We should have done this decades ago, but when billion-dollar businesses start engaging in political extortion it becomes even more pressing to end their special treatment.”“For nearly a century, Major League Baseball has enjoyed a special exemption from antitrust laws that other professional sports leagues do not,” said Sen. Cruz. “Major League Baseball asks for your ID when you pick up tickets at will-call, but they have made it clear they oppose photo ID requirements to vote. If Major League Baseball is going to act dishonestly and spread lies about Georgia’s voting rights bill to favor one party against the other, they shouldn’t expect to continue to receive special benefits from Congress.”“A corporation that happily does business with the communist regimes in Cuba and China but caves to woke CEOs who want to punish states with Voter ID does not deserve any special immunities in antitrust law,” said Sen. Blackburn.“For decades, Major League Baseball has enjoyed a special exemption from the same antitrust laws that govern other businesses in our nation,” Sen. Rubio said. “The league has been able to escape scrutiny in part thanks to its perception as a good-faith guardian of America’s national pastime. But with its reprehensible decision to play politics and punish the State of Georgia – and countless small and minority-owned Georgian businesses – by moving the All-Star Game out of Atlanta, the MLB has shown its willingness to use its market power, derived from its antitrust exemption, irresponsibly. Now, Congress is obligated to revisit this unique treatment.”“Major League Baseball has enjoyed constitutionally questionable antitrust protections for a century, yet it has decided to act in a partisan manner by punishing the state of Georgia for completely reasonable voter integrity and election security legislation,” said. Rep. Duncan. “Commissioner Manfred’s decision was ill-advised and will cost Atlanta small businesses, many of which are minority-owned, around $100M in economic activity. Furthermore, public polling has consistently shown overwhelming bipartisan support for voter ID laws, which are the cornerstone of the Georgia elections reform bill. This is just the latest in a wave of corporate decisions to ‘Go Woke.’ If companies or organizations want to undermine efforts to ensure the integrity of our elections process, then they invite increased scrutiny of their business practices. I urge Major League Baseball to reconsider this short-sighted decision, and I urge my colleagues to stand strong against the onslaught of the Woke Left on daily American life.""Bill text can be found here.555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

They allow the CCP to influence what college students are taught and obstruct the freedom of speech on campuses. As Li Changchun, a senior member of the CCP, stated in 2009, the Confucius Institutes are “an important part of China’s overseas propaganda set-up.”“Confucius Institutes allow the Chinese regime to funnel propaganda into American universities under the guise of educational enrichment. It’s long past time that this is made clear to Americans up front, and that anyone involved with these centers face background checks. Anything else would be an abdication of our national security efforts,”Senator Hawley has previously asked Missouri universities to reconsider their partnerships with the Confucius Institutes and commended the University of Missouri for shutting down its Confucius Institute.The Transparency for Confucius Institutes Act amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require program participation agreements between the CCP agency which administers educational programs, known as the Hanban, and American institutions to address the ways in which Beijing exerts undue influence through Confucius Institutes, including:555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW 
Washington, DC 20500Dear Mr. President:I write today to urge you to extend the freeze on temporary foreign worker entries into the United States that, without intervention, will expire today. The presidential proclamation suspending entry of certain temporary workers into the U.S. has protected Americans suffering from the pandemic-induced economic crisis. With millions of struggling Americans out of work – and millions more desperate to make ends meet – now is not the time to open the floodgates to thousands of foreign workers competing with American workers for scarce jobs and resources.As you know, in June of 2020 the Trump administration issued Proclamation 10052 as a part of the coronavirus response effort. [1] The proclamation suspended entry to the United States of applicants for several temporary or “nonimmigrant” visa categories that presented a risk to the U.S. labor market during the economic recovery. On December 31, 2020, the administration extended the order to March 31, 2021, [2] noting that an extension was warranted as the pandemic continued to disrupt American’s lives, and high levels of unemployment and job loss were still presenting serious economic challenges to workers across the United States.These challenges persist today. The unemployment rate remains at 6.2 percent – with nearly 10 million Americans out of work and looking for a job. [3] The pandemic has been especially devastating for low-income and working class Americans, many of whom have borne the brunt of the crisis – and stand to lose the most from misguided policy decisions.In periods of high unemployment, it makes no sense to allow a struggling labor market to be flooded with a wave of foreign competition. What makes even less sense is to willingly introduce further competition for U.S. workers at the same time that a disastrous illegal immigration crisis grows on our southern border. As at the border, failure to take meaningful action is, in itself, a policy decision with detrimental impacts for American workers.I urge you to extend the temporary foreign worker entry suspension until the national unemployment rate has meaningfully declined, and until your administration has conducted a thorough review of nonimmigrant visa programs to ensure that American workers are fully and effectively protected from harm. In the meantime, I will continue to work to develop legislative solutions that will protect American workers and promote a quick recovery.Sincerely,Josh Hawley

David Dorn is honored with the “Single Act of Heroism Award,” an award recognizing Americans who accomplish extraordinary feats of heroism by risking their lives for the benefit of others in a dire situation.""David Dorn was dedicated to helping others and protecting his community, even after he retired from law enforcement and through his last moments with us. His character represents the absolute best of Missouri and this country.""“This award may be rare, but the exceptional courage and devotion of Officer Dorn is shared by his brothers and sisters in blue who put their lives on the line to keep us safe. Our local law enforcement officers deserve our sincerest gratitude for protecting our communities every single day.""Last summer, the Senate adopted a resolution sponsored by Senators Hawley and Blunt to honor the life of Officer Dorn. Senator Hawley recently cosponsored legislation to create federal penalties for individuals who deliberately target local, state, or federal law enforcement officers with violence.Text of Senator Hawley’s letter nominating Officer Dorn is below:In the early morning hours of June 2, 2020, David Dorn learned that his friend’s business was being ransacked by looters. So in the middle of the night, David promptly left the safety of his St. Louis home to save his friend’s livelihood and protect his community.David Dorn was a father to five children, a grandfather to ten grandchildren, and loving husband to Ann Dorn. Before retiring in 2014, David spent 38 years serving his neighbors as a police officer and was a well-known pillar of his community.When David arrived at his friend’s business, indeed, seven burglars were looting the shop. A gunman opened fire on David Dorn, mortally wounding him on the sidewalk. This senseless act of violence was streamed live on social media, where his own grandson watched in horror.His tragic death galvanized the people of St. Louis and two days later, they gathered to honor David Dorn and participated in a march to end violence.The actions of David Dorn are in keeping with Missouri’s finest traditions of selfless service and reflect great credit upon himself, his community, and the entire State of Missouri.Therefore, Senator Josh Hawley is honored to nominate David Dorn for the Congressional Medal of Honor Society’s, 2020 Citizen Honors Award.Each year only five U.S. citizens receive a Congressional Medal of Honor Citizen Honors Award. These five individuals and one organization exemplify the values embodied in the Medal of Honor: courage, sacrifice, commitment, integrity, citizenship, and patriotism.A panel assembled by the Congressional Medal of Honor Society considers all nominations and selects national finalists.

Washington, DC 20510Dear Chairman Durbin,We write to request that you schedule a full Committee hearing immediately on major new revelations regarding the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) antitrust investigation into Google. It is critical that the Committee conduct oversight into enforcement—or underenforcement—of our nation’s antitrust laws. I ask that you use your authority as Chairman to call Google executives and relevant FTC officials to publicly testify, including the former Commissioners who now represent big tech firms. Today, we are also sending a letter to FTC Acting Chair Rebecca Kelly Slaughter urging her to dispatch relevant officials to Congress as soon as possible.Recent reporting from Politico details previously undisclosed internal memorandums from FTC lawyers and economists, written from 2011 to 2013 during the agency’s investigation into Google’s business practices. [1] The reporting confirms what has become increasingly apparent in recent years: confronted with the most consequential antitrust case in a generation, and ample evidence of market dominance and misconduct, the nation’s antitrust enforcers failed to act. Instead, after a 19-month investigation, the Obama Administration’s FTC agreed to a non-binding sweetheart deal proposed by Google itself. This is outrageous.The FTC’s inaction has had broad-sweeping implications for our economy, our culture, and our democracy. In the intervening years, Google has amassed—and exploited—an ever-growing market share in search and digital advertising and smartphones, and has used these dominant positions to make inroads into other product lines and services.

Washington, D.C. 20580Dear Acting Chair Slaughter, We write regarding major new revelations regarding the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) antitrust investigation into Google, and its determination not to pursue enforcement actions in accordance with the nation’s antitrust laws. Today, we also sent a letter to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary demanding a hearing on this matter, and expect FTC officials to appear before Congress to publicly testify about the decision not to pursue enforcement. Not since the Gilded Age have so few firms dominated such large swaths of the U.S. economy. Recent reporting from Politico provides some insight into the regulatory failures that allowed for the current state of affairs to metastasize. [1] The reporting details previously undisclosed internal memorandums from FTC lawyers and economists, written from 2011 to 2013 during the agency’s investigation into Google’s business practices. The reporting confirms what has become increasingly apparent in recent years: confronted with the most consequential antitrust case in a generation, and ample evidence of market power and anticompetitive conduct, the FTC failed to act. Rather than enforce the antitrust laws enacted by Congress, the Obama Administration’s FTC, after a 19-month investigation, instead agreed to a non-binding sweetheart deal proposed by Google itself. This is outrageous.Unsurprisingly, this regulatory slap on the wrist did little to discourage the tech firm from deploying anticompetitive practices in its quest for monopoly power. In the intervening years, Google has amassed an ever-growing market share in search and digital advertising and smartphones, and has exploited that market power to make inroads into other product lines and services, oftentimes discriminating against its competitors. As distressing as these consequences may be, the FTC’s inaction has had consequences far beyond the market power of a single firm or the market concentration of a single industry. The FTC’s failure to enforce the nation’s antitrust laws signaled to similarly dominant market participants, in tech or elsewhere, that compliance is optional. In other words, lax enforcement of our laws encourages lawlessness. This has had broad-sweeping implications for our economy, our culture, and our democracy.The regulators responsible for this era of underenforcement must be held to account, under oath. We urge you to cooperate with congressional efforts to conduct oversight into enforcement—or, underenforcement—of our nation’s antitrust laws.Sincerely,Josh Hawley

The Honorable Alejandro N. Mayorkas 
Secretary 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
Washington, D.C. 20528 

Dear Secretary Mayorkas:  

On March 11, 2021, your department reversed recent changes to the “public charge” rule – a Trump-era policy that sought to enforce existing immigration law.[1] The rule stipulates that the majority of noncitizen immigrants deemed likely to become dependent on public assistance should not be allowed to enter the United States or change their visa status to remain longer in the country. I write today to urge you to reinstate those changes. 

As you undoubtedly know, current immigration law provides that any alien (with exceptions for especially vulnerable individuals) who is “likely at any time to become a public charge” becomes inadmissible for a visa to the United States or adjustment of visa status.[2] In keeping with that law, in August of 2019, the Trump administration issued a final rule clarifying the terms of the existing statute and outlining the factors that the Department of Homeland Security would consider when making a “public charge” determination.[3] Among other things, the rule included a requirement that any alien seeking an extension of stay or status change should show that they had not been consistently dependent on public assistance, including cash benefits as well as in-kind benefits such as Medicaid, housing vouchers, and food stamps. Contrary to the apocalyptic tone of some media coverage, the rule clarified that these limitations do not apply to asylees and several other vulnerable populations outlined in the underlying statute and rule. Rather, such a rule was both rational and necessary: the American government has a responsibility to prioritize, first and foremost, the well-being of taxpaying citizens. That is the first duty of any regime. 

The American economic situation has grown much more dire since then. We are in the middle of a national pandemic, millions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet, and there is a burgeoning crisis at the border. Under conditions like these, this is perhaps the worst imaginable time to gut this important safeguard. By creating a fresh incentive for foreign migrants to surge across our southern border, your actions reflect a profound misunderstanding of the plight of American workers and communities across the country, and threaten to further exacerbate an already severe humanitarian disaster. 

This dangerous moment is no time for the Department to change course. The public charge rule serves the essential purpose of protecting Americans’ welfare first and foremost, and it should be immediately reinstated. 

Sincerely,                                          


Josh Hawley 
United States Senator

The U.S. Military Right to Carry Act allows servicemembers to renew their permits by mail and requires states to treat members of the military equally to state residents in issuing concealed carry permits.“There is no reason the brave men and women who put their lives on the line for this country should have to fight through endless bureaucratic hurdles and red tape to maintain their concealed carry licenses. I’m proud to stand with my colleagues on behalf of our military service members and their Second Amendment rights.""""The men and women who served this country in the United States Military have earned the right to not face discrimination when it comes to their concealed carry permits,"" said Rep. Jason Smith. ""If a member of the U.S. Armed Forces holds a concealed carry permit, they should be able to renew that permit by mail or be treated as a resident of the state in which they are stationed.

Over the past couple days, Palestinian terrorists in Gaza, who are funded by Iran, have launched a series of rocket attacks into Israel. They are targeting Israeli civilians and cities, including Israel’s capital Jerusalem. This is troubling as members of your administration are currently in Vienna negotiating with Iran, the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. In light of these recent attacks by Hamas against Israel, the United States should take all steps necessary to hold Tehran accountable and under no circumstances, provide sanctions relief to Iran. This is especially important as Iran is supporting terrorist activity against the United States’ closest ally in the region, Israel.As you know, Palestinian terrorist groups launched more than 1,000 rockets targeting Israel over the last few days alone. This includes the first rockets aimed at Jerusalem since 2014. While the United States and countries around the world condemned these rocket attacks, Iran resoundingly supports this aggression. Shortly after the attacks began, and as they continued, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei tweeted that Palestinians should unite to “use the tools of their disposal” to attack Israel, which he recently called not a nation, but a “terrorist garrison.” Even the Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohammed Javad Zarif, who currently is supervising Iran’s negotiating team in Vienna, called Hamas’ leader Ismail Haniyeh to express Iran’s support for the group’s actions.The United States designated Hamas as a terrorist organization in 1997 and as such, is prohibited from providing any funds to Hamas. Iran, however, is a longtime financial and material supporter of Hamas. The United States engaging in active negotiations with Iran and potentially providing billions of dollars in sanctions relief will no doubt contribute to Iran’s support of Hamas and other terrorist organizations who attack Americans and our allies. We call on you to immediately end negotiations with Iran, and make clear that sanctions relief will not be provided. Doing so would demonstrate a firm commitment to our closest ally in the region and to our own security interests.The United States must not do anything to enrich Israel’s enemies, such as by offering sanctions relief to a regime that seeks to destroy Israel. As a longtime friend of the Jewish state, we also urge you to unequivocally support Israel’s right to defend itself against any and all terrorist attacks.Respectfully,555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

Senator Hawley’s bill is cosponsored by Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.).""TikTok is an immediate security threat that has no place on government devices. This should not be a partisan issue and I’m glad to see my colleagues in the Senate act together to address Beijing’s covert data collection campaign. Banning TikTok from government devices is a good first step towards taking Chinese espionage seriously.""Senator Scott said, “I applaud the Committee’s unanimous passage of our legislation to ban the use of TikTok, which is connected to the Chinese Communist Party, by federal employees on government devices. Communist China has shown again and again that it will stop at nothing to infiltrate our government networks and steal American technology. Today’s passage is a critical step to protecting our national security.”“There is absolutely no reason why TikTok, an application that Beijing can use to collect Americans’ personal data, should be available on government devices,” Senator Rubio said. “I am glad to see the Senate finally moving forward on this issue.”Senator Cotton said, “TikTok gathers and then stores private information on servers accessible by the Chinese Communist Party. TikTok shouldn’t be allowed on government devices, and I’m pleased to see our bill advance out of committee.”Senator Hawley originally introduced the No TikTok on Government Devices Act in March 2020, following a Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee hearing he chaired, entitled “Dangerous Partners: Big Tech & Beijing,” when TikTok refused to testify.

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/senator-hawley-introduces-parent-tax-credit-historic-relief-working-families,"Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced legislation to create the Parent Tax Credit, a historic tax cut to help working parents afford to start a family and raise their children. Through a fully refundable tax credit provided directly through automatic, monthly advances, Senator Hawley’s Parent Tax Credit gives working parents the flexibility they need to make the best choices for raising their families. ""Starting a family and raising children should not be a privilege only reserved for the wealthy. Millions of working people want to start a family and would like to care for their children at home, but current policies do not respect these preferences. American families should be supported, no matter how they choose to care for their kids.""Although most American families believe children are better off when one parent stays home to care for them, current federal childcare programs and policies force both parents into the labor market and require children be enrolled in formal commercial childcare. Senator Hawley’s legislation creates a fully refundable tax credit of $6,000 for single parents and $12,000 for married parents with qualifying children. Over the past several decades it has become increasingly difficult for working- and middle-class parents to afford to raise a family. Take childcare: Although most American families believe children are better off when one parent stays home to care for them, often both mom and dad feel they must enter the workforce to be able to afford kids.Current law doesn’t help. Existing federal childcare programs and policies—such as the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit—actually require both parents to enter the labor market in order to receive the benefits. These polices also require that children be enrolled in formal commercial childcare. And they frequently reserve the greatest benefits for upper-income earners. Current law does little or nothing for the millions of working families who would prefer to care for their children at home.Senator Hawley believes that American families should be supported, no matter how they choose to care for their kids. That is why he is proposing one of the biggest tax cuts for working families in American history. The Parent Tax Credit is a fully refundable benefit for families provided directly through automatic, monthly advances. This new credit does not tilt the deck in favor of two-earner households or formal childcare arrangements. The Parent Tax Credit gives working families the flexibility to make the best choices for raising their family.For households with a qualifying child, the Parent Tax Credit is worth $6,000 for single parents and $12,000 for married parents that file a joint tax return. There is no income phase-out. Households that fulfill the eligibility parameters outlined below receive the full benefit. The Parent Tax Credit is available to households with a qualifying child under the age of 13. To receive the credit, single-parent households must report prior-year earnings equal to or greater than earned income from 20 hours per week of work at the federal minimum wage, an earnings threshold of $7,540. Married parents that file a joint tax return must reach the same earnings threshold. This creates an explicit marriage bonus of 100 percent. In order to receive the credit, tax returns must include the Social Security Number of parents and qualifying children.Payments are advanced by the IRS on a monthly basis. The IRS is instructed to establish an online portal allowing families to make changes to relevant information, including the number of qualifying children, marital status, and earned income. Families can also choose to opt out of monthly payments, and can instead receive a lump-sum return when they file their federal taxes.555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

The world needs to know if this pandemic was the product of negligence at the Wuhan lab but the CCP has done everything it can to block a credible investigation. That’s why the Biden administration must declassify what it knows about the Wuhan lab and Beijing’s attempts to cover up the origin of the pandemic.""Senator Braun said, “Identifying the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is vital for preventing future pandemics, and as investigations and research into the origins of the virus continue, the Biden administration should declassify intelligence related to any potential links between biological research laboratories in Wuhan, China and the COVID-19 pandemic.”Former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield recently said he believes Covid originated at WIV and the Washington Post Editorial Board has called on the Biden administration to declassify any intelligence relating to the lab.In March 2020, Senator Hawley was the first member of Congress to call for an international investigation into China’s cover-up of the spread of coronavirus and, in April 2020, introduced legislation to allow American citizens to sue the Chinese government for damages.555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

Washington, DC 20415Dear Acting Director Young and Acting Director McGettigan:I write to request that you promptly issue new guidance to federal agencies that will allow for the resumption of in-person operations where necessary to fully serve constituents. I’ve recently been contacted by many of my constituents in Missouri who are having serious difficulty receiving basic services from the federal government because certain agencies are limiting in-person operations due to self-imposed restrictions related to COVID-19. As vaccinations increase nationwide, it is time to safely resume in-person services at field offices that interact directly with constituents.Over the past several weeks, my constituents have reported that certain federal agency offices are nonresponsive. While these complaints are widespread across agencies, particular concern has been directed at the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) and local offices of the Social Security Administration (SSA). For example, constituents in Missouri are being met with a response from the NPRC that the agency is “servicing only urgent requests related to medical emergencies and burials” and that constituents should consider “delaying [their requests] until we are past this national emergency.” In addition, constituents have complained about long wait times for even phone appointments at SSA offices.Putting services for Missourians on the back-burner is unacceptable, especially given the fact that the rest of Missouri has largely returned to work. My constituents should have access to basic government services; if these services are not adequately provided remotely, then it’s incumbent upon you and agency leadership to find another solution. Remote work cannot become a permanent reality for the field offices that need to interact with Missourians every day.While I appreciate the extraordinary circumstances under which federal employees have operated over the past year, I believe the time has come to safely return to the office. To help facilitate this, Congress has appropriated substantial sums of money over the past year to help agencies respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. I urge you to immediately issue new guidance that provides a pathway for agencies to fully and promptly reopen, along with any appropriate protective measures for the workplace to help this occur safely.Thank you for your attention to this matter.Sincerely,Josh Hawley

With this month’s announcement that FEMA will help operate a vaccination site in the City of St. Louis for eight weeks, we believe that a parallel effort in Kansas City will facilitate more vaccine access for more Missourians, especially for individuals at high risk for the disease living in the region.Thank you for your prompt consideration of this request to help accelerate Missouri’s recovery from the pandemic.Sincerely,Josh Hawley

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-colleagues-reintroduce-legislation-ban-tiktok-government-devices,"Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) reintroduced his legislation to ban all federal employees from using TikTok on government devices. Despite reports that TikTok is a unique threat to data security, the Biden administration shelved plans by the Trump administration to force a sale of TikTok’s American operations. Text of the legislation, cosponsored by Senators Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), can be found here.""TikTok is a Trojan Horse for the Chinese Communist Party that has no place on government devices—or any American devices, for that matter.""""My bill is a straightforward plan to protect American government data from a hostile foreign power, which, less than a year ago, passed the Senate unanimously. TikTok has repeatedly proven itself to be a malicious actor but Joe Biden and Big Tech refuse to take the threat of Chinese espionage seriously. It’s time for Congress to act.""""TikTok poses a potential threat to personal privacy and our national security interests,” Senator Rubio said. ""There is absolutely no reason why this application, which Beijing can use to advance its malign foreign policy initiatives, should be utilized on federal devices. In its current form, this platform is not safe. I’m proud to join Senators Hawley and Scott in introducing this bill.""Senator Scott said, “We cannot allow federal employees to jeopardize U.S. government networks and national security by using apps like TikTok, which are connected to the Chinese Communist Party. Communist China has shown again and again that it will stop at nothing to infiltrate our government networks and steal American technology and intellectual property. I’m proud to join Senator Hawley on this important legislation and hope our colleagues will join us in quickly passing the No TikTok on Government Devices Act.""""The No TikTok on Government Devices Act is in the best interest of our national security. Chinese-owned apps are required to report user data to the Chinese Communist Party, that is why we cannot trust TikTok with the sensitive data that exists on U.S. government devices,"" Representative Buck said. ""It is well past time to acknowledge the serious cybersecurity threat that TikTok poses and enact a federal government-wide ban on the Chinese app.""Senator Hawley originally introduced the No TikTok on Government Devices Act in March 2020, following a Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee hearing he chaired, entitled “Dangerous Partners: Big Tech & Beijing,” when TikTok refused to testify. In August 2020, the bill passed the Senate unanimously.The State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, and TSA have already banned TikTok on federal government devices.Congressman Ken Buck (R-Co.) is introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives.555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-says-bidens-open-borders-policies-have-created-moral-crisis,"Today, speaking at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said that President Joe Biden has created a “moral crisis” by sending the message that the U.S. Southern border is open. Senator Hawley said the Senate Democrats’ proposed immigration reform plan would create new loopholes for illegal immigrants and devalue legal immigration.Senator Hawley said, “I'm glad that we have the opportunity today to talk about what is happening on the border, and to have a chance to look at and examine what is, I think, a humanitarian crisis. It is a national security crisis. It is a drug crisis. It's also, frankly, a moral crisis.""When you see what these cartels are doing on our border. When you see the children being exploited and smuggled for profit by these cartels at the border. When you see the lies that these cartels are telling innocent people to get their money and bring them across the border. And when you see the effects of the drugs that are flowing across this border into every community of my state.""I come from the state of Missouri. You can't visit a community in my state that is not, frankly, awash in drugs. From where? From across the border.""Our border is in a state of total crisis, and it is a crisis that is affecting every single person in my state and in this country. And I suggest to you we have a moral obligation—and this administration has a moral obligation—to address the crisis it has created at the border, for children, for families, for American citizens, and I'm glad we get to talk about this.""You know, the statistics tell the story. I mean, the number of family units crossing the border is up 4,143% from last May. 4,143%.""That border crossing is not safe. The border is not open. And yet the Biden Administration has sent the message that it is open. And it has effectively encouraged this illegal smuggling. It has encouraged this exploitation of children. It has encouraged the drug crisis we see with its policies.""That's a hard truth, but it is the truth. And the American people are owed the truth. And the moral consequences of these policies have to be confronted and addressed and owned up to.""And I'm afraid I can’t support the legislation we're considering today because I think it goes in exactly the opposite direction. I think creating new loopholes for illegal immigrants that have criminal records, sending the message that more people ought to come here illegally while devaluing legal immigration is exactly the wrong way to go.""555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

We must correct the failed Washington consensus that has allowed Beijing to thrive at the expense of working Americans.”Senator Hawley previously called for amendments to impose a duty of 100 percent on goods made in the Xinjiang Autonomous region, require certain businesses to monitor and disclose the use of forced labor in their supply chains, and prohibit the transfer or licensing of certain intellectual property rights of goods funded by American taxpayers.555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/senators-josh-hawley-kirsten-gillibrand-lead-legislation-improve-military-response-sexual-assault,"Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) introduced legislation to improve the U.S. military’s response to sexual assault. The Professionalizing the Sexual Assault Response Coordinator Act tasks the Department of Defense with evaluating options for establishing a Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC) military operational specialty (MOS) and reporting its findings and recommendations to Congress. The Hawley-Gillibrand bill comes after the Fort Hood Independent Review Committee reported on growing concerns of SARCs lacking the training and resources needed to be effective at providing support to military sexual assault victims.“America’s service members make untold sacrifices on our nation’s behalf, and it is our responsibility to ensure those who need support can get it. This legislation would aid the Department of Defense in identifying next steps to professionalize the role of Sexual Assault Response Coordinator throughout all branches of the military — a role that requires adequate training, resources, and support to provide service members with the best care possible.”“To combat the epidemic of sexual assault in our military we must professionalize every part of the military justice system, including Sexual Assault Response Coordinators (SARCs). SARCs are an essential part of the front lines of combating military sexual assault and Congress has a duty to ensure SARCs have the training, resources, and independence to support our men and women in uniform,” said U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Chair of the Senate Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee. “I’m proud to co-lead this bipartisan legislation as we work to eradicate the scourge of sexual assault in our military.”“Securing justice for survivors of sexual assault and abuse is critical,” said Senator Cramer. “Our legislation would give Congress and the Defense Department the information they need to professionalize the role of Sexual Assault Response Coordinators in the military and ensure the best resources and training are provided to support victims of sexual assault.”“I am pleased to be a cosponsor and vote in favor of  S. 1520, legislation that is well overdue, and will make great strides to support victims of Sexual Assault in the military,” said Senator Ben Cardin. “Our bipartisan legislation will allow victims of sexual assaults to have more privacy, will incentivize victims to report more cases, and increase the prevention of sexual assaults and other crimes in the military. Our troops already sacrifice so much to protect this nation, they need to know Congress prioritizes their personal safety and security.”“Survivors of sexual assault should have the best possible care. In order to ensure that, the military needs trained professionals helping support men and women after these horrific events, and this bipartisan effort will help us do that,” said Senator Ernst.More information on the Professionalizing the Sexual Assault Response Coordinator Act is below and the full text of the legislation can be found here.Sexual Assault Response Coordinators (SARCs) form the backbone of the United States military’s efforts to provide sexual assault victims with the support they need, from medical treatment to legal assistance. These first-line responders play an essential role in our military’s response to sexual assault, but they often lack the training and resources they need to be effective. The Fort Hood Independent Review Committee report highlighted these concerns, as did recent testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Personnel.The Professionalizing the Sexual Assault Response Coordinator Act addresses these challenges by tasking the Department of Defense to evaluate and report on the optimal execution of a SARC MOS across all branches of the military. The Act mandates, in particular, that the evaluation and report address the following considerations: The evaluation and report mandated by this Act will ensure Congress and the Department of Defense have the information required to professionalize the SARC role, so that SARCs have the training and other resources they need to provide the most effective support possible to victims of sexual assault.555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/senator-hawley-leads-effort-condemn-violence-against-jews-anti-israel-rhetoric-politicians-and,"Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced a resolution condemning hatred and violence against Jews, denouncing anti-Israel rhetoric from elected officials and the media, and reaffirming that Jews must be treated with dignity and respect. Senator Hawley’s resolution has received support from the Republican Jewish Coalition and the Family Research Council. It is cosponsored by Senators Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), John Kennedy (R-La.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), and Bill Cassidy (R-La.)“The sickening rise in anti-Semitic attacks in the United States and around the world must end, along with the hateful anti-Israel rhetoric from politicians and the media that inspires the violence.We must ensure that Jewish people receive the full protection of law owed to them as citizens of the United States.""“At a moment when Jews are literally under attack in the streets of our nation, Jewish Americans need to know that Congress is on their side. This resolution provides an opportunity for our elected leaders to take a stand against antisemitism and against the demonization of Israel that fuels it,” said Matt Brooks, Executive Director of the Republican Jewish Coalition.“As anti-Semitism continues to rear its ugly head, we must once again remind the world that no one should ever be attacked for their religious beliefs. Whether this occurs at home or abroad, it is wrong, and we must condemn it. This resolution helps do exactly that,” said the Family Research Council.Senator Rick Scott said, “The anti-Semitic attacks occurring across our nation are disgusting. This disturbing wave of anti-Semitic and anti-Israel actions in Congress, in the United States and around the world must be swiftly condemned at every level and those responsible prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. We must make clear that America will never tolerate this hate and proudly stands with Israel and all of our Jewish communities.”“Anti-Semitic attacks and rhetoric must be met with a clear voice of condemnation,” said Senator Braun. “I’m proud to join this strong statement of support for our allies in Israel and Jewish Americans here at home.”“Attacking someone because of their religious beliefs should never be tolerated. We’ve seen an alarming rise in anti-Semitic attacks across the country over the last week in response to the state of Israel exercising its right to defend itself,” said Senator Tillis. “Every member of Congress should unequivocally condemn this targeted violence. I am proud to co-sponsor this resolution to affirm our support and protections for Jewish Americans.”“The rise in Anti-Israel rhetoric and acts of violence against the Jewish community throughout the U.S. are alarming and must stop immediately. This increase in anti-Semitism compels us, now more than ever, to defend the liberty and safety of the Jewish people here at home, and support a free and sovereign Israel abroad,” said Senator Ernst. “I firmly stand with our ally Israel and our Jewish friends in America and around the world.”Senator Cruz said, “Antisemitism is a unique prejudice with a unique history, which has resulted in unique horrors throughout history. This wave of abhorrent violence is directed at Jews for being Jewish, just like Hamas is firing rockets into Israel because they want to murder Jews and eliminate the Jewish state. The Senate has come together in the past to condemn antisemitism in these terms, without watering down our condemnation by reference to equally abhorrent but different forms of hatred. The Democrat House seems unable to do so, but I am hopeful that we can do so again, and I’m proud to join Sen. Hawley’s resolution.”“Some say that being anti-Israel doesn’t mean being anti-Semitic, but the two often go hand-in-hand. Since Hamas started lobbing rockets at Israel, we have seen anti-Semites commit numerous acts of violence against Jews in America and abroad. The individuals whose irresponsible words have added to this cloud of hate have no excuse. Israel is America’s ally, and Jewish Americans have played a significant role in making America the great, diverse nation that we are today. We must continue to stand against anti-Semitism,” said Senator Kennedy.“The recent violence against Jewish people in America does not reflect the principles of our nation. Unfortunately, this wave of anti-Semitism has been spread through lies and misinformation shared on social media. It’s also been incited by Democrats in Congress who use their position of power to stoke Jewish hatred while rockets rain down upon Israel. Enough is enough.” said Senator Marshall. “The U.S. stands against anti-Semitism and Jewish racism at home or abroad. We will always speak out against those who use their anti-Israel views to delegitimize Israel and demonize the Jewish people.""Senator Daines said, “the abominable anti-Israel rhetoric being perpetuated by politicians is leading to violent attacks on Jewish people here in America and across the world—it must stop. We must stand with the Jewish people and Israel, and unequivocally condemn acts of violence and anti-Semitism.""“In America and around the world, we are seeing Jews being attacked in the streets just because they are Jews, and some of our elected officials are fueling the flames by insufficiently condemning the violence and attacking Israel for defending itself,” said Senator Cramer. “Anti-Semitism is evil, Israel is our friend, and violence against Jews for being Jewish is vile. The United States needs to unequivocally condemn such abhorrent behavior. I urge my colleagues to do so by supporting our resolution.“The recent rise in anti-Semitic violence in the United States is unfortunately not surprising given how members of the radical left have refused to condemn the actions of Hamas terrorists,” said Senator Blackburn. “We must protect the people of Israel and Jewish Americans from this disgusting violence, which starts with speaking out against the rhetoric coming from the left.”Senator Rubio said, ""The horrific spike in Anti-Semitic violence and crimes both in the U.S. and around the world serves as reminder that hateful rhetoric and lies can quickly turn into violence. We must do all we can to combat this ancient evil and ensure America's Jewish communities are protected.”“We have seen a sharp increase in attacks against Jewish people, both in America and around the world.  These attacks—fueled by vile and hateful rhetoric against Israel and its people—must end, and the perpetrators must be punished.  We cannot allow anti-Semitic behavior to stand,” said Senator Crapo.""I’m proud to stand with Israel and the Jewish community in the United States and around the world, and to co-sponsor this important and timely Senate resolution condemning the rising tide of anti-Semitic violence and rhetoric,” Senator Hagerty said. “I support Israel’s recent efforts to defend its people from rocket attacks by Hamas and other Iran-backed terrorists in Gaza who hide behind human shields and indiscriminately target civilians in Israel. For anyone to use this conflict to discriminate and spread lies against the Jewish people is wholly unacceptable.""In recent weeks, Jewish people in the United States have been threatened, cursed at, spit on, burned, and physically assaulted in nearly 200 documented attacks since the start of the most recent conflict between Israel and Palestine.Last week Senator Hawley joined 19 of his colleagues in introducing a resolution to stand with Israel and condemn the attacks by Hamas, an Iranian-backed terrorist organization. He and 43 colleagues also sent a letter to President Biden urging him to stand with Israel and stop negotiating potential sanctions relief to Iran.555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/senator-hawley-colleagues-introduce-bipartisan-bill-stabilize-usps-and-promote-long-term,"U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined Senators Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), and 17 other colleagues to introduce bipartisan legislation to set the United States Postal Service on a more sustainable financial footing and support the goal of providing long-term reliable service across the country. The bill strengthens transparency and accountability for Postal Service performance, eliminates unnecessary financial burdens, and helps ensure the Postal Service can better serve the American people. A bipartisan companion bill was approved by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform last week.“The United States Postal Service has been around for nearly 250 years and we must ensure it can survive for another 250. With these bipartisan reforms, we can help put the Postal Service on a path to self-sustaining financial viability that will secure six-day service, protect rural delivery, and ensure that all Americans have reliable, uninterrupted access to their mail.”The Postal Service Reform Act would eliminate the aggressive prefunding requirement that has hurt the Postal Service financially, and integrate postal worker retirees’ health care with Medicare. Together, these two reforms would create $45.9 billion in savings for the Postal Service over the next ten years. In addition, the bill would require the Postal Service to maintain its standard of delivering at least six days a week. The legislation would improve transparency of Postal Service operations to both customers and Congress by requiring the publication of easily accessible weekly service data on the Postal Service website, as well as issuing a detailed report to Congress every six months on Postal Service finances and operations. The bill also includes bipartisan provisions for Postal Service accountability and growth.To see the full text of the Postal Service Reform Act, please click here.555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

Bethesda, MD 20892Dear Dr. Collins and Dr. Fauci:I write with grave concern about the latest allegations of a COVID-19 cover-up. New public reporting suggests that Chinese researchers directed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to purge gene sequences of COVID-19 cases from a key NIH database. [1] The deleted information could be critical for understanding how the virus spread and where it came from. These deletions are alarming and merit a full congressional and law enforcement investigation.The NIH has since stated that “submitting investigators hold the rights to their data.” But that’s not what the NIH says in its public materials. It says removal of information is disfavored and is only permitted pursuant to specific protocols that do not appear to have been followed here. But moreover, why the NIH would agree to remove key data about COVID-19 in the midst of the most severe public health crisis in a century is unfathomable. It appears the removal of this data from this database was not done for scientific purposes. Rather, it could have been done to obscure the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) role in the origins of COVID-19, especially given the researchers’ apparent affiliation with Wuhan University—an institution controlled by the CCP. [2] American taxpayer-funded public health databases should be transparent and objective; they should not be subject to foreign influence.In order to properly investigate the origins of the devastating COVID-19 pandemic—and to prevent future pandemics from occurring—investigators need access to information. These efforts are already hampered by the paucity of data from the early cases of the virus in Wuhan. Yet I’m growing concerned that the NIH is not taking the CCP’s obstruction and its motives seriously, especially following evidence that NIH dollars may have found their way to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.These newly reported actions raise serious questions about what other data Chinese-based researchers have sought to purge from the American scientific community. The American people need to know the extent of the CCP’s influence at the NIH and the CCP’s role in obscuring the origins of a pandemic that has claimed over 600,000 American lives. Please answer the following questions by July 1, 2021:I am sending a copy of this letter to the intelligence and law enforcement communities so they can take action as is appropriate. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.Sincerely,Josh Hawley

In the letter, Senator Hawley cites recent instances of Canadian pastors being arrested and jailed for holding worship services that do not comply with strict COVID-19 restrictions.“I am troubled that our Canadian neighbors are effectively being forced to gather in secret, undisclosed locations to exercise their basic freedom to worship,” Senator Hawley writes. “Frankly, I would expect this sort of religious crackdown in Communist China, not in a prominent Western nation like Canada. Canadian authorities’ arrest of faith leaders and seizure of church property, among other enforcement actions, appear to constitute systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom.”Last year, Senator Hawley urged the Department of Justice to bring federal lawsuits to uphold the rights of houses of worship burdened by unjust restrictions.Full text of the letter is available here and below.June 24, 2021Chair Nadine Maenza

Washington, DC 20401Dear Chair Maenza:One of the most fundamental human rights is the freedom to practice one’s faith according to the dictates of one’s conscience. Last year, I urged the Department of Justice to bring federal lawsuits to uphold the rights of houses of worship burdened by unjust restrictions. Now I am writing to express my deep concern that this freedom is in peril across our nation’s northern border.In recent months, there have been numerous instances of Canadian pastors being arrested and jailed for holding worship services that do not comply with COVID-19 restrictions. On June 14, Pastor Tim Stephens of Fairview Baptist Church in Calgary, who was previously arrested in May, was arrested again at home in front of his wife and children. Media outlets captured heartbreaking video of the pastor’s children sobbing as they held their father’s hand through the barred window of a police car. Pastor Stephens’ alleged violation was holding an outdoor worship service in a park, which was apparently discovered by a police helicopter flying overhead.Other Canadian pastors, such as Pastor James Coates of GraceLife Church in Spruce Grove, have similarly faced arrests and enforcement actions. Authorities reportedly seized and fenced off the GraceLife Church building in April, which sparked a protest of hundreds of people in opposition to the move.I am troubled that our Canadian neighbors are effectively being forced to gather in secret, undisclosed locations to exercise their basic freedom to worship. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states that “[e]veryone has the following fundamental freedoms,” which include the “freedom of conscience and religion.” The arrests and actions taken to enforce overly burdensome and unjustified orders, however, do not seem to live up to this praiseworthy statement. Frankly, I would expect this sort of religious crackdown in Communist China, not in a prominent Western nation like Canada.Canadian authorities’ arrest of faith leaders and seizure of church property, among other enforcement actions, appear to constitute systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom. I urge the Commission on International Religious Freedom to take whatever action is necessary to address and rectify this situation, and consider adding Canada to the Commission’s Watch List.Thank you for your attention to this pressing matter.Sincerely,Josh Hawley

Washington, DC 20226Dear Acting Director Richardson:Over the last month, ATF has proposed two rules with far-reaching implications for Americans’ Second Amendment rights. On May 21, ATF announced Proposed Rule 2021R–05, Definition of “Frame or Receiver” and Identification of Firearms. This rule covers a breadth of issues, including the classification of split or modular frames and receivers, the identification of mufflers and silencers, and so forth, many of which will have implications for law-abiding firearms manufacturers who have worked faithfully to comply with existing laws. But most importantly, this Proposed Rule would take a significant step toward a national gun registry by requiring FFL dealers to maintain personal gun owner information and records of transactions involving firearms, including their makes, models, and serial numbers—forever.And that wasn’t all. On June 10, ATF issued Proposed Rule 2021R–08, Factoring Criteria for Firearms With Attached “Stabilizing Braces.” This proposed rule would reverse years of interpretive guidance and recategorize millions of pistols and AR-15-style firearms as “short-barreled rifles,” placing them under the strict regulatory scheme of the National Firearms Act and making it a federal felony to otherwise possess them. Indeed, the Proposed Rule states that it “may affect upwards of 1.4 million individuals.”These measures are concerning enough on their face. But more alarming is ATF’s apparent willingness to unilaterally make important firearms policy determinations wholly apart from Congress. Americans’ rights to keep and bear firearms are safeguarded by the Second Amendment, and the responsibility for implementing those constitutional protections rests with elected lawmakers—not unelected federal bureaucrats.Accordingly, please provide my office with responses to the following questions no later than June 25, 2021:Thank you for your attention to these important matters.

Washington, D.C. 20416Dear Administrator Guzman,We write with serious concern about the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) poor performance in implementing and administering the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant (SVOG) program.As you know, Congress established the SVOG program in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, and has provided the program with more than $16 billion in appropriations. This funding was intended to provide critical relief to movie theatres, museums, and other entertainment venues—a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions imposed upon it by state and local governments.Unfortunately, this critical relief has yet to be distributed to venue operators. According to the most recent data set published by the SBA on June 14, 2021, venue operators have submitted 14,214 applications requesting $11.5 billion in funding. However, thus far, only 411 grants have been approved for a total of $304.2 million. Remarkably, out of the already-small number of venue operators who have even had their applications approved, only a few have actually receives their grants. This is unacceptable.Venue operators from our states have contacted our offices expressing considerable frustration with this laggard pace. This frustration is justified. These businesses do not need money next week or next month. They need money today, right now. They needed the money in January and in February and in March, and yet are still waiting for relief in June—almost six months after the SVOG program was authorized by Congress. We urge you to distribute the congressionally authorized relief funding to qualified applicants as soon as possible.Given the SBA’s poor performance in administering the SVOG program, we request the following information by June 24, 2021:Sincerely,Josh Hawley

Syed previously sat on the board of an organization, Emgage Action, that has echoed the anti-Semitic remarks of Representative Ilhan Omar and others, including calling Israel an “apartheid state” and accusing Israel of “war crimes.”“Dilawar Syed was a director for an organization that has engaged in anti-Semitic rhetoric, including amplifying false statements that Israel is an ‘apartheid state.’ This rhetoric is disgusting and inexcusable. Mr. Syed must renounce this hateful rhetoric and explain his association with this organization. The Small Business Committee must convene a hearing to ask Mr. Syed about these actions and determine whether he is fit to serve.” 555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-colleagues-reintroduce-taiwan-defense-act,"Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced he will reintroduce the Taiwan Defense Act (TDA), following new signs of China’s increasing belligerence in the Asia-Pacific and imperial ambitions worldwide. Sen. Hawley’s bill ensures the United States is able to defeat any attempted Chinese invasion of Taiwan.Originally introduced in June 2020, TDA is cosponsored by Senators John Cornyn (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) and Representative Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) will be introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives.""The Chinese Communist Party wants control of the Indo-Pacific region, starting with Taiwan. We cannot allow Beijing to succeed, not just for the sake of our Asian allies and partners, but for the sake of all Americans whose lives and livelihoods depend on a free and open Indo-Pacific.""“As China continues to destabilize the Indo-Pacific region, our military must be prepared to defend our allies and uphold our commitments to trade and diplomatic partners like Taiwan,” said Senator Cornyn. “This legislation would ensure the U.S. can efficiently and effectively come to Taiwan’s aid in the event China threatens their autonomy.”Senator Daines said, “We must uphold our commitments to Taiwan and push back against Chinese aggression in the Asia-Pacific and around the world.”“The United States must remain committed to Taiwan as the Chinese Communist Party continues to build its military forces and threaten Taiwan’s sovereignty,” said Senator Tillis. “It’s crucial the U.S. Military strengthen its ability to protect Taiwan, and the Biden Administration must build on the work of the Trump Administration to support strong cross-Strait deterrence with increased attention and greater resources. I am proud to work with my colleagues on this legislation so that the DoD can take swift action on this threat.”“Taiwan’s freedom from the threat of the Chinese Communist Party’s authoritarian rule is the key to a peaceful, secure, and stable Indo-Pacific,” said Senator Tuberville. “The CCP knows this and in their mission to become the world’s top superpower, they are taking bold action to strengthen their military and threaten Taiwan. The Taiwan Defense Act is central to standing with our allies across the region and combating provocations from the CCP.”""When senior leaders are warning the CCP could invade Taiwan within the next six years, we need a sense of urgency to restore deterrence in the Taiwan Strait,"" said Representative Gallagher. ""Taiwan's liberty is a vital national security interest of the United States, and the Taiwan Defense Act ensures America maintains the capability to deny a CCP invasion.""Full text of the bill can be found here.555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.

https://www.hawley.senate.gov/op-ed-public-schools-must-shape-kids-who-love-america-and-our-founding,"By Sen. Josh Hawley | Published on August 1, 2021 | New York PostParents know something is wrong. It’s why they are showing up in droves at school-board meetings across the nation. They are sending a message. They don’t want their children taught that the true founding of America came in 1619, or that America is a systemically racist place, or that most Americans are ­oppressors. They don’t want their children taught lies. And they are right. 

Sometimes, these lies go by the name “critical race theory,” a pet project of the left that ­began, as many bad ideas do, in the academy and has spread in recent years across corporate America and into school curricula. Sometimes the lies are called “anti-racism.” 

Whatever the label, the central principles are the same. These doctrines teach that American society is structurally oppressive, that our culture is shot through with racism and other forms of bigotry, and that most Americans are complicit in racial oppression, knowingly or not. 

[. . .]

Let’s be clear. This isn’t a ­nation of oppressors. This is a nation of liberators. This is the country founded on the worth and dignity of every individual. This is the country that gave working people the right to vote. This is the country that freed the slaves. This is the ­nation that has brought more good to the planet than any other people in history. 

And it is time we defend that being taught in school. Critical race theory in any guise is a toxin. It poisons the bloodstream of our national life and drives Americans further apart. Sometimes, it seems that this is just what its advocates want: ­division, anger, hatred. But that isn’t what America needs. America needs the truth, ­because it’s the truth about our history and our purpose that unites us as a nation. 

That’s why I’m proposing a bill to require every school district in America that receives taxpayer money to teach our kids the founding documents and principles of this country.

[. . .]

Why anyone would object to this most basic of civics education is hard to fathom. That so many on the left do reveals how confused they have become. In recent days, leftist commentators have accused me of “whitewashing” American history and advocating “indoctrination” akin to the Chinese Cultural Revolution. 

Just to state the accusations is to expose their absurdity. Teaching our kids the actual documents that express the true principles that make us Americans isn’t whitewashing. It is ­education. It used to be seen as one of the central purposes of public schools. And teaching children to love America isn’t indoctrination. It’s what binds us together as citizens. 

The left increasingly vilifies America’s history and purpose. Leftists advocate for tearing it all down — both literally, with violent riots masquerading as “social justice,” and figuratively, by casting the institutions of our culture as oppressive, from the family to religious faith. Americans increasingly see this assault on our common life ­together for what it is — an attempt to utterly remake America — and reject it. We can’t ­allow this agenda of destruction and rage to succeed. 

The true principles on which this country was founded have inspired generations. And they summon us still toward great deeds. Every school boy and girl has the right to claim them as his or her heritage. And all school children should learn them as their own.

This is my conviction: Our children can perform wonders we haven’t yet imagined. They can write a future for this country beyond anything we have dared to dream. But first they must know who they are, and who we are together, as a ­nation. This is an investment in the future that will yield a ­remarkable return. It’s an ­investment of love. Let’s make it together —and now. Let’s teach our children to know and love America.555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-59471123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812901 E.
