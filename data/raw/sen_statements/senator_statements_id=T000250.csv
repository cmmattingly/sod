John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed how Democrats intend to pay for their so-called “Inflation Reduction Act” by increasing Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audits and placing new burdens on taxpayers. Thune noted that the Democrats’ bill would provide for the hiring of as many as 87,000 new IRS employees, which would more than double the current size of the agency and make it larger than the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Coast Guard combined.Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, August inflation numbers came out this week, and they weren’t good. “Inflation was even higher than expected. “And it was very clear that soaring prices are likely to continue for quite a while. “But as usual, that doesn’t seem to concern Democrats one bit. “The president was asked Tuesday if he was concerned about August’s even-worse-than-expected inflation report. “His answer? “‘No, I’m not.’ “It was just one more tone-deaf moment for the president and Democrats. “On Tuesday the president and Democrats gathered at the White House to congratulate themselves for having passed their so-called Inflation Reduction Act – a bill that will do nothing to reduce inflation. “That’s not just my opinion, Mr. President. “That was the conclusion of the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model. “And of the Democrat chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, who referred to the bill as the “so-called Inflation Reduction Act” on the Senate floor while admitting it would do nothing to solve our inflation crisis. “But that didn’t stop Democrats from celebrating yesterday. “For most of us, of course, it’s difficult to understand what there was to celebrate. “Leaving aside the issue of 40-year high inflation, we already know that the bill will also fall short in another respect – on deficit reduction. “Democrats’ claims that the bill would provide meaningful deficit reduction were always somewhat dubious, but even granting Democrats’ rosiest assumptions, President Biden wiped out any deficit reduction when he announced his massive student loan giveaway eight days after the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law. “So no inflation reduction, no deficit reduction … oh, and the Inflation Reduction Act will drive up energy bills for Americans. “So what was there to celebrate? “Well, for Democrats, the Inflation Reduction Act marked a chance to finally push through some of their far-left, Green New Deal fantasies. “Things like electric vehicle tax credits to help wealthy Americans buy electric cars. “More than $60 billion for “environmental justice priorities” – including $1.9 billion for things like identifying gaps in tree canopy coverage. “And the list goes on. “So I think Democrats are pretty satisfied with themselves over finally jamming through elements of their Green New Deal agenda. “Then of course they succeeded in extending increased Obamacare subsidies that will push Americans off of private health care plans and into government-run care. “And then there are the tax hikes. “Mr. President, the current Democrat leader once said, ‘You don’t want to take money out of the economy when the economy is shrinking’ – like it has the previous two quarters. “But those days are long gone. “For Democrats, raising taxes has become an article of faith. “And it goes far beyond raising money to help pay for their big-government spending. “Democrats believe raising taxes on corporations and well-off Americans is a good in and of itself – even if those tax hikes have a negative effect on less well-off Americans, and the economy. “And the tax hikes Democrats have included in their so-called Inflation Reduction Act will indeed have a negative effect on our economy and on the hardworking Americans who help support it. “Democrats’ tax hikes on businesses will result in slower growth, lower wages, and thousands fewer jobs. “And Democrats’ tax hikes on conventional energy will result in higher energy bills for working families. “Mr. President, in addition to raising taxes, the other main way the Inflation Reduction Act raises revenue is by increasing IRS audits and placing new burdens on taxpayers. “Democrats’ bill contains a whopping $80 billion for the IRS. “More than half of those funds, or $46 billion, are earmarked for increased IRS enforcement. “Just 4 percent is for improving customer service – which should tell you all you need to know about where Democrats’ real priorities lie. “The bill would provide for the hiring of as many as 87,000 new IRS employees – which would more than double the current size of the agency and make the IRS larger than Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Coast Guard put together. “Mr. President, in the lead-up to passage of Democrats’ bill, the Biden administration put out a statement declaring that the money for IRS enforcement would not go to increased audits of households making less than $400,000. “Because we had reason to doubt that would be the case, Republicans put forward an amendment to the bill to prevent the IRS from using its new money to audit those Americans. “Every Democrat – every Democrat – voted against the amendment. “I guess Democrats are happy to oppose more IRS audits of middle-class Americans in theory, but they don’t want to cut off the possibility of those audits in practice if they end up needing them to help fund their Green New Deal spending. “Mr. President, I don’t need to tell anyone that the IRS is notorious for mishandling sensitive taxpayer data. “As recently as this month, we learned that the IRS had inadvertently posted confidential taxpayer data for around 120,000 individuals on its website – private taxpayer information that was available to the general public. “Then of course there was last year’s leak or hack of confidential taxpayer information that was shared with the left-leaning ProPublica and used to advance a partisan agenda – for which, I might add, neither the IRS nor the Biden administration has provided any accountability.   “Then there was the infamous targeting of conservative groups for extra scrutiny under the Obama IRS. “And the list goes on. “And I haven’t even discussed the IRS’ record of grossly underperforming – some would say nonexistent – customer service. “During the 2022 tax season, just 10 percent of taxpayer calls – 10 percent – were answered by an IRS employee. “What we need to be doing is holding the IRS accountable, not setting tens of thousands of new IRS agents loose on taxpayer accounts.   “Earlier this week I joined my Republican colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee to introduce legislation to prevent the IRS from using its new funding to audit American workers or small business owners earning less than $400,000 per year. “I also introduced a bill this week – along with Senator Collins – to improve taxpayer service at the IRS. “Our legislation – the Increase Reliable Services Now Act – would prevent the IRS from hiring new employees for enforcement until customer service at the IRS has reached a more acceptable level. “It is unacceptable that taxpayers have a 1 in 10 chance of receiving assistance when calling the IRS.   “And the agency should not be allowed to increase enforcement hires until it has achieved a basic level of customer service.   “I will continue to work to increase IRS accountability and prevent hardworking Americans from being squeezed to fund Democrats’ Green New Deal spending. “Mr. President, like the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan spending spree before it – which helped plunge our country into our current inflation crisis – the Inflation Reduction Act is a bad deal for the American people. “And all the self-congratulatory White House parties in the world won’t change that fact. “Americans are experiencing serious economic hardship … and Democrats are doing nothing to help. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink:

In 2020, the state exported approximately $284 million in pork products, $279 million in beef products, and $102 million in dairy products to markets across the world. A fair, reliable, and competitive export market is essential for South Dakota producers to sustain and expand their businesses.Unfortunately, in the last two years, agricultural exporters lost at least 22% of foreign sales due to the increased costs to ship goods overseas, coupled with shipping container delays and cancellations. South Dakota businesses especially small businesses with fewer resources to fight supply chain problems are struggling to meet the demands of their customers. Meanwhile, ocean carriers continue to report record profits as shipping costs soar, bringing in two-or-three-times the revenue they predicted.With the help of U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and U.S. Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.), we introduced the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022 to help ease supply chain pressures, particularly at our nation’s ports. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation passed the U.S. Senate unanimously, and it was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives with strong, bipartisan support. It was signed into law on June 16, 2022.The Ocean Shipping Reform Act is the most significant change to our maritime laws in a generation. The legislation will strengthen the authority of the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) by providing it with new tools to help level the playing field for American exporters and counteract anticompetitive behavior. The bill will also help FMC more efficiently resolve disputes between ocean carriers and shippers, while also taking actions at the U.S. Department of Transportation to alleviate strain across the supply chain.Our legislation will help ease supply chain pressures by addressing unfair ocean carrier practices, speeding up the resolution of disputes over carrier fees, and improving the movement of goods at our nation’s ports. It won’t solve our nation’s inflation crisis, but it should help make life easier for U.S. exporters, importers, and consumers alike. Our bill isn’t a silver bullet, but help is on the way.Finding common ground in Washington is no easy feat, and we are grateful that the House and Senate came to an agreement on these important reforms to our nation’s shipping laws. The Ocean Shipping Reform Act proves that Congress can still do big things in a bipartisan way. We are proud to show that South Dakotans know how to work across the aisle and deliver meaningful results for our country at a time when we need it the most. Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/helping-south-dakotans-deliver"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed the ongoing inflation crisis that the American people continue to face and noted the tone-deaf messaging coming from the White House and congressional Democrats. Thune also highlighted the toll inflation is taking on the agriculture industry in South Dakota, and he noted that under the Biden administration, farm production expenses are projected to reach record highs.Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery):“Mr. President, yesterday afternoon, Democrats and the president gathered at the White House to celebrate their so-called Inflation Reduction Act … a bill that will do exactly nothing to reduce inflation.   “And you don’t have to take my word for that. “The nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model said this about the bill’s impact on inflation: ‘The impact on inflation is statistically indistinguishable from zero.’ “‘Statistically indistinguishable from zero.’ “Or you could take the word of the Democrat chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, who admitted on the Senate floor that the so-called Inflation Reduction Act would not reduce inflation. “That’s right. “Mr. President, to describe yesterday’s celebration at the White House as tone-deaf is putting it mildly.   “Democrats had a big party to celebrate a bill that may fulfill some of their big-government fantasies but will do nothing to fix the inflation crisis facing our country. “Meanwhile, Americans were dealing with the release of August’s inflation numbers – which were even higher than expected and made it very clear that soaring prices will continue for the foreseeable future. “One of President Obama’s top economic advisers noted yesterday, and I quote, ‘Today’s CPI report confirms that the US has a serious inflation problem.  Core inflation is higher this month than for the quarter, higher this quarter than last quarter, higher this half of the year than the previous one, and higher last year than the previous one.’ “Yet Democrats and the president thought yesterday was a good day to celebrate fulfilling some of their big-government fantasies. “I guess Americans struggling to afford their soaring grocery bills can be comforted by the fact that thanks to Democrats’ legislation, their tax dollars will now be going to fund electric vehicle tax credits for wealthy Americans – not to mention road equity and identifying gaps in tree canopy coverage. “Mr. President, the pain of inflation is permeating every aspect of our economy. “During the month of August, I spent a lot of time traveling around South Dakota, and, naturally, I spent a lot of time talking to farmers and ranchers. “And one thing I heard over and over is the toll inflation is taking on agriculture. “In addition to the normal challenges every American is facing from inflation – like high utility bills and high grocery prices – farmers and ranchers are facing massive increases in the price of essential inputs like fertilizer and fuel. “Under the Biden administration, farm production expenses will reach a record high this year. “Fertilizer prices are on track to increase by 84 percent. “84 percent. “That is a staggering increase. “Fuel prices are on track to increase 65 percent. “And there’s no end in sight. “And farmers are facing a huge increase in interest costs thanks to a combination of higher interest rates and record-high farm debt. “Gross farm income is actually supposed to reach a record level this year, but those gains are expected to be entirely wiped out by inflation – and then some. “Thanks to inflation, net farm income is expected to decrease. “Meanwhile, Democrats were at the White House celebrating a bill that will not only do nothing to address our inflation crisis but will drive up energy bills for American farmers and American families. “Mr. President, agriculture is the lifeblood of my state of South Dakota. “And addressing the needs of farmers and ranchers is always one of my top priorities here in the Senate. “And while it’s unfortunately going to be difficult to stop Democrats from prolonging our inflation crisis as long as they’re in charge in Washington, in the meantime I am doing everything I can to make life easier for farmers and ranchers. “One of my top priorities right now is preparing for the 2023 farm bill, to make it as effective as possible in addressing the challenges facing farmers and ranchers. “I’ve been holding roundtables in South Dakota to hear directly from producers about their priorities for the farm bill. “So far, I’ve held roundtables covering row crops, conservation, and livestock. “I also participated in a farm bill panel at Dakotafest and an Aberdeen Area Chamber of Commerce farm bill discussion at the Brown County Fair. “And I look forward to continuing to receive input from producers as the time to draft the farm bill approaches. “I’ve also begun introducing legislation – based on my conversations with farmers and ranchers – that I will work to get included in the farm bill. “In March I introduced the Conservation Reserve Program Improvement Act, which would make CRP grazing a more attractive option for farmers and ranchers by providing cost-share payments for all CRP practices for the establishment of grazing infrastructure, including fencing and water distribution.  “It would also increase the annual payment limit for CRP, which has not changed since 1985, to help account for inflation and the increase in land value. “In May I joined Senator Klobuchar to introduce the Agriculture Innovation Act. “Currently the U.S. Department of Agriculture collects reams of data on conservation practices. “The problem is that a lot of this data is often not analyzed and presented in a way that would be useful for farmers and ranchers. “The legislation Senator Klobuchar and I introduced would provide for better processing and development of the data USDA collects, so that farmers and ranchers can evaluate the impact of conservation and other production practices on things like soil health, crop yields, and profitability. “Our bill would make it easier for farmers and ranchers to decide what conservation practices to adopt by, among other things, helping producers identify the ways adopting conservation practices can improve their bottom line.   “In the next couple of weeks I will be introducing another piece of legislation for the 2023 farm bill to improve the effectiveness of livestock disaster assistance for producers.   “Too often, producers find that accessing disaster relief programs at the Department of Agriculture is an arduous and lengthy process. “I’m working on legislation that would make it easier for farmers and ranchers to access the Livestock Forage Disaster Program and the Emergency Conservation Program so that producers can receive timely assistance in the wake of natural disasters like drought and flooding. “The U.S. Drought Monitor plays a critical role in triggering USDA disaster assistance, and I’m working to build on my previous efforts to improve weather monitoring and the accuracy of the Drought Monitor. “Mr. President, this isn’t a farm bill issue per se, but I’m also introducing legislation today to prevent Democrats from using funding in the recently passed – and misnamed – Inflation Reduction Act to monitor livestock methane emissions. “It’s very clear that elements of the radical environmental left would like to see U.S. livestock producers out of business entirely.  “My legislation is designed to forestall future attempts to curtail beef production by preventing the Biden Environmental Protection Agency from using funds in Democrats’ bill to monitor livestock emissions. “Mr. President, agriculture is a challenging way of life. “In addition to backbreaking work in all weathers, our nation’s farmers and ranchers have to contend with the uncontrollable whims of the weather, which can wipe out a herd or a crop in a day. “And as if the usual challenges of the job weren’t enough, over the course of the Biden administration our nation’s farmers and ranchers have had to deal with soaring inflation. “I am incredibly grateful for all the South Dakota farmers and ranchers – and all of our nation’s farmers and ranchers – who continue to persevere during these difficult circumstances. “And I will continue to do everything I can in Washington to make your jobs easier and support you as you do the essential work of feeding our nation – and the world. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink:

John Thune (R-S.D.), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, today introduced a bill that would prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from monitoring methane emissions from livestock. Specifically, this legislation would prohibit the EPA from using any of the new methane monitoring funding provided in the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending spree to surveil livestock methane emissions in South Dakota, Iowa, or anywhere else in the country.“Farmers and ranchers – the people who work tirelessly to help feed America and the world – should not be subject to government surveillance as part of a broader effort to implement radical climate policies that would threaten their ability to operate,” said Thune. “This common-sense legislation would protect South Dakota livestock producers and their operations from government snooping.”“Democrats are seeking to weaponize the EPA against our farmers by spying on their operations. I’m not going to let that happen on my watch!” said Ernst. “With this effort, I’m fighting to protect Iowa’s livestock producers from the Left’s radical climate agenda and costly government overreach that will only fuel higher food costs and more reckless spending in Washington.”Thune recently spoke at a Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works hearing about his related bill, the Livestock Regulatory Protection Act. Thune’s legislation would prohibit the EPA from issuing permits related to livestock emissions. Specifically, the bill would amend the Clean Air Act to prohibit the EPA from issuing permits for any carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, water vapor, or methane emissions resulting from biological processes associated with livestock production.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/thune-ernst-introduce-bill-to-prohibit-government-monitoring-of-livestock-emissions-block-radical-climate-policies"

John Thune (R-S.D.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.), ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, today sent a letter to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra requesting that the department rescind its one-size-fits-all federal mask mandate on Head Start programs. Children six months to five years of age are currently eligible to be vaccinated against COVID-19, but a HHS interim final rule (IFR) still requires all staff and volunteers in Head Start educational facilities to be vaccinated and requires all staff, volunteers, and children two years of age and older to wear masks – even when they are outside on the playground.“This IFR continues to be an overly rigid, inflexible rule that complicates individual Head Start programs’ ability to operate and attract staff and volunteers – though there is a preliminary injunction against the IFR in multiple states – and we request that you immediately rescind it,” the senators wrote. “The nation must continue to transition toward treating COVID-19 as an endemic condition and return to a sense of normalcy, and it is past time for Washington bureaucrats to allow Head Start programs to do the same.”In May, the Senate passed Thune’s bipartisan resolution to repeal the Biden administration’s mask mandate for toddlers in the Head Start program. In February, Thune introduced a resolution to nullify HHS’s IFR, and in December 2021, he introduced separate legislation to do the same. In January, he led his colleagues in sending a letter to Secretary Becerra requesting that the administration rescind the IFR.The Head Start program is a federal program that provides qualifying, low-income children with early education services. Program facilities are located throughout the nation and, up until the issuance of this IFR, individual locations had been able to set and enforce their own COVID-19 protocols. Although this rule has been halted by federal courts in several states, including South Dakota, the only way to ensure it never sees the light of day is to permanently rescind it nationwide.  The letter was also signed by U.S. Sens. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho). Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), and Thom Tillis (N.C.).  Full letter below:The Honorable Xavier Becerra                                                                                                          Secretary                                                                                                                                            U.S. Department of Health & Human Services                                                                             200 Independence Avenue, Southwest                                                                                 Washington, D.C. 20201 Dear Secretary Becerra:Since November 2021, vaccine and mask mandates on Head Start and Early Head Start programs have been in effect as a result of a U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) interim final rule (IFR). We write to highlight how unnecessary these mandates continue to be and request that this IFR be rescinded immediately.As you know, as of January 31, 2022, this IFR requires Head Start staff and volunteers to be vaccinated against COVID-19. It also requires Head Start staff and volunteers to wear masks. But beyond these mandates, the IFR also requires students two years of age and older to wear masks despite the World Health Organization advising against mask mandates for children five years of age and younger.Up until the publication of this IFR in late 2021 – more than 18 months after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic – individual Head Start programs across the nation had the flexibility to implement their own precautions that effectively protected staff, volunteers, and students in these facilities. This flexibility afforded each individual program the opportunity to establish health and safety protocols and other mitigation strategies that were consistent with state and local laws and recommendations that worked best for their staff, volunteers, and students. In fact, according to a December 2020 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this flexibility was effective, as the CDC found that individual programs successfully implemented recommendations that limited the transmission of COVID-19 in their facilities.The application of inflexible federal rules on individual Head Start programs through this IFR and the forcing of toddlers enrolled in these programs to wear masks even caught the attention of Congress. On May 3, 2022, the U.S. Senate passed a joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of this IFR by a bipartisan vote of 55 to 41, with seven Democrats supporting the resolution and opposing the IFR.Prior to Senate consideration of the resolution, President Biden unfortunately committed to vetoing it. A primary reason for his opposition was because, at the time of Senate consideration, the CDC had not yet approved children five years of age and younger to be vaccinated against COVID-19. However, on June 18, 2022, the CDC approved certain COVID-19 vaccines for children six months through five years of age. Head Start-aged children are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine if their families so choose.This IFR continues to be an overly rigid, inflexible rule that complicates individual Head Start programs’ ability to operate and attract staff and volunteers – though there is a preliminary injunction against the IFR in multiple states – and we request that you immediately rescind it. The nation must continue to transition toward treating COVID-19 as an endemic condition and return to a sense of normalcy, and it is past time for Washington bureaucrats to allow Head Start programs to do the same.Thank you for your prompt attention to this request. Sincerely,Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/thune-burr-biden-administration-s-overreaching-child-mask-mandate-must-end"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed how the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending spree has created an economy that is making life harder for working families. Thune noted that our country continues to be in a period of historically high inflation – largely because of Democrats’ big-government, big-spending agenda – in which families are continuing to struggle with high grocery bills, high energy bills, and high rent prices.Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, this morning the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the August inflation numbers. “And as every American who has been to a grocery store lately knows, August was yet another month of high inflation. “Consumer prices rose 8.3 percent last month from a year earlier, holding near a four-decade high.  “And Americans are feeling the strain. “Mr. President, even one unexpectedly expensive month can be challenging for many families. “But at least it’s usually possible to recover from a single tough month. “How are American families going to recover from the months upon months upon months of high inflation that have marked the Biden economy? “Mr. President, as I said, American families are suffering. “Grocery bills are out of control. “Between August 2021 and August 2022, grocery bills rose at their highest rate since 1979. “1979. “Even back-to-school supplies like pencils and glue are more expensive. “The National Retail Federation reported in July that households were on track to spend an average of $864 on back-to-school shopping – a 24 percent increase from 2019. “Utility bills have soared.   “Things have gotten so bad that approximately one out of every six households – one out of every six households – is behind on its utility bills. “Unfortunately, considering the increases in the price of natural gas and electricity since President Biden took office, it’s not surprising. “Forty percent of households – 40 percent – report having difficulty paying for their normal household expenses. “And Gallup reports that 56 percent of Americans – well over half of the U.S. population – are experiencing financial hardship as a result of inflation. “The personal savings rate has plunged to its lowest level since 2009, and many Americans are dipping into their savings to make ends meet. “Others have taken up a side job, or are pulling out the credit card. “Still others have been forced to rely on food banks. “Mr. President, as recently as Friday, President Biden was touting his work to, quote, ‘finally deliver an economy that works for working families.’ “I have to say, I don’t know what ivory tower the president is living in, but the Biden economy is the very opposite of an economy that works for working families. “Working families in the Biden economy are struggling. “They’re wondering how they can make ends meet. “They’re cutting back on groceries like meat or milk. “They’re cutting back on family trips or putting off making necessary home repairs. “They are, as I said, dipping into their savings, or charging necessities on their credit cards, or visiting food banks. “A recent CBS News article discussing a new Gallup poll noted, and I quote, ‘The findings indicate that the hottest inflation in 40 years is eating into the bedrock of the American economy — the middle-class — and even eroding the financial stability of more well-heeled households.’  “‘The findings indicate that the hottest inflation in 40 years is eating into the bedrock of the American economy — the middle-class …’ “This is not an economy that’s, to paraphrase the president, being built from the bottom up and the middle out. “This is not an economy that ‘works for working families.’ “This is an economy where living standards for working families are declining. “Mr. President, the president has actually had the audacity to repeatedly bring up the lines of cars waiting at food banks that occurred during the height of the COVID pandemic – with the implication that things are different now in the Biden economy. “Perhaps no one in the White House has read the news recently. “Here’s a sampling of headlines from the past few weeks: “‘Las Vegas food banks experiencing heightened demand amid inflation spikes’ “‘Food banks feeling pinch of high inflation as centers juggle increased demand for help’ “‘New Hampshire food pantries struggle with rising costs, growing demand: Organizations say more people than ever need help’ “‘St. Mary’s Food Bank in Phoenix sees record number of families in need amid inflation’ “‘Mountain West food banks are strained by high customer demand and low supply’ “And unfortunately I could go on. “Mr. President, at this point, everyone knows how we got here. “Democrats took office and decided to pass a massive, $1.9 trillion spending bill, the so-called American Rescue Plan Act, that flooded the economy with unnecessary government money. “And the economy overheated as a result. “Democrats were warned – including by at least one noted economist from their own party – that their legislation ran the risk of overheating the economy. “But they were committed to taking advantage of their new majority to push through their big-government, big-spending vision. “And so they ignored the warnings. “And their bill helped trigger the worst inflation crisis in 40 years. “But perhaps the worst part is that even after Democrats saw the damage that resulted from their American Rescue Plan spending spree, they continued to try to double down on the spending strategy that helped get us into this mess in the first place. “Democrats spent half of last year attempting to force through another partisan spending spree originally planned to cost up to $5 trillion. “Fortunately for Americans, those particular far-left fantasies were foiled. “But that hasn’t stopped Democrats from continuing to accumulate wasteful government spending. “In August Democrats forced through a partisan tax-and-spending bill that will raise Americans’ energy bills, reduce jobs and opportunities for American workers, and waste taxpayer dollars on a host of Green New Deal priorities like electric vehicle tax credits for wealthy Americans and road equity and identifying gaps in tree canopy coverage. “They’ve called this tax-and-spending spree the Inflation Reduction Act – even though, as even the DEMOCRAT chairman of the Senate Budget Committee admitted, the bill will not reduce inflation. “Apparently the title’s only function is to make the bill sound more acceptable to Americans who are sick and tired of dealing with soaring prices and economic pain. “Then a mere eight days after signing the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, the president once again added to Democrats’ record of economic malfeasance with a massive student loan giveaway that could cost more than $1 trillion – and that the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget notes will, quote, “meaningfully boost inflation.” “‘… meaningfully boost inflation.’ “Mr. President, I’m not sure whether Democrats are incapable of learning their lesson, or whether they consider soaring prices to be a trivial issue next to implementing their Green New Deal agenda, or whether they think inflation is an acceptable price to pay for big government. “But whatever it is, Democrats are apparently going to continue to ignore the economic pain Americans are experiencing in favor of implementing their far-left, big-government, big-spending agenda.   “And it appears that the American people are going to have to continue to suffer as a result. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink:

John Thune (R-S.D.), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight, and Susan Collins (R-Maine) today introduced the Increase Reliable Services Now Act, legislation that would prohibit the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from hiring new enforcement employees until basic taxpayer service targets – including improved phone services and more efficient tax return processing – are reached. The bill would also prohibit the IRS from using enforcement appropriations in the so-called Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to audit taxpayers with annual incomes of less than $400,000 at a greater rate than at the date of the IRA’s enactment.“The IRS continually fails to deliver basic customer service to taxpayers. Rather than improving those services, Democrats have prioritized doubling the size of the agency in order to raise revenue to help pay for their reckless and partisan tax-and-spending spree,” said Thune. “More tax collectors will not bring relief to Americans who are waiting on their tax refunds, nor will it help them more easily get ahold of an IRS representative. Our bill proposes actionable steps to prioritize and improve basic customer service at the IRS, from which all taxpayers can immediately benefit.”“Americans deserve a government that is responsive, yet the IRS has consistently failed to provide taxpayers with the service they should expect. Incredibly, four out of five phone calls from taxpayers seeking assistance go unanswered, and tax refunds have been unacceptably delayed,” said Collins. “Our legislation would fix the IRS’ misplaced priorities by requiring the agency to focus on improving customer service and reducing backlogs.” This week, Thune also introduced a bill that would prevent the IRS from using any of the $80 billion of new funding to the agency for audits on American workers and small business owners who earn less than $400,000 per year.The Increase Reliable Services Now Act would prohibit the IRS from hiring new “examinations and collections” (enforcement) employees until basic taxpayer service targets are reached. Specifically, the bill would prohibit the hiring of new IRS enforcement employees until the agency maintains adequate taxpayer phone service (at least 70 percent of phone calls being answered for six consecutive months and an average speed of answering phone calls in five minutes or less). It would also require at least 90 percent of IRS employees to work in person at their job sites.In addition, the bill would prohibit any hiring, other than return processing and call center personnel, until the backlog of processing taxpayer correspondence, tax forms, and payments is not in excess of 1 million cases and eligible tax return refunds are issued by the IRS within six weeks or less, on average, of receipt.The Increase Reliable Services Now Act is supported by the National Taxpayers Union and Americans for Tax Reform.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/thune-collins-introduce-bill-to-hold-the-irs-accountable-protect-taxpayers"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed how the Democrats’ so-called “Inflation Reduction Act” will do nothing to reduce inflation and how it will instead double down on wasteful government spending and increase the tax burden on American businesses and middle-income families. Thune noted that Democrats should start focusing on pro-growth economic policies that would actually help working families who have experienced a de facto pay cut due to record-high inflation and President Biden’s failed policies.Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, a month ago yesterday, Senate Democrats shoved another partisan spending bill through the Senate – this one the inaccurately named Inflation Reduction Act. “I say inaccurately named because the so-called Inflation Reduction Act … will do nothing to reduce inflation. “That’s right. “The so-called Inflation Reduction Act … will not actually reduce inflation. “And you don’t have to take my word for it.  “The nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model said this about the bill’s impact on inflation: ‘The impact on inflation is statistically indistinguishable from zero.’ “‘Statistically indistinguishable from zero.’ “Democrats also claim that the bill will lead to deficit reduction. “But that’s not really true either. “In the first place, Democrats arrive at their deficit reduction assumptions using some extremely fuzzy math. “A substantial part of their deficit reduction claims depends on not extending a program that they’ve already called for extending … and on supposedly eliminating a rule that at this point was never going to be implemented anyway. “But even using their rosiest assumptions, the deficit reduction they would have achieved with the Inflation Reduction Act was wiped out completely eight days after the bill was signed by the president’s costly, reckless student loan giveaway. “Mr. President, Democrats have clearly been seeing the polling on Americans’ opinion of the economy – and their lack of faith in President Biden and Democrats to deal with the economic challenges we’re facing. “That’s unquestionably why Democrats named their bill the Inflation Reduction Act and touted their commitment to deficit reduction in an attempt to suggest fiscal responsibility. “The problem, of course, is that their commitment to deficit reduction, inflation reduction, and fiscal responsibility was, and continues to be, nothing more than window dressing. “At its core, the Inflation Reduction Act, like the so-called American Rescue Plan before it, is just another big-government, big-spending piece of legislation. “It will do nothing to address the real economic challenges facing our nation. “Instead, it will waste taxpayer dollars on Democrats’ big-government fantasies. “It will drive up energy costs in the service of Democrats’ Green New Deal agenda. “It will push people off private insurance and into government-run care – driving up the cost to taxpayers. “The legislation imposes socialist-style price controls that will discourage medical innovation and reduce the number of new treatments and cures.  “It imposes new taxes on businesses that will slow economic growth and result in lower wages and fewer jobs. “And the list goes on. “And, Mr. President, in case there was any doubt about their intentions with this bill, Democrats made their priorities very, very clear when the Senate considered amendments. “Democrats’ so-called Inflation Reduction Act hikes taxes on domestic oil and gas production, something that will unquestionably result in higher energy prices for American families – who are already facing high energy bills in the Biden economy. “And during the amendment vote-a-rama on this legislation, Democrats made it very clear that they are indeed just fine with restricting American energy production and seeing Americans’ energy bills soar. “Democrats rejected attempts to ease their tax hikes on domestic oil and gas. “They rejected amendments to make it easier for companies to develop American oil and natural gas. “They also rejected a comprehensive amendment to reform the burdensome permitting process, which is one of the biggest obstacles to new energy investment. “They even rejected an amendment to prevent Democrats’ new electric vehicle tax credit from going to wealthy Americans. “Apparently it’s just fine to support measures that would drive up Americans’ energy bills, but electric vehicle tax breaks for wealthy Americans have to be preserved.  “Not to mention the irony of U.S. automakers recently hiking prices on certain electric vehicles by $6,500 to $8,000, which roughly matches the $7,500 tax credit in the Democrats’ ‘inflation reduction’ bill.  “Mr. President, I have long been a supporter of clean energy. “But the fact of the matter is, clean energy technology has not advanced to the point where we can solely rely on alternative energy. “We need oil and natural gas, and we will continue to need them for a while yet. “And efforts to discourage domestic production of conventional energy will simply drive up energy costs for hardworking Americans and force our country to rely on unstable foreign sources of oil and gas. “That may very well be Democrats’ plan, in hopes of hastening the arrival of their Green New Deal future.     “Mr. President, Democrats like to bill themselves as the party of the little guy. “But their track record gives the lie to that. “Democrats couldn’t bring themselves to support measures to lower Americans’ energy bills by increasing domestic oil and gas production because it conflicts with their Green New Deal ideology. “But they did all unite to protect a tax deduction that mainly goes to wealthy Americans in high-tax states. “And to make sure, as I mentioned, that wealthy Americans are able to access tax credits for electric vehicles. “And of course they opposed a measure to prevent more audits of Americans making less than $400,000 a year. “Yes. “Democrats’ legislation includes tens of billions of dollars for new IRS agents and increased audits. “Democrats’ hope is that more audits of Americans will help pay for some of their spending measures, like increased government health care subsidies and their Green New Deal priorities. “The Biden administration put out a statement claiming that this wouldn’t mean increased audits of Americans making less than $400,000. “But when Democrats had the opportunity to confirm that by supporting an amendment that would have prevented the new enforcement funds from being used to audit Americans making less than $400,000, they unanimously voted against it. “Mr. President, I could go on. “I haven’t even talked about the border security amendments Democrats opposed. “Republicans thought that perhaps, while Democrats were throwing money at “environmental justice” and climate slush funds and identifying gaps in tree canopy coverage, perhaps they could spare some money for the crisis at our southern border – a crisis that Democrats have largely chosen to pretend doesn’t exist. “But Democrats quashed any attempt to divert money to address the border crisis. “Apparently identifying gaps in tree canopy coverage is more important than securing our southern border. “Democrats went so far as to oppose – oppose – an amendment that would have prohibited hiring additional IRS agents until additional Customs and Border Protection agents are hired to help secure the border. “Yes, you heard that right. “Mr. President, I’m pretty sure Americans are more worried about our border crisis than what Democrats apparently think is an IRS enforcement crisis. “But clearly Democrats don’t want to let border security get in the way of funding for their Green New Deal priorities or supersizing the IRS. “Mr. President, it may have an appealing name, but as the substance of the bill demonstrates, the so-called Inflation Reduction Act is nothing more than the latest installment of Democrats’ big-government, big-spending agenda.  “It will do nothing to address the real economic challenges facing Americans. “And it will do nothing to address Americans’ priorities. “What it will do is spend hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars on Democrats’ socialist, big-government fantasies – and raise taxes to help pay for it.  “Meanwhile, our inflation crisis – and our border crisis, and rising crime – will continue. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/thune-democrats-big-government-big-spending-agenda-does-nothing-to-ease-economic-pain"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed President Biden’s unprecedented decision to transfer the cost of student loan debt from those who chose to incur the debt to those taxpayers who didn’t. He noted that it’s inherently unfair, encourages students to take on even more debt, and does nothing to address the skyrocketing cost of college education. Thune also noted that instead of focusing on policies that would help lower inflation for American families, Democrats instead chose to pursue their reckless tax-and-spending spree in order to appease their far-left base.Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, eight days. “Eight days. “That’s how long it took President Biden to completely erase any of the supposed deficit reduction included in Democrats’ so-called Inflation Reduction Act. “On August 24, eight days after signing the Inflation Reduction Act into law, President Biden announced that with a stroke of his pen, he would be forgiving $10,000 in student loan debt ($20,000 for Pell Grant recipients) and taking other costly measures on student loans. “The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget – where Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen served before joining the Biden administration – estimates that, altogether, the president’s student loan changes will cost anywhere from $440 billion to $600 billion over the next decade.  “The Penn Wharton Budget Model suggests that it could be even worse than that, with the total cost over 10 years exceeding $1 trillion.   “Mr. President, even using the most optimistic assumptions, the Inflation Reduction Act would only ever have reduced the deficit by around $300 billion. “President Biden’s student loan plan will wipe out every dime of that reduction, and then add hundreds of billions to the debt on top of that. “So much for Democrats’ commitment to reducing the deficit. “Mr. President, I’ve already noted that the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the president’s student loan measures will cost a staggering half a trillion dollars over the next decade.   “Here’s what else the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget had to say: “‘The student debt cancellation and relief measures announced … by the Biden Administration … would meaningfully boost inflation.’ “‘Would meaningfully boost inflation.’ “Yes. “Americans have spent the majority of the Biden administration struggling with huge increases in the price of everything from gas to groceries, and the president just imposed a new policy that is likely to, quote, ‘meaningfully boost inflation.’ “I guess it isn’t surprising, Mr. President. “After all, it’s thanks in large part to Democrats and the president that we ended up in this inflation crisis in the first place. “Their reckless American Rescue Plan spending spree flooded the economy with unnecessary government money, and the economy overheated as a result. “But the president’s latest reckless action underscores just how committed Democrats are to their big-spending, big-government agenda. “Mr. President, Democrats tried to suggest that they’d gotten serious about the economy with their so-called Inflation Reduction Act – even though the bill was only serious about spending taxpayer dollars on ill-considered priorities like their Green New Deal agenda. “But the fact that it took the president exactly eight days to wipe out any deficit reduction from Democrats’ bill tells you all you need to know about exactly how serious Democrats are about handling taxpayer dollars responsibly. “Mr. President, I’ve talked for a while here about why the president’s student loan plans are such bad economic policy. “But you don’t have to take my word for it.   “Here’s what former Obama economic adviser Jason Furman had to say about President Biden’s student loan plans: “Pouring roughly half [a] trillion dollars of gasoline on the inflationary fire that is already burning is reckless.  Doing it while going well beyond one campaign promise ($10K of student loan relief) and breaking another (all proposals paid for) is even worse.” “Another former Obama economic adviser noted, and I quote, ‘Student loan debt relief is spending that raises demand and increases inflation. … It will also tend to be inflationary by raising tuitions.’ “Even some current Democrat members of Congress have expressed their concerns about the president’s reckless student loan decision. “And the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget – where President Biden’s own treasury secretary once served on the board – issued a scathing statement in which she said, and I quote:  “‘This announcement is gallingly reckless – with the national debt approaching record levels and inflation surging, it will make both worse. … It would do nothing to actually make education more affordable, and if anything, this policy will drive up tuition costs while raising prices on a variety of other goods and services for ordinary Americans.’ “‘… while raising prices on a variety of other goods and services for ordinary Americans.’ “Mr. President, as the Washington Post’s editorial board noted, American taxpayers will be footing the bill for the president’s student loan decision.  “Ordinary Americans will pay in the form of higher prices. “They’ll pay in the form of higher rates on loans and mortgages. “And they’ll pay in the form of higher tuition costs. “The majority of Americans do not have student loan debt – either because they’ve paid off their loans, never went to college, got a scholarship or worked their way through college, or were able to go thanks to their or their parents’ savings. “Now these Americans will be footing the bill for the 13 percent of Americans who do have student loan debt. “Everyone is going to have to suffer economically to provide loan forgiveness for the few. “This is deeply unfair, Mr. President. “It’s unfair to expect Americans who either never went to college, paid off their loans, or paid their way through to shoulder the cost of other Americans’ loans. “The president’s decision is unfair to parents who scrimped and saved to send their children to college. “To students who chose a lower-cost college or worked to put themselves through. “To the men and women in the military who fought for this country to earn money for their college education. “And to the families struggling with high grocery bills and high energy bills and high rent prices who are likely to end up facing even more price increases thanks to the president’s student loan decisions. “And let’s remember that taxpayers are going to be facing economic hardship to pay off student loans for Americans who, if they graduated from college, enjoy greater long-term earning potential than many of the Americans who will be helping to shoulder the burden for their debts. “The president’s plan isn’t even targeted to the most needy, with families making $250,000 – nearly ten times the poverty line for a family of four – now eligible to have their loans forgiven.  “Mr. President, there’s no doubt that the cost of a college education has risen outrageously. “And that in some cases students have been encouraged to take on unrealistic levels of debt to pay for it.  “But the president’s student loan plan does absolutely NOTHING to fix these problems. “The president’s plan will not only do nothing to control the cost of college education, it will almost undoubtedly make our current situation worse.    “What college is going to spend time worrying about lowering student fees if it can expect the federal government to pick up part of the bill for its students’ education? “The president’s plan will also do nothing to discourage students from taking on unrealistic levels of debt. “In fact, it’s likely to encourage students to incur even more debt, since the president has now set up an expectation that the government will step in to help pay down students’ loan burden. “Given the fact that student loan debt is expected to be back to its current level in six years, I imagine we will be hearing more Democrat calls for student loan forgiveness in the very near future.   “In fact, some members of the Democrat Party already think the president didn’t go far enough. “More than one Democrat wanted the president to forgive $50,000 in debt. “Apparently these Democrats won’t be satisfied until our economy drowns entirely under the weight of reckless government spending.  “Mr. President, the defining ‘achievement’ of the Biden administration so far has been an economy that has left millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet. “Apparently the president wants that to be his legacy. “Because for the sake of a few possible additional votes in November, he has decided to pursue yet another economic policy that will almost undoubtedly result in further economic pain for the American people. “Now he’ll just have to hope that his strategy doesn’t backfire. “Because while his reckless student loan plan may buy him a vote or two, a lot of other Americans may decide that they’ve had their fill of inflationary spending and far-left appeasement. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.” Permalink:

John Thune (R-S.D.), a longtime member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, today spoke at the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works’ hearing on his Livestock Regulatory Protection Act, which the committee is considering. Thune also welcomed Scott VanderWal, president of the South Dakota Farm Bureau Federation and vice president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, who testified about the importance of Thune’s bill.In April 2021, Thune introduced the bipartisan Livestock Regulatory Protection Act, legislation that would prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from issuing permits related to livestock emissions. Specifically, the bill would amend the Clean Air Act to prohibit the EPA from issuing permits for any carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, water vapor, or methane emissions resulting from biological processes associated with livestock production.Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery):“Thank you Chairman Carper and Ranking Member Capito for holding today’s legislative hearing to consider the Livestock Regulatory Protection Act.“I also want to thank South Dakota Farm Bureau Federation President and American Farm Bureau Federation Vice President Scott VanderWal for being here and for his testimony on this important legislation.“I have long been concerned with efforts to impose onerous regulations and costly permit fees on animal emissions and the negative effect this would have on U.S. agricultural producers’ ability to continue providing a safe and abundant food supply for our nation and the world. “Regulating animal emissions could ultimately lead to higher food costs for consumers who are already facing increased food prices. “Contrary to the story being pushed by opponents of the beef industry, beef production is directly responsible for only a tiny fraction of U.S. emissions. “Cattle actually play an important role in managing pasturelands that sequester vast amounts of carbon. “And on top of that, it’s become clear that with certain feed additives, as well as then capturing and utilizing the energy potential of their waste using biodigesters, it’s possible to significantly reduce cattle emissions – making the demonization of beef even more wrongheaded. “This issue isn’t limited to cattle production.  “Regulating animal emissions would negatively affect the entire livestock sector, including poultry producers in Delaware and dairy producers in West Virginia. “To address this, I introduced the Livestock Regulatory Protection Act with Senator Sinema. “The Livestock Regulatory Protection Act, which is also cosponsored by Senators Boozman and Kelly, would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from imposing emissions regulations relating to the biological processes of livestock. “I actually introduced this bill years ago with the Democrat leader. “This legislation was included in annual funding bills on a bipartisan basis for a number of years after the Democrat leader and I first introduced it. “Unfortunately, Democrats have omitted this important protection in their recent spending proposals, and it has had to be secured in final spending bills. “Passing this legislation would provide livestock producers long-term certainty that their livelihoods will not be compromised by regulatory overreach.  “Thanks again for holding today’s hearing, and I urge this committee to swiftly advance this important legislation.” ###Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/thune-south-dakota-farm-bureau-president-testify-in-favor-of-thune-led-livestock-regulatory-protection-act"

Democrats control the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives, and while there have been plenty of policies I’ve disagreed with, I’m proud of the work I’ve been able to accomplish on behalf of all South Dakotans.With the Senate having just begun its traditional August state work period, I’m excited to have more opportunities to travel across the state to talk to folks about what is on their minds, what has been accomplished the last few months in Washington, and what else is in store for the rest of the year.One of the most important bills Congress takes up every year is the National Defense Authorization Act. This year’s bill will authorize critical funding to continue preparation for the B-21 mission at Ellsworth Air Force Base, and it will also include my proposal to authorize additional funding for school districts affected by growing missions. I am incredibly proud that South Dakota and Ellsworth were chosen to serve as the first operating base for the B-21. I am committed to ensuring that the base has everything it needs to continue serving as one of our nation’s essential military assets for decades to come, including by ensuring local communities have the resources to help address school and housing capacity needs. Turning from the air to the sea, at the beginning of the summer, my Ocean Shipping Reform Act received overwhelming bipartisan support in both the House and Senate, and it is now the law of the land. This new law will help ease supply chain pressures by addressing unfair ocean carrier practices, speeding up the resolution of disputes over carrier fees, and improving the movement of goods at our nation’s ports. This is especially important for South Dakota producers, who rely on efficient access to markets around the world for their products. It won’t solve our nation’s inflation crisis, but it should help make life easier for U.S. exporters, importers, and consumers alike.  After months of requests, I was pleased that the administration finally agreed to restore the summertime sale of E15 fuel for 2022, which went into effect on June 1. I have long advocated to make permanent the year-round sale of E15, plus higher blends of ethanol, as a way to offer American drivers more affordable and cleaner options at the gas pump and to offset foreign sources of energy. It’s a step in the right direction, and I will continue to call on the Biden administration to leverage American agriculture to help drive down gas prices and support our state’s economy.As a longtime member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, ensuring that our rural communities have a seat at the table remains a top priority for me. Right now, the 2023 farm bill is a big focus of mine. I’ve already begun to hold a series of roundtables to hear from South Dakota farmers and ranchers about what they need from next year’s bill, and I plan to continue introducing proposals that I hope to get included in it. Agriculture is the lifeblood of the South Dakota economy, and I will do everything I can to make sure that our farmers and ranchers have the resources they need to help feed our country.As always, fighting for South Dakota is my number-one priority. I’m focused on the same principles and priorities that have always guided me: working hard, fighting for what matters, and listening to my top advisers – you, the people of South Dakota. I look forward to catching up with folks this month, and if we cross paths, please be sure to say hello. In the meantime, if you have questions about how I can help you, or if you have an idea or feedback about something I’m working on, please don’t hesitate to write, call, or email – I’m all ears.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/delivering-for-south-dakotans"

From soaring gas prices to food prices – and just about everything in between – a nearly 41-year high inflation rate is forcing families to dig deeper into their pocketbooks as they try to make ends meet. I continue to hear from folks across the state who tell me about the sacrifices they are making, and it’s abundantly clear that they need some relief.Unfortunately, instead of pursuing policies that would grow our economy and drive down prices for families and small businesses, Democrats continue to pursue the policies that helped lead to record-high inflation in the first place. Democrats are pursuing their so-called “Inflation Reduction Act,” a bill that would do nothing to reduce inflation but would double down on wasteful government spending and impose hundreds of billions of dollars in tax hikes on American businesses – tax hikes that would result in higher prices for consumers in nearly every income bracket.Our economy has posted negative economic growth for the past two quarters – the textbook definition of a recession – and Democrats think now is an ideal time to raise taxes on American businesses. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to understand that raising taxes in the middle of a recession is a very, very bad idea. Bottom line, Democrats are failing Economics 101.  Increasing the tax burden on American businesses and consumers doesn’t end there. The Democrats’ bill would also impose a methane fee and a new tax hike on U.S. refiners importing crude oil and petroleum products, which are intended to make conventional energy prohibitively more expensive. Regardless of the wishful thinking Democrats engage in, Americans still need conventional energy – now and into the near future. The Democrats’ energy tax hikes are setting everyday Americans up to continue to suffer under high energy prices for the foreseeable future, as the cost for gas far exceeds the $2.38 price per gallon when President Biden took office.The Democrats’ bill – that they bizarrely claim is going to lower inflation – happens to be chock-full of radical, Green New Deal-esque policies. There’s billions of dollars for a grant program to plant trees and things like identifying gaps in tree canopy coverage. There are billions of dollars going to purchase heavy-duty electric vehicles like garbage trucks and even more money for the U.S. Postal Service to purchase zero-emission delivery vehicles – to name a few.Among other egregious policies, there are tax credits for folks who purchase electric vehicles and even more write-offs for refitting windows, skylights, and doors to meet Democrats’ required level of energy efficiency. The icing on the cake, of course, is the fact that the wealthiest Americans in our country are the ones who are purchasing electric vehicles, and Democrats want to give these high-income earners a tax break. This bill is wasteful and irresponsible and would create a lot of economic pain for hardworking Americans and job creators.The Democrats’ $1.9 trillion spending spree in early 2021 helped plunge our economy into an inflation crisis that has left Americans struggling. If anything, Democrats should have learned that dumping unnecessary dollars into the economy is a recipe for disaster. Their new partisan tax-and-spending spree, unfortunately, tees up even more economic pain for families. As we have seen time and time again, economic common sense is taking a back seat to Democrats’ big-spending, big-government ideology. I will continue to fight back against these radical, out-of-touch policies and focus on solutions that put more money into the pocketbooks of hardworking South Dakotans.  Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/democrats-double-down-on-reckless-tax-and-spending-spree"

It doesn’t matter what town you’re traveling through, it becomes clear that the people of this state are what give it its backbone. They are hardworking, passionate, God-fearing Americans who are willing to go the extra mile for a friend, neighbor, or family member.August was a busy month. I spent most of it crisscrossing South Dakota, meeting with South Dakotans and taking in the sights and sounds of everything that our great state has to offer in the summertime. For me, there’s nothing more valuable than hearing directly from families and small business owners – to hear what challenges they’re facing and what I can do in Washington to help out.One way I intend to help is by crafting a pro-South Dakota farm bill. I hosted multiple roundtable events across the state where I was able to receive invaluable feedback from farmers and ranchers ahead of the 2023 farm bill. I visited small towns in every corner of the state and hosted events where I was able to hear what’s on folks’ minds. South Dakotans’ concerns are my concerns, so you can be sure I’ll take everything I heard with me back to Washington.As I traveled the state, I shared some of the bipartisan wins I have helped deliver for South Dakotans this year. From getting my Ocean Shipping Reform Act signed into law to restoring the summertime sale of E15 fuel to securing critical funding for Ellsworth Air Force Base, these successes were no easy feat in a Democrat-controlled Washington. While much was accomplished, there is much more work yet to do this Congress.Whether I was in a bigger city or a smaller town, I heard about everything from record-high inflation to border security to gas prices. I heard about economic issues, particularly the workforce shortages that are plaguing businesses throughout the state. Farmers and ranchers told me about the agriculture industry’s seemingly annual struggle with tough weather and market conditions. Part of my job is to try to prevent bad policies from going into place that will make these crises worse, and you can be sure I’ll fight hard to do just that.The other thing I love about August in South Dakota is that it’s fair season. The Sioux Empire Fair, the Turner County Fair, Dakotafest, the Brown County Fair, and Yankton Riverboat Days – to name a few – are quintessential stops that ensure you’re having a true South Dakota summer. I often joke that in August I’m basically eating my way across the state. From milkshakes at Dakotafest to Tubby burgers at the Brown County Fair, I look forward to these fair-food staples every year.South Dakota is the best place in the country to live, work, and raise a family. It’s my home. It’s my kids’ and grandkids’ home. And it’s a beacon of freedom, opportunity, and personal responsibility that continues to draw people from across the United States to come explore during all seasons of the year.Summer is ending, but fall is right around the corner. That means South Dakota high school and college sports, pheasant hunting, and so much more. As always, spending quality time with South Dakotans has been very informative, especially as I prepare to head back to Washington where a little commonsense and South Dakota straight-talk go a long way. Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/summer-in-south-dakota"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today joined Neil Cavuto on Fox News to discuss President Biden’s executive action to extend the suspension of repayments on qualifying federal student loans and forgive up to $20,000 per borrower. Earlier today, Thune called out Democrats for not having a serious plan to lower the cost of higher education and for putting taxpayers and working families on the hook for billions of dollars of student loans in a blatant political payoff. On President Biden’s costly student loan decision:“[President Biden] keeps coming up with new ways to increase inflation in our economy. [Student loan forgiveness] will certainly do that. It’ll increase the cost of college education because tuition costs are going to go up. And I think it will add to inflation because it’s pumping more money out into the economy at a time when we have record 40-year-high inflation.“Here’s the problem with this, you’ve got 87 percent of the people in this country [who] don’t have student debt, so [the Biden administration is] going to subsidize the 13 percent who do, and the 87 percent who don’t have student loan debt are going to pay for it in the form of maybe higher taxes down the road […] and higher inflation.”…“Democrats are trying to change the subject. They're trying not to talk about inflation and the broken border and energy costs and crime in our streets. They're trying to shift it to something that they think is more favorable ground for them. And the way they do that, in most cases, is they buy it. Democrats spend money, they raise taxes, they grow and expand government. That is what they do. And in this case, at least $300 billion dollars –  I mean, think about that – just like that the Democrats dropped $300 billion in hopes again that it has some positive political benefit.“In the long run this hurts the economy, contributes to inflation, and more importantly, as has already been pointed out by your reporters, this sends a really wrong message to people in this country. This is a country that was built upon a principle of personal individual responsibility. And what you're saying here, to a whole lot of people in the country, is go ahead, take out loans, don't worry about it, we'll just write it off when the time comes.“And again, that may make a few people happy in the near term, but this is going to have long term consequences that are very, I would say, devastating to the whole principle and ethic that sort of undergirds the American experiment. But in the near term, it's going to have a negative, I think, economic consequence as well because it's going to add to the cost of tuition to go to college in this country.”Some estimates suggest that forgiving $10,000 in student loans for certain borrowers would cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. In addition, the current student loan repayment freeze has already cost American taxpayers more than $100 billion. In April, Thune introduced the Stop Reckless Student Loan Actions Act, which would end President Biden’s untargeted, budget-busting suspension of repayments on qualifying federal student loans. The bill would still allow the president to temporarily suspend repayment for low- and middle-income borrowers in future national emergencies and would prohibit the president from cancelling outstanding federal student loan obligations due to a national emergency.Thune has led common-sense measures to address the problem of student debt. In December 2020, Congress passed a five-year version of legislation Thune introduced with Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) to allow employers to help employees repay their loans. Thune and Warner’s Employer Participation in Repayment Act amends the Educational Assistance Program to permit employers to make tax-free payments on their employees’ student loans. Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/thune-on-fox-news-biden-transfers-student-debt-from-graduates-to-taxpayers"

We may disagree with each other about which of our states produces the better tasting beef, but we share the strong view that the highest quality beef in the world is raised right here in the United States.We also agree that the beef labeling system in our country needs to change. Currently, imported beef that is neither born nor raised in the United States, but simply finished here, is allowed to be labeled as “Product of the U.S.A.” The ground beef you picked up from the grocery store to fire up on the grill this weekend during the game could have originally come from a country half way around the world, but just because it was packaged here in the United States, there could still be a misleading label on it. At that point, the only thing that’s potentially made in the U.S.A. is the packaging it’s wrapped in — if that.To address this, the 2002 and 2008 farm bills included mandatory country of origin labeling (MCOOL) for beef. Unfortunately, the World Trade Organization (WTO), essentially the global referee when it comes to trade between nations, ruled against the United States on MCOOL for beef. Despite our opposition, Congress repealed MCOOL in 2015. Standing up for cattle producers is, and always will be, a top priority for us, which is why we have introduced legislation that would provide a path forward for the reinstatement of MCOOL for beef.Our American Beef Labeling Act would require the U.S. trade representative (USTR), in consultation with the U.S. secretary of agriculture, to develop a WTO-compliant means of reinstating MCOOL for beef. Specifically, our bill would give USTR six months to develop a reinstatement plan followed by a six-month window to implement it. If USTR fails to reinstate MCOOL for beef within one year of enactment, it would automatically be reinstated. That would ensure when you see a “Product of the U.S.A” label on your beef, you can trust it.Our legislation currently has eight cosponsors in the Senate, and a bipartisan companion bill has also been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. We will continue working to build support from our colleagues to advance this important legislation because having transparency in labeling that benefits producers and consumers alike is just common sense.** Note to editors: This column first appeared on Agri-Pulse.com.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/bipartisan-beef"

John Thune (R-S.D.) last night joined Mike Emanuel on Fox News to discuss the successful passage of his amendment to the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending spree, which eliminated a new $35 billion tax hike on small- and medium-sized businesses, and how the bill, among other things, will be used to hire 87,000 new IRS agents to target middle-income Americans.  On the Democrats’ plan to hire 87,000 new IRS agents: “Mike, I think the takeaway from the passage of this bill is there is an IRS agent coming to a neighborhood near you. 87,000 new employees at the IRS, only 4 percent of them are going to be, you know, committed to helping improve taxpayer service. Most of them are going to be harassing middle-income taxpayers.“There was a study done by the Joint Tax Committee, which showed that up to 90 percent, up to 90 percent of any revenue the Democrats think they're going to raise from the so-called addition of these IRS tax agents is going to come from people making less than $400,000 a year.“So there's going to be a lot of people, middle-income taxpayers in this country, who are going to have to get used to having the IRS looking over their shoulder at every turn. That's what the essence of this is, that's what they signed up for with this bill: 87,000 new IRS agents and $80 billion in new spending, six times the annual IRS budget. That's what this bill is all about.” On passage of Sen. Thune’s amendment to the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending spree:  “It’s a short-term win. We were able to take a $35 billion tax hike on small- and medium-sized businesses out of the bill. And it was nice to get seven Democrats voting for it.“But as you point out, these are all Democrats who are up for re-election here in just a few months, and they’re scared. I think they’re scared to have to go back to their voters and tell them that, you know, we raised taxes, we had this massive new tax increase on small- and medium-sized businesses in this country. And at a time when most of those taxes, obviously, are going to be passed on to the same people in the country who are already experiencing 40-year-high inflation.” Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/thune-on-fox-news-the-irs-is-coming-to-a-neighborhood-near-you"

Without successful passage of Thune’s amendment, more than 18,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in the United States that employ 11.7 million workers would risk being subjected to $35 billion in tax hikes.

John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed how the Democrats’ so-called “Inflation Reduction Act” would do nothing to reduce inflation and how it would double down on wasteful government spending and impose hundreds of billions of dollars in tax hikes on American businesses. Thune noted that these tax hikes would result in higher prices for consumers in nearly every income bracket. Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, we’re somehow continuing to consider Democrats’ grab bag of bad ideas – otherwise known (misleadingly) as the Inflation Reduction Act. “Let’s start with the bill’s title.  “It gets you feeling hopeful, doesn’t it? “The Inflation Reduction Act. “It sounds like a bill that’s going to address perhaps the number-one problem facing our nation: inflation. “And then you actually look at the bill’s contents … and discover that the bill will do nothing to reduce inflation. “Nothing. “And you don’t have to take my word for it. “Here’s what the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model had to say about the bill’s impact on inflation: ‘The impact on inflation is statistically indistinguishable from zero.’  “‘Statistically indistinguishable from zero. “The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office also found that the bill would do nothing to address our current inflation crisis.  “So did the Tax Foundation. “So much for inflation reduction. “So what about the deficit reduction Democrats are touting? “Well, unfortunately there’s a good chance there won’t be much of that either. “Democrats rely on some very shady accounting to reach their supposed deficit reduction number – most notably counting $120 billion in savings from the repeal of a rule that has never been implemented – and at this point was not expected to be. “Mr. President, no matter what this rule was predicted to cost, if it was never going to be implemented its cost was effectively $0 – and so repealing this rule leaves you with exactly zero extra dollars to spend – not $120 billion. “Then there’s the question of the bill’s expanded Obamacare subsidies.  “Democrats’ bill extends the expanded Obamacare subsidies by three years. “But it’s common knowledge that Democrats want to extend them permanently – as the president explicitly said in his State of the Union address. “And when you figure in the cost of extending them permanently, most of the purported cost savings in the bill – which Democrats claim will go toward deficit reduction – dwindle away.  “So no inflation reduction.  An extremely doubtful amount of deficit reduction. “What else? “Well, there are the hundreds of billions of dollars in tax hikes. “Yes, Mr. President.  “Hundreds of billions of dollars in tax hikes. “Our economy has posted two consecutive quarters of negative growth – in fact by any common definition we are now in a recession – and Democrats think now is a good time to hike taxes. “On businesses. “Businesses that are already struggling with 40-year-high inflation. “Democrats’ book minimum tax, as proposed last week, would be a $313 billion tax hike, with roughly half of the increase falling on American manufacturers. “Mr. President, I don’t think I need to tell anyone what happens when you raise taxes on businesses – particularly when the economy is shrinking. “You get less growth, lower wages, and fewer jobs. “According to an analysis from the National Association of Manufacturers, in 2023 alone the version of the bill Democrats introduced last week would reduce real gross domestic product by more than $68 billion and result in more than 218,000 fewer workers in the overall economy. “The Tax Foundation also found that the bill would – unsurprisingly – reduce economic growth, reduce wages, and reduce jobs. “In short, a big part of the burden of Democrats’ tax hike on businesses would fall on American families and American workers.  “And, Mr. President, the book minimum tax on American businesses isn’t the only tax hike Democrats are proposing in this bill. “They also just reportedly replaced a $14 billion tax hike on investment with a new, $74 billion stock buyback tax designed to punish investors who choose to keep their own money invested in a business – a tax hike that will likely discourage new investment and have a negative impact on Americans’ retirement savings. “And, of course, they’ve included a number of taxes and fees on oil and gas production. “I guess Democrats would like our current sky-high energy prices to continue long term. “Because I’m at a loss for any other reason why Democrats would choose to hike taxes on oil and gas production at a time when Americans are already struggling with high gas prices and high utility bills. “Mr. President, Democrats didn’t always think raising taxes during a recession was a good idea. “In fact, President Obama once said, “[T]he last thing you want to do is to raise taxes in the middle of a recession.” “Or as the current Democrat leader once put it, “You don’t want to take money out of the economy when the economy is shrinking.” “Unfortunately, now that their Green New Deal fantasies are on the line, Democrats have changed their tune. “That’s right, Mr. President. “Democrats are hiking taxes during a recession not to address our border crisis, or inflation, or rising crime, but so that they can implement their Green New Deal agenda. “Their so-called Inflation Reduction Act is chock-full of Green New Deal spending. “Things like $1.5 billion – billion – for a grant program to plant trees. “$1 billion for electric heavy-duty vehicles like garbage trucks. “$3 billion for the U.S. Postal Service to purchase zero-emission delivery vehicles. “And $1.9 billion for things like road equity and identifying gaps in tree canopy coverage. “Yes, Mr. President. “Democrats are apparently willing to send us into a longer-term recession – or stagflation – in order to provide billions of dollars for things like road equity and identifying gaps in tree canopy coverage. “All told, Democrats provide more than $60 billion in this bill for ‘environmental justice.’ “$60 billion. “To put that number in perspective, that’s more than the federal government spent on highways in 2019. “The bill also contains at least $30 billion in climate slush funds – part of which is allocated for, among other things, climate-related political activity. “Yes, Mr. President. “Climate-related political activity. “Somehow I don’t think families struggling with ballooning grocery bills and the high price of gas are eager to see their tax dollars going to Green New Deal activism. “But apparently Democrats disagree. “And I haven’t even talked about the tax credits and rebates Democrats’ bill would provide for wealthy Americans to purchase new electric vehicles – or remodel their kitchens with Democrat-approved green appliances. “Mr. President, I could go on for a while here. “It’s difficult to squeeze all of the bad ideas in Democrats’ bill into just one floor speech. “I haven’t mentioned the socialist-style price controls Democrats’ bill would impose on prescription drugs – price controls that would result in fewer new drugs and treatments. “Or the additional $80 billion – yes, Mr. President, $80 billion – that Democrats’ bill would give to the IRS – the majority of it to boost IRS audits. “More than $45 billion of that money would go to IRS enforcement. “$45 billion.  Or 57 percent. “Want to know how much of that $80 billion would go to taxpayer services? “Four percent. “Mr. President, this is an agency that only succeeded in answering about one out of every 50 taxpayer phone calls during the 2021 tax season. “And yet Democrats are focused not on improving taxpayer services, but on boosting the number of IRS audits. “And, Mr. President, no one should be deceived into thinking these increased audits will fall solely on millionaires and billionaires. “No matter what Democrats – and some officials at the IRS – conveniently claim, the fact of the matter is that it’s exceedingly unlikely that Democrats will be able to collect the revenue they want to collect from increased IRS enforcement without auditing small businesses and ordinary taxpayers. “In fact, based on data from the Joint Committee on Taxation, 78 to 90 percent of the revenue projected to be raised from under-reported income would likely come from those making under $200,000. “Mr. President, almost 18 months ago now, Democrats passed a massive, partisan, $1.9 trillion spending spree. “Americans are still struggling with the resulting inflation crisis. “This new tax-and-spending spree is yet another terrible economic idea from Democrats. “And like the so-called American Rescue Plan before it, it will leave our economy – and the American people – worse off. “For their sake, I hope Democrats will think better of this bill before it’s too late. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink:

John Thune (R-S.D.) and Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, introduced a resolution expressing support for the United States’ actions that will strengthen the military interoperability and resiliency of Finland’s and Sweden’s militaries, prior to their anticipated accession to the Northern Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance. “Finland and Sweden will bring their own unique capabilities and industries to NATO that will strengthen the alliance, expand its geostrategic position, and bolster its deterrence posture,” said Thune. “Purposeful engagement at this time would not only deepen our interoperability, but demonstrate reassurance before Finland and Sweden formally join the treaty. It would also help signal to other NATO members to quickly complete their respective membership approvals.” “The United States Senate rightly voted by an overwhelming majority to welcome Finland and Sweden into NATO,” said Inhofe. “While we wait for other members of NATO to do the same, the United States and fellow allies should intensify coordination with these partners to underscore our commitment from the get-go and make it clear to Russia that we will not be deterred by their meddlesome threats in the meantime. Our resolution calls on the President to strengthen the defense cooperation that is at the root of these nations’ historic decision to join NATO.” The resolution was cosponsored by U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.).Thune and Inhofe’s resolution specifically addresses the interim period before all NATO members have completed their respective ratification protocols, while Finland and Sweden will not yet have the full collective security protections of the alliance. It also supports a spectrum of actions to enhance bi-, tri-, and multilateral interoperability of Finland and Sweden to ensure both nations can fully contribute as NATO members on day one of their membership. Such actions, including exercises and training, bomber task forces, and freedom of navigation operations in the Baltic Sea, would also serve as de facto near-term security assurances from Russian aggression while highlighting the capabilities Finland and Sweden will bring to NATO. Many of the actions enumerated in the resolution already take place. However, the resolution seeks greater emphasis and intent from the administration to set U.S. posture for the next phase of the broader accession effort, as well as maintain U.S. leadership in support of these historic additions to the alliance. It also would assist in countering disinformation that targets a number of NATO member nations that could potentially delay their timely consideration of Finland’s and Sweden’s bids for NATO membership.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/thune-inhofe-lead-resolution-supporting-increased-coordination-with-finland-sweden-ahead-of-full-nato-membership"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today joined Gillian Turner on Fox News to discuss how the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending spree will increase costs on American families on top of the 40-year-high inflation that is already hurting their pocketbooks.   On the Democrats’ bill failing to meaningfully address historically high inflation: “As you pointed out, the Congressional Budget Office, which is the official scorekeeper for Congress, said [the bill] will have a negligible effect on getting, you know, battling inflation, contrary to what you just played the president saying. “And there are lots of other budgetary models out there by nonpartisan entities that have come to the same conclusion that, in fact, it will increase inflation in the near term and do nothing to reduce it in the long term. “So, if you're worried about inflation, if you're worried about gas prices, if you're worried about the economy generally, I think this is just a really bad bill. And I'm hoping that more Democrats are going to come to that realization, because they won't get a single Republican vote for it here in the Senate.” On the higher costs families will face if this legislation passes:  “Well, it certainly increases rates on businesses, all of which gets passed on to consumers in this country. And the Joint Committee on Taxation, again, which is the official scorekeeper when it comes to tax and revenue issues here in Washington, has done a study and they have suggested that the burden of these tax increases will be felt the most by people making under $200,000 a year, that in fact, in 2023, this next year, people under $200,000 a year would end up paying $17 billion more [in] higher costs. “It raises taxes on businesses, it raises taxes on oil and gas production, and even raises taxes on imported oil into this country, all of which are paid for at the pump by American consumers. So, it's loaded with tax increases.” … “But there are lots of taxes, hundreds of billions of dollars of taxes in this, all of which get passed on and paid for in the form of lower wages or higher prices. It's as simple as that, and it's economics 101, which I don't think the Democrats fully comprehend.” Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/thune-democrats-prioritize-radical-climate-agenda-over-addressing-skyrocketing-energy-prices"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed how Democrats’ proposed energy tax hikes would hurt Americans who are already suffering from high energy prices. Thune noted that the Democrats’ bill is wasteful and irresponsible and would do nothing to ease the economic pain that their policies have helped create. Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, last week Democrats unveiled their so-called Inflation Reduction Act – a bill that will do nothing to reduce inflation, but will double down on Democrats’ wasteful government spending, along with imposing hundreds of billions in tax hikes. “Yes. “Hundreds of billions of dollars in tax hikes. “Our economy has posted negative economic growth for the past two quarters, and Democrats think it’s a good idea to raise taxes on American businesses. “Perhaps Democrats think that current prices aren’t high enough. “Or that businesses aren’t struggling enough with the inflation Democrats helped create. “The worst part, of course, is that a substantial part of the burden of these tax hikes will fall on ordinary Americans. “Americans who are already struggling with historically high inflation. “Americans who are seeing their grocery bills balloon and their rent skyrocket. “Americans who are paying more than $4.00 per gallon every time they fill up their car. “Now Democrats are going to pass tax hikes that will hit these Americans hard. “A tax hike on businesses that will almost undoubtedly result in lower growth, lower wages, and fewer jobs. “A tax hike on investment – investment we need to grow our economy and create opportunities for American workers. “And tax hikes on energy production. “Yes. “Tax hikes on energy production – to the tune of $60 billion. “Mr. President, as I mentioned, Americans are still, on average, paying more than $4.00 a gallon every time they go to fill up their cars – as they have been for months. “Their electricity bills are up. “The price for utility gas service is up – by almost 40 percent. “And Democrats think now is a good time to raise taxes on oil and gas production. “I guess maybe they’re hoping that they can force Americans off conventional energy by continuing to keep gas and energy prices high. “And in case anyone was thinking that Democrats would be content with shutting down domestic production – with a methane tax, higher royalties, excise taxes, and costly permitting delays – and would rather Americans receive conventional energy from abroad – well, Democrats have a tax hike for that too.  “The Democrats’ bill would impose a new tax hike on U.S. refiners importing crude oil and petroleum products intended to make conventional energy prohibitively expensive.“But of course Americans still need conventional energy – and that will continue to be true for a while yet no matter how much wishful thinking Democrats engage in. “And Democrats’ energy tax hikes are setting ordinary Americans up to continue to suffer under high energy prices for the foreseeable future. “So what are all these tax hikes for, Mr. President? “What government spending is worth imposing tax hikes that run the risk of pushing our economy into a longer recession – or stagflation? “Well, let me just review some of the “priorities” Democrats will be spending that tax hike money on. “There’s $1.5 billion – billion – for a grant program to plant trees. “And $1.9 billion for things like identifying gaps in tree canopy coverage. “Yes. “Identifying gaps in tree canopy coverage. “There’s $1 billion for electric heavy-duty vehicles like garbage trucks. “I’m not really sure why the federal government is going to be spending money on electric garbage trucks … or how that’s going to reduce inflation.  “There is $3 billion for the U.S. Postal Service to purchase zero-emission delivery vehicles. “Quite a lot of money for an agency that is supposedly self-funded. “There’s funding for road equity. “All told, there is more than $60 billion in funding for ‘environmental justice.’ “$60 billion. “That’s more than the federal government spent on highways in 2019. “There’s also at least $30 billion in climate slush funds – part of which is allocated for, among other things, climate-related political activity. “Yes. “Political activity. “So in other words, Democrats are raising taxes on Americans so that they can provide federal funding for Green New Deal activism. “And I haven’t even talked about all the tax credits for adopting Democrats’ preferred green energy technologies. “There are tax credits for purchasing electric vehicles and for refitting windows and skylights and doors to meet Democrats’ required level of energy efficiency. “Yes. “Democrats are raising the tax burden on working Americans to pay for tax credits for wealthy Americans to purchase a brand-new electric vehicle – or do some home remodeling. “Of course, these tax credits aren’t officially limited to wealthy Americans. “But I’m hard-pressed to think of many working families who can afford to spend $60,000 on a new electric vehicle while inflation is at a 40-year high. “Mr. President, I am a longtime supporter of clean energy. “I come from a state that is leading the way toward cleaner and more efficient energy technologies.  “And I have worked with colleagues from both parties to advance clean energy, including through the responsible use of energy tax credits to bring clean-energy technologies to the point where they can compete on their own. “But this bill has nothing in common with the bipartisan work I and many others have done to responsibly advance clean energy. “This bill is wasteful and irresponsible and will do essentially nothing to reduce warming globally as other nations continue to skate by. “It will, however, waste a lot of taxpayer dollars and create a lot of economic pain for hardworking Americans. “One think-tank analyzed a plan similar to the one Democrats are pushing and found that it would result in staggering job losses, higher energy bills, and a tremendous reduction in economic growth. “Mr. President, one sensible move to advance clean energy – and necessary investment in conventional energy – would be to address the arduous permitting process, which can hold up both renewable and conventional energy projects for years. “That’s something we should be focused on – to promote investment in the conventional energy we still need and in the renewable energy technologies of the future. “Instead, we’re being asked to support a bill that will squander billions and billions of taxpayer dollars on Green New Deal activism and road equity and monitoring tree canopies. “And we’re supposed to vote for it based on the vague promise that the Senate will consider – consider, mind you, not pass – permitting legislation. “Permitting legislation that may or may not meaningfully address the broken and burdensome permitting process or negate spurious lawsuits from far-left environmentalists. “And even if it did provide meaningful reform, my hopes are not high that the Biden administration would actually act on the legislation. “Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline – a project that endured a decade of permitting, was already underway, and was to be paired with $1.7 billion in private investment for renewables – does not instill confidence that even approved projects are safe from the president and Democrats’ Green New Deal ideology. “Mr. President, Democrats’ reckless, $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan spending spree helped plunge our economy into an inflation crisis that has left Americans struggling to make ends meet. “And if this new partisan tax-and-spending spree passes, Americans can look forward to a lot more economic pain in the future. “But at least they’ll be able to console themselves with the knowledge that their tax dollars are going to fund tree canopies. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink:

John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed how the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending spree would hurt South Dakota taxpayers. Thune noted that according to data from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, Americans in nearly every income bracket would bear a significant burden of this bill’s tax hikes, with more than half of the increased burden falling on Americans making $400,000 or less. Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, ‘You don’t want to take money out of the economy when the economy is shrinking.’ “‘You don’t want to take money out of the economy when the economy is shrinking.’ “Those aren’t my words. “Those were the words of the current Democrat leader in 2008. “‘You don’t want to take money out of the economy when the economy is shrinking.’ “Apparently it’s a philosophy the Democrat leader no longer subscribes to. “Because last week, he introduced legislation … to take money out of the economy when the economy is shrinking. “Democrats’ so-called Inflation Reduction Act – a misnomer if there ever was one, since the bill will do nothing to help alleviate our current inflation crisis – would take hundreds of billions of dollars out of the economy in the form of tax hikes and comes just as our economy posted a second quarter of negative growth. “Notably, the bill imposes a $313 billion tax hike on American businesses – with roughly half of that increase falling on American manufacturers. “I guess the president’s commitment to boosting American manufacturing takes a back seat to raising revenue to fund Democrats’ Green New Deal priorities. “Mr. President, I don’t think I need to tell anyone what happens when you raise taxes on businesses – particularly when the economy is shrinking. “You get less growth, lower wages, and fewer jobs. “According to an analysis from the National Association of Manufacturers, in 2023 alone Democrats’ bill would reduce real gross domestic product by more than $68 billion and result in 218,108 fewer workers in the overall economy. “And ordinary Americans would bear a substantial part of the burden of this tax increase.  “According to data from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, Democrats’ bill would increase the tax burden on Americans across every income bracket, with more than half of the increased tax burden falling on Americans making $400,000 or less. “Next year alone, Democrats’ bill would increase the tax burden on Americans earning less than $200,000 by $16.7 billion. “Mr. President, Democrats are brazenly attempting to sell this new tax as somehow closing a loophole, instead of hiking taxes on American businesses. “But that isn’t even close to being the truth. “When companies pay less than the current corporate tax rate, they’re often simply taking advantage of tax credits that Republicans and Democrats put in place to encourage investment in things like research and development or the production of new technologies. “Democrats aren’t closing a loophole in the tax code.  “They’re raising taxes on American businesses – at a time when our economy has posted two consecutive quarters of negative growth. “They’re raising taxes on businesses that are already struggling with historically high inflation. “Mr. President, Democrats claim they will make large companies pay at least a 15 percent minimum tax. “But that isn’t true either. “Because Democrats have created carveouts to their own minimum tax. “That’s right. “Not all companies will have to pay the new book minimum tax. “For instance, green energy companies – and companies that take green energy tax credits – will be allowed to pay less than Democrats’ alternative minimum corporate tax rate. “In other words, if you are a member of, or invest in, Democrats’ preferred industries, you get special tax treatment under Democrats’ legislation. “So much for ensuring that all companies “pay their fair share.” “Mr. President, in addition to their $313 billion tax hike on American businesses, Democrats’ legislation also raises taxes on investment – another bad idea at a time when our economy is already shrinking. “Perhaps Democrats’ real plan is to reduce inflation by slowing our economy and ensuring that we enter a recession – or stagflation. “Democrats’ legislation also raises taxes on oil and gas production – even as Americans continue to struggle with high energy prices, including a 75 percent increase in gas prices since President Biden took office. “And taxes aren’t the only way Democrats raise revenue in this bill to pay for their Green New Deal measures. “Democrats’ bill also attempts to raise revenue by increasing IRS audits and enforcement. “Democrats’ legislation gives the IRS an additional $80 billion in funding over 10 years. “This would allow the IRS to hire an additional 87,000 employees – meaning that the IRS would have nearly three times as many personnel as U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency charged with overseeing security at our nation’s borders. “The IRS’ budget would also substantially exceed Customs and Border Protection’s budget if this legislation is enacted. “You might think that given the raging crisis at our southern border, the Biden administration would be focused on beefing up funding and personnel for Customs and Border Protection instead of the IRS. “But you’d be wrong. “Apparently the need to find money for Democrats’ Green New Deal trumps the need for a secure border. “Mr. President, of the additional $80 billion that Democrats’ bill would hand to the IRS, 57 percent – or more than $45 billion – would go to enforcement, and 4 percent would go to taxpayer services.  “Four percent. “As I said on the floor yesterday, we’re talking about an agency that only succeeded in answering about one out of every 50 taxpayer phone calls during the 2021 tax season – and has repeatedly mishandled sensitive taxpayer data. “To name just one instance, confidential taxpayer information was either leaked or hacked from the IRS last year and shared with the left-leaning ProPublica in order to advance a partisan agenda. “And more than a year later, the IRS still hasn’t provided meaningful follow-up to Congress or accountability to taxpayers. “And yet Democrats’ focus is not on improving the IRS’ responsiveness and accountability, but on boosting the number of audits. “And speaking of those audits. “No one should think that the IRS would just be auditing major corporations and billionaires. “No, this bill would result in a lot of audits of small businesses and ordinary Americans. “In fact, it’s extremely unlikely that Democrats will be able to gather the revenue they’re claiming they can get from increased IRS enforcement unless they audit Americans making less than $200,000. “Based on data from the Joint Committee on Taxation, 78 to 90 percent of the revenue projected to be raised from under-reported income would likely come from those making under $200,000. “Only 4 to 9 percent would come from those making more than $500,000. “Mr. President, after more than a year of high inflation – spurred by Democrats’ reckless American Rescue Plan spending spree – and with an economy that has shrunk for the past two quarters, it’s hard to believe that Democrats are trying to pass hundreds of billions in tax hikes. “But once again, economic common sense is taking a back seat to Democrats’ big-spending, big-government ideology. “Democrats have already inflicted a lot of economic pain on the American people. “And if this legislation passes, there is more to come. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink:

And what they concluded [was] that the tax hike would place a disproportionate burden on those Americans, working Americans, making under $200,000 a year. … “But the broader point here, Charles, is prices are gonna go up, costs are gonna go up, for American citizens. We are at a time of record inflation. We have an economy that's wobbly. We've got two consecutive quarters now of negative GDP growth, and the Democrats’ prescription for that is raising taxes and increasing spending, the very thing, spending at least you could argue, that got us into this in the first place. “So this is a big mistake on their part.

John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed how the Democrats’ disastrous spending bill would increase inflation, raise taxes, and fund radical Green New Deal projects. Thune noted that rather than increasing accountability and improving taxpayer services, the Democrats’ bill would double the size of the Internal Revenue Service in order to increase tax audits to fund their reckless tax-and-spending spree. Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, Democrats dropped the latest version of their tax and spending spree last week. “And like every previous version, this bill is a bad deal for the American people. “Where should I start, Mr. President? “Maybe with the bill’s title. “In true Orwellian style, Democrats are calling the bill the Inflation Reduction Act … even though the bill would do nothing to reduce inflation. “And you don’t have to take my word for it. “The nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model analyzed the bill and found that the bill would not reduce inflation. “In fact, the analysis found that Democrats’ bill would contribute to inflation through 2024 and have no material impact on inflation in the long term.  “Mr. President, inflation has hit working Americans very hard. “Their grocery bills have ballooned. “Rents have skyrocketed. “Filling up their cars costs 75 percent more per gallon than it did when President Biden took office. “Their utility bills have increased. “The list goes on. “Families are having to cut back on purchases and dig into their savings or pull out their credit cards – or in some cases, visit a food bank – to make ends meet. “And what does Democrats’ tax-and-spending spree do to help? “Nothing. “Americans are dealing with the worst inflation in more than 40 years, and Democrats’ bill does nothing to help end our current crisis. “Nothing. “So what does the bill do, Mr. President? “Well, for one thing, it raises taxes. “That’s right, Mr. President. “Our economy has shrunk for each of the past two quarters – in fact by any common definition we are now in a recession – and Democrats’ bill raises taxes … by hundreds of billions of dollars. “Here’s what the Democrat leader previously had to say about raising taxes in a recession: ‘If we’re in a recession and we’re in a difficult economic time, I don’t think Sen. Obama or anyone else is going to raise any taxes.  You don’t want to take money out of the economy when the economy is shrinking.’ “President Obama expressed a similar sentiment: ‘[T]he last thing you want to do is to raise taxes in the middle of a recession.’ “‘The last thing.’ “Well, Mr. President, apparently that doesn’t apply when Democrats have Green New Deal projects they want to pay for. “Democrats’ bill attempts to offset the cost of their Green New Deal spending spree by raising taxes on American businesses, particularly manufacturers. “The proposed book minimum tax would be a $313 billion tax hike, with roughly half of the increase falling on American manufacturers. “Mr. President, I don’t think I need to tell anyone the likely outcome of raising taxes on businesses – particularly when the economy is contracting. “The likely outcome is less growth, lower wages, and fewer jobs. “According to an analysis from the National Association of Manufacturers, in 2023 alone the bill would reduce real gross domestic product by more than $68 billion and result in 218,108 fewer workers in the overall economy. “Democrats’ bill also raises taxes on the energy sector – specifically on domestic oil and gas production. “It’s another facepalm move from Democrats. “Currently, gas prices are 75 percent higher than they were when President Biden took office. “Electricity prices are up. “The cost of utility gas service is way up. “And yet Democrats think it’s a good idea to raise taxes on domestic oil and gas production.  “Apparently Democrats want our current high energy prices to stick around for the long term. “So what are Democrats going to use all that tax-hike money for? “Well, for one thing, they’re going to use it to fund Green New Deal projects. “Critical ‘priorities’ like monitoring gaps in tree canopy coverage and road equity and funding the Post Office’s purchase of electric delivery vehicles. “Then there are the multiple slush funds for Green New Deal projects. “And the tax credit for the purchase of a new electric car or truck. “Of course, you’ll only be able to use the credit if you can afford to spend somewhere in the neighborhood of $60,000 – the average price for a new electric vehicle – while we’re in a recession. “So it would almost undoubtedly be mostly Americans with higher salaries – up to $300,000 per household – who would be able to make use of this credit. “But I guess Democrats think electric vehicle tax credits for wealthier Americans are a good use of taxpayer dollars. “What else, Mr. President? “I’ve mentioned the bill’s tax hikes. “But Democrats’ bill also attempts to raise revenue by increasing IRS audits and enforcement. “That’s right. “Democrats’ bill would more than double the current number of IRS employees, making the agency nearly three times larger than U.S. Customs and Border Protection – the agency charged with security at all of our nation’s borders – and more than 50 percent larger than the entire U.S. Department of Agriculture. “Democrats give the IRS a whopping $80 billion in additional funding over 10 years. “Of that $80 billion, 57 percent goes to enforcement and 4 percent goes to taxpayer services. “Four percent. “Mr. President, this is an agency that only succeeded in answering about one out of every 50 taxpayer phone calls during the 2021 tax season. “And yet Democrats are focused not on improving the IRS’ responsiveness to taxpayers, but on boosting the number of IRS audits. “Mr. President, I still haven’t mentioned the bill’s socialist-style price controls for prescription drugs – price controls that would result in fewer new drugs and treatments. “A study from last November found that Democrats’ price-control plans would result in 135 fewer new drugs through 2039. “That’s a lot of potentially life-changing – and lifesaving – treatments to lose. “Then of course there’s Democrats’ plan to expand Obamacare subsidies to higher-earning Americans – a move which would drive up the cost of health insurance. “I could go on.“Mr. President, most Americans remember the lead-up to Democrats’ American Rescue Plan spending spree last March. “We were promised that passing that bill would have big benefits for our economy and American families. “Well, we know what actually happened.  “Democrats’ reckless spending spree helped trigger the worst inflation in four decades. “And American families have suffered as a result.  “Now we’re being asked to swallow a similar story about Democrats’ latest spending legislation. “This bill will help our economy, we’re told – even though we know it would make life harder for American businesses and workers at a time when our economy is already contracting. “It will help inflation, Democrats claim … even though a nonpartisan analysis says it would do nothing to help alleviate our current crisis. “It will reduce our deficit, Democrats say – relying on some very shady accounting measures to reach their supposed deficit reduction number. “It will help lower energy prices, the president claims … even though new energy taxes would further inflate near-term energy bills during a season of historic prices. “Mr. President, you would think Democrats might have been chastened by their disastrous American Rescue Plan spending spree.  “But you’d be wrong. “Apparently Democrats are determined to get in another disastrous spending bill. “And once again the American people will be left to suffer the consequences. “Mr. President, I yield the

April and May successively set records for the highest numbers for any month, ever. During the 2021 fiscal year, CBP encountered a record number of individuals attempting to cross our southern border illegally – 1,734,686, to be precise.In just the first nine months of this fiscal year, we have already exceeded last year’s record number of apprehensions. The situation at our southern border remains out of control, although you’d never know it to hear the president and his administration. The flood of illegal immigration is so great that huge numbers of CBP officers have been pulled off the border to process migrants, further straining enforcement.A May article from the Economist reported that, “Around 60% of CBP agents have been assigned to process migrants, taking them away from field work.” That, of course, leaves our borders wide open to illegal activity, including the drug trafficking that is flooding our country with fentanyl. It also means that even with all the apprehensions the Border Patrol has made, many more individuals are getting through unstopped. It is a security nightmare. This ongoing humanitarian and national security crisis is the result of a president who hasn’t taken responsibility to protect our border and seriously enforce our immigration laws. On his very first day in office, President Biden rescinded the declaration of a national emergency at our southern border. He halted construction of the border wall and revoked a Trump administration order that called for the government to faithfully execute our immigration laws. Then, his Department of Homeland Security issued guidelines pausing deportations, except under certain conditions – again, all on his first day in office. President Biden effectively declared to the world that the United States’ borders were open. The president has also sought to significantly limit the ability of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to enforce immigration laws. Deportations dropped precipitously during fiscal year 2021, as did arrests in the interior of the country. Illegal immigration – especially the kind of out-of-control illegal immigration we’re currently experiencing – has serious consequences. With CBP overstretched, it is easier for bad actors, including gang members, drug traffickers, and human smugglers, who prey on vulnerable migrants, to cross the border into our country. President Biden has talked about wanting to build a “fair, orderly, and humane” immigration system. There is nothing humane about our current situation. Encouraging illegal immigration, as the president’s policies have done, has contributed to a humanitarian crisis that saw at least 557 migrants die attempting to cross the southern border during fiscal year 2021. Just last month, 53 migrants died in an un-air-conditioned tractor-trailer after being smuggled across the border. It was a sobering reminder of the human cost of policies that enable illegal immigration. Open borders also put our communities at risk. Our country is currently in the midst of a fentanyl crisis, with fentanyl overdoses now the leading cause of death for U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 45. Most of it is being trafficked across our southern border, facilitated by this ongoing security crisis. The president may think his border policies are progressive and compassionate, but they are dangerous. The bottom line is that the Biden administration’s policies encourage individuals to undertake the often-dangerous journey from their home countries to our southern border. I will continue to hold the administration accountable for its policies that continue to fuel this dangerous and unsustainable crisis.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/southern-border-crisis-is-a-national-security-nightmare"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed this morning’s report that the United States has experienced two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, which is the traditional definition of a recession. Thune stressed that Democrats’ latest reckless tax-and-spending spree would waste taxpayer dollars, slow economic growth, and do nothing to help families who are facing steep costs due to historically high inflation.   Thune’s remarks below (excerpts): “Yesterday afternoon, Democrats, Senator Manchin, Joe Manchin from West Virginia, and their leadership announced the latest version of their Build Back Better tax-and-spending spree, which they are bizarrely calling the Inflation Reduction Act.”…“So let me just tell you a few of the things that the bill does. It imposes a new tax on job creators. It provides funding to the IRS to harass small businesses and nonprofits. It provides tens of billions of dollars in tax credits for Green New Deal projects and the purchase of costly electric vehicles. And it extends increased government subsidies for people on Obamacare. “Well, Mr. President, I think the question you have to ask is, what exactly is any of that going to do to address inflation? How are more IRS audits going to help Americans wondering how they can continue to afford to pay more than $4 a gallon for gas? How's the new tax on businesses going to drive down the price of chicken or milk or fruits or vegetables? “And as for electric vehicle tax credits, they might make purchasing an electric vehicle slightly less painful. But that is if you can afford to purchase one in the first place, especially in the midst of an inflation crisis.”… “This bill isn’t going to do anything about inflation. It's not going to do anything for economic growth. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this bill's new tax on businesses actually slows down parts of our economy. And it begs the question, Mr. President, about why you would need new taxes when the taxes that are coming into the treasury already are, frankly, at record levels.” … “So the Joint Economic Committee did an analysis recently, which found out that the increase in cost for an average American family year over year, as a result of this level of inflation, is about $9,000. So, that's $9,000 more for the same basket of goods, the same basic necessities, that Americans bought last year.” …“And so you already have this huge tax on American families because of inflation. Now, you couple that with the fact that the economy is slowing down, it's getting a little wobbly, and you would think, you would think just intuitively, that when you have an economy like that, the last thing you would want to do – the very worst prescription for high inflation and slow growth – would be more taxes and more spending.”…“So instead of lowering energy costs by increasing supply, opening up federal lands, approving permits to drill, approving infrastructure projects, encouraging investment in energy production in this country, instead of discouraging it and pressuring companies not to invest in energy production. This has the opposite effect. It's going to tax energy. It's going to put a tax on energy. So you're going to have higher electricity costs, higher fuel costs. I don't get it. I honestly don't get it.”… “But the fact of the matter is that Democrats like to grow and expand government. They like more government. They like more government control. And this [bill] achieves that in a lot of ways. Obviously, it makes people more dependent upon government.” … “Mr. President, I hope my Democrat colleagues will think better of this. I can’t think, honestly, of a time where there hasn’t been a worse prescription for what ails our economy and ails our country than what is being proposed here in the form of more taxes, more spending, more government control, and more pain, economic hardship, for the American people.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/thune-it-is-reckless-to-raise-taxes-in-a-recession"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today released the following statement on the death of al Qaeda terrorist Ayman al-Zawahiri: “Al-Zawahiri was one of the key plotters of the terrorist attacks on 9/11, and he succeeded Osama bin Laden as the leader of al Qaeda for the past 11 years. He shares responsibility for the deaths of thousands of American citizens and has been a top target for the United States for decades,” said Thune. “This successful drone strike is a testament to the vigilance of the men and women who worked to identify and track this priority terrorist target and help deliver swift justice. It should also be a reminder of the global reach of the U.S. Intelligence Community and our entire national security apparatus.“This mission is proof positive that the United States maintains a credible over-the-horizon strike capability that should put all terrorists on alert,” continued Thune. “The fact that al-Zawahiri had comfortably made a home in Kabul, a city which was chaotically abandoned under this administration roughly one year ago despite all the dire warnings against doing so, also shatters any pretense that the Taliban would actually deny al Qaeda or other terrorists a safe haven in Afghanistan. This strike underscores the importance of our efforts to thwart resurgent terrorism around the world in order to keep Americans safe at home and abroad.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/thune-statement-on-the-death-of-al-qaeda-terrorist-ayman-al-zawahiri"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today issued the following statement after the Senate passed the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2022, legislation that includes key Thune-led provisions to bolster South Dakota’s water rights and combat invasive species.  “This legislation provides greater certainty to South Dakota and neighboring states when it comes to water rights, and it provides additional resources for mitigation of invasive species like zebra mussels,” said Thune. “This is an important bill for the Great Plains, and I’m glad I could play a part in it to advocate for South Dakota’s interests.” Key provisions included: Background on efforts to protect state water rights: Since 2010, the Corps has restricted access to the Missouri River reservoirs and has proposed charging an unprecedented fee for so-called surplus water taken from the major reservoirs in the upper basin. When the Corps built the dams along the river after Congress passed the 1944 Flood Control Act, it flooded prime state and tribal land with the agreement that by doing so, residents would have access to water from the Missouri River for various purposes. Although some of those intended purposes such as irrigation never fully materialized, the states never ceded the right to use Missouri River water for municipal and industrial water supplies.After years of work by Thune and the South Dakota delegation, a provision was included in WRDA 2014 prohibiting the Corps from charging surplus water fees in the Upper Missouri River Basin for 10 years.  In 2018 WRDA bill, this prohibition was extended to 12 years and again to 16 years in WRDA 2020. Simultaneously, Senator Thune and the delegation urged the Corps to reverse course on overreaching water supply regulations and guidance. In response, the Corps withdrew its Water Supply Rule in January 2020 and the Real Estate Policy Guidance Letter No.26 in December 2020.  Both actions were important steps toward restoring traditional access to the Missouri River for states like South Dakota without undue interference from the federal government.  Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/key-thune-priorities-for-south-dakota-included-in-water-infrastructure-bill"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed how the Biden administration’s deliberate refusal to secure the southern border is affecting community safety all across the country, including in South Dakota. Thune noted that the high volume of fentanyl being trafficked across the southern border continues to fuel our nation’s opioid crisis, and fentanyl overdoses are currently the leading cause of death for U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 45. Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, the Biden border crisis continues to rage. “Last month, U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered 207,416 individuals attempting to cross our southern border illegally – the highest June number ever recorded. “And April and May successively set records for the highest numbers for any month, ever. “During the 2021 fiscal year, Customs and Border Protection encountered a record number of individuals attempting to cross our southern border illegally.  “1,734,686, to be precise. “Well, Mr. President, we still have three months to go for this fiscal year, but we’ve already exceeded last year’s number … by more than 11,000. “Yes. “In just nine months, we have already exceeded last year’s record number of apprehensions. “The situation at our southern border is out of control. “Although you’d never know it to hear the president and his administration. “‘The border is secure,’ the president’s homeland security secretary said just a few days ago. “‘The border is secure.’ “My only question, Mr. President, is how he said that with a straight face. “Our southern border is the opposite of secure. “It is in crisis. “The flood of illegal immigration is so great that huge numbers of Customs and Border Protection officers have been pulled off the border to process migrants. “A May article from the Economist reported that, quote, ‘Around 60% of CBP agents have been assigned to process migrants, taking them away from field work.’ “That, of course, leaves our borders wide open to illegal activity, including the drug trafficking that is flooding our country with fentanyl. “It also means that even with all the apprehensions the Border Patrol has made, many more individuals are getting through unstopped. “One source reports that so far this fiscal year, there have been more than half a million ‘gotaways’ – individuals the Border Patrol saw but was unable to apprehend. “The Economist article I mentioned also noted, and I quote, ‘One border expert estimates that less than 20% of people trying to cross the border undetected are stopped.’ “Less than 20 percent, Mr. President. “That is a security nightmare. “Our Customs and Border Protection agents are giving this job their all, but there’s no way for them to keep up with the flood of illegal immigration – especially when they’re being pulled off the border to process migrants. “Mr. President, it is President Biden’s job to help stop this border crisis. “But when he’s not pretending this crisis doesn’t exist, he’s taking actions that are contributing to this disaster. “On his very first day in office, President Biden rescinded the declaration of a national emergency at our southern border. “He halted construction of the border wall. “He revoked a Trump administration order that called for the government to faithfully execute our immigration laws. “And his Department of Homeland Security issued guidelines pausing deportations except under certain conditions. “All on his first day in office. “Needless to say, the effect of all this was to declare to the world that the United States’ borders were effectively open. “And even as huge numbers of illegal immigrants pour across our southern border, he has continued to build on those actions. “The president has sought to significantly limit the ability of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to enforce immigration laws. “Deportations dropped precipitously during fiscal year 2021, as did arrests in the interior of the country. “In March of this year, the administration rescinded a 2019 rule expanding expedited removal for individuals here illegally. “And, of course, the administration is still attempting to remove Title 42 COVID-19 restrictions with no viable plan to control the resulting surge in illegal immigration. “Mr. President, illegal immigration – especially the kind of out-of-control illegal immigration we’re currently experiencing – has serious consequences. “I’ve already mentioned some of the security risks it presents. “With Customs and Border Protection overstretched, it is easier for bad actors to cross the border into our country. “Gang members, drug traffickers, human smugglers … the list goes on. “Our country is currently in the midst of a fentanyl crisis. “In fact, right now fentanyl overdose is the leading cause of death for U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 45. “And where is all this fentanyl coming from? “Most of it is being trafficked across our southern border. “And the current border situation is undoubtedly facilitating that trafficking.  “Illegal immigration is financially costly as well. “Immigration and Customs Enforcement is currently running out of money for the year, thanks in part to the out-of-control situation at our southern border. “Mr. President, President Biden has talked about wanting to build a ‘fair, orderly, and humane’ immigration system. “Well, Mr. President, there is nothing humane about our current situation. “Encouraging illegal immigration, as the president’s policies have done, has contributed to a humanitarian crisis that saw at least 557 migrants die attempting to cross the southern border during fiscal year 2021. “Just last month, 53 migrants died in an un-air-conditioned tractor-trailer after being smuggled across the border. “It was a sobering reminder of the human cost of policies that enable illegal immigration. “The president may think his border policies are compassionate. “He is wrong. “Policies that encourage illegal immigration – that encourage individuals to undertake the often-dangerous journey across our southern border, often at the mercy of human smugglers – are the very opposite of compassionate. “Mr. President, I’d like to think that the president would wake up to the dangerous situation we’re in and take action to help stem the flood of illegal immigration at our southern border. “But after a year and a half of his administration’s neglecting this crisis, I’m not getting my hopes up. “I’m afraid that like inflation, out-of-control illegal immigration has become a fact of life in the Biden presidency. “And as with inflation, Americans – and vulnerable individuals attempting to enter our country – will be left to suffer the consequences. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/thune-ongoing-southern-border-crisis-empowers-cartels-fuels-fentanyl-overdoses"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today led several of his Senate Republican colleagues in introducing the Food and Energy Security Act, legislation that would prohibit the Biden administration from forcing its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) agenda onto the American economy. Specifically, the bill would require federal financial and securities regulators to estimate the impact of their rules on affected businesses involved in the agriculture or energy supply chains. If any rules are estimated to drive up food, energy, or gas prices, the regulators would then be prohibited from implementing the rules during times of high inflation.“Hard-working families across South Dakota are paying more for everything right now due to record-high inflation,” said Thune. “Instead of focusing on ways to bring down the cost of gas, food, and electricity, or developing an all-of-the above energy policy, the Biden administration continues to pursue a radical environmental agenda that threatens farmers’ and ranchers’ access to capital, increases production costs, and drives up prices at the pump. This legislation would not only prevent the administration from implementing rules that increase costs, but it would also require the administration to recognize that its actions – and the broader ESG movement – have real-world impacts that compromises our nation’s food and energy security.”“Small businesses across America continue to be concerned about how rulemaking relating to the so-called ‘ESG movement’ could disqualify them from doing business with publicly traded companies,” said Kevin Kuhlman, vice president of federal government relations, National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). “Such rulemaking could have a devastating effect on small businesses in numerous industries, but also the small business economy generally with increased prices for things like fuel and food products. The Food and Energy Security Act is commonsense legislation that requires an analysis of these concerns by federal regulators and prohibits certain rulemaking while inflation remains high. NFIB supports Senator Thune in this important effort.” “American families are suffering from rapid inflation across the country – increases in prices for food, electricity, gasoline and essential goods are at 40-year highs,” said Rich Nolan, president and CEO or the National Mining Association (NMA). “The Food and Energy Security Act works to ensure excessive regulations are not further contributing to this very real problem. The NMA appreciates the work of the Senate sponsors to provide relief for all Americans.”  “Earlier this year, the Biden administration proposed a massive climate disclosure rule that will create new reporting burdens for every farm, ranch, and small business in the country. This plan will harm producers and consumers alike,” said Mary-Thomas Hart, environmental counsel at the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA). “NCBA is proud to support the Food and Energy Security Act because rules like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s emissions disclosure mandate add a costly burden to cattle producers, rural communities, and consumers across the country.”The legislation was co-sponsored by U.S. Sens. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), and Mike Rounds (R-S.D.).Since President Biden was sworn into office, his administration has proposed rules and announced initiatives that would discourage banks, credit unions, and other financial firms from financing the fossil fuel industry and other sectors of the economy disliked by the far-left. In response to these efforts, in April, Thune raised concerns about the Biden administration’s use of the financial regulatory system to advance its radical environmental agenda under the guise of mitigating banks’ and credit unions’ exposure to climate risks.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/thune-introduces-legislation-to-fight-democrats-radical-environmental-agenda-protect-south-dakota-producers"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed how Democrats want to impose a trillion dollars in tax hikes while record-high inflation is hurting small businesses and families in South Dakota. Thune warned that the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending spree would guarantee persistent and widespread inflation.   Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, ‘Our experts believe and the data shows that most of the price increases we’ve seen … [are] expected to be temporary.’ “That’s what President Biden said one year ago this month – something his administration repeatedly echoed.  “Unfortunately, Mr. President, it long ago became clear that that was wishful thinking on the president’s part.  “Far from being temporary, inflation has become a fact of life in the Biden economy. “Last month, inflation hit its highest level yet under President Biden, climbing to 9.1 percent – the worst inflation in more than 40 years. “And the impact of inflation is being felt in every corner of our economy. “Businesses of every size are dealing with the effects of inflation. “And small businesses, of course, are being hit particularly hard. “Seventy-five percent of small business owners report that inflation has had a negative effect on the financial health of their business over the past six months. “And 75 percent report that inflation pressures are getting worse. “It’s not surprising. “Everything from inputs to transportation to electricity has become more expensive in the Biden economy. “And that has a huge impact on businesses’ ability to pay their expenses and run their operations. “As one South Dakota business owner who wrote to me noted, ‘It makes it hard for me to grow my USA-made business when I don’t have the funds to pay my employees more, add more benefits, purchase more machinery, and buy more material in bulk as inflation continues to rise.’ “Farmers and ranchers in my state are also struggling. “As of March, the price of fertilizer had risen an astounding 162 percent since January 2021. “The prices of two common herbicides have risen more than 50 percent since last year. “And the price of diesel, which powers a lot of farming and ranching equipment, has doubled since President Biden took office. “Farming and ranching are tough jobs already, often with tight margins and a lot of weather-related risks, and inflation is making things exponentially harder. “And, Mr. President, the list of inflation’s impacts goes on. “For example, last week I talked about how inflation is affecting our military, which is able to do less with the funds appropriated for it thanks to soaring prices across the economy. “That in turn can affect troop readiness and the military’s ability to keep up with needed programs and purchases, from weapons to vehicles to aircraft and ships. “And of course I haven’t even yet mentioned the most basic impact of inflation – the misery faced by hardworking Americans who confront sky-high prices at the grocery store and the gas pump and wonder how they’re going to feed their family this month or whether they’ll be able to afford to get to work. “Bloomberg reported last week that nearly six in 10 American workers are concerned that their paychecks won’t stretch far enough to support themselves and their families. “And another recent poll reported that 70 percent of Americans have had to cut back on other spending to afford necessities. “Life in the Biden economy is grim. “Mr. President, at this point how we got here is well-established. “One of the main reasons we’re in the midst of this inflation crisis is Democrats’ decision to pass a massive, partisan, $1.9 trillion spending bill last March under the guise of COVID relief – despite the fact that Congress had just passed a fifth bipartisan COVID bill that met essentially all current pressing COVID needs. “Democrats were warned that their bill could cause inflation. “They proceeded anyway. “Their so-called American Rescue Plan flooded the economy with unnecessary government money. “And the economy overheated as a result. “And so here we are, with Americans struggling under the weight of the worst inflation in 40 years, and Democrats … want to double down on the spending strategy that helped get us into this mess in the first place. “That’s right. “Despite the fact that even Democrat economists have stated that the American Rescue Plan helped create our current inflation crisis, Democrats want to pass another massive government spending bill filled with excessive spending and tax hikes.  “A trillion dollars in tax hikes, in recent discussions. “Apparently Democrats are not content with spending us into an inflation crisis; they’d also like to tax us into a recession. “Mr. President, there’s already reason to worry about the negative economic impacts of new climate measures the president is contemplating imposing. “But on top of that, Democrats want to spend even more government money and impose a trillion dollars in tax hikes … a substantial part of which would fall on small businesses. “At this rate, Mr. President, there’s no telling when our inflation crisis will end. “And, Mr. President, Democrats are so committed to big spending that even if their legislation fails this time around, they’re already planning to run on their big spending agenda in November. “I’m not sure I would want to try to convince voters to elect me by touting the same spending strategy that helped land our country in this inflation crisis. “But Democrats’ belief in big spending is so deeply ingrained that it apparently can’t be swayed even when they see the negative consequences. “Mr. President, it is incomprehensible that Democrats are contemplating doubling down on the spending strategy that helped get us into this mess in the first place. “Their first spending spree was a disaster for our country. “I can only imagine how much Americans would suffer from their next one. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/thune-it-s-never-a-good-time-to-raise-taxes"

Still eager to spend more, Democrats then passed a massive $1.9 trillion piece of legislation under the guise of COVID relief that flooded the economy with unnecessary government money, and the economy overheated as a result. Then, despite steadily climbing inflation in the wake of their bill, Democrats seemed incapable of learning from their mistake, and they spent last fall attempting to double down on the failed strategy that helped get us into this mess in the first place. Fortunately, Democrats’ plan for a second spending spree failed last December, but it’s become clear that they’re not giving up. Right now, they’re trying to pass a new version of their tax-and-spending spree where they plan to hike taxes on small businesses. While President Biden was on the campaign trail, he touted, among many things, that he would repeal the tax cuts from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act – the tax relief legislation Republicans passed in 2017 that helped increase wages and incomes, boost economic growth, and drive the poverty rate to a record low. The president falsely claims that the bill solely benefitted high-income earners and corporations when it was actually lower- and middle-income Americans who are the ones who saw some of the biggest benefits from Republicans’ tax relief legislation. The effects of tax reform on business investment, wages for working families, and tax revenue were a boon to the American people and our economy. I wish we had continued down that path of growth and opportunity, but Democrats have decided to take another route. The president claims he ran for office because he was tired of the “trickle-down economy” and that he wants to build an economy “that works for working families.” But as families across the country know, President Biden’s economy is not working for them. Inflation is at its highest level since November 1981 – a staggering 9.1 percent. Everywhere South Dakotans look, they’re facing price increases. I was recently back in my hometown of Murdo for an all-school reunion, and some folks told me that business profits are down by 30 percent or more this year due to high gas prices and soaring inflation. Like many small towns across South Dakota that rely heavily on the tourism industry, record-high inflation has stunted travel and resulted in a significant loss in revenue. It’s abundantly clear that raising taxes would likely lead to a combination of lower wages for workers, lower returns for business owners, and higher prices for goods and services. When you combine that with inflation and more unnecessary government spending, you have a recipe for continued economic misery for American families and communities across the country. If Democrats really wanted to help American families, they’d be focused on making all of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax cuts permanent. I am doing everything in my power to stop the Democrats’ newest version of their reckless tax-and-spending spree. South Dakotans have suffered enough.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/south-dakotans-deserve-permanent-tax-relief-not-new-tax-hikes"

This declaration would greatly assist in recovery efforts from significant weather events occurring June 11, 2022, through June 14, 2022. Much of the western and central South Dakota plains experienced extreme weather during the specified timeframe that involved severe thunderstorms with golf ball to grapefruit size hail and wind gusts of 80 to 95 miles per hour. The last of these storms produced winds over 120 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service. These winds caused extensive damage to homes and businesses, agriculture, and public infrastructure, such as rural electrical cooperative power lines and telephone poles. More than 6,000 residents experienced power outages, many of whom were left without power for several days. Unfortunately, South Dakota was in the midst of recovering from multiple natural disasters when these storms occurred, and, since then, has been battered by more devastating storms. The resilience and resourcefulness of South Dakotans in recent months has been extraordinary, however, as losses mount, the people of our great state hope the federal government will join in their restoration efforts. In light of these considerations, we urge you to approve Governor Noem’s request as soon as possible so that the necessary federal resources are available to assist relevant areas of our state.

John Thune (R-S.D.) today joined the Faulkner Focus on Fox News to discuss the rise of crime around the country, President Biden weighing whether to declare a “climate emergency,” and the administration’s complete lack of a coherent energy policy. On President Biden testing positive for COVID-19: “Let me just, as you all noted earlier, wish the president well. And I think we all hope for a quick and full recovery for him.” On the rise of crime around the country: “The fact of the matter is that the way that we restore, I think, a respect for law enforcement in this country is by having our elected leaders not talking about defunding them, not bad-mouthing them, not denigrating the work that they do.  “And that’s clearly something that’s got to change, because if you continue to see the attacks that are made on law enforcement officials in this country, it’s going to encourage more of that. It’s going to discourage law enforcement officials from staying in their jobs. “And, obviously, when you are allowing sort of crime to run wild and essentially preventing law enforcement officers from doing the job that we want them to do, these are the kinds of results you’re gonna get.” On President Biden weighing whether to declare a “climate emergency”: “Well first off, what he should be declaring is an energy emergency, because that’s what we have in the country. “The president, his policies, have crushed energy development in this country. We need to get our energy producers off the sidelines, back into the game producing American energy, making America energy independent. “And the president’s policies have led us to where now we’re asking other countries to ship the liquid fuels here that we need to power our economy.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/thune-on-fox-news-our-country-has-an-energy-emergency"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today joined Good Morning America 3rd Hour to discuss the historically high inflation rate that is causing economic hardship for American families and how Democrats would make inflation worse if they succeeded in passing new tax hikes and government spending. On inflation under President Biden’s watch and the impact on families: “Well, I think if you look at it, Amy, when President Biden took office the inflation rate was 1.4 percent, well within the Fed’s range of 2 percent. Now, as you said, it's a 40-year high, 9.1 percent last month year over year.  “What that represents, according to the Joint Economic Committee in a study they did recently, is about 700 additional dollars per month per family in this country, or about $9,000 a year in higher costs.” On the causes of high inflation: “I think it comes back to the bill [Democrats] passed, which we tried to discourage them from passing, and even liberal Democrat economists from the Obama administration also suggested this was a really bad idea to flood the zone with a lot of spending, which they did with a $2 trillion bill last year. That overstimulated the economy. You know, the textbook definition of inflation is too many dollars chasing too few of goods. So it started with the spending.  “I think the other issue, honestly, is lack of a coherent energy policy in this country. A lot of what drives inflation is gas prices. And if you look at the price of gas, it's doubled since the president took office. And I think a lot of that has to do with just not having the supply. They shut down a lot of oil and gas production in this country.” On ways to lower inflation: “I think there are things you can do. One, stop the wasteful spending, unnecessary spending. Don't talk about raising taxes. That would be a horrible idea right now, which is on their agenda. And then, come up with a coherent energy policy that emphasizes American energy production so that we're not dependent upon other countries around the world.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/thune-on-gma3-democrats-spending-lack-of-energy-policy-is-driving-high-inflation"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today spoke on the Senate floor about the importance of passing the National Defense Authorization Act in order to authorize funding for critical military priorities, including those at Ellsworth Air Force Base. Thune noted that he is focused on making sure Ellsworth has the resources it needs to address school capacity and housing needs in order to accommodate military families who will move to South Dakota with the arrival of the B-21. Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, one of the most important bills we take up every year is the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA – legislation authorizing funding for our military men and women and the defense of our country. “The Senate Armed Services Committee passed this year’s bipartisan bill a month ago. “And we have less than two months of floor time left in the fiscal year. “Yet Senate Democrats’ focus this month is on a last-ditch effort to pass some version of their Build Back Better tax-and-spending spree in hopes, I have to assume, of eking out a few more votes in November. “And apparently the NDAA will just have to wait. “Mr. President, as it does every year, this year’s NDAA authorizes funding for critical military priorities. “The fiscal year 2023 NDAA continues the modernization efforts begun several years ago in the wake of the 2018 National Defense Strategy Commission report, which warned that our nation’s readiness had eroded to the point where we might struggle to win a war against a major power like Russia or China. “It authorizes funding to improve quality of life for our military members and their families – which is not only something we owe these men and women, who sacrifice so much for us, but is also essential for recruiting and retaining members of our all-volunteer force. “It authorizes funding to enhance our nuclear deterrence – a key priority with continued nuclear threats from traditional powers like Russia and rogue states like Iran and North Korea. “And it continues our strong support for Ukraine. “Mr. President, Ukraine no longer dominates every front page. “But for five months now, Ukraine has been fighting a heroic war against Russian aggression. “And thanks to support from allies in Europe and from our own country, Ukraine is still holding out. “In a war that many experts thought could see Kyiv fall within a matter of days, Ukraine is approaching day 150 of resisting Vladimir Putin’s Soviet-style aggression. “In fact, Ukraine continues to strike painful blows against the Russian military, which has now turned to Iran for military support. “Later today Olena Zelenska, wife of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, will be addressing Congress. “She and her husband have been a beacon for Ukrainians during this brutal war. “And President Zelenskyy’s iron determination, his tireless leadership, and his unflagging commitment to his people have inspired all those who love freedom. “Ukraine is in many ways standing up for the whole free world right now, sending the message that Russia’s unprovoked aggression will not be allowed to stand. “And the least we and other free nations can do is ensure they have the resources they need to carry out their fight. “Mr. President, Russia’s war against Ukraine reminds us that nations that value freedom and security must stand together. “And Finland and Sweden are looking to stand with other free nations by joining the NATO alliance. “Vladimir Putin has turned the historic positions of neutrality in Finland and Sweden into robust public support to join the alliance, and both of these countries will strengthen the capabilities and geostrategic position of NATO. “Yesterday the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations reported the treaty concerning their accession to NATO, and I hope the Senate and administration will soon complete their respective roles and approve Finland and Sweden’s membership. “Mr. President, one priority for me in every National Defense Authorization Act is ensuring that the men and women of Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota have everything they need to successfully carry out their mission. “Right now, my priority is ensuring that Ellsworth remains a responsive and lethal component of Global Strike Command, with the B-1 bomber leveraging the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile and its Long Range Anti-Ship Missile derivative.  “And as we look to the future, I am working to ensure the base continues to receive full funding for the many equipment and support facilities that will be needed for the B-21 Raider mission at Ellsworth. “I worked to ensure full funding for the first of these facilities in last year’s NDAA, including a low-observable coating restoration facility, a wash rack and maintenance hangar, an expanded flight simulator facility, and more. “This year’s NDAA continues that work, with additional funding for the low-observable coating restoration facility, as well as funding for two additional construction projects – a weapons generation facility and a radio frequency facility – that will be needed to ensure Ellsworth is able to fully conduct the nuclear and stealth B-21 mission. “I’ve had the privilege of visiting the B-21 production site in Palmdale, California, and while the program remains heavily classified, I can say that the six planes under production are impressive feats of American engineering, and that we’re honored that South Dakota will be the first state to host the mission. “But it’s not just about the hardware and cutting-edge systems, Mr. President. “Our greatest asset is our people, including the pilots, maintainers, and all the men and women who have answered the call to serve. “That’s why I’m focused on ensuring that our men and women in uniform have not just the military support they need, but the support they need for their families. “More military families will be moving into the Ellsworth area with the arrival of the B-21 mission – as many as 250 people per year, including 100 dependents – and I am committed to ensuring that the infrastructure is in place to provide ample facilities for these families. “To that end, I worked to include in this year’s NDAA an extension of an authority for the secretary of defense to adjust basic allowance for housing rates if an installation is experiencing a sudden increase in the number of servicemembers assigned there. “This will help ensure that families at Ellsworth and elsewhere will have the resources they need to secure appropriate accommodations. “I’m also working to ensure that the Douglas School District is able to integrate and support Air Force members’ children and provide sufficient classroom space. “This NDAA would provide $15 million in Impact Aid for schools experiencing force structure changes like the anticipated growth at Ellsworth with the arrival of the B-21 mission. “I’m grateful to Senator Rounds for his assistance in getting this through the committee’s markup and to our state’s at-large representative, Congressman Johnson, for his work to get it included in the House-passed bill. “This expanded program should be a good first step to help ensure that Douglas School District is able to expand to meet the needs of new Ellsworth families. “Mr. President, the House of Representatives, to its credit, voted on its version of the National Defense Authorization Act the other day. “But unfortunately the House legislation’s total funding authorization is lower than the Senate bill’s number. “That’s a concern, not only because we have a lot of priorities to fund, but because inflation is currently cutting into the military’s spending power. “Inflation affects American families and businesses, but it also has a serious effect on our nation’s security. “As prices soar across the economy, the military is able to do less with the dollars it has. “And that can affect troop readiness and the military’s ability to keep up with needed programs and purchases, from weapons to vehicles to aircraft and ships. “It is essential that the final House and Senate bill include the Senate’s topline funding number. “Mr. President, in his 1793 annual message to Congress, George Washington said, ‘There is a rank due to the United States among nations which will be withheld, if not absolutely lost, by the reputation of weakness.  If we desire to avoid insult, we must be able to repel it; if we desire to secure peace, one of the most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity, it must be known that we are at all times ready for war.’ “In other words, ‘peace through strength.’ “Those words hold true in every age. “The surest method of securing peace is ensuring that we are prepared for war. “As Russia’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine reminds us, there will always be nations who threaten peace and freedom. “And the surest way to prevent these powers from destroying freedom is to ensure that we present a powerful threat of our own – a credible deterrent that stops these nations (and other bad actors) from wanting to tangle with us. “There is no more certain way to invite war than to be unprepared to meet the bullies and dictators of this world. “The National Defense Authorization Act is one of the most essential pieces of legislation we take up each year because it helps ensure that our nation is equipped to defend itself and deter aggression. “I hope the Democratic leadership will consider deferring its tax-and-spending plans to take up this important national security legislation in the near future. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/thune-annual-defense-bill-would-provide-critical-funding-for-ellsworth-air-force-base"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed how the Democrats continue to pursue their reckless tax-and-spending agenda instead of focusing on pro-growth economic policies that would help working families who have experienced a de facto pay cut due to record-high inflation. Thune noted that the economy is teetering on the brink of a recession, and while Democrats want to raise taxes, Republicans want to make permanent the relief created by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, June inflation numbers came out last Wednesday. “And as is typical for the Biden presidency, they weren’t good. “In fact, they were spectacularly bad. “Inflation hit 9.1 percent in June – the worst inflation since November 1981. “The last time inflation was this bad, America was still a year and a half away from finding out whether Han Solo would survive his time in carbonite. “Mr. President, we all know how we got here: “In large part, via a Democrat spending spree. “When Democrats took office in January 2021, Congress had just passed a fifth bipartisan COVID relief bill that met essentially all current pressing COVID needs. “But now that they were in charge, Democrats were eager to get spending. “And so they passed a massive, $1.9 trillion piece of legislation under the guise of COVID relief that flooded the economy with unnecessary government money. “And the economy overheated as a result. “Even worse, despite steadily climbing inflation in the wake of their bill, Democrats seemed incapable of learning from their mistake. “In fact, they spent last fall attempting to double down on the strategy that helped get us into this mess in the first place. “Fortunately, their plans for a second spending spree failed last December. “But it’s become clear that they’re not giving up. “In fact, right now they’re trying to pass a new version.  “In the latest iteration of their tax-and-spending spree, Democrats notably plan to hike taxes on small businesses. “Yes, Mr. President. “On small businesses. “Our country is struggling with soaring inflation, the economy is teetering on the brink of a recession, and Democrats want to raise taxes … on small businesses. “In particular, on small, individually and family-owned businesses, or what are often called pass-through businesses – which make up more than 90 percent of the businesses in this country.                                                                                                                “Mr. President, I guess it shouldn’t be a surprise.“After all, tax and spend is the unofficial Democrat motto. “And Democrats have made their hostility to tax relief very plain. “President Biden ran for president on repealing tax cuts from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ... the tax relief legislation Republicans passed in 2017 that helped increase wages and incomes, boost economic growth, and drive the poverty rate to a record low. “In addition to the natural economic recovery coming out of the pandemic, much of the residual strength in the economy that President Biden likes to tout is a result of the tax relief passed in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.“But that hasn’t stopped President Biden from claiming that the bill just benefitted high-income earners and corporations.  “The only problem with his narrative, of course, is that lower- and middle-income Americans are actually the ones who saw some of the biggest benefits from Republicans’ tax relief legislation. “Wage growth in the wake of Republicans’ legislation was strongest for those in lower income brackets. “From 2017 through the end of 2019, real wealth for the bottom 50 percent increased by an astounding 28.4 percent, compared to 8.9 percent for the top 1 percent. “Meanwhile, government revenue, which Democrats claimed would be hit hard by the Republican tax cuts, last year posted its largest increase in 44 years. “Mr. President, before the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Democrats charged that reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate – from the highest rate in the developed world, 35 percent, to a more globally competitive rate of 21 percent – would strip the government of corporate tax receipts. “But that’s hardly been the case. “Not only did federal corporate tax revenues come in at a record high in fiscal year 2021, corporate tax revenue as a share of the economy rose to its highest level since 2015.  “Total tax receipts are set to increase this year by 19.5 percent, or $800 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, after rising last year by 18 percent.  “The effects of tax reform on business investment, wages, and tax revenue have been a boon to the American people and our economy. “Mr. President, it’s fascinating how Democrats claim to want one thing yet push for policies that will secure the exact opposite. “The president claims he ran for office because he was tired of the ‘trickle-down economy’ and that he wants to build an economy ‘that works for working families.’ “The ironic thing is that the pre-COVID economy President Biden complains about was working for working families, thanks in large part to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other Republican economic policies. “The Biden economy, by contrast, is the very opposite of an economy that works for working families. “Working families in the Biden economy are suffering. “Food prices have risen astronomically, and gas prices are nearly twice as high as they were when President Biden took office. “Real average hourly earnings are currently declining at the fastest pace in 40 years. “And Americans continue to see a de facto pay cut under President Biden.  “Currently, a growing number of Americans are digging into their savings – when they have them – to make ends meet. “Others are relying on things like credit cards or visits to food banks – where demand has soared. “And now Democrats want to make things worse by raising taxes on small businesses and others. “That is likely to lead to a combination of lower wages for workers, lower returns for business owners, and higher prices for goods and services. “Combine that with our soaring inflation and more unnecessary government spending, and you have a recipe for continued economic misery for American families. “Mr. President, if Democrats really wanted to help American families, they’d be focused on making all of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax cuts permanent. “Instead, they’re pursuing tax and spending policies that will make the economic havoc they’ve created even worse. “Let’s hope the newest iteration of their Build Back Better tax-and-spending spree will fail before American families have to suffer the consequences. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink:

John Thune (R-S.D.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) today urged U.S. Department of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai to prioritize lumber tariff relief in order to make home construction and homeownership more affordable for communities across the country. The senators also urged the USTR to resume negotiations with Canada on a softwood lumber agreement in order to provide further relief to U.S. consumers from increased home building and housing costs.   “The sharp increase in softwood lumber prices, on top of high inflation and supply chain challenges, has only further added to residential construction costs,” the senators wrote. “Addressing lumber trade inefficiencies would help reduce unnecessary financial pressures on the U.S. housing market, and we urge the U.S. trade representative to prioritize a new softwood lumber agreement between America and Canada.” Full letter below: The Honorable Gina Raimondo                                         The Honorable Katherine TaiSecretary                                                                             Ambassador U.S. Department of Commerce                                          Office of the U.S. Trade Representative1401 Constitution Avenue, NW                                         600 17th Street, NWWashington, D.C. 20230                                                    Washington, D.C. 20508 Dear Secretary Raimondo and Ambassador Tai: We appreciate the Department of Commerce’s preliminary determination to reduce tariffs on softwood lumber shipments from Canada to the United States, and urge an expeditious final determination and implementation of the tariff reductions. We also encourage the administration to prioritize a new softwood lumber agreement between the United States and Canada to provide greater market stability for the U.S. housing industry and ease the burden of housing costs for all Americans. On January 31, 2022, the Department of Commerce issued a preliminary determination in its third administrative review to reduce tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber into the United States from a rate of 17.9 percent to 11.64 percent. On May 16, President Biden released a Housing Supply Action Plan that referenced the reduction of tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber into the United States. While the preliminary determination and public announcements are welcome steps, we urge the Department of Commerce’s swift implementation of tariff reductions, consistent with the Tariff Act of 1930, in order to make home construction and homeownership more affordable for communities across our country. In addition to tariff relief, American home builders, home buyers, and renters stand to benefit from a new softwood lumber agreement. The 2006 lumber agreement between the United States and Canada expired on October 12, 2015. Since the agreement’s expiration through May 2022, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that softwood lumber prices rose a seasonally adjusted 135 percent. The sharp increase in softwood lumber prices, on top of high inflation and supply chain challenges, has only further added to residential construction costs. Addressing lumber trade inefficiencies would help reduce unnecessary financial pressures on the U.S. housing market, and we urge the U.S. trade representative to prioritize a new softwood lumber agreement between America and Canada. We commend your efforts, consistent with your respective remits, to provide greater stability and affordability for the U.S. housing community. An expeditious reduction of tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber into the United States and a new softwood lumber agreement between the two countries would mark significant progress toward achieving these goals.Sincerely,Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/thune-menendez-urge-administration-to-prioritize-lumber-trade-to-improve-housing-costs"
http://www.thune.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/op-eds?ContentRecord_id=2B2C3A5E-3499-4CB3-AB7F-59A31F1AFEF9,"Inflation is at its highest level since November 1981 – a staggering 9.1 percent. The last time it was this high, Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark had recently been released. Everywhere South Dakotans look, they’re facing price increases. On average, inflation is costing the average household $718 per month, or more than $8,600 over the next year. That is an unsustainable financial burden for families and small businesses. And on top of all this, real average hourly earnings are currently declining at the fastest pace in 40 years.A growing number of Americans are digging into their savings to make ends meet, and others are relying on things like credit cards or visits to food banks. Yet, even as inflation continues to climb and affect families and businesses across the state, Washington Democrats are preparing to double down on the same kind of irresponsible government expansion they’ve already committed to with a partisan, multi-trillion-dollar tax-and-spending bill.At its most basic level, inflation is created when there are too many dollars chasing too few of goods in the economy. Democrats helped trigger this ongoing inflation problem last year when they decided to pour trillions of unnecessary government dollars into the economy – despite being warned by me and many others that their partisan $1.9 trillion spending bill would stoke inflation. At this point, after months of record-high prices, the logical solution would be to stop all of this wasteful spending. Unfortunately, Democrats still believe that flooding the economy with more government dollars will help fix the inflation crisis. Newsflash: It will only make things worse.Like a zombie, the Democrats’ Build Back Better tax-and-spending spree just keeps coming back from the dead. Democrats are planning to raise taxes by a trillion dollars. A substantial part of that tax increase would come in the form of new taxes on small businesses – individually and family-owned businesses, or what are often called pass-through businesses. In South Dakota, pass-throughs, such as sole proprietorships, S corporations, and partnerships, employ an estimated 68 percent of the private sector. Nationwide, more than 90 percent of American businesses are pass-throughs, and these businesses employ tens of millions of Americans. Right now, business owners are struggling with the high cost of everything from inputs to electricity. I recently read a comment from one small business owner in South Dakota, who noted that “it’s hard when you’re working so hard but you’re not making money. […] we are right there right now.” If Democrats have their way, life for small business owners – and their employees – is going to get even harder. Raising taxes on businesses would lead to a combination of lower wages for workers, lower returns for business owners, and higher prices for goods and services. It would also make it more challenging for small business owners to reinvest in and grow their businesses.The Democrats’ proposed tax hikes and the resulting economic impacts are not going to be limited to small businesses, nor are they going to be limited to families bringing home more than $400,000 – despite the fact that the president has repeatedly pledged not to raise taxes on families making less than that. A recent analysis by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation showed that lower- and middle-income taxpayers will face significant hits from the Democrats’ proposed tax hikes, and more than half of taxpayers earning between $100,000 and $200,000 would see a tax hike next year, as well as a quarter of taxpayers making between $75,000 and $100,000.Raising taxes on small businesses, including pass-throughs in South Dakota and across the country, is a reckless approach to the economy. I am at a loss to understand any legitimate reason why Democrats would be contemplating increasing the tax burden on small businesses and middle-income Americans during an inflation crisis. American families are already suffering, and they should not have to deal with the economic consequences of yet another ill-advised piece of Democrat legislation. I will continue to fight on behalf of South Dakota families and small businesses to stop this irresponsible and partisan tax-and-spending spree from becoming law.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/democrats-prescription-for-record-high-inflation-spend-more-and-raise-taxes"

Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), and Jon Tester (D-Mont.).Full letter below: The Honorable Tom VilsackSecretaryU.S. Department of Agriculture1400 Independence Avenue, SWWashington, DC 20250 Dear Secretary Vilsack: The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) work in implementing the Emergency Relief Program (ERP) to help farmers and ranchers who suffered disaster-related losses in 2020 and 2021 has been meaningful to producers around the country.  We appreciate your efforts to streamline the process by allowing the Farm Service Agency (FSA) to use data already on record with the Risk Management Agency (RMA), which has been helpful in expediting the process.  We write to bring to your attention issues that have come up with ERP implementation and to request that USDA address these issues expeditiously. The first issue concerns many producers who, because their cause of loss was attributed to a 2019 event, have Prevented Plant indemnities that were not captured under ERP to receive the top up payments even though farmers suffering losses from the same cause of loss were made eligible because the loss was attributed to a 2020 event.  Importantly, this was not an intentional misreporting on the part of loss adjusters.  Rather, this was a situation where there was no uniform guidance on how to attribute losses that may have occurred over an extended period of time or have resulted from a number of events.  It is important that these eligible losses be properly captured in USDA’s second generation of Phase I ERP application letters.   The second issue concerns how certain producers’ adjusted gross income is calculated in order to be eligible for the higher payment limitation under the program.  Generally, under the law, producers who derive 75 percent or more of their adjusted gross income from farming are eligible for the higher limitation.  However, we understand that there are some problems with the implementation of this rule.  Farm equipment sales should be considered a part of farm adjusted gross income in order to meet the 75 percent rule, which they are not currently without also meeting a whole other set of requirements.  We understand an update in the FSA handbook could clarify matters to ensure this is remedied, and we would urge you to make this update.  Additionally, producers who earn 75 percent or more of their income from farming but experienced an overall adjusted gross income loss are meant to be covered by the 75 percent test using reflective metrics, such as gross receipts, to ensure these producers receive the increased payment limitation as well. Finally, we have heard producers who purchased supplemental crop insurance coverage, such as Supplemental Coverage Option, must wait to receive ERP assistance until the fall, while many producers who did not purchase supplemental coverage may have already received their ERP assistance.  We urge you to consider expediting ERP assistance to these producers who purchased supplemental coverage in order to not disincentive their decision to purchase higher levels of coverage, which should be encouraged.  Thank you once again for all of your work in delivering ERP to our farmers and ranchers and for your consideration of our requests. Sincerely, Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/thune-klobuchar-call-on-usda-to-improve-disaster-assistance-for-producers"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed how the Democrats’ radical energy agenda has helped create record-high inflation and soaring fuel prices. Thune argued that Congress and the administration should instead pursue a pro-growth agenda that reduces the United States’ reliance on foreign countries for oil, cuts costs for hardworking families, and helps restore America’s energy independence. Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, yesterday morning June inflation numbers were released. “And as usual with this administration, the news was not good. “Inflation rose once again in June, to 9.1 percent – the highest inflation since November 1981. “November 1981. “I was in college the last time inflation was this bad. “Mr. President, Americans are suffering. “Everywhere Americans turn, they’re being asked to pay more. “More for cleaning supplies. “More for gas. “More for health insurance. “More for groceries. “A new analysis yesterday from the Joint Economic Committee found that inflation will cost the average American household a staggering $718 a month over the next year. “$718.  A month. “And, Mr. President, that will happen even if prices stop going up tomorrow. “$718.  Per month. “More than $8,600 for the year. “No working family can afford that. “Mr. President, a major reason that we’re in this crisis is because of Democrats’ decision to flood the economy with unnecessary government money with their so-called American Rescue Plan Act.   “And unfortunately, there is no easy solution to the crisis they helped create. “But the first thing – the first thing – should be to do no more harm. “Incredibly, however, Democrats are currently attempting to double down on the strategy that helped create this crisis in the first place by passing a version of the Build Back Better tax-and-spending spree they tried to force through last year. “Apparently Democrats think more government spending – like the government spending that helped get us into this mess – plus new taxes are a good solution for an inflation crisis and an economy teetering on the brink of recession. “Mr. President, if Democrats want to help our country get out of this inflation crisis, more unnecessary government spending and new taxes are the exact wrong way to go about it. “In fact, the biggest thing Democrats can do is to avoid making this crisis worse by flooding the economy with more unnecessary government money. “And after that, the biggest thing Democrats – and the administration in particular – can do to help alleviate this crisis is to unleash American energy production. “I don’t need to tell anyone that energy prices have been a major contributor to our inflation crisis. “Gas prices are up nearly 60 percent. “60 percent. “The current cost of a gallon of regular gas is $4.60 – almost double what it was when President Biden took office just 18 months ago. “And the price of diesel is even worse – which is a big concern for farmers and ranchers back home in South Dakota and around the country.  “Not to mention all of our truckers. “Electricity is up 13 percent. “Utility gas service is up 38 percent. “Americans are feeling the pinch. “And of course high gas prices – and utility prices – don’t just cause direct pain at the pump, they also contribute to higher prices across our economy. “Which means that lowering energy prices is one of the most important things we can do to help ease high prices on a variety of goods. “And the way to lower energy prices is to unleash American energy production – including (and especially) conventional energy production. “Unfortunately, the president has shown – and continues to show – a clear hostility to conventional energy production, despite the fact that our economy cannot function without conventional energy. “I’m a longtime supporter of alternative energy – from wind to biofuels – and I come from a state that derives a substantial portion of its electricity generation from wind. “In fact, in 2021, over 50 percent of our state’s power generation came from wind, and 30 percent came from hydroelectric on the Missouri River. “But if it weren’t for traditional fossil fuels backing up that generation, we’d be left in the dark. “The fact of the matter is, no matter how much Democrats might wish it were otherwise, alternative energy technology has simply not advanced to the point where our country can rely exclusively on alternative energy.  “And that means that unless we want Americans to be permanently buried under the pain of high gas prices, we need to invest in responsible production of oil and natural gas. “We have tremendous natural resources here at home, and the ability to extract those resources in a far more environmentally responsible way than frequently happens in other countries. “But unleashing American production is going to require action from the president – who despite the current energy price crisis continues to display hostility to domestic production. “He touts the number of leases oil and gas companies have available, but he fails to mention that just three months ago his administration made it harder for oil and gas companies to actually make use of the leases in question by increasing the regulatory burden for environmental reviews.  “On top of this, thousands of drilling permits – which are required to actually begin drilling on oil and gas leases – are currently stuck in the approval process at the Department of the Interior. “And at the beginning of this month, the administration released a new offshore drilling plan, which includes an option to offer, at most, a paltry 11 new leases over the next five years. “It also leaves the door open for zero new leases.  “Zero. “If this proposed five-year plan doesn’t make it clear that the president isn’t interested in increasing our domestic energy production, I don’t know what does. “I could go on, Mr. President. “I could mention the administration’s proposed SEC climate-disclosure rules that are designed to discourage investment in conventional energy. “Or the president’s quest to increase taxes on domestic oil and gas production. “Or Democrats’ efforts to impose a new fee – or tax – on methane that could cost consumers an additional $35 billion to $69 billion annually. “But I’ll leave it there. “But, Mr. President, I hope, I really hope, that the president and his administration will take a good, hard look at their hostility to conventional energy production. “Inflation is at 9.1 percent.  “9.1 percent. “American families are paying nearly twice what they were paying in gas prices just 18 months ago. “And utility gas prices have increased sharply.  “Unless Democrats want Americans to be facing staggering prices at the pump and on store shelves for the long term, then the administration needs to start encouraging domestic production of conventional energy. “That means not just approving leases, but making it easier for oil and gas companies to actually develop those leases and produce oil and natural gas. “It means encouraging, not discouraging, investment in responsible conventional production and infrastructure like natural gas pipelines. “And it means giving up attempts to discourage domestic energy production with new and higher taxes or burdensome ESG regulations. “American families are struggling, Mr. President. “And the president can actually do something to help them. “I hope he will. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/thune-to-democrats-stop-standing-in-the-way-of-american-energy-production"

John Thune (R-S.D.), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, today joined several of his Republican colleagues in introducing legislation to recover funds from unchecked unemployment fraud and provide incentives for states to recover fraudulent payments. The bill would jumpstart efforts to claw back federal funds and pursue recovery of fraudulent payments by ensuring aggressive identification, investigation, and prosecution of criminal fraud in pandemic unemployment programs.“South Dakotans expect that their hard-earned tax dollars are being spent wisely,” said Thune. “Unfortunately, billions of dollars of fraudulent payments have been made through pandemic-related unemployment insurance programs since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This commonsense legislation would incentivize states to recover these stolen taxpayer dollars and help ensure these fraudsters are held accountable.”The legislation was led by U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee and Rob Portman (R-Ohio), ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. It was co-sponsored by U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.).Last year, Thune introduced the Recovering Fraudulent Claims Act, legislation that would establish the COVID-19 Unemployment Insurance Fraud Task Force to investigate alleged instances of fraud in the COVID-19 unemployment insurance programs that have since expired. The bill would also require the task force to report back to Congress on its findings and provide insight into the amount of fraudulent unemployment insurance payments that have been recovered since the establishment of these programs and the number of individuals who have been prosecuted since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.   The White House estimated that 19 percent of total COVID-19 unemployment insurance payments were lost to fraud, which amounts to roughly $80 billion on the low end. By contrast, the U.S. Department of Labor’s estimate puts that number much higher. In May 2022, the Washington Post reported that an estimated $163 billion was siphoned away by fraudsters and that if the government’s best estimate is accurate, only 2.4 percent of wrongful payments have been recovered.  Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/thune-republican-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-recover-funds-from-pandemic-related-unemployment-fraud"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today warned that the cost of the Democrats’ trillion-dollar reckless tax-and-spending spree would ultimately fall on the backs of small businesses and hardworking families in South Dakota and around the country. Thune noted that Democrats remain unfazed by the impacts of their radical spending proposals and job-killing tax hikes, even as inflation reached 9.1 percent in June – its highest rate in nearly 41 years. Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, inflation numbers came out this morning, and once again they were not good. “Inflation in June was 9.1 percent – 9.1 percent – the highest level since November of 1981. “Groceries are up 12 percent on average. “Baby food is up 14 percent. “Milk is up 16 percent. “Chicken is up 18 percent. “And the list goes on. “Household cleaning products are up 11 percent. “Gas prices are up nearly 60 percent. “Furniture and bedding are up 13 percent. “Utility gas service is up 38 percent. “Health insurance is up 17 percent. “And on and on and on. “Everywhere Americans look, they’re facing price increases. “Price increases on the most essential items.  “Groceries. “Gas. “Their utility bills. “And on top of all this, real average hourly earnings are currently declining at the fastest pace in 40 years. “58 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. “And a growing number of Americans are digging into their savings – when they have them – to make ends meet. “Others are relying on things like credit cards or visits to food banks. “Demand for food assistance has soared in recent months. “One organization in my hometown of Sioux Falls received 600 more calls for food assistance in May of this year than it had received in the same month a year ago. “And food banks often have fewer resources to meet the need, thanks to declines in donations and the high price of groceries. “And, Mr. President, there is no end to this pain in sight. “A recent Joint Economic Committee analysis found that inflation will cost the average household $7,620 over the next year, or $635 per month. “$635. “Per month. “That is an unsustainable burden for working families. “Mr. President, by now most Americans are familiar with how we got here. “When President Biden took office, inflation was at 1.4 percent – well within the Fed’s target inflation rate of 2 percent. “And it might have stayed there had Democrats not decided to pass a massive, partisan, $1.9 trillion spending spree under the guise of COVID relief – mere weeks after Congress had passed a fifth bipartisan COVID bill that met essentially all current pressing COVID needs. “Democrats’ so-called American Rescue Plan sent a lot of unnecessary government money into the economy. “And the economy overheated as a result. “And you don’t have to take my word for it on the damaging effects of this legislation. “Here’s what one Democrat economist who worked in the Obama administration had to say on the subject: “The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan passed in the early days of the Biden administration will go down in history as an extraordinary policy mistake.” “Or as another former Obama adviser noted, and I quote, “The original sin was an oversized American Rescue Plan.  It contributed to both higher output but also higher prices.” “Mr. President, Democrats were warned that their so-called American Rescue Plan ran the risk of overheating the economy. “They passed it anyway. “But what’s almost worse is that even after they saw the inflation that resulted from their $1.9 trillion boondoggle, they spent months last year trying to double down on the reckless spending that helped cause so much inflation in the first place. “Even as inflation steadily increased, Democrats spent months working to pass their so-called Build Back Better bill – a multi-trillion dollar reckless tax-and-spending spree that would have dumped more unnecessary government money into an already overheated economy. “Fortunately their efforts ultimately failed last December. “But like a zombie, Democrats’ Build Back Better tax-and-spending spree just keeps coming back from the dead.  “Yes, you heard that right. “Despite the fact that our inflation crisis is even worse than it was last fall, Democrats are once again considering a version of their Build Back Better tax-and-spending spree. “We don’t know all the details yet. “But what we do know is cause for alarm. “Democrats are planning to raise taxes by a trillion dollars.  “$1 trillion. “And a substantial part of that tax increase would come in the form of new taxes on small businesses. “Yes. “On small, individually and family-owned businesses, or what are often called pass-through businesses. “In other words, Mr. President, Main Street America. “In South Dakota, pass-throughs, such as sole proprietorships, S corporations, and partnerships, employ an estimated 68 percent of the private sector.               “Nationwide, more than 90% of American businesses are pass-throughs.  “And these businesses employ tens of millions of Americans.  “Mr. President, small business owners’ expectations for better business conditions recently hit an all-time low. “Business owners are struggling with the high cost of everything from inputs to electricity, as inflation continues to soar and global supply chains continue to be sluggish. “I recently read a comment from one small business owner in South Dakota, who noted, and I quote, ‘It’s hard when you’re working so hard but you’re not making money. … we are right there right now.’ “‘It’s hard when you’re working so hard but you’re not making money.’ “Yes, it is, Mr. President. “And if Democrats have their way, life for small business owners – and their employees – is going to get even harder. “Raising taxes on businesses will lead to a combination of lower wages for workers, lower returns for business owners, and higher prices for goods and services. “It will also make it more challenging for small business owners to reinvest in and grow their businesses. “Mr. President, as I said, altogether, Democrats are contemplating raising taxes by $1 trillion in their new Build Back Better tax-and-spending spree. “And those tax hikes and their economic impacts are not going to be limited to small businesses. “Nor are they going to be limited to families bringing home more than $400,000 – despite the fact that the president has repeatedly pledged not to raise taxes on families making less than that. “The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation studied the tax-and-spend provisions Democrats are discussing.  “Its analysis shows that lower- and middle-income taxpayers will face significant hits from the proposed tax hikes. “The JCT analysis found that more than half of Americans earning between $100,000 and $200,000 would see a tax hike next year, as well as a quarter of Americans making in between $75,000 and $100,000. “Raising taxes on small businesses, including pass-throughs in South Dakota and across the country, is a reckless approach to the economy. “But apparently Democrats are not content with merely a high probability of recession. “They want to guarantee that we get there.  “I am at a loss to understand any other reason why they would be contemplating increasing the tax burden on small businesses and middle-class Americans during an inflation crisis. “Mr. President, Democrats tried their hardest last fall to double down on the spending strategy that helped plunge us into this inflation crisis in the first place. “Mercifully, they failed.  “Let’s hope that common sense will once again prevail and that Democrats’ latest reckless tax-and-spending proposal will come to nothing. “American families are already suffering. “They should not have to deal with the economic consequences of yet another ill-advised piece of Democrat legislation.  “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink:

John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to return the question of abortion to the states and the people and their elected representatives. Thune applauded the pro-life movement for its decades-long commitment to defending the unborn and criticized Democrats for using scare tactics and misinformation to create a false narrative that pro-life laws will prevent women from getting essential medical care for miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies. Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, on June 24, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, returning the question of abortion to the states and to the people and their elected representatives. “The Supreme Court’s decision was an affirmation of democracy, which had been set aside by Roe in favor of a national abortion regime imposed upon the entire country by a handful of activist judges. “Roe took legislative power out of the hands of the people and put it in the hands of unelected judges – on nonexistent constitutional grounds.    “The Supreme Court’s decision puts the question of abortion back in the hands of the states and the people and their elected representatives – where it should always have been. “And I am profoundly grateful for this decision – most especially because of what is at stake here. “Because the Roe decision was not a failure of constitutional jurisprudence on some arcane point. “It was a failure that infringed on our most fundamental rights as human beings – in fact, on the fundamental right, the right to life. “Roe not only allowed for but imposed a regime that forced states to legalize the killing of unborn human beings.      “And so the decision to overturn Roe not only affirms democracy and repairs a constitutional wrong, it allows for the righting of a profound moral wrong – the legal killing of unborn Americans. “The Supreme Court’s decision does not of course make abortion illegal. “But it will – finally – allow those states that choose to to put in place protections for unborn children. “Mr. President, since Roe v. Wade legalized abortion through all nine months of pregnancy, more than 63 million children have been killed in this country by abortion. “63 million. “That is an unfathomable – and heartbreaking – number. “To put it in some kind of perspective, that’s more than twice the population of the state of Texas, and more than 70 times the population of my home state of South Dakota. “63 million. “63 million unique, unrepeatable human beings. “Future doctors and nurses and farmers and teachers and bus drivers and plumbers and scientists. “That is a lot of innocent lives lost, Mr. President. “And yes, Mr. President, when we talk about unborn babies we are talking about human lives.  “Members of the pro-abortion left would like to obscure this fact. “But science and medical technology and plain old common sense all clearly demonstrate the humanity of the unborn child. “Every mom who has ever felt her unborn baby kick is well aware that she isn’t just carrying around a clump of cells. “And ultrasound technology and medical advancements have made the humanity of the unborn child even more undeniable. “It is impossible to hear the heartbeat of an unborn child at six weeks and say that he or she is not alive. “It is impossible to look at an unborn baby on an ultrasound, kicking her feet and moving her hands and sucking her thumb, and pretend that she is anything but a human being. “And human beings, Mr. President, deserve to be protected. “Mr. President, Democrats’ response to the Dobbs decision has been predictably hysterical. “We’ve heard cries to pack the Supreme Court – because apparently the only legitimate Supreme Court is a Supreme Court that rules in line with Democrats’ policy preferences. “We’ve heard cries to abolish the filibuster and eliminate protections for the minority party in the Senate – and the Americans it represents.“We’ve heard a proposal to establish abortion facilities in national parks.  “I’m struggling to think of any family who wants an abortion facility to be part of the itinerary offered on their trip to Yellowstone or the Badlands. “But apparently some Democrats think our national parks should become abortion factories. “Then, of course, there’s the flood of misinformation out there falsely suggesting that pro-life laws will prevent women from getting essential medical care for miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies. “And on top of all this, multiple Democrats have started a crusade against pregnancy resource centers. “That’s right. “Pregnancy resource centers – which were established to provide moms in need with things like diapers and baby clothes, prenatal and parenting classes, help connecting with state and local resources, emotional support, and agency referrals for moms who want to choose adoption – are now under attack by members of the Democrat Party. “Apparently the ‘pro-choice’ party can’t stand the idea that women might be offered a choice other than abortion. “Mr. President, when the Dobbs decision was handed down, the president called it a sad day for our country.“A sad day. “To the president and his party, apparently it is a sad day when the door is opened to greater protection for human life and human rights. “I would say that it is a sad day when the right to kill unborn human beings has become the signature issue of the Democrat Party.  “When the party that portrays itself as the defender of the little guy has become the party that wants to deny even the smallest protections to the littlest guys and girls among us. “Mr. President, Democrats’ vision of America is not my vision of America. “I believe that America is big enough to take care of both moms and their babies. “We don’t have to pit moms and babies against each other.  “We can take care of them both. “It’s something the pro-life movement has been focused on for years – and something that a number of states have worked to do with their Alternatives to Abortion programs. “And I know that commitment will only grow in the wake of the Dobbs decision. “Mr. President, those who seek to deny human rights to some human beings are never found to be on the right side of history – as our nation knows, to its sorrow. “Our country was founded to protect human rights – the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. “But for almost 50 years now, our country has failed to protect the human rights of unborn human beings. “Today, thanks to the Dobbs decision, we have a chance to change that. “We have a chance to build a society where the life of every American is valued, and where being small and vulnerable does not mean that your human rights are any less respected. “At our best, we are a country that defends human rights, not denies them. “We stand up for the innocent.  We protect them.  We fight for them.  “It’s time to live up to that. “Mr. President, the Dobbs decision gives us a chance to protect the human rights of the smallest and most innocent humans among us.  “But the Dobbs decision would never have happened without the tireless work of so many since the day Roe v. Wade was decided. “It would never have happened without those who prayed, who offered help to moms in need, who fought for the rights of unborn Americans in elections and courts and state legislatures. “‘Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves,’ it says in the book of Proverbs. “And for 50 years, that’s what members of the pro-life movement have done. “And it is their work that has brought us to this day, when we finally once again have a chance to protect innocent unborn Americans in law. “‘May the Lord reward their work, and their wages be full from the Lord.’ “Mr. President, I know that sometimes it seemed like the day when Roe v. Wade would be overturned would never come. “But it is here. “And while there is still much work to be done to ensure that the human rights of unborn Americans are respected and that moms and their babies have the support they need, it is nevertheless a moment for joy and for gratitude. “And I am profoundly grateful for this decision.  Profoundly grateful that we now have the opportunity to move closer to the day when we fully live up to our founding principles and ensure that every American, born or unborn, has the opportunity for life, for liberty, and for the pursuit of happiness. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/thune-a-victory-for-life"

John Thune (R-S.D.) and Jim Risch (R-Idaho), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today released the following statement ahead of the one-year anniversary of the ignored July 13, 2021, State Department dissent cable that warned of the Taliban’s ability to quickly retake territory and potentially seize Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. “This is a dark anniversary for our nation and for Afghanistan. One year ago, a State Department dissent cable reportedly warned the Biden administration of the rapidly deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan, including the growing vulnerability that Kabul could quickly fall to the Taliban,” said Thune and Risch. “While the tragic evacuation, which tarnished America’s credibility with our partners and allies, has faded from front-page headlines, we are committed to holding the Biden administration accountable for its failure of duty that allowed for a quick Taliban takeover of Afghanistan and a botched withdrawal that left hundreds of Americans and tens of thousands of Afghan partners behind.” In February, Thune and Risch introduced legislation that would require the State Department to provide Congress with a classified version of the dissent cable, removing any personally identifiable information of the senders. The bill would also require the State Department to release a public, unclassified version of the cable. The July 13, 2021 internal dissent cable reportedly warned the Biden administration of the mounting deterioration of Afghanistan’s security and the need to immediately begin evacuations. Regrettably, it was apparently met with inaction, evidenced by the National Security Council Deputies Committee’s decision to delay its first meeting to discuss evacuating Afghanistan until a full month after the dissent cable was sent. The flagrant shortcomings of the Biden administration’s management of the United States’ exit from Afghanistan are further detailed in Ranking Member Risch’s report entitled “Left Behind: A Brief Assessment of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Failures during the Afghanistan Evacuation” and investigations conducted by U.S. Central Command. According to the State Department, the dissent channel “is a serious policy channel reserved only for consideration of responsible dissenting and alternative views on substantive foreign policy issues that cannot be communicated in a full and timely manner through regular operating channels or procedures,” which underscores the urgent nature of the warnings sent by U.S. diplomats.

It’s an opportunity for communities to come together for picnics and parades. It’s a time for friends and families to gather and create new memories. And while we celebrate all of the blessings and opportunities we have as Americans at parades, barbeques, and fireworks shows, we must not overlook the true meaning of the holiday – we should honor our freedoms that have been paid for by the sacrifices of so many Americans past and present.On Independence Day, I’m reminded of our Founding Fathers who put together the greatest statement of self-government the world has ever seen: the Declaration of Independence. They proclaimed that “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.”America is the greatest country the world has ever known, not only because of what we have achieved, but because we’re humble enough to know that we always have room to listen, learn, and grow as we continually strive to live up to the founding principles of the Declaration of Independence. The rights that the founders described in that document aren’t determined by one’s social status, where an individual is born or raised, or even any standard set by government itself. That’s what makes them so unique. They’re granted to us by God. They are unalienable. And the governments born from these free people are created and maintained with their consent. That’s pretty remarkable when you think about it.As we celebrate the stars and stripes, we also honor those who served and continue to serve our great nation, paying tribute to them by upholding the values for which they continue to fight. I think about my father, Harold, a fighter pilot who flew Hellcats off of the U.S.S. Intrepid in the Pacific theater during World War II. Through him, I learned about the Greatest Generation – their humility, their quiet service, and their dedication to the cause of freedom. The stories my dad would tell us about the men he served with will stay with me forever – these men were driven by an unwavering love for our country, full of pride and patriotism. The world had never met, nor will it meet again, a group of individuals so dedicated to the pursuit of freedom and democracy around the world. Our nation continues to have the blessings of liberty and freedom our forefathers sought for future generations of Americans. The Founding Fathers dedicated their lives to creating our great nation, and the brave men and women who have answered the call to serve continue that fight today. We are forever grateful for their bravery in defending freedom, liberty, and the American dream.    Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/proud-to-be-an-american"

Agriculture is the lifeblood of the South Dakota economy, and I am committed to doing everything I can to ensure that our farmers and ranchers have the resources they need to help feed our country. I’m fortunate to be a longtime member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, which gives me an important platform from which to address the needs of South Dakota ag producers.Right now, a big focus of mine is the 2023 farm bill. I’ve already begun to hold a series of roundtables to hear from South Dakota farmers and ranchers about what they need from the 2023 bill, and I plan to continue introducing proposals that I hope to get included in it.My Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) Improvement Act, which I introduced in March, would make CRP grazing a more attractive option by providing cost-share payments for all CRP practices for the establishment of grazing infrastructure, including fencing and water distribution. It would also increase the annual payment limit for CRP, which has not changed since 1985, to help account for inflation and the increase in land value.I’m also working with colleagues from other agriculture states on legislation based on my conversations with South Dakota farmers and ranchers. I introduced the Agriculture Innovation Act with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). Currently the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) collects reams of data on conservation practices. The problem is that a lot of this data is often not analyzed and presented in a way that would be useful for producers.The legislation Sen. Klobuchar and I have introduced would provide for better processing and development of the data USDA collects so farmers and ranchers can evaluate the impact of conservation and other production practices on things like soil health, crop yields, and profitability. Our bill would make it easier for producers to decide what conservation practices to adopt by, among other things, helping identify the ways conservation practices can improve their bottom line.  In addition to farm bill priorities, I’ve been spending a lot of time focused on trade, which has played a large part in America’s economic success for decades. Strong trade policy is critical for American ag producers, who depend on exporting their products around the globe. It is unacceptable that the Biden administration has dropped the ball on pursuing increased market access for American producers.I recently led a letter with 23 of my Senate Republican colleagues to the U.S. trade representative and the secretary of agriculture urging them to prioritize increased access to foreign markets for American producers, including – and especially – American ag producers. Unfortunately, the administration has not made market access commitments a priority in its trade agenda, and the administration has failed to pursue any ambitious market-opening initiatives or comprehensive trade agreements.Another issue I’m committed to addressing is America’s beef labeling system. As South Dakotans know, cattle producers in our state produce some of the highest quality beef in the world. But the current labeling system for beef is unfair to American cattle producers and misleading for consumers. As I have said before, when you see a ‘product of the USA’ label on the grocery store shelf, it should mean just that. That is why I introduced bipartisan legislation with Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) to require clear and accurate labeling for beef, and I will continue to stand up for mandatory country of origin labeling and South Dakota cattle producers. Our nation depends on our farmers and ranchers, and I am profoundly grateful for all of the determined men and women who have chosen this way of life and are committed to helping pass it on to future generations. I am honored to represent South Dakota’s farmers and ranchers in the Senate, and I will continue to do everything I can to ensure that they have all the resources they need to continue to feed our nation and the world.  Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/supporting-south-dakota-agriculture"
http://www.thune.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/op-eds?ContentRecord_id=0E367089-4F70-4F67-9211-4D6040F28C7F,"Fox NewsToday’s debates around Big Tech giants like Facebook, Twitter, or Google, among others, typically center around the ability that these platforms have to shape social media and determine the content that people see or don’t see. Little is known by consumers, or even Congress, about the secretive algorithms used by these platforms and the intentional or unintentional political biases at play, which is why I’ve long argued that these manipulative practices are worthy of congressional oversight and action. Big Tech, much like the Wizard of Oz, would prefer that we don’t look behind the curtain and instead just focus on what we can see. That will change if I have anything to say about it.New research shows that Big Tech companies are manipulating the online experiences of millions of Americans in ways unknown before, with a demonstrated and disturbing bias against communications from Republican candidates and policymakers. Republican leaders have had enough, and we’ve introduced legislation to stop it.Researchers at North Carolina State University recently analyzed emails sent by Republican and Democrat candidates during the 2020 election cycle. The non-partisan study found that Gmail, which is the largest email provider in the United States, sent nearly 70 percent of emails from Republican candidates to spam while allowing 90 percent of emails from Democrat candidates to sail through Google’s filtering algorithms without issue. A data discrepancy like this one can’t be ignored. These findings are alarming on many levels, but especially when it comes to the integrity of our elections. Email is a vital method of communication for elected officials and candidates to reach voters, and it’s a problem when the most-used email provider in the United States demonstrates a pattern of limiting political discourse from one of the major political parties while essentially amplifying it for the other party. No major Big Tech company should have the ability to place its thumb on the scales by limiting the content that voters see, especially behind closed doors.I recently pressed Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai on this issue. Google disagrees with the allegation that its e-mail filtering algorithms are politically biased. Thankfully, there’s an easy way to clear everything up: Google could be more transparent with the public about its algorithms and why Republican emails are discriminated against at such a high rate.  Or better yet, Google could leave the decision up to the consumers to make their own online decisions. That might be a novel idea to Big Tech, but it’s something American consumers are demanding now more than ever before. This would be required of all major platforms if Congress passes my Political Bias in Algorithm Sorting (BIAS) Emails Act, which I introduced earlier this month. It would prohibit email platforms from using biased filtering algorithms on emails from federal political campaigns unless a user took a proactive action to apply a label to that email. My bill would also require these platforms to explain when emails from political candidates are marked as spam and provide transparency reports into the platform’s sorting practices.Consumers should have the most power to determine what they do or don’t see online, especially when they have opted to receive emails in the first place. Nothing in the Political BIAS Emails Act would stop a user from marking an email they don’t want as spam – but it would prevent large platforms from trying to make those decisions for the user. Last week, Republican leaders in the House of Representatives introduced companion legislation to the bill I introduced in the Senate. Their support and leadership will be necessary if we are going to take on the largest Big Tech companies on behalf of consumers everywhere. I’m not new to this effort. In fact, I’ve introduced multiple pieces of legislation that would also hold Big Tech accountable and empower American consumers. My Filter Bubble Transparency Act and Platform Accountability and Consumer Transparency Act would also create meaningful change for online users, and they both enjoy bipartisan support.  Big Tech has an outsized ability to shape consumers’ online experiences, and it’s only growing. Republicans believe in empowering consumers to make their own decisions within a free market of ideas, and if we are trusted with majorities in Congress next year, we will have more tools and leverage at our disposal to hold Big Tech accountable.The decision is up to the voters – they just might want to check their spam folders to learn more. Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/google-may-send-republicans-to-spam-but-we-re-holding-big-tech-accountable"

This announcement stops the recommended reduction in services at VA facilities in Hot Springs, Sioux Falls, Sturgis and Wagner.“As Senators, we share a commitment to expanding and strengthening modern VA infrastructure in a way that upholds our obligations to America’s veterans. We believe the recommendations put forth to the AIR Commission are not reflective of that goal, and would put veterans in both rural and urban areas at a disadvantage, which is why we are announcing that this process does not have our support and will not move forward. The Commission is not necessary for our continued push to invest in VA health infrastructure, and together we remain dedicated to providing the Department with the resources and tools it needs to continue delivering quality care and earned services to veterans in 21stcentury facilities—now and into the future.”Background:For additional background, in May, Thune and Rounds introduced legislation that would eliminate the commission that is tasked with identifying facilities that should be consolidated or realigned and protect the several VA facilities across South Dakota that have been designated.The delegation’s decade-long fight to save the Hot Springs VA culminated in October 2020 when then-VA Secretary Robert Wilkie notified them that the VA had formally rescinded its earlier record of decision to realign the VA Black Hills Health Care System, which would have significantly reduced services at the Hot Springs VA medical center. Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/thune-rounds-colleagues-announce-end-of-va-air-commission"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today spoke on the Senate floor about his efforts to hold Big Tech accountable to American consumers. Thune discussed his Political Bias in Algorithm Sorting (BIAS) Emails Act, legislation that would prohibit large online platforms from censoring emails through filtered algorithms. It would also provide much-needed transparency for consumers by revealing Big Tech’s censoring practices that are used to filter certain emails. Thune has also introduced the Filter Bubble Transparency Act and the Platform Accountability and Transparency Act, two additional measures that are aimed at holding Big Tech accountable. Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, former Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt, writing with Jared Cohen, once said that ‘modern technology platforms’ are, quote, ‘even more powerful than most people realize,’ and that, quote, ‘our future world will be profoundly altered by their adoption and successfulness in societies everywhere.’ “There is no question that Big Tech plays an ever-increasing role in our lives. “I imagine most of us wouldn’t even be able to count the number of times a day we interact with technology platforms, from checking our email to spending time on social media to searching on Google. “And the pandemic only accelerated that trend, as our reliance on technology for everything from social connection to food delivery increased. “Mr. President, I don’t need to tell anyone that technology platforms offer a lot of benefits. “They are sources of entertainment and information. “They make it easier to stay close to distant loved ones.  “They allow us to shop, and conduct business, and connect with friends, and advocate for causes we believe in. “But I also don’t need to tell anyone that technology platforms have a more problematic side as well. “One big problem arises from the increasing ability Big Tech has to shape the information we see through the use of opaque algorithms. “Gone are the days when you logged into Facebook and just consumed content that had been posted chronologically since your previous log-in. “Now Facebook – and other social media platforms – use algorithms to shape your newsfeed and provide suggestions for additional content, emphasizing posts the platforms think you’ll be interested in and deemphasizing other posts. “Now obviously algorithms are not all bad. “Most of us like it when YouTube automatically plays another video by our favorite band, instead of switching to something completely unrelated. “But if a 15-year-old kid watches a video and then YouTube’s algorithms lead him or her down a path of inappropriate videos … well, that’s a problem. “A 2021 Wall Street Journal investigation into TikTok revealed how easy it is for young users to be bombarded with inappropriate and disturbing content. “And thanks to limited or opaque disclosures, people are often not aware of just how much their experience on technology platforms is being shaped by opaque algorithms. “When we search for something on Google, most of us don’t spend a lot of time thinking about the fact that Google is tailoring our search results to what it thinks we want to see – or what it wants us to see. “But the fact of the matter is that almost all of the information being presented to us by Big Tech platforms like social media and Google is being filtered and tailored to us. “And while, again, this can have a positive side, it can also have negative consequences, ranging from political polarization to addictive behavior. “And as technology platforms play an ever-more-dominant role in our lives, I believe that platforms should be required to make users aware of the fact that an algorithm is controlling the content they see. “To that end, I have offered multiple pieces of legislation to increase Big Tech’s transparency and give consumers more control over their experience.   “My bipartisan Filter Bubble Transparency Act would require large-scale internet platforms to notify users that the content they are seeing has been selected for them by secret algorithms – creating a unique universe of information for each user, a phenomenon that’s often referred to as the “filter bubble.”   “Platforms would also be required to give users the choice to switch to a version of the platform that is filter-bubble free. “I’ve also introduced the bipartisan Platform Accountability and Transparency Act, or PACT Act, to shed greater light on the secretive content moderation processes internet platforms use. “The PACT Act would require internet platforms to prepare biannual transparency reports outlining material they’ve removed from their sites or chosen to deemphasize. “These reports would have to be made available to the public – and not in intentionally complicated legalese. “Platforms would have to provide clearly understandable versions of these reports to consumers. “The PACT Act would also require technology platforms to provide consumers with greater due process when it comes to content these platforms remove or otherwise moderate. “So if Facebook, for example, removed one of your posts, it would have to tell you why, and it would have to provide a way for you to appeal that decision. “Mr. President, today I am introducing a third piece of legislation to increase transparency and accountability at Big Tech – the Political Bias in Algorithm Sorting Emails Act, otherwise known as the Political BIAS Emails Act. “The Political BIAS Emails Act is intended to address the problem political campaigns on both sides of the aisle have faced in getting their campaign emails to Americans. “A recent study from North Carolina State University found that during the 2020 election cycle, Google’s Gmail – the largest email provider in the United States – sent greater numbers of Republican campaign emails to spam folders, while Yahoo and Outlook sent greater numbers of Democrat campaign emails to spam, albeit by lesser margins than Google did for Republican campaign emails.  “That’s a problem.  “Americans should have access to political communications from both parties so that they can make their own informed decisions on what candidates they wish to support. “Disproportionately filtering out information from candidates of one party – or from a certain candidate within a particular political party, as happened during the Democrat presidential primary – skews the information available to Americans. “And I do not believe that Big Tech should be deciding what information individuals receive. “Americans are free to opt out of whatever email communications they wish, including political communications, but Big Tech should not be making that decision for them. “My Political BIAS Emails Act would prohibit email services from using filtering algorithms on emails sent from political campaigns where the candidate is running for federal office. “Gmail and other email services’ inboxing practices are a black box to consumers, and they operate with little accountability. “To address this, my legislation would require email services to submit transparency reports noting the number of emails from both Republican and Democrat campaigns flagged as spam, as well as provide information to political campaigns on request to help ensure that voters are receiving relevant information on every candidate’s policy positions. “This legislation would help ensure that Americans, not Big Tech, are making the decisions on what campaign communications they want to receive. “Mr. President, internet platforms have enhanced Americans’ lives in a number of ways. “But as these platforms play an ever-greater role in shaping the information we receive, it is vital that we insist on adequate transparency and ensure that Americans are given the opportunity to opt out of the filter bubble. “I will continue to work to advance the various bills that I have introduced to promote greater transparency in Big Tech. “And as ranking member of the Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Communications, Media, and Broadband, I will continue to focus on ways to ensure that Big Tech is accountable to consumers. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink:

By no fault of their own, rural communities are often overlooked. But that shouldn’t be the case. South Dakotans and other rural Americans shouldn’t be penalized for where they live or work. They deserve the same broadband access as their urban counterparts, which is why I have long focused on expanding rural broadband access and 5G services. During my last broadband roundtable event in Sioux Falls, I heard firsthand from the folks who are on the ground, building out networks across the state. Among many issues, I heard about the challenges these companies face when it comes to supply chain shortages and increased construction costs. I also invited Federal Communications Commissioner Brendan Carr to attend the roundtable so he could hear directly from South Dakota broadband providers about the need to reduce regulatory barriers. Hearing feedback directly from the source is invaluable, and I appreciated the commissioner’s willingness to attend.  Having reliable rural fixed broadband services is key to ensuring that rural communities are able to access 5G – the next wave of mobile broadband internet. 5G offers tremendous potential for rural communities, whether it’s better access to telehealth or the opportunity to implement precision agriculture. I am committed to smoothing the path for these services, which will be critical as we build out 5G networks, not just in cities and suburbs, but in rural communities across the United States. 5G mobile broadband technology has the power to change the way we interact with the internet. 5G will be 100 times faster and support 100 times as many devices, enabling massive breakthroughs in key industries in South Dakota and around the country.U.S. companies are already building out 5G networks, but there’s more work to be done. Washington needs to remove regulatory and permitting hurdles and ensure that companies have access to the spectrum they need to build strong networks. We’ve already seen progress after my MOBILE NOW Act became law in 2018. Despite these important steps, we must continue to pass smart and effective legislation to keep America leading the race to 5G and help rural America stay connected. I’ve introduced a number of other bills to help keep the United States at the forefront of the 5G revolution and ensure that 5G technology makes its way to rural communities. My STREAMLINE Act, for example, would expedite the deployment of the small cells needed for 5G installation while respecting the role of state and local governments in making deployment decisions. Importantly, it would make it more affordable to bring 5G to rural areas by addressing the costs of small-cell deployment. In terms of workforce, a critical component to winning the race to 5G, my Telecommunications Skilled Workforce Act, which became law last year, will help increase the number of workers enrolled in 5G training programs and identify ways to grow the telecommunications workforce to meet the demands of 5G. I will continue to work to support every part of the 5G equation – from physical technology to spectrum to a 5G workforce – so the United States can stay at the forefront of this internet revolution. I will also continue to make fixed broadband and 5G access in rural communities a priority. We can’t afford not to.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/https-www-google-com-search-q-mamie-lise-sxsrf-aliczsam8m5orse4clcgsroc1jy5ym8eya-1656120825282-source-lnms-tbm-isch-sa-x-ved-2ahukewi3ypvrusf4ahwplmofhamkbjgq-auoa3oecaiqbq-biw-1527-bih-853-dpr-2-2-imgrc-3zid6888jo4com"

Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Thune also discussed the important role pregnancy resource centers have in supporting mothers and their babies in communities across the country. Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, the Dobbs case will be decided by the Supreme Court in a matter of days now. “I pray that it will be decided in favor of life, and that Roe v. Wade, a case that even pro-abortion constitutional scholars have criticized, will be overturned. “But however Dobbs is decided, the work of the pro-life movement will continue. “That work of course includes advocacy – attempts to change laws to ensure that the human rights of unborn human beings are protected. “But perhaps most of all it includes the daily work of providing help to moms in need. “Helping moms and their babies is central to the pro-life movement. “Pregnancy resource centers and other pro-life organizations provide a variety of resources to help women in challenging circumstances. “They provide supplies for moms and their babies. “They offer prenatal and parenting classes. “They assist moms with housing. “They help them connect with state and local resources. “They provide friendship and support and a listening ear to moms going through a difficult time. “They provide agency referrals for mothers who choose to make an adoption plan for their babies. “They provide places for moms and their babies to live while they complete their education, or get back on their feet. “During the current formula crisis, pregnancy resource centers have helped moms struggling to find what they need to feed their babies by providing them with free formula. “Mr. President, you would think that helping out moms would be pretty uncontroversial. “You would think that everyone, including individuals who are pro-abortion, could get behind helping a struggling mom find housing or access prenatal care. “But apparently the pro-abortion movement finds providing material help to moms in need – and letting them know that they have alternatives to abortion – to be pretty threatening. “Pregnancy resource centers have frequently been a target of pro-abortion politicians and the pro-abortion movement, which have sought to undermine their work. “But things have gotten very serious in recent weeks. “Since a draft of a possible opinion in the Dobbs case was leaked in May, pro-abortion extremists have conducted a campaign of vandalism and violence against pregnancy resource centers and churches.  “Just a few blocks away from here, one pregnancy resource center was egged and graffitied and had its door covered in red paint. “A number of others have faced similar vandalism. “And multiple pregnancy resource centers have been the victim of arson. “A group claiming responsibility for a number of the attacks, Jane’s Revenge, released a chilling letter last week in which it declared, quote, ‘open season’ on pregnancy centers, and stated, and I quote, ‘We promised to take increasingly drastic measures against oppressive infrastructures. Rest assured that we will, and those measures may not come in the form of something so easily cleaned up as fire and graffiti.’ “Perhaps it is not entirely shocking that some members of the extreme pro-abortion movement have responded to the possibility of Roe’s being overturned with vandalism, arson, and threats of further attacks. “But this wave of violence is deeply troubling. “And these attacks need to be taken seriously. “I hope Attorney General Garland is developing a strategy to confront this wave of vandalism and violence and to prevent future and more serious attacks. “Earlier this month I joined a number of my Republican colleagues in sending a letter to the attorney general asking about his plans for dealing with these attacks and preventing future ones. “I am disappointed that we have yet to receive a reply to our letter. “And the president – not merely his spokesperson, but the president himself – should be out there strongly condemning these attacks and letting everyone know that violent responses to the Dobbs decision will not be tolerated. “Mr. President, after one pregnancy resource center was vandalized, its director said, ‘We’re not going to let intimidation change what we’re doing.  It failed.  It was pretty unanimous from the volunteers and staff here, that this is not going to change how we do business here one bit at all.’ “I know that attitude is reflected at other pregnancy resource centers. “And I know that despite threats of violence, the work of helping moms and their babies will continue. “Mr. President, the work of the pro-life movement represents the best of our American tradition. “Providing a voice to the voiceless. “Standing up for the human rights of those who have been denied them. “And providing a helping hand to our neighbors in need. “I am grateful to all the pro-life Americans standing up for the human rights of unborn human beings and helping moms and their babies get the resources they need. “And win or lose at the Supreme Court, I know that that work will continue. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/thune-i-will-always-stand-up-for-life"

pheasant season – rolls around.  “It’s a tradition that I’m happy to be able to share with the next generation, as my dad shared it with me. “There’s nothing better than a day spent outdoors with friends and family, followed by a communal meal … usually involving pheasant! “Mr. President, being in the outdoors isn’t just enjoyable; I think it’s part of a good life. “The health benefits of time spent outdoors are well-established, and I know a day – or even an hour – out in the fresh air always clears my mind and refreshes my spirit. “With more and more of our life spent in front of screens, I think time spent outdoors and disconnected is even more important. “I’m grateful for all those hours we spent as kids running around outside. “And for family activities outdoors … like our summer trips to the Black Hills. “We used to go out there for Labor Day, stay in this little non-air-conditioned cabin, and just glory in the outdoors. “We’d hike and visit the caves, or go to Mount Rushmore, or head to the lake. “I loved – and still love – visiting Sylvan Lake. “I loved being there with my parents and siblings, and I loved taking my daughters there on trips like the ones I took growing up. “Nobody who visits South Dakota should miss the Black Hills. “I’m not sure there’s a more beautiful place on earth. “The interplay of light and shadow on the trees and rocks late on a summer afternoon. “The endless South Dakota sky reflected in the blue of Sylvan Lake. “The Milky Way carpeting the night sky with millions of diamonds. “There’s no better place to spend time in the great outdoors than South Dakota. “Our state is filled with natural wonders. “The Missouri River. “Jewel Cave and Wind Cave – two of the longest caves in the world. “Together they offer hundreds of miles of underground passageways to explore, filled with glimmering crystals and remarkable rock formations. “We have the magnificent Black Hills National Forest and Custer State Park. “Rolling prairies. “And, of course, the Badlands. “If you haven’t experienced the rugged beauty of the Badlands, you’re missing out. “Extraordinary layered rock formations that look like they might have come from another planet. “A wealth of fossils. “Everybody should see the sun set over the Badlands at least once in their life, turning the tops of the rocks to a sea of fiery orange. “And of course no mention of South Dakota’s great outdoors would be complete without a mention of Mount Rushmore – one of our national treasures. “Nature got a little help from man here. “And the result is magnificent. “You can’t help but be awed when you see Mount Rushmore soaring up in front of you. “And you can’t help but feel a little prouder to be a citizen of this great land. “Mr. President, our nation’s great outdoor spaces need to be cared for so that we can preserve them for future generations – from wildlife enthusiasts to hikers and runners to farmers and ranchers.  “I’m a longtime supporter of the Conservation Reserve Program. “Agriculture producers are familiar with the Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP, which provides incentives for farmers, ranchers, and landowners to take environmentally sensitive land out of production for 10 to 15 years. “The Conservation Reserve Program helps the environment by improving soil health and water quality and providing habitat for wildlife, including endangered and threatened species. “I pushed for an increase in the CRP acreage cap in the 2018 farm bill, and the final bill raised the acreage cap to 27 million acres. “Currently I’m working on further improvements to CRP that I will work to get included in the 2023 farm bill. “Based on my conversations with farmers and ranchers, I developed the Conservation Reserve Program Improvement Act, which I introduced in March. “This legislation would make CRP grazing a more attractive option by providing cost-share payments for all CRP practices for the establishment of grazing infrastructure, including fencing and water distribution. “It would also increase the annual payment limit for CRP, which has not changed since 1985, to help account for inflation and the increase in land value. “This would enhance the appeal of CRP for farmers and ranchers, improving their bottom line while helping to protect the environment and increase wildlife habitat. “Another priority of mine is improving forest management in the Black Hills National Forest to reduce the risk of wildfires and damaging insect infestations. “I’ve introduced two pieces of legislation during this Congress to help improve management of our national forests, including the Black Hills. “Currently on-the-ground management activities, including timber thinning, are significantly lagging in the Black Hills National Forest and other forests throughout the country. “My Expediting Forest Restoration and Recovery Act would require the U.S. Forest Service to expedite treatment of more than 70 million acres of National Forest System lands to reduce the threat of insect and disease infestations and catastrophic wildfires. “My Black Hills Forest Protection and Jobs Preservation Act is also designed to help expedite forest management projects in the Black Hills and elsewhere. “The bill, which I introduced with my Wyoming colleague Senator John Barrasso, would require the U.S. Forest Service to quickly issue National Environmental Policy Act decisions that are necessary to carry out forest management projects, including thinning of overly dense timber stands in the Black Hills National Forest. “Our bill would also expedite timber production projects in the Black Hills National Forest and neighboring national forests to help maintain the timber sale program that plays a critical role in keeping these forests healthy while also supporting the regional economy. “Mr. President, I’m grateful to live in a state that has so much to offer when it comes to the great outdoors. “I will continue to work to protect and preserve our natural treasures. “And I hope every American will take advantage of Great Outdoors Month to get outside and enjoy the natural world. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/thune-celebrates-south-dakota-s-great-outdoors"

http://www.thune.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/op-eds?ContentRecord_id=D7FA05F8-D6AF-47AB-BC2D-4A74CB757FC5,"Record-high inflation and supply chain bottlenecks are driving up prices and hitting South Dakota’s economy particularly hard. While it’s true that supply chain issues and the reopening of economies after COVID shutdowns contributed somewhat to inflationary pressures, a big reason for our current inflation crisis is too much spending on Democrat priorities in Washington. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix for the inflation crisis, but, in addition to stopping wasteful and unnecessary spending, there are actions we can take to lessen the blow. For more than a year now, foreign-flagged ocean carriers have been playing games with American agriculture exports. Businesses from Strider Bikes in Rapid City to Valley Queen Cheese in Milbank have been experiencing port delays, equipment access issues, and declined bookings for months. These delays have a significantly negative impact on our state’s economy. Last year, more than 2 million pounds of South Dakota lactose was sold and ready to ship, but it sat for months in Valley Queen’s warehouse waiting for an empty container to become available. On top of that, the National Milk Producers Federation estimates that export supply chain challenges cost the U.S. dairy sector nearly $1 billion in the first six months of 2021.  South Dakota farmers and ranchers feed and fuel the world, and consumers and businesses look to them for in-demand agricultural goods. American manufacturers support many of the essential parts and products that fill our homes, businesses, and store shelves. In the last two years, agricultural exporters lost at least 22 percent of foreign sales, yet carriers continue to report record profits, bringing in two-or-three-times the revenue they predicted. Many ag exporters in the state have also been dealing with increased costs to ship goods overseas and the effects of shipping container delays and cancelations. South Dakota businesses – especially small businesses, which have fewer resources to fight supply chain problems – are also struggling to meet the demands of their customers. After unanimously passing in the U.S. Senate, our bipartisan, bicameral Ocean Shipping Reform Act made its way through the U.S. House of Representatives where it recently passed with strong, bipartisan support. With the help of U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and U.S. Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.), our critical legislation that will help ease supply chain pressures, particularly at our nation’s ports, is now the law of the land. The Ocean Shipping Reform Act is the strongest fix to our maritime laws in a generation. The legislation will strengthen the authority of the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) by providing it with new tools to help level the playing field for American exporters and counteract anticompetitive behavior. The bill will also help FMC more efficiently resolve disputes between ocean carriers and shippers, while also taking actions at the U.S. Department of Transportation to alleviate strain across the supply chain. Our legislation will help ease supply chain pressures by addressing unfair ocean carrier practices, speeding up the resolution of disputes over carrier fees, and improving the movement of goods at our nation’s ports. It won’t solve our nation’s inflation crisis, but it should help make life easier for U.S. exporters, importers, and consumers alike. Our bill isn’t a silver bullet, but help is on the way. Finding common ground in Washington is no easy feat, and we are grateful that the House and Senate came to an agreement on these important reforms to our nation’s shipping laws. The Ocean Shipping Reform Act proves that Congress can still do big things in a bipartisan way. We are proud to show that South Dakotans know how to work across the aisle and deliver meaningful results for our country at a time when we need it the most.  Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/helping-south-dakotans-deliver"

Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) today urged President Biden to promptly grant Gov. Kristi Noem’s (R-S.D.) request for federal disaster assistance in portions of South Dakota. The request follows the severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding that devastated communities across eastern South Dakota on May 12, 2022. “Widespread impacts resulted from this storm system, including uprooted or snapped trees, significant property damage, downed power-lines, overturned semi-trucks, as well as injuries and two tragic fatalities,” the delegation wrote. “The high winds and ensuing weather also caused extensive damage to agriculture—the lifeblood and economic engine of South Dakota. “The state, county, and local governments stepped up to meet the disaster with all available resources and authorities. However, the impact to public infrastructure across the 20 counties and two Indian reservations is severe,” the delegation continued. “We respectfully request that you expeditiously review Governor Noem’s request and declare a major disaster for relevant areas of our state.” Full letter below: The Honorable Joseph BidenPresident of the United StatesThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, DC  20500 Dear President Biden:  We write in strong support of Governor Kristi Noem’s request for a major disaster declaration for the state of South Dakota as a result of severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred on May 12, 2022.  As Governor Noem’s request indicates, eastern South Dakota was struck by a string of destructive storms on May 12, 2022, with 14 reported tornadoes and wind gusts of more than 100 miles per hour in some areas. Widespread impacts resulted from this storm system, including uprooted or snapped trees, significant property damage, downed power-lines, overturned semi-trucks, as well as injuries and two tragic fatalities. The high winds and ensuing weather also caused extensive damage to agriculture—the lifeblood and economic engine of South Dakota. Fortunately, it was too early in the season to wipe out any crops, but farmers lost essential equipment and resources—feed, grain bins, outbuildings, and more. The state, county, and local governments stepped up to meet the disaster with all available resources and authorities. However, the impact to public infrastructure across the 20 counties and two Indian reservations is severe. As Governor Noem indicated in her request, this event was of “such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and the affected local governments, and supplemental federal assistance is necessary.” This determination was reached on the basis of a preliminary damage assessment completed by the state in cooperation with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. We respectfully request that you expeditiously review Governor Noem’s request and declare a major disaster for relevant areas of our state. Along with our fellow South Dakotans, we appreciate your consideration of this request and stand ready to assist in any way possible. vPermalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/thune-rounds-johnson-urge-biden-to-grant-much-needed-disaster-relief-for-severe-storms"

John Thune (R-S.D.), a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Aviation Safety, Operations, and Innovation, introduced the Dynamic Airspace Pilot Program Act of 2022. This bipartisan legislation would require the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in coordination with the Department of Defense (DoD), to establish a pilot program to support the development of “dynamic airspace,” or the efficient scheduling of special use airspace and airspace boundaries that evolve as military exercises or other flights proceed through them. “I believe dynamic airspace will better enable the Pentagon to meet training requirements for 5th generation aircraft like the B-21, which need larger volumes of airspace to accommodate longer engagement distances,” said Thune. “But dynamic airspace should benefit all users of the National Airspace System, including an expanding commercial demand, new space entrants, and unmanned aircraft systems. The safe and efficient management of America’s airspace is critical to our national security and our economy, and I look forward to advancing the dynamic airspace concept.” “Our bipartisan bill creates a pilot program testing special scheduling and management of airspace to expand aviation opportunities – fueling jobs and economic growth,” said Sinema. The concept of dynamic airspace seeks to optimize use of the National Airspace System (NAS) to accommodate a growing universe of airspace users, including modern military aircraft that require larger volumes of airspace for realistic training, commercial and general aviation, military and commercial space launches, and unmanned aircraft systems. Optimized use of the NAS could lead to improved time and access to airspace, more direct flight routes, and reduced fuel consumption. The Dynamic Airspace Pilot Program Act would require dynamic airspace testing in special activity airspace in at least two areas over land and one over coastal waters. The pilot program would be conducted in a manner that increases airspace access for military testing and training without conflicting with the safe management of the NAS for other users and stakeholders. The FAA and DoD would be required to report to Congress on the interim findings of the pilot program.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/thune-sinema-introduce-dynamic-airspace-pilot-program"

John Thune (R-S.D.), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Communications, Media, and Broadband, today spoke on the Senate floor about his efforts to ensure rural communities in South Dakota have access to broadband services. Thune discussed his Reforming Broadband Connectivity Act, legislation that would help guarantee a stable funding stream for the Federal Communications Commission’s Universal Service Fund, which promotes universal access to broadband and other telecommunications services. Thune also noted that his STREAMLINE  Act would make it more affordable to bring 5G to rural areas by addressing the costs of small cell deployment. Last week, the communications subcommittee held an oversight hearing on the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), one of the leading agencies charged with expanding rural broadband access and promoting wireless access. During that hearing, Thune pressed NTIA Assistant Secretary Alan Davidson on removing unnecessary burdensome requirements when distributing broadband funding.   Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, before I begin, I’d like to take a brief moment to wish the United States Army a happy 247th birthday. “I had the special honor this morning to “fall in” with Secretary of the Army Wormuth, Army Chief of Staff McConville, Sergeant Major of the Army Grinston, many other Army leaders, and hundreds of soldiers for some morning PT. “I appreciated the opportunity to join in the Army tradition of a birthday formation run, and it was especially humbling to run through the hallowed grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. “Any time you are in Arlington – or any national cemetery in the states, like Black Hills National Cemetery, or overseas, like the Normandy American Cemetery – you are reminded of the sacrifice and legacy of our nation’s warfighters. “Every name and pair of dates on a headstone tells a unique story of selfless service to our nation. “And in running over the hills and around the turns this morning, you get a better sense of the magnitude of the more than 400,000 Americans honored at Arlington and the collective sacrifice of all of America’s heroes. “Today, the U.S. Army proudly carries on the heritage and legacy established on June 14, 1775. “Our soldiers – and all our men and women in uniform – stand guard around the world to protect our freedoms. “And they make any adversary think twice about threatening them, as the U.S. Army has done for 247 years. “Thank you all for your service to our country, your professionalism and determination, and for including me today. “Happy birthday. “Mr. President, as a longtime member – and former chairman – of the Senate Commerce Committee and as a resident of a rural state, I have long been focused on expanding rural broadband access and ensuring that the benefits of the next wave of mobile broadband, 5G, are fully realized in rural communities. “Expanding rural broadband access has been embraced by members on both sides of the aisle, and Congress has appropriated billions of dollars in recent years to ensure that rural communities are able to access fixed broadband. “And it is encouraging to see members on both sides of the aisle supporting this goal. “But there are problems. “While, as I said, Congress has appropriated billions of dollars toward this goal, the federal government lacks an overarching broadband strategy. “As a recent Government Accountability Office report highlighted, rural broadband funding is spread out over 15 separate agencies and more than 130 separate programs. “That does not exactly make for outstanding efficiency or coordination. “What it does make for is wasted taxpayer dollars – and slower progress in ensuring that all our rural communities have access to broadband. “Last week, the Senate Commerce Committee’s communications subcommittee, of which I serve as ranking member, held an oversight hearing on one of the leading agencies charged with expanding rural broadband access and promoting wireless access – the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA. “I appreciated Assistant Secretary Davidson coming to testify before the committee. “Last year, Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which provided billions of dollars to NTIA to deploy broadband services to unserved areas throughout the United States. “At the time the bill was debated, I raised a number of concerns about NTIA’s ability to effectively and efficiently manage such substantial funding given NTIA’s past history on expanding rural broadband services. “The last time Congress provided NTIA with broadband funding – a fraction of the funding it is now responsible for – the agency struggled with implementation and ended up overbuilding existing broadband networks, resulting in billions of taxpayer dollars being spent with little to show. “And I have not seen a lot to convince me that NTIA will do a better job this time around.  “Last month, NTIA released its Notice of Funding Opportunity for the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment, or BEAD, Program. “The notice contains a number of troubling components. “To begin with, I am concerned that NTIA is planning to base its funding allocations on maps that don’t accurately reflect which areas of the country are unserved. “This creates a substantial risk of misallocating the funding Congress appropriated and once again overbuilding existing networks at the taxpayer’s expense. “NTIA’s notice also makes clear that when it comes to expanding networks, NTIA is planning to favor certain applicants – specifically, government-run networks and non-traditional broadband providers – entities with no proven track record in deploying broadband networks. “What NTIA should be doing is taking a neutral approach that allows equal participation from all types of broadband providers, as long as they meet the technical, financial, and operational standards to deploy networks.  “Finally, especially at a time of record-high inflation, the last thing any agency should be doing is pursuing extraneous political goals that will ultimately increase the costs for providers who are deploying networks. “I am disappointed that NTIA, like other federal agencies under this administration, is seeking to score political points with certain constituencies – in this case by leaning into net neutrality requirements, promoting burdensome labor standards, and focusing on climate-change initiatives. “NTIA’s focus on requiring broadband providers to use a unionized workforce or project labor agreement not only puts providers who do not use union workforces at a disadvantage, but it is unworkable for providers in rural communities like those in South Dakota who simply don’t have access to a unionized workforce. “Earlier this month, I heard firsthand from the folks who are building out networks in my home state of South Dakota about the challenges they face with respect to supply chain shortages and increased construction costs. “And including unnecessary requirements in broadband contracts will only exacerbate the problem. “I will continue to urge NTIA to work with states to reduce rather than increase regulatory burdens so that the funding Congress provided can be used to provide broadband access to as many Americans as possible. “I also continue to work on other measures to expand broadband access in rural communities, including the Reforming Broadband Connectivity Act, which I joined colleagues from both parties to introduce last year. “This legislation would help guarantee a stable funding stream for the Federal Communications Commission’s Universal Service Fund, which promotes universal access to broadband and other telecommunications services. “And I am hoping that we can get this legislation enacted into law this year. “Mr. President, having reliable rural fixed broadband services is also key in ensuring that rural communities are able to access the next wave of mobile broadband internet, 5G.   “And I am committed to smoothing the path for 5G services. “5G offers tremendous potential for rural communities, whether it’s better access to telehealth or the opportunity to implement precision agriculture. “And we need to ensure that we build out 5G networks not just in cities and suburbs but in rural communities across the United States. “I’ve introduced a number of bills to help keep the United States at the forefront of the 5G revolution and ensure that 5G technology makes its way to rural communities. “My STREAMLINE Act, for example, would expedite the deployment of the small cells needed for 5G installation while respecting the role of state and local governments in making deployment decisions. “And, importantly, it would make it more affordable to bring 5G to rural areas by addressing the costs of small cell deployment. “On the spectrum side of the equation, this year I introduced the Spectrum Innovation Act, along with communications subcommittee chairman Senator Lujan, to free up additional mid-band spectrum for 5G deployment, an action that will simultaneously improve 5G coverage and bring in revenue for deficit reduction. “And since freeing up additional spectrum requires proper coordination between NTIA, the FCC, and other federal agencies, I joined Senators Wicker, Blackburn, and Lujan to introduce the Improving Spectrum Coordination Act to ensure that our federal partners are effectively managing our nation’s airwaves. “On the workforce side of things, my Telecommunications Skilled Workforce Act, which was enacted into law last year, is designed to help increase the number of workers enrolled in 5G training programs and identify ways to grow the telecommunications workforce to meet the demands of 5G. “I will continue to work to support every part of the 5G equation – from physical technology to spectrum to a 5G workforce – so that the United States can stay at the forefront of this internet revolution. “I will also continue to make fixed broadband and 5G access in rural communities a priority. “Too often, rural areas like those in my home state of South Dakota have lagged behind when it comes to getting the most modern internet technology. “And I am committed to ensuring that the full benefits of next-generation technologies make their way to rural communities. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/thune-rural-communities-must-have-access-to-quality-high-speed-internet"

John Thune (R-S.D.), Republican whip and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Communications, Media, and Broadband; Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Republican leader; John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), chairman of the Senate Republican Conference; Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee; Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), vice chair of the Senate Republican Conference; Rick Scott (R-Fla.), chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee; and 21 of their Republican colleagues today introduced the Political Bias in Algorithm Sorting (BIAS) Emails Act. This legislation would hold Big Tech platforms accountable for using biased algorithms that take control away from consumers and alter the way users are able to see emails from political campaigns. The legislation would also create more transparency for consumers by revealing the censoring practices Big Tech platforms, including Google, use to filter certain emails.“I’ve long believed that Congress should hold Big Tech accountable to the users who rely on its platforms – for everything from email to social media – and empower those consumers to make their own online decisions, free from Big Tech’s heavy hand,” said Thune. “I’m proud to lead this effort that would prohibit large online platforms from censoring emails through filtered algorithms – a process that ultimately discriminates against political campaigns. Consumers should be able to choose what they want to see, not Google. It’s long past time for Big Tech to be held accountable for its blatant bias, and this bill would be an important step in that direction.”“The evidence suggests that some actors in the tech industry display an undeniable pattern of ideological bias against conservatives,” said McConnell. “I applaud Senator Thune for leading legislation to push back against companies that use private-sector political censorship to quietly distort our public discourse. If left-wing elites disagree with citizens’ free speech, they should make their own case in an open marketplace of ideas, not use powerful technology platforms to put a thumb on the scale.”“Big Tech is not the free speech police. They should never target the information Americans chose to receive based on political beliefs,” said Barrasso. “This legislation will prohibit email platforms from filtering political emails to spam without user consent and stop these companies from forcing their own biases on people in Wyoming and across the country.”“The North Carolina State University study revealed concerning data that tech companies may be using email filtering algorithms to create an unfair advantage for Democrat campaigns,” said Blunt. “It’s hard to have truly fair elections when large email platforms are putting their thumb on the scale, deciding which messages can easily reach voters and which get buried in a spam folder. This legislation will help ensure a level playing field, increase accountability, and protect voters’ access to information.”“When Big Tech targets and silences conservative voices and puts their thumb on the scale of our political process, they need to be held accountable and, at the very least, the public ought to know about it,” said Ernst. “This measure prevents these platforms from playing favorites in our elections and ensures there is transparency around how they treat political campaigns from one party versus another.”“Republicans won't sit back and allow Big Tech to be a pawn for the Left,” said Scott. “Any suppression of conservative candidates is unacceptable. The Political BIAS Emails Act is an important step forward to hold Big Tech accountable for its attempts to silence conservative voices and increase transparency between large email platforms and political campaigns.”Thune’s legislation is also co-sponsored by U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.).To prevent Big Tech from hindering the access of voters to a candidate’s perspective on certain political issues and other relevant information, the Political BIAS Emails Act would prohibit email platforms, like Google, from using biased filtering algorithms on emails from federal political campaigns, unless a user took a proactive action to apply a certain label to that email. The legislation would also bring much more transparency to the practices large email services use to dictate outcomes by requiring email services to produce quarterly transparency reports.Earlier this year, a non-partisan study found that Google’s algorithm marked nearly 70 percent of emails from Republican campaigns during the 2020 election as spam compared to only 8 percent of emails from Democrat campaigns. Thune has also introduced the Filter Bubble Transparency Act and the Platform Accountability and Transparency Act, two additional measures that are aimed at holding Big Tech accountable to consumers.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/thune-senate-republican-leaders-introduce-political-bias-emails-act"

time on social media to searching on Google. “And the pandemic only accelerated that trend, as our reliance on technology for everything from social connection to food delivery increased. “Mr. President, I don’t need to tell anyone that technology platforms offer a lot of benefits. “They are sources of entertainment and information. “They make it easier to stay close to distant loved ones.  “They allow us to shop, and conduct business, and connect with friends, and advocate for causes we believe in. “But I also don’t need to tell anyone that technology platforms have a more problematic side as well. “One big problem arises from the increasing ability Big Tech has to shape the information we see through the use of opaque algorithms. “Gone are the days when you logged into Facebook and just consumed content that had been posted chronologically since your previous log-in. “Now Facebook – and other social media platforms – use algorithms to shape your newsfeed and provide suggestions for additional content, emphasizing posts the platforms think you’ll be interested in and deemphasizing other posts. “Now obviously algorithms are not all bad. “Most of us like it when YouTube automatically plays another video by our favorite band, instead of switching to something completely unrelated. “But if a 15-year-old kid watches a video and then YouTube’s algorithms lead him or her down a path of inappropriate videos … well, that’s a problem. “A 2021 Wall Street Journal investigation into TikTok revealed how easy it is for young users to be bombarded with inappropriate and disturbing content. “And thanks to limited or opaque disclosures, people are often not aware of just how much their experience on technology platforms is being shaped by opaque algorithms. “When we search for something on Google, most of us don’t spend a lot of time thinking about the fact that Google is tailoring our search results to what it thinks we want to see – or what it wants us to see. “But the fact of the matter is that almost all of the information being presented to us by Big Tech platforms like social media and Google is being filtered and tailored to us. “And while, again, this can have a positive side, it can also have negative consequences, ranging from political polarization to addictive behavior. “And as technology platforms play an ever-more-dominant role in our lives, I believe that platforms should be required to make users aware of the fact that an algorithm is controlling the content they see. “To that end, I have offered multiple pieces of legislation to increase Big Tech’s transparency and give consumers more control over their experience.   “My bipartisan Filter Bubble Transparency Act would require large-scale internet platforms to notify users that the content they are seeing has been selected for them by secret algorithms – creating a unique universe of information for each user, a phenomenon that’s often referred to as the “filter bubble.”   “Platforms would also be required to give users the choice to switch to a version of the platform that is filter-bubble free. “I’ve also introduced the bipartisan Platform Accountability and Transparency Act, or PACT Act, to shed greater light on the secretive content moderation processes internet platforms use. “The PACT Act would require internet platforms to prepare biannual transparency reports outlining material they’ve removed from their sites or chosen to deemphasize. “These reports would have to be made available to the public – and not in intentionally complicated legalese. “Platforms would have to provide clearly understandable versions of these reports to consumers. “The PACT Act would also require technology platforms to provide consumers with greater due process when it comes to content these platforms remove or otherwise moderate. “So if Facebook, for example, removed one of your posts, it would have to tell you why, and it would have to provide a way for you to appeal that decision. “Mr. President, today I am introducing a third piece of legislation to increase transparency and accountability at Big Tech – the Political Bias in Algorithm Sorting Emails Act, otherwise known as the Political BIAS Emails Act. “The Political BIAS Emails Act is intended to address the problem political campaigns on both sides of the aisle have faced in getting their campaign emails to Americans. “A recent study from North Carolina State University found that during the 2020 election cycle, Google’s Gmail – the largest email provider in the United States – sent greater numbers of Republican campaign emails to spam folders, while Yahoo and Outlook sent greater numbers of Democrat campaign emails to spam, albeit by lesser margins than Google did for Republican campaign emails.  “That’s a problem.  “Americans should have access to political communications from both parties so that they can make their own informed decisions on what candidates they wish to support. “Disproportionately filtering out information from candidates of one party – or from a certain candidate within a particular political party, as happened during the Democrat presidential primary – skews the information available to Americans. “And I do not believe that Big Tech should be deciding what information individuals receive. “Americans are free to opt out of whatever email communications they wish, including political communications, but Big Tech should not be making that decision for them. “My Political BIAS Emails Act would prohibit email services from using filtering algorithms on emails sent from political campaigns where the candidate is running for federal office. “Gmail and other email services’ inboxing practices are a black box to consumers, and they operate with little accountability. “To address this, my legislation would require email services to submit transparency reports noting the number of emails from both Republican and Democrat campaigns flagged as spam, as well as provide information to political campaigns on request to help ensure that voters are receiving relevant information on every candidate’s policy positions. “This legislation would help ensure that Americans, not Big Tech, are making the decisions on what campaign communications they want to receive. “Mr. President, internet platforms have enhanced Americans’ lives in a number of ways. “But as these platforms play an ever-greater role in shaping the information we receive, it is vital that we insist on adequate transparency and ensure that Americans are given the opportunity to opt out of the filter bubble. “I will continue to work to advance the various bills that I have introduced to promote greater transparency in Big Tech. “And as ranking member of the Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Communications, Media, and Broadband, I will continue to focus on ways to ensure that Big Tech is accountable to consumers. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/thune-big-tech-must-be-held-accountable-to-american-consumers"

Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) today joined “Your World with Neil Cavuto” to discuss how their bipartisan, bicameral Ocean Shipping Reform Act will help alleviate strain across the supply chain. Following passage by the U.S. House of Representatives last night and the U.S. Senate passing the bill unanimously in March, Thune and Johnson’s legislation now heads to the president’s desk, where it’s expected to be signed into law.  Sen. Thune on the origins of this legislation: “We were hearing from agricultural interests in South Dakota, exporters, about these challenges they were having getting containers to get their products to overseas markets. And it was coupled with all the challenges people are having, importers are having, getting goods into the country, and so these supply chain issues were becoming more of a prominent issue for people that we represent. “And so, ironically, you have two people from the middle of the country, House and the Senate, work together to try and do something to clear up a lot of that congestion at the West Coast ports and got this bill through the House, through the Senate. Dusty got it through the House and on the president's desk, and we're hopeful it's going to make a difference.” Rep. Johnson on the supply chain and inflation:  “Our legislation tells foreign ocean carriers if they're going to use U.S. ports, and if they have cargo space available going back to Asia, they gosh darn better take American corn, beans, dairy, beef, and manufactured goods. That is going to make a big difference.” … “We don't just need China to stop discriminating against American goods. We also need our own president to stop discriminating against American energy. I mean, these gas prices are insane. It clearly puts upward pressure on inflation. The fact that he will go to Saudi Arabia and beg these guys to bail us out, but he won't look to ethanol, and he won't look to American domestic production of gas and oil is beyond my understanding.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/thune-and-johnson-celebrate-passage-of-ocean-shipping-reform-act-on-fox-news"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed how record-high inflation is hurting working families in South Dakota, and he noted that Democrats’ big-spending, big-government agenda is costing American households, on average, an additional $460 per month.  Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, the latest inflation numbers came out on Friday, and – as has become par for the course in the Biden economy – they weren’t pretty.  “Inflation hit 8.6 percent in May – the worst inflation since December 1981. “Grocery prices increased nearly 12 percent on average. “Eggs were up 32 percent. “Chicken was up 17 percent. “Milk was up 15 percent. “And the list goes on.  And on. “Gas prices were up 48 percent. “Since President Biden took office, the price of gas has more than doubled. “Gas has hit $5.00 a gallon, and the price of diesel – so essential to our nation’s farmers and ranchers – is even worse. “And there’s no end in sight. “J.P. Morgan estimates that gas prices could exceed $6 a gallon by August. “Other energy costs have also increased, with electricity up 12 percent and utility gas service up 30 percent. “By one estimate, inflation is costing American households $460 per month. “That’s right. “$460. “Per month. “It’s no surprise that in a recent poll, 83 percent of respondents – 83 percent – described the state of the economy as ‘poor’ or ‘not so good,’ or that just 27 percent said they have a good chance of improving their standard of living. “Mr. President, President Biden likes to talk about creating, quote, “an economy that works for working families.” “Well, I have news for the president. “This economy is not working for working families. “Working families can’t absorb an additional $460 a month. “They have to cut back. “They have to put off needed car repairs or eliminate a family vacation or cut down on milk for the kids. “The president said the other day, and I quote, ‘[The economy] is strong as can be but for inflation, but for gas and food.’ “‘But for gas and food.’ “Well, Mr. President, I have to tell you, gas and food prices are two pretty essential economic measures for families. “Moms and dads wondering how they can afford to fill up their cars to get to work and get the kids to baseball practice don’t care how good the president says the economy is if the price of a tank of gas has more than doubled since the president took office. “Mr. President, I guess we can at least be glad that Democrats and the president have finally started acknowledging our inflation crisis. “For months last year as inflation climbed, the administration dismissed concerns. “And even as it became more and more clear that we had a long-term problem on our hands, the president and congressional Democrats spent their time focusing not on solutions to our inflation crisis, but on a massive spending spree almost guaranteed to make our inflation problem worse. “That’s right. “Let’s remember how we got here, Mr. President. “When President Biden took office, inflation was at 1.4 percent – well within the Fed’s target inflation rate of 2 percent. “And it might have stayed there had Democrats not decided to pass a massive, partisan, $1.9 trillion spending spree under the guise of COVID relief – mere weeks after Congress had passed a fifth bipartisan COVID bill that met essentially all current pressing COVID needs. “Democrats’ so-called American Rescue Plan sent a lot of unnecessary government money into the economy. “And the economy overheated as a result. “And you don’t have to take my word for it. “Here’s what one Democrat economist who worked in the Obama administration had to say on the subject: ‘The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan passed in the early days of the Biden administration will go down in history as an extraordinary policy mistake.’ “Let me just repeat that, Mr. President. “‘The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan passed in the early days of the Biden administration will go down in history as an extraordinary policy mistake.’ “Mr. President, Democrats were warned that the American Rescue Plan ran the risk of overstimulating the economy. “They went ahead anyway. “But what’s almost worse was their subsequent decision to pursue another massive spending spree – their Build Back Better plan – even after it had become clear that their first spending spree had helped plunge our economy into a serious inflation crisis. “And even now, Mr. President – even now, as Americans deal with the worst inflation in decades – it’s looking like Democrats are trying to revive elements of their Build Back Better plan and use reconciliation rules to pass another partisan spending spree. “It’s the triumph of big-government ideology over economic reality. “And if Democrats succeed in passing another partisan spending spree using reconciliation rules, Americans’ economic situation is going to get even worse. “Mr. President, unfortunately there is no easy solution to Democrats’ largely self-inflicted inflation crisis. “But the first priority is to do no more harm. “That means no more partisan spending sprees like Democrats’ Build Back Better plan. “Another big priority should be unleashing American energy production – in particular domestic production of oil and natural gas – to ease energy prices. “High gas and energy prices fuel higher consumer prices across the board. “And unleashing American energy production would not only help reduce the price of gas, but could also help rein in prices for other commodities. “Unfortunately, the president has demonstrated a clear hostility to conventional energy production, which is discouraging investment in American energy – and prolonging the current gas price situation. “Another thing we should be doing to help make life easier for consumers is trying to ease supply chain woes – whether that involves removing burdensome trucking regulations or passing legislation like my Ocean Shipping Reform Act. “I am pleased that both Democrats and Republicans have come together to support my bipartisan legislation, which I introduced with Senator Klobuchar earlier this year. “I’m particularly grateful to my fellow South Dakotan Representative Dusty Johnson, who helped usher this legislation through the House. “The Ocean Shipping Reform Act will help ease supply chain pressures by addressing unfair ocean carrier practices, speeding up the resolution of detention and demurrage disputes, and improving the movement of goods at our nation’s ports. “It won’t solve our nation’s inflation crisis, but it should help make life easier for U.S. exporters, importers, and consumers alike. “I’m very pleased that this legislation passed the House of Representatives yesterday, and that it will soon be on its way to the president’s desk. “And I hope that we will be able to pursue more bipartisan propositions to help make life easier for American families. “Mr. President, Democrats’ big-spending, big-government agenda has resulted in a lot of pain for working families. “If President Biden and Democrats really want to make life better for ordinary Americans, they will decisively reject any further spending sprees and work with Republicans to do what we can to alleviate the inflation crisis Democrats helped create. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink:

Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) today issued the following statements after the U.S. House of Representatives passed their Ocean Shipping Reform Act (S. 3580). The bipartisan, bicameral legislation, which unanimously passed the U.S. Senate in March, would strengthen the authority of the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) by providing it with new tools to help level the playing field for American exporters and counteract anticompetitive behavior. The bill would also help FMC more efficiently resolve disputes between ocean carriers and shippers, while also taking actions at the U.S. Department of Transportation to alleviate strain across the supply chain. Their bill now heads to the president’s desk, where it’s expected to be signed into law. “Today’s vote proves that Congress can still do big things in a bipartisan way,” said Thune. “Now that we’ve cleared this hurdle, I’m glad that my Ocean Shipping Reform Act will soon be the law of the land. The common-sense improvements made by this bill willprovide the FMC with the tools necessary to address unreasonable practices by ocean carriers and hold them accountable for any bad-faith efforts that disenfranchise American producers, including those throughout South Dakota, who feed the world. Especially as Americans continue to grapple with record-high inflation, this legislation would also benefit consumers by promoting the efficiency of the supply chain.” “Foreign flagged ocean carriers are playing games with American agriculture exports and our bill puts an end to it,” said Johnson. “The Ocean Shipping Reform Act is the strongest fix to our maritime laws in a generation. Americans are facing record inflation, our bill isn’t a silver bullet, but help is on the way. I am proud to have worked on this issue for the last year with Congressman Garamendi, and I am grateful that the House and Senate came to an agreement on these important reforms to our nation’s shipping laws.”   The Ocean Shipping Reform Act will:  The FMC is the independent federal agency responsible for regulating the U.S. international ocean transportation system for the benefit of U.S. exporters, importers, and consumers. The FMC is primarily responsible for ensuring that ocean carriers and marine terminal operators engage in fair and competitive practices with respect to the movement of goods, while upholding the integrity of service contracts to guard against detrimental effects to shipping. Additionally, the FMC monitors rates, charges, and rules of government-owned or controlled carriers to ensure they are just and reasonable, which promotes fluidity and competition in U.S. international trade.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/thune-johnson-ocean-shipping-reform-act-heads-to-president-s-desk"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed his priorities for the 2023 farm bill, which would be the fifth farm bill he’s helped write during his time in Congress. Thune noted the importance of serving on the Senate Agriculture Committee, which gives him an important platform from which he can address the needs of South Dakota agriculture producers. Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, farming and ranching are industries that are particularly subject to the whims of the weather. “Just one storm can wipe out an entire herd or crop – sometimes in a matter of minutes. “Last Thursday, severe storms struck eastern South Dakota, and farmers were hit hard. “Fortunately it was too early in the season to wipe out any crops, but farmers lost essential equipment and resources – feed, grain bins, outbuildings, and more.“My office will be doing everything it can to make sure those affected get the assistance they need to recover. “And I know many are already planning to rebuild. “Mr. President, whether it’s a natural disaster or an ordinary day, farmers and ranchers are always at the top of my mind here in the Senate. “Agriculture is the lifeblood of our South Dakota economy, and I am committed to doing everything I can to ensure that our farmers and ranchers have the resources they need to help feed our country. “I’m fortunate enough to be a longtime member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, which gives me an important platform from which to address the needs of South Dakota ag producers. “Right now, a big focus of mine is the 2023 farm bill. “I’ve already held the first of a series of roundtables to hear from South Dakota farmers and ranchers about what they need out of the 2023 bill. “And I’ve introduced the first of what will be a number of proposals that I hope to get included in next year’s legislation. “My Conservation Reserve Program Improvement Act, which I introduced in March, would make CRP grazing a more attractive option by providing cost-share payments for all CRP practices for the establishment of grazing infrastructure, including fencing and water distribution. “It would also increase the annual payment limit for CRP, which has not changed since 1985, to help account for inflation and the increase in land value. “I’m also working with colleagues from agriculture states on legislation based on my conversations with South Dakota farmers and ranchers. “Last week I joined Senator Klobuchar to introduce the Agriculture Innovation Act. “Currently the U.S. Department of Agriculture collects reams of data on conservation practices. “The problem is that a lot of this data is often not analyzed and presented in a way that would be useful for farmers and ranchers. “The legislation Senator Klobuchar and I have introduced would provide for better processing and development of the data USDA collects, so that farmers and ranchers can evaluate the impact of conservation and other production practices on things like soil health, crop yields, and profitability. “Our bill would make it easier for farmers and ranchers to decide what conservation practices to adopt by, among other things, helping producers identify the ways adopting conservation practices can improve their bottom line.   “And Senator Klobuchar and I will be working to get this legislation included in the 2023 farm bill. “Mr. President, in addition to farm bill priorities, I’ve been spending a lot of time focused on agriculture and trade. “Our nation’s farmers and ranchers already send their products around the globe. “But with Russia’s war in Ukraine – and its devastating impact on Ukrainian agriculture – American ag producers are facing added responsibility when it comes to feeding the world. “Unfortunately, for some time now I’ve been hearing reports of ocean carriers refusing to transport American agricultural products. “This would be a difficult situation at any time, as export markets around the world are critically important to American producers. “But it is particularly painful at a time when inflation is soaring and the supply chain is under significant strain – and when there is an increased need to get American agriculture products abroad thanks to the war in Ukraine. “That’s why I introduced legislation – the Ocean Shipping Reform Act – to address these kinds of shipping problems and create a more level playing field for American producers.“My bipartisan legislation would give the Federal Maritime Commission increased authority to respond to unfair ocean carrier practices – whether that involves a refusal to carry certain cargo, like agricultural commodities, or discriminating against certain commodities for export.  “It would also provide the FMC with tools to more quickly resolve detention and demurrage disputes, which would bring greater efficiency and transparency to a process that leaves many shippers frustrated, especially agriculture producers and other small businesses. “I was very pleased that the Senate passed my bill at the end of March. “And I am working with my colleagues in the House to advance this legislation so that it can get to the president’s desk. “I also recently led a letter with 23 of my Senate Republican colleagues to the U.S. trade representative and the secretary of agriculture urging them to prioritize increased access to foreign markets for American producers, including – and especially – American ag producers. “Unfortunately, the Biden administration has not made market access commitments a priority in its trade agenda, including the proposed Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. “And the administration has failed to pursue any ambitious market-opening initiatives or comprehensive trade agreements. “Mr. President, trade has played a large part in America’s economic success for decades, and it is critical for American ag producers, who depend on exporting their products. “It is unacceptable that the administration has dropped the ball on pursuing increased market access for American producers. “I am also less than impressed by the president’s failure to put forward a confirmable nominee for the post of chief agricultural negotiator at the Office of the United States Trade Representative. “And while the president has – finally – put forward a nominee for undersecretary for trade and foreign agricultural affairs at the Department of Agriculture, it has taken him far too long to fill this position, which plays a critical role in advocating for American producers when it comes to world trade.  “I pressed the U.S. trade representative on the administration’s failure to prioritize a meaningful trade and agriculture agenda during a recent Finance Committee hearing, and I will continue to maintain pressure on the administration to expand export opportunities for our nation’s workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses. “Mr. President, our nation depends on our farmers and ranchers.“And I am profoundly grateful for all the determined men and women who have chosen and passed on this way of life. “I am honored to represent South Dakota’s farmers and ranchers here in the Senate. “And I will continue to do everything I can to ensure that they have all the resources they need to continue to feed our nation, and the world. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.” Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/thune-america-depends-on-our-farmers-and-ranchers"
http://www.thune.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/op-eds?ContentRecord_id=69D9A0A2-505B-4C7A-A47F-0564B2437082,"President Biden recently penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal entitled “My Plan for Fighting Inflation” in which he denies responsibility for his failed policies that helped create record-high inflation and out-of-control fuel costs. In his op-ed, President Biden spends multiple paragraphs attempting to convince Americans that the economy is thriving – which I have to think feels pretty meaningless to the millions of Americans struggling with massive increases in the cost of gas, groceries, and other everyday goods.Unsurprisingly, a recent poll found that just 27 percent of Americans believe they have a good chance of improving their standard of living. Here’s the deal: The president can talk about his supposed economic achievements all he wants, but that means little to South Dakotans who have seen their disposable income eaten up by price hikes or whose pay raise failed to even keep pace with the increase in the cost of living. When President Biden took office, inflation was at 1.4 percent – well within the Federal Reserve’s target inflation rate of 2 percent. Currently, it is at 8.6 percent – a 40-year high – largely thanks to the Democrats’ massive, partisan spending spree that flooded the economy with unnecessary government money. The definition of inflation is too many dollars chasing too few goods and services. And that’s exactly the situation Democrats helped create with their American Rescue Plan. They sent too many federal dollars into the economy – and the economy overheated as a result. I recently questioned U.S. Department of the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen at a Senate Finance Committee hearing, and she admitted that she was wrong about inflation after she and other administration officials told the American people this was just a temporary problem. Anyone who relies on gas to fill up their car or buys groceries to feed their family knows the rise in prices hasn’t been temporary – inflation has gotten worse, and it has been eating away at family budgets for months. Instead of talking about ways to address high energy prices by unleashing American energy production, the Biden administration continues to tout its release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve – a highly temporary Band-Aid that did next to nothing to address the cause of high gas prices, except for briefly pausing their rise to record highs. If Democrats really wanted to reduce gas prices and boost the productive capacity of our economy over time, they would embrace American energy production – including conventional energy production. Instead, the president is doing the opposite: He continues to discourage domestic production of the conventional energy sources that Americans rely on, and the result is likely to be continued high energy prices well into the future. I am calling on President Biden and Washington Democrats to get serious about addressing the inflation crisis that is hurting families across the country. Inflation is creating an additional tax on hardworking South Dakotans, and it’s forcing them to dig even deeper into their pocketbooks in order to make ends meet. I will do my part to hold Democrats accountable for their reckless spending and radical agenda that is fueling the inflation crisis, and I will continue to advocate for pro-growth policies that would reverse this dangerous trend. Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/inflated-prices-lead-to-deflated-family-budgets"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed President Biden’s proposal to forgive student loans and how it would be unfair to Americans who have already paid off their student loans or never incurred student loan debt. He also noted that it would do absolutely nothing to address the underlying problem: the rising cost of higher education. Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, before I begin, I would like to express my dismay at House Democrats’ decision last night to block legislation to provide enhanced security for Supreme Court justices and their families. “Due to the unprecedented leak of an early draft of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision – and the resultant hysteria from members of the pro-abortion left – the Supreme Court asked Congress for additional authorities to protect justices’ families.  “This happened four weeks ago.  “And yesterday’s arrest of an armed man near Justice Kavanaugh’s home – a man who told police that he intended to kill a Supreme Court justice and has been charged with attempted murder – made clear just how needed that protection is. “Mr. President, the Supreme Court security legislation in question passed the Senate unanimously four weeks ago, but has faced inexplicable delays in the House. “This should not be a partisan issue. “The Senate Democrat whip said just yesterday that the House should pass this legislation. “And I really thought yesterday’s arrest of an individual bent on assassinating a Supreme Court justice would have forced House Democrats to abandon the political games and provide this urgently needed protection. “There is no excuse for further delay. “One press report suggests that Democrats may be rethinking their opposition. “I hope that’s true. “House Democrats should abandon the political games TODAY and pass this legislation.  “Mr. President, recent reporting suggests that President Biden may be contemplating forgiving $10,000 in federal student loan debt per borrower. “This is a bad idea for so many reasons it’s difficult to know where to start. “But let me begin by pointing out the obvious – that forgiving $10,000 in federal student loan debt would do absolutely nothing to address the underlying problem, and in fact would likely make things worse. “The price of higher education has risen stratospherically in recent decades. “The cost of one year of attendance at some colleges – just one year – is more than many Americans’ yearly salaries. “And that’s a problem. “But forgiving $10,000 of student loan debt would do absolutely nothing to fix the problem of soaring tuition costs. “As I said, it would be very likely to make things worse. “What incentive would colleges have to rein in costs if they could be confident that part of their students’ bill would eventually be picked up by the federal government? “Because, of course, no one should be deceived into thinking that student loan forgiveness would be a one-time thing. “One estimate suggests that the student loan burden in this country would return to its current amount within four years of $10,000 in debt being forgiven. “Four years. “And calls to forgive more debt would undoubtedly come much sooner. “Future graduates are very likely to want the same deal that would be offered to graduates today – the wiping away of $10,000 in debt. “Which brings us to another problem – some students opting to take on unrealistic levels of debt to finance their educations. “How much greater is that problem going to be if students think that the government is likely to step in and forgive some of the debt they’re agreeing to repay? “It’s very easy to imagine a student feeling free to take on more debt than he or she otherwise would, believing that the government is likely to eventually reduce the resulting debt burden. “Mr. President, another massive problem with President Biden’s plan is, of course, its complete unfairness. “Under President Biden’s plan, an individual who just finished paying his or her student loans after years of work would not receive a penny. “Meanwhile, a student who graduated a month ago and hasn’t yet paid a dime on his or her loans could see a substantial part of his or her debt wiped away. “The president’s plan is also incredibly unfair to the tens of millions of Americans without any student loan debt, who would be asked to subsidize the student loan debt of a small percentage of Americans.“Somewhere around two-thirds of millennials have no student debt – either because they did not attend college or did not take out any loans to attend college. “The president’s plan is unfair to those who avoided loans by working their way through school or choosing a lower-cost college option. “It’s unfair to parents who worked for years to ensure that they could finance their kids’ education. “And it’s unfair to those who chose not to attend a traditional four-year college and instead trained in one of the many essential trades we depend on – from plumbing to air conditioning to broadband installation – at a significantly lower-cost community college or technical school. “Mr. President, another problem with the president’s plan is what it would teach about the sanctity of contracts. “While it may at times be ill-advised, students freely enter into the agreements they make when they take out a loan. “Should we really be teaching that agreements and contracts mean nothing?  That people can incur debt and then not have to pay it off?  “Mr. President, another important point to make here is that the average debt for undergraduate education in this country is not as crippling as it might be portrayed. “Now, there is no question that there are students out there who were encouraged to take on unrealistic levels of debt and are currently struggling with huge debt burdens made up of private as well as federal loans.  “But the average debt for an undergraduate education is somewhere around $29,000. “That’s not chump change, but it’s also not an unmanageable level of debt for the average college graduate – especially with the availability of extended repayment plans and income-driven repayment programs. “Average student loan debt rises substantially for those with advanced degrees, and there are certainly those who take on far too much debt for graduate education, but it’s also important to note that those with advanced degrees have higher – in some cases much higher – earning potential. “Doctors, for example, take on medical debt north of $190,000 on average, but once they’ve completed their education and training, they can expect to make a robust (sometimes a very robust) six figures per year – making repaying debt of that size a very feasible proposition. “Mr. President, there is no question that the cost of higher education is out of control – and that students sometimes take on unrealistic levels of debt to pay for it. “But forgiving student loan debt is not the answer, for the reasons I’ve mentioned, among others. “Instead, we should be exploring ways to drive down higher education costs. “We should also be highlighting affordable education options like our nation’s community colleges and technical schools. “These institutions – like the outstanding tech schools we have in South Dakota – provide students with associate’s degrees, certificates, apprenticeships, opportunities to learn a trade, and more. “There are also things we can do to help students pay off loans without forcing taxpayers to shoulder the burden.  “In December 2020, Congress passed a five-year version of legislation I introduced with Senator Warner to allow employers to help employees repay their loans. “Our Employer Participation in Repayment Act amends the Educational Assistance Program to permit employers to make tax-free payments on their employees’ student loans. “It’s a win for employees, who get help paying off their student loans. “And it’s a win for employers, who have a new option for attracting and retaining talented workers. “Our bill is not a cure-all, but it will certainly help ease the pain of paying back student loans for a number of Americans. “I’m pleased that it was enacted into law for a five-year period, and I hope Congress will act to make it permanent. “Another big thing we can do, of course, is make sure that graduates have access to good-paying jobs. “This is key to enabling people to pay off their debt, and we should resolve to build on the economic progress we had made pre-pandemic and focus on policies that will allow our economy to thrive. “Mr. President, Republicans are not alone in thinking that forgiving $10,000 in student loan debt is fraught with problems. “As one Democrat senator said, and I quote, ‘An across-the-board cancellation of college debt does nothing to address the absurd cost of college or fix our broken student loan program.  It offers nothing to Americans who paid off their college debts, or those who chose a lower priced college to go to as a way of avoiding going into debt or taking on debt.  It ignores, really importantly, it ignores the majority of Americans who never went to college, some of whom have debts just as staggering …’ “The New York Times editorial board – not exactly known for toeing the Republican line – noted, and I quote, ‘Canceling this debt, even in the limited amounts that the White House is considering, would set a bad precedent and do nothing to change the fact that future students will graduate with yet more debt — along with the blind hope of another, future amnesty.  Such a move is legally dubious, economically unsound, politically fraught and educationally problematic.’ “Mr. President, with inflation near a 40-year high and the president’s approval rating hitting a new low – and with Democrat prospects for November looking less than rosy – it’s not exactly surprising that the president would look toward student loan forgiveness as a way of distracting voters. “Or that some Democrats are reportedly pushing for student loan forgiveness as a way to boost their chances in November. “But I very much hope that the president will decide that temporary political gain is not a good reason to put American taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars in student loan debt that is not their own. “As the New York Times noted, the president’s plan is “legally dubious, economically unsound, politically fraught and educationally problematic.” “And I strongly encourage the president to abandon a plan that even the Democrat speaker of the House has suggested he doesn’t have the authority to implement. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink:

John Thune (R-S.D.), a longtime member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, introduced the Armed Forces Fuel Choice Act. This bipartisan legislation would require all commercial gas stations located on military bases in the United States to offer E15 fuel. This bill would also ensure that members of the Armed Forces, their families, and other eligible customers have access to this cleaner, more affordable fuel option. All gas stations within the bill’s jurisdiction would have until January 1, 2024, to begin selling the fuel, with a second compliance year permitted for sites requiring updated storage tanks.  “Our men and women in uniform should have access to the most affordable fuel options, regardless of where they are serving,” said Thune. “As gas prices hit record-highs, E15 fuel is a cost-effective and clean alternative at the pump, and this bill would ensure that military bases across the country provide it as an option for servicemen and women and their families.” “Not only do our servicemembers deserve access to more affordable fuel options, but reducing our nation’s reliance on foreign oil and depending more on homegrown biofuels can bolster our national security,” said Duckworth. “By encouraging the sale of E15 at on-base military commissary and exchange stores, the Armed Forces Fuel Choice Act will underscore that energy security is an important part of our national security and help our military families save their hard-earned money at the pump.” As of April 2022, E15 is sold at 2,667 gas stations nationwide, contributing to the more than 5,400 gas stations that sell higher blends of biofuels – above the standard E10. E15 provides consumers with a more affordable fuel alternative at the pump. This month, a gallon of ethanol was $1.42 less per gallon than unblended gasoline, a savings that is amplified in higher blends of biofuels. There are more than 180 gas stations on Air Force and Army installations in the continental United States, which dispensed more than 335 million gallons of fuel in 2020. Thune and Duckworth have long supported the use of E15 fuel as a way to leverage American agriculture in order to provide consumers with a cost-effective and clean fuel option. In March, Thune and Duckworth successfully urged President Biden to resume the year-round sale of E15 fuel in order to lower gasoline prices and reduce the United States’ reliance on foreign sources of energy. This policy went into effect on June 1. Thune and Duckworth cosponsored bipartisan legislation to make the year-round sale of E15 permanent, as well as legislation to update greenhouse gas modeling for biofuels to accurately reflect their lifecycle emissions reductions.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/thune-duckworth-introduce-bill-to-provide-military-families-with-a-cost-effective-fuel-option"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed how President Biden’s policies have helped enable the worst border crisis in our nation’s history. Thune noted that the southern border crisis is impacting communities all across the country, including those in South Dakota. Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, three weeks ago a federal judge blocked the Biden administration from lifting Title 42 COVID restrictions. “It was a welcome decision that will hopefully help stave off an additional flood of illegal immigration at our southern border. “But it’s been pretty much the only bit of good news on this front. “Because the situation at our southern border, Mr. President, is out of control. “In April, U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered 234,088 individuals attempting to cross our southern border illegally. “234,088. “That is the highest monthly number ever recorded. “The Border Patrol is stretched thin. “A recent article reported that, quote, ‘Around 60 percent of CBP agents have been assigned to process migrants, taking them away from field work.’“60 percent. “Detention facilities are overflowing.“And massive numbers of illegal immigrants are being released into the country, many of whom will never report to an immigration office as ordered. “In short, our southern border is in chaos. “And if Title 42 is lifted, the situation is almost guaranteed to become much worse. “The Department of Homeland Security has estimated that as many as 18,000 migrants per day could attempt to cross our southern border if the policy is lifted. “18,000. “Per day. “That’s more than double the number we’re currently experiencing.  “And the administration has yet to implement any plan for dealing with such a situation. “Mr. President, illegal immigration – especially the kind of out-of-control illegal immigration we’re now experiencing – has serious consequences. “Criminals, including human traffickers, drug smugglers, and gang members, regularly attempt to cross our southern border. “And the worse the situation at our border gets, the easier it is for these individuals to make their way into the United States. “And that has consequences for our entire country. “South Dakota law enforcement officials tell me that they’re seizing drugs that they can trace directly back to the cartels who smuggle these drugs across the border. “Our country is currently in the midst of a fentanyl crisis. “In fact, right now fentanyl overdose is the leading cause of death for U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 45. “And where is all this fentanyl coming from? “Most of it is being trafficked across our southern border. “And when more and more of our Customs and Border Protection agents have been pulled off the border to process migrants, it’s pretty much a guarantee that drug smugglers are having a much easier time getting their product into the country. “I mentioned that Customs and Border Protection encountered more than 234,000 individuals attempting to cross our southern border illegally in April. “But that number only reflects individuals CBP actually apprehended. “In April, Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas testified that in addition to the 1.7 million apprehensions at the southern border in fiscal year 2021, there were more than 389,000 ‘gotaways’ – individuals the Border Patrol saw but was unable to apprehend. “The Economist recently reported, and I quote, ‘One border expert estimates that less than 20 percent of people trying to cross the border undetected are stopped.’ “Mr. President, the administration has attempted to suggest that the surge in illegal immigration we’ve been experiencing since President Biden took office is in large part a function of conditions in other countries. “But, Mr. President, while these factors exist and there are legitimate asylum claims at the border, that doesn’t mean there is nothing the president can do about our out-of-control border situation. “Better border security is well within the president’s control. “He’s just not interested in putting it in place. “And his vice president has all but formally abandoned her role as border czar. “In fact, since taking office, the president has invited increased illegal immigration with the policy decisions he’s made. “On his very first day in office, President Biden rescinded the declaration of a national emergency at our southern border. “He halted construction of the border wall. “He revoked a Trump administration order that called for the government to faithfully execute our immigration laws. “And his Department of Homeland Security issued guidelines pausing deportations except under certain conditions. “All on his first day in office. “Needless to say, the effect of all this was to declare to the world that the United States’ borders were effectively open. “And of course the president’s anti-border-security efforts didn’t end there. “The president has significantly limited the ability of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to enforce immigration laws. “Deportations dropped precipitously during fiscal year 2021, as did arrests in the interior of the country. “In March, the administration rescinded a 2019 rule expanding expedited removal for individuals here illegally. “And, of course, the administration is attempting to remove Title 42 COVID-19 restrictions with no viable plan to control the resulting surge in illegal immigration. “Mr. President, President Biden has made it known that he wants to create a “fair, orderly, and humane” immigration system. “Well, he’s failing on all fronts. “I don’t need to tell anyone that the situation at the southern border right now is far from orderly. “It’s also not humane. “The president and other members of his party tend to convey an attitude that strong border security and enforcement of our nation’s immigration laws are somehow not compassionate or humane. “Well, they’re wrong. “We’re seeing the effects of the president’s anti-border-security policies at our southern border right now. “And the results are neither compassionate nor humane. “Encouraging individuals to make the oftentimes dangerous journey to our southern border in the hopes that they will be able to slip across illegally is not humane. “Encouraging families – and at times unaccompanied children – to expose themselves to the dangers of heat and the elements and human trafficking is not compassionate. “At least 557 migrants died attempting to cross the southern border during fiscal year 2021 – a record number. “How many of them were encouraged to make the journey by the president’s lax border policies? “And I haven’t even mentioned the lack of compassion and humanity the president displays for Americans affected by the illegal immigration crisis. “Straining the resources of U.S. border communities by smoothing the way for illegal immigration and cross-border criminal activity is not compassionate. “Making it easier for cartels to flood our nation with fentanyl is not humane. “Mr. President, the president – any president – has a special responsibility for our nation’s security. “And that includes securing our nation’s border. “So far President Biden has spectacularly failed to meet that responsibility. “This week, a caravan of thousands has reportedly started working its way north through Mexico, aligning with the Summit of the Americas. “It’s long past time for the president to get serious about the border crisis he has created, and this summit could be an opportunity for him to finally take action. “I hope he’ll reverse his current course before his administration’s signature accomplishment ends up being a legacy of chaos at our southern border.” Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/thune-every-state-is-a-border-state"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed President Biden’s recent op-ed in the Wall Street Journal in which he denies responsibility for his failed policies that helped create record-high inflation and out-of-control fuel costs. Thune noted that the president’s so-called “plan” to fight inflation means little to South Dakotans who continue to pay the price for his radical agenda. Thune also questioned U.S. Department of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen at a Senate Finance Committee hearing today on how President Biden’s proposed fiscal year 2023 budget would impact inflation rates. Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, the White House has apparently decided to spend June focusing on the economy. “President Biden kicked things off with an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal entitled ‘My Plan for Fighting Inflation.’ “Before he gets to the actual – quote-unquote – ‘plan,’ though, the president spends the first half of the op-ed touting his supposed economic successes. “As usual, he takes credit for the economy’s recovery from COVID-related woes – even though the recovery was well underway before he became president and was a natural result of the economy reopening after COVID shutdowns. “He touts job creation figures – without mentioning the fact that businesses are struggling to find workers to fill jobs. “He touts the number of new small business applications in 2021 – without mentioning that small business optimism is at its lowest level since April 2020, at the height of pandemic shutdowns. “And he mentions ‘millions of Americans getting jobs with better pay’ – while leaving out the fact that inflation continues to outstrip wage growth, meaning that on average Americans are experiencing a de facto pay cut.  “In all, he spends multiple paragraphs attempting to convince Americans that the economy is thriving – which I have to think feels pretty meaningless to the millions of Americans struggling with massive increases in the cost of gas, groceries, and other everyday goods.  “In fact, a poll released yesterday found that just 27 percent of Americans believe they have a good chance of improving their standard of living. “And it’s no wonder. “The president can talk about his supposed economic achievements all he wants – that means little to Americans who have seen their disposable income eaten up by price hikes or whose raise failed to even keep pace with the increase in the cost of living. “And of course the president completely omits the fact that it was his economic plans that helped create our current inflation crisis. “When President Biden took office inflation was at 1.4 percent – well within the Federal Reserve’s target inflation rate of 2 percent. “Today it is at 8.3 percent – near a 40-year high. “And how did we get from there to here? “In substantial part via the president’s so-called American Rescue Plan. “Democrats’ massive, partisan spending spree flooded the economy with unnecessary government money. “And the economy overheated as a result. “But that’s not something the president mentions when he talks about fighting inflation. “So what is the president’s so-called plan to fight inflation? “Well, after spending half the op-ed touting his supposed economic successes, the president finally gets to the plan part. “And the first part of his three-part plan involves … having somebody else address inflation. “Controlling inflation, the president says, is primarily the job of the Federal Reserve. “And he’s going to leave them alone to do that job. “The next part of the president’s ‘plan’ involves things like ‘fixing broken supply chains’ and ‘boost[ing] the productive capacity of our economy over time.’“Now, I’m a big supporter of improving our supply chains – it’s why I introduced the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, which will hopefully pass the House of Representatives and head to the president’s desk soon. “But given that the president has so far demonstrated little progress in addressing supply chain challenges, I’m not holding my breath waiting for the White House to take action.  “I’m also a big fan of boosting the productive capacity of our economy.  “My concern is that the president fails to give any examples of how he might actually do that. “He mentions high gas prices. “But instead of talking about ways to address high energy prices by unleashing American energy production, he pivots to touting his release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve – a highly temporary Band-Aid that did next to nothing to address the cause of high gas prices, except for briefly pausing their rise to record highs. “He also claims Congress could help by passing his clean-energy tax credits and investments – which he says would result in a $500 decrease in utility bills for American families. “First, nothing about the president’s clean-energy tax credits is likely to drive down energy prices, especially in the near term – and Americans can’t afford to wait.  “In fact, for Americans to take advantage of some of these credits, they would need to spend more money – on an electric car, for example, which is how the administration suggests Americans deal with these historic gas prices.  “And the president’s claim that his energy tax credits and investments would decrease utility bills for American families by $500 is 100 percent false. “And you don’t have to take my word for it. “The Washington Post Fact Checker column gave the president’s claim four Pinocchios – a rating that the Post reserves for, quote, ‘whoppers.’ “And if the president has the idea that his tax credits can somehow magically move the United States to a place where we can abandon gas and oil overnight, well, he has another think coming. “No matter how much Democrats might wish it were otherwise, the fact of the matter is that clean energy technology has simply not advanced to the point where we can replace all traditional energy sources with renewables. “And pretending that we don’t need gas and oil – or discouraging American oil and gas production – will only result in higher energy prices for American consumers. “If the president really wanted to reduce gas prices and ‘boost the productive capacity of our economy over time,’ he would embrace American energy production – including conventional energy production. “Instead, he’s doing the opposite.  “He continues to discourage domestic production of the conventional energy sources that Americans rely on. “And the result is likely to be continued high energy prices well into the future. “Finally, Mr. President, the president turns to the third part of his plan to fight inflation – reducing the deficit. “Unfortunately, it’s a little hard to take the president seriously on this issue. “The president touts a Congressional Budget Office prediction that the deficit will fall by $1.7 trillion this year. “What the president doesn’t mention is that the reason this year’s projected deficit drop looks so substantial is because Democrats inflated the deficit last year with their American Rescue Plan spending spree. “Of course the deficit will look lower this year without a massive, $1.9 trillion piece of legislation financed entirely with deficit spending.  “And I’m not getting my hopes up about future deficit drops, since many Democrats still want to use reconciliation rules to force through another big Democrat spending bill. “If they come up with a proposal that’s anything like their original Build Back Better proposal, we will undoubtedly be looking at more deficit spending.“Mr. President, one news outlet had this to say about President Biden’s op-ed and his plan to reduce the deficit, and I quote: ‘Is it really a ‘plan’ when the president points fingers?  While the president’s op-ed purports to lay out a plan for addressing inflation, a close read shows that he actually seems to be pushing the burden off on others …’ “That’s a fair assessment, Mr. President. “And unfortunately it’s pretty par for the course for President Biden. “He’s happy to take credit for positive economic numbers – even when he had nothing to do with them. “But when it comes to taking responsibility for a situation, he’s frequently nowhere to be found. “He won’t acknowledge that his own economic proposal, the American Rescue Plan, helped create our inflation crisis. “Indeed, he largely ignored the inflation crisis until it started to become absolutely necessary for him to address it if he wanted to survive politically. “And he’s displayed a similar lack of ownership of other crises on his watch. “The actions he’s taken to weaken border security and immigration enforcement have helped create an unprecedented immigration crisis at our southern border.   “But from the president’s attitude you’d barely even know that there’s a problem – much less one that he has a particular responsibility to address. “His hostile attitude toward American energy production has helped drive up gas prices and left families struggling to fill their cars. “Yet the president is ready to push off responsibility for conventional energy production to other nations – leaving our nation less secure and more vulnerable to price spikes.   “Mr. President, the president closes his op-ed by noting that, quote, ‘The economic policy choices we make today will determine whether a sustained recovery that benefits all Americans is possible.’ “The president is right about that. “Unfortunately, it’s pretty clear that the economic policy choices he is making are the wrong ones. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/thune-biden-isn-t-fooling-south-dakotans"
http://www.thune.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/op-eds?ContentRecord_id=2E4D4DF9-E212-4B32-A1F5-8B2E9DDFFEA2,"I think it’s fair to say that in South Dakota, the unofficial start of summer begins when the temperature hits – and stays – over 65 degrees ... give or take. It’s been another long winter and spring, and I think we are all looking forward to some warmer, sunnier days. Few things can top summers in South Dakota, and some of my fondest childhood memories are from our summer road trips to the Black Hills. We’re blessed to call South Dakota home, and South Dakotans quickly win the hearts of all who travel to the state. We are home to the Corn Palace, the Missouri River, the Badlands, Wall Drug, the Black Hills, the Crazy Horse Memorial, Mount Rushmore, and more. As they say, there is something for everyone.   With the school year officially wrapped up, families are not only starting to fine-tune their summer schedules, but they’re having to revisit their budgets, too. Everything from sports camps, summer school, carpool duty, road trips, and nearly everything else in between – whatever keeps the kids busy – may cost more this summer due to rising gas prices and soaring inflation. For lots of folks, a summer road trip is a no-brainer, but the price hikes hitting Americans threaten to shorten plans or keep travelers home altogether. As I travel throughout the state, I continue to hear from South Dakotans who tell me about the tremendous toll these high fuel costs have on their household budgets. The national average for a gallon of gas leapt over $4 in May and seems to climb higher each day. In fact, the national average for a gallon of gas is double what it was the day President Biden took his oath of office in January 2021. Heading into peak travel season, this means families are reprioritizing their spending and having to make tough decisions on whether or not they can afford to spend the day driving through the Badlands or having enough groceries to get through the week. I am frequently asked what can be done to lower these egregious fuel costs. The short answer: an all-of-the-above energy strategy. Since taking office, President Biden has pursued a radical agenda that is hostile to conventional energy. The president cancelled the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in office and he almost immediately froze new oil and gas leases on federal lands – sending a clear signal to oil and gas producers that his administration would be reluctant to work with them to increase American energy production. As we are seeing now, the only effect of curbing conventional energy production is to either force Americans to pay more for their energy or rely more on foreign sources for oil, like the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The more we rely on energy from abroad, the more vulnerable Americans are to energy price spikes and global shortages. The ongoing energy crisis hasn’t spurred the Biden administration to take action beyond raiding our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which only minimally stunted rising prices. However, I am pleased that the administration recently permitted the summertime sale of E15 fuel, which went into effect on June 1. I have long advocated for the year-round sale of E15 as a way to offer American drivers a more affordable and cleaner option at the gas pump. Earlier this year, I led a bipartisan letter to the president calling for this very policy. It’s a step in the right direction, but President Biden needs to get serious about leveraging all American energy solutions. Failure to take meaningful action to reverse rising energy prices will cast a long shadow over the summer and our economy. As families all across the country have to dig deeper into their pocketbooks in order to fill up their tanks and make ends meet, I will continue to press the administration to abandon its failed energy policies and put our country back on track to restore our energy security. Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/rising-temperatures-rising-prices"

John Thune (R-S.D.) and Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) today joined 46 of their colleagues in sending a letter to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) pledging to block any bill that would undermine pro-life protections, including the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits taxpayer funding for abortion. Last year, Thune and Rounds introduced legislation that would make the Hyde Amendment permanent. “We write to express our unwavering support for the Hyde Amendment and all other longstanding pro-life protections,” the senators wrote. “For more than 45 years, the Hyde Amendment has ensured that taxpayer dollars are not used to fund abortions, saving the lives of nearly 2.5 million preborn children.

For more than 45 years, the Hyde Amendment has ensured that taxpayer dollars are not used to fund abortions, saving the lives of nearly 2.5 million preborn children. As you know, the Hyde Amendment is supported by both a substantial majority of the American public and a bipartisan majority of sitting United States Senators, and was most recently signed into law by President Biden in Public Law 117-103. Nevertheless, President Biden's budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 once again proposes to eliminate the Hyde Amendment and other existing pro-life protections, while also increasing taxpayer funding for the abortion industry at home and abroad, including through massive funding increases for the Title X family planning program. On February 5, 2021, we wrote to you that “[w]e are committed to vote against the advancement of any legislation that would eliminate or weaken the Hyde Amendment or any other current-law pro-life protections, or otherwise undermine existing Federal pro-life policy.” We firmly renew this commitment for FY 2023. We are united in our resolve to preserve more than 45 years of consensus against taxpayer funding for abortion. We urge you to start where we finished by making a baseline commitment to maintain the same pro-life protections that were included in Public Law 117-103, and to eschew any taxpayer-funded giveaways that benefit the multi-billion-dollar abortion industry. The American people, born and preborn, deserve nothing less. Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/thune-rounds-defend-pro-life-protections-vow-to-block-taxpayer-funded-abortions"

Being home is always a trip down memory lane. When I think back to my childhood, my first memories are of my parents, Pat and Harold Thune, and of growing up with my three brothers and sister. And boy, we were lucky kids to have my parents at the helm.My mom was a wonderful, loving, eternally optimistic mother, who spent most of my growing up years as our high school librarian. She was responsible for making sure we Thune kids got some culture – whether we wanted it or not. She insisted that we all learn to play the piano, encouraged me to join the swing choir, and in the summers, she even made us come inside for an hour every day to read.My dad was our hero – a Division I basketball star and World War II combat pilot. He was a teacher at my high school, a coach, the athletic director, and the bus driver. Between him and my mom as the librarian, we Thune kids were practically never away from our parents’ watchful eyes. I am so grateful to have had my dad’s coaching – in sports and in life. On the court, my dad taught us players to play as a team. He didn’t like ball hogs or people who were in it for personal glory. He believed your job as a member of a team was to make the people around you better. If somebody else was in a better position to take the shot, you always made the extra pass. It’s an attitude I’ve tried to carry with me throughout my life. Being back in Murdo also made me reflect on just how lucky I was to grow up in a small town – and small-town South Dakota in particular. The values I saw growing up in Murdo are reflected in towns all across our state. In Murdo I learned the character of South Dakotans – the work ethic, the commitment to freedom coupled with a belief in personal responsibility, and a sense of responsibility to the broader community. South Dakotans cherish their freedoms – and they also believe that with freedom comes responsibility. They have a deep appreciation for the Founders’ vision that has allowed us to enjoy such freedom – and for the sacrifices that have been required to secure it. With that, of course, comes an expectation that each generation has to do its part to pay freedom’s price and protect all that we have been given.The South Dakota values I learned growing up helped shape my political philosophy: my belief that government should be limited and that it is best when it’s closest to the people. If a matter can be handled at the state or local level, it should be. I learned that the legacy of the past is something to be cherished and preserved – while leaving room for change and adaptation when needed – and that freedom is a sacred gift, and one that must be defended. And, finally, while government is necessary, government is not where we should look for salvation.The legacy of growing up in South Dakota is a precious one. I am deeply grateful for those years in Murdo and for the privilege of living in the Mount Rushmore State. South Dakota is the best state in the world to live, work, and raise a family. From Sioux Falls to Rapid City and every town in between, the communities and families that make up our great state are truly one-of-a-kind. I am proud to call South Dakota my home, and it is my great honor to represent the people of South Dakota in the United States Senate. Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/hometown-values"

John Thune (R-S.D.), a longtime member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, today questioned U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack at a hearing on the challenges facing farmers, families, and rural communities.On spring weather conditions (excerpt):“In South Dakota, we have producers dealing with difficult weather conditions this spring, including – depending on where they are at in the state – severe drought, excess moisture, and significant storm damage. I would urge USDA to provide expedited assistance to those affected producers.” On proper forest management (excerpt):“Proper forest management is as important now as it’s ever been, and it plays a critical role in maintaining forest health and reducing the threat of catastrophic wildfires. In the Black Hills, the forest products industry has been a reliable partner in the proper management of the forest. Unfortunately, last year, a saw mill in the Black Hills closed due to lack of timber availability, and I am concerned that more mill closures could be imminent if the Forest Service does not take action to maintain the forest’s timber sale program. “Numerous concerns have been raised with the Forest Service’s publication of a general technical report on the forest’s timber sale program and the agency’s failure to uphold its commitment to work collaboratively with industry and state and local officials through consideration of the science-based recommendations from the formal Black Hills National Forest Advisory Board and state foresters. Following the general technical report, we have seen a drastic reduction in timber sales and the loss of milling infrastructure that is critical in meeting the goals outlined in the Forest Service’s 10-year wildfire reduction strategy.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/thune-advocates-for-south-dakota-producers-and-proactive-forest-management-in-the-black-hills"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today spoke on the Senate floor about growing up in South Dakota and the values that make it the greatest place in America live, work, and raise a family. Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, before I begin, I want to express my sorrow at the terrible shooting in Texas on Tuesday that claimed the lives of two teachers and 19 schoolchildren. “Like a lot of Americans, I cannot imagine the anguish these children’s parents are facing right now, as they grieve for sons and daughters whom they will never again drive to school, or welcome home at the end of the day.   “I pray that the Lord will be with them in their suffering, and that they will receive the comfort and strength that they need.  “My prayers are with the entire Uvalde community – the families of those killed, the injured, the teachers and students who suffered such terror, the medical and law enforcement personnel who responded, and all those reeling from this terrible attack. “Mr. President, this past weekend I headed to Murdo, South Dakota – the small town of around 500 people where I grew up.  “Needless to say, any trip to Murdo brings back a lot of memories. “First and foremost those memories are of my parents, Pat and Harold Thune, and of growing up with my three brothers and sister. “We were lucky kids to have my parents. “My mom was a wonderful, loving, eternally optimistic mother, who spent most of my growing up years as our high school librarian. “She was responsible for making sure we Thune kids got some culture – whether we wanted it or not. “She was the one who made sure we got an introduction to music and learned how to play the piano. “With her encouragement, I even joined the swing choir – although I’ll spare you, Mr. President, from any recitals.  “In the summers, she’d make us come inside for an hour every day to read. “I didn’t always want to come inside on those beautiful summer days. “At the time, I would have much preferred to keep shooting hoops with the basket my dad had attached to a pole in our backyard. “But today I am grateful for every minute she made us spend with books. “My dad – he was our hero, a Division I basketball star and World War II combat pilot. “He was a teacher at my high school.  And a coach.  And the athletic director.  Oh, and the bus driver. “So between him and my mom as the librarian, we Thune kids were practically never away from our parents’ watchful eyes. “But I am so grateful to have had my dad’s coaching – in sports and in life. “My dad taught us players to play

better position to take the shot, you always made the extra pass. “You didn’t try to pad your own statistics. “You played for the good of the team. “It’s an attitude I’ve tried to carry with me throughout my life. “My parents gave us Thune kids a strong set of values – and an inheritance of faith. “In good times and bad, faith was their anchor, and the Holy Scriptures their roadmap.  “And I am grateful that they taught us Who to turn to in times of trouble. “Mr. President, being in Murdo reminded me of my parents, as it always does. “It also made me reflect on just how lucky I was to grow up in a small town – and small-town South Dakota in particular. “It’s true that growing up in a small town meant that my parents had heard all about any of the Thune kids’ misdemeanors before we even made it home. “But even with that little drawback, small-town life was wonderful. “In Murdo, you know everyone, and everyone knows you. “And that gave us a sense of community and belonging that we carry to this day. “Growing up in Murdo also taught us just how much we are all connected. “South Dakotans are independent people, but we also rely on our neighbors when the going gets tough. “And the going can get tough. “But in Murdo, we knew that if a roof collapsed under the weight of snow, or a windstorm came through and wiped out a barn, or we lost a friend or family member, the whole community would rally around to help. “Small-town life has a beautiful simplicity.“On summer nights, my dad would take us to get ice cream cones and then we’d drive down to the White River.  “We’d roll the windows down to feel the breeze and watch the sun drop below the horizon. “No staring at iPhones or checking likes on social media. “Those were idyllic evenings. “And moments like those kept us connected to what really mattered – our family, our community, the land. “Mr. President, the values I saw reflected growing up in Murdo are reflected in towns all across our state. “In Murdo I learned the character of South Dakotans – the work ethic, the commitment to freedom coupled with a belief in personal responsibility, the sense of responsibility to the broader community. “Agriculture, of course, is the lifeblood of South Dakota. “But it is a hard way of life. “It’s backbreaking work in all weathers – always with the risk that all your work can be wiped out in moments by a storm. “And anyone who grows up on a farm or ranch knows that everybody has to pull their weight, or the farm or ranch just won’t survive. “And I think that grounding in agriculture has helped give South Dakotans their reputation for having a strong work ethic and a commitment to getting the job done. “And I’m not kidding about the reputation. “As a senator, I’ve traveled to a number of places around the world, and I regularly meet people – often military members – who talk about the work ethic of the South Dakotans they know. “I’m pretty sure it’s that work ethic and sense of personal responsibility that is responsible for the fact that South Dakota has always punched above its weight when it comes to military service – as well as the patriotism that runs strongly through the South Dakota character. “South Dakotans cherish their freedoms – and they also believe that with freedom comes responsibility. “And they have a deep appreciation for the Founders’ vision that has allowed us to enjoy such freedom – and for the sacrifices that have been required to secure it. “And with that comes an expectation that each generation has to do its part to pay freedom’s price and protect all that we have been given. “The South Dakota values I learned growing up helped shape my political philosophy: my belief that government should be limited, and that it is best when

for change and adaptation when needed.  “That freedom is a sacred gift, and one that must be defended – and that with freedom comes responsibility. “And, finally, that while government is necessary, government is not where we should look for salvation. “Mr. President, the legacy of growing up in South Dakota is a precious one. “We didn’t have much money, but we were very rich in the things that mattered. “I am deeply grateful for those years in Murdo – for the teachers and coaches and others in the community who invested in me and for everyone who continues to make it feel like home – and for the privilege of living in the Mount Rushmore State.   “And it is my very great honor to represent the people of South Dakota in the United States Senate. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/south-dakota-values"

John Thune (R-S.D.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and James Lankford (R-Okla.) today introduced the Reverse Entry for Migrant Offenders and Violence Expulsion (REMOVE) Act, legislation that would close a loophole that currently allows noncitizens convicted of kidnapping or sexual assault to remain in the United States. “Illegal immigrants, especially those who commit heinous crimes such as kidnapping or sexual assault, cannot be allowed to remain in our country,” said Thune. “These are inherently violent crimes, and we must do everything we can to ensure that our kids and grandkids are safe in our communities. I’m proud to lead this common-sense legislation that would close an egregious loophole that permits criminals to stay in our country.”  “Criminals, human traffickers, and terrorists are taking advantage of the crisis at the southern border to carry out crimes,” said Dr. Cassidy. “Those here illegally who commit sexual assault or kidnapping should face deportation. It’s common sense. Our bill ensures we hold criminals accountable and keep Americans safe.” “Denying entry to migrants convicted of kidnapping and sexual assault is necessary to help keep our communities safe,” said Moran. “This legislation will make certain that criminals with these records are kept out of the United States.” “Those who come across our border illegally and commit violent crimes like kidnapping and sexual assault should be deported,” said Tillis. “Current law does not clearly establish that human smuggling and kidnapping are grounds for deportation, and it’s time that Congress corrects this problem. I am proud to introduce this commonsense legislation with my colleagues because human smuggling, kidnapping, and assault by dangerous illegal immigrants happen every day, and this legislation is way overdue.” “Last year, I confronted the Biden Administration’s definition of ‘violent crimes’ in regard to deportation orders. Their new rules limited the number of people that could be deported, including some sex offenders who were found guilty of sex crimes while in our nation illegally,” said Lankford. “Every Oklahoman believes that an illegal immigrant who is a kidnapper or commits sexual assault should be deported. I am mortified that there is even a question in the Biden Administration if all sex offenders should be deported. Our bill gives that question a firm answer; yes, sex offenses are violent crimes and should lead to immediate deportation for those found guilty. Period.” Over the years, portions of the federal criminal code have been ruled to be unconstitutionally vague by the Supreme Court. Criminal defendants have successfully sought relief from long sentences on the grounds that the statutory definitions of their crimes gave insufficient notice of their actions’ consequences. In 2018, the Supreme Court ruled in Sessions v. Dimaya that a residual or “catchall” provision of the criminal code (18 USC § 16(b)) incorporated into the Immigration and Nationality Act was unconstitutionally vague. The result in Sessions v. Dimaya was that a noncitizen criminal defendant convicted under 16(b) could not be deported, which the REMOVE Act seeks to correct.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/thune-cassidy-moran-tillis-lankford-introduce-legislation-to-close-loophole-that-allows-illegal-immigrant-criminals-to-remain-in-the-united-states"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today joined his colleagues in introducing the Elimination of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission Act. This legislation would eliminate the commission that is tasked with identifying facilities that should be consolidated or realigned and protect the several VA facilities across South Dakota that have been so designated. In March, Thune led the South Dakota delegation in sending a letter to VA Secretary Denis McDonough upon the release of the VA’s recommendations for the AIR Commission, which, if implemented, would significantly reduce services in Fort Meade, Hot Springs, Sioux Falls, and Wagner. “Ensuring that South Dakota veterans have accessible, high-quality care is a top priority for me, which is why I’ve worked hard over the years to defend and expand VA facilities and services across the state,” said Thune. “The VA’s process of developing its recommendations for the AIR Commission relied on faulty and limited assessments based on data that fails to accurately reflect the current realities of veterans in South Dakota. We cannot let the VA extinguish the important progress we have made to protect our VA facilities, which is why I will continue to fight tooth and nail against any proposals that seek to blindly reduce veterans’ access to care in our state.” Background on the AIR Commission:  The legislation was led by U.S. Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and, in addition to Thune, was co-sponsored by U.S. Sens. Maggie Hassan and Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.).   The delegation’s decade-long fight to save the Hot Springs VA culminated in October 2020 when then-VA Secretary Robert Wilkie notified them that the VA had formally rescinded its earlier record of decision to realign the VA Black Hills Health Care System, which would have significantly reduced services at the Hot Springs VA Medical Center.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/thune-joins-bipartisan-bill-to-protect-south-dakota-va-facilities"

John Thune (R-S.D.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), and Mark Warner (D-Va.) introduced legislation that would simplify the way in which retired first responders can make tax-free withdrawals from their retirement accounts to go toward qualifying health insurance premiums. Under current law, retirement plans must make direct payments to a qualifying insurance plan in order for the premium payment to be excluded from a retiree’s gross income – up to $3,000 per year. This bipartisan bill would make the requirement optional and allow retirement plans to instead make distributions directly to the retiree who can then transmit the payment to the qualifying insurance plan while obtaining the tax benefit. “We owe a great debt of gratitude to our retired police officers, firefighters, and other first responders who dedicated their lives to protecting our communities and keeping our friends, families, and neighbors across South Dakota safe,” said Thune. “Currently, it is extremely difficult for retired first responders to utilize an existing benefit that helps cover certain health care expenses, which is why I introduced this legislation that would ensure these retirees can make tax-free withdrawals from their pension and direct those amounts to qualifying insurance premiums.” “Too often fire fighters are forced to retire early and have no access to affordable health insurance. We owe it to our fire fighters and EMS providers to help them access quality healthcare after making a career’s worth of physical and mental sacrifices for our communities,” said Edward Kelly, general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters. “This legislation ensures our retired fire fighters can access their hard-earned retirement income to pay for health insurance costs. The IAFF thanks Senators Brown, Thune, and Warner for their commitment to supporting our retirees and helping them to maintain a healthy and secure retirement.” “In 2006, Congress enacted the HELPS Retirees Act, which provided a modest tax benefit to help retired public safety officers afford health insurance by allowing the use, on a pre-tax basis, of up to $3,000 annually from their pension funds health care and long-term care insurance,” said Patrick Yoes, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police. “However, too many public safety officers were ineligible or lost their eligibility for this benefit because of the law’s ‘direct pay’ requirement. This means that the public pension system must pay the health or long-term care insurance company directly in order to exclude these payments from the employee’s gross income. Officers whose pensions are or came to be administered by third parties could not take advantage of this tax break. We are very grateful to Senators Brown and Thune for introducing legislation which repeals this direct pay requirement and provides a modest increase to the benefit.” The direct payment that retirement plans must comply with under current law in order for retired first responders to exclude the withdrawal from gross income has proven to be an overly burdensome requirement. This legislation would alleviate this burden on retirement plans, including the South Dakota Retirement System, and allow them to make distributions to retired first responders without rendering the retiree ineligible for the tax exclusion. Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/thune-introduces-legislation-to-help-retired-first-responders-cover-health-care-expenses"

From him I learned the patriotism and selflessness and humility that characterized the Greatest Generation – and that continue to characterize our military members today. Throughout the years, I have been privileged to meet many South Dakota veterans and current servicemembers, including the airmen at Ellsworth Air Force Base and members of the South Dakota Army and Air National Guard. It is the honor of my life to represent them in Congress.South Dakota has a proud legacy of military service, but, as many know, our state’s role in our nation’s security has not always been guaranteed. The fight to save Ellsworth from closure in 2005 is well-told, but it has forever shaped my approach to making sure Ellsworth’s future is never again questioned. From the day the base was saved to today, my focus has always been on ensuring that it gets everything it needs to retain its strength. This includes working to ensure that the B-1s remain a responsive and lethal component of Global Strike Command while simultaneously preparing for the future B-21 mission so the base can continue to serve as one of our nation’s most essential military assets for decades to come.Last year, I worked to ensure that the National Defense Authorization Act contained not only full funding for B-21 aircraft development, but full funding for the first of many equipment and support facilities that will be needed for the stealth and nuclear mission at Ellsworth, including a facility to restore the plane’s low-observable coating, a wash rack and maintenance hangar, mission operations and training facilities, and an expanded flight simulator space. Now, I am advocating for the timely construction of the weapons generation facility and radio frequency facility that will be essential to ensuring the 28th Bomb Wing is able to fully conduct the nuclear and stealth B-21 mission. Ellsworth is well on its way to becoming “Raider Country,” and there’s still more new construction on the way.The work doesn’t stop there. I am fighting to ensure that the Air Force is able to invest in unmanned systems to complement the mission of the B-21. I also intend to introduce a measure for this year’s National Defense Authorization Act to establish a pilot program that would develop “dynamic airspace” – a concept of efficient air traffic scheduling and airspace boundaries that evolve as exercises or other flights progress. Dynamic airspace would better enable the Pentagon to meet training requirements for 5th generation aircraft like the B-21, which need larger volumes of airspace to accommodate longer engagement distances, and it will build off the successful expansion of the Powder River Training Complex that includes a significant portion of West River.The foundation of Ellsworth’s success isn’t modern equipment and facilities, it’s the men and women in uniform who support the mission. That’s why I’m also focused on making sure Ellsworth has the resources it needs to take care of our military families, particularly as more of them move into the area ahead of the B-21 mission. This includes making sure that ample housing is available and that the Douglas School District is able to provide sufficient classroom space for current and arriving students. These are critical quality-of-life issues for our military families – matters that heavily influence whether airmen want to stay in the service or leave for the private sector, where many of their skills are in high demand. We know that South Dakota is an incredible place to live, work, and raise a family, and it should be no different for those serving at Ellsworth.I am more grateful than I can say for all the men and women in South Dakota and across our great nation who have answered our country’s call. It is because of them that we live in peace and safety, and the freedom that we enjoy is secured by their sacrifice.May God bless all our military men and women and keep them safe as they stand on watch for us.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/a-grateful-nation"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today expressed his sincere gratitude to all of the airmen at Ellsworth Air Force Base, members of the South Dakota Army and Air National Guard, and all of the men and women of the United States military for their service and dedication to our country. Thune discussed the importance of ensuring that Ellsworth has the resources it needs to continue serving as one of our nation’s most essential military assets as it prepares for the B-21 mission. Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, this Saturday will be Armed Forces Day, a day set aside to honor the members of the United States military. “I first came to know the military through my dad Harold, a fighter pilot who flew Hellcats off the deck of the USS Intrepid during World War II. “From him I learned the patriotism and selflessness and humility that characterized the Greatest Generation – and that continue to characterize our military members today. “As a member of Congress, I’ve come to know our military through the men and women of the South Dakota Army and Air National Guard, and through the airmen of Ellsworth Air Force Base. “As I’ve said before, I may be biased, but I am convinced that South Dakota has the most outstanding Guard troops in the nation. “As usual, they’ve been busy over the past year. “On Saturday the National Guard welcomed home Guardsmen from a deployment to Djibouti, where our Guard has recently had a heavy rotation to support operations in the Horn of Africa, and honored Guard members who are headed to a deployment in Europe.  “Guard members helped with the response to last week’s severe storms in South Dakota. “They deployed to the border to reinforce an overstretched Border Patrol. “They deployed to Guantanamo Bay.  “The 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field completed NOBLE EAGLE deployments across the country and honed their alert mission. “Just a few weeks ago, 30 National Guard members traveled to Suriname, where they trained military personnel and provided support to local communities. “The list goes on. “South Dakota National Guard members play an essential role in military and humanitarian operations both here at home and abroad. “And I am tremendously grateful for their service. “Mr. President, my acquaintance with Ellsworth began during my time in the House of Representatives, but I really got to know the base shortly after I became a senator. “Just a few months into my first term in the Senate, Ellsworth found itself targeted for closure by the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. “And the South Dakota congressional delegation and state and community leaders immediately mobilized to defend the base.  “I’m pretty sure I attended every single BRAC hearing in D.C. that summer – whether Ellsworth was on the agenda or not. “I just wanted to make sure that I was there in case the chance to advocate for Ellsworth arose. “Many thought South Dakota might not have the clout to make this stand – that we didn’t wield enough influence. “We were only given about 12 percent odds of pulling through. “But we were determined that we weren’t going to lose Ellsworth. “And in August, we succeeded in having Ellsworth removed from the closure list. “But we didn’t stop there. “We got right to work on building up the base so that we would never again find ourselves in the same position. “In 2007, we saw the Air Force Financial Services Center open at Ellsworth. “2011 saw the arrival of the 89th Attack Squadron and its command and control stations for MQ-9 Reapers. “And in 2015 a decade-long effort paid off with the expansion of the training airspace for the base. “The Powder River Training Complex is now the largest training airspace in the continental United States. “And it’s undoubtedly partly thanks to this airspace that Ellsworth received the news last June that we had officially been named Main Operating Base 1 for the future B-21 bomber – ‘Home of the Raider.’ “This designation not only means that Ellsworth will be the first base to host the B-21 Raider, but that it will also host the formal training unit and the first operational squadron.   “Once operational, the B-21 Raider will be a critical part of our nation’s long-range strike capabilities and nuclear deterrent well into the future. “And I am incredibly proud that South Dakota and Ellsworth were chosen to serve as the first base for the B-21s. “My focus now is on ensuring that Ellsworth gets everything it needs for its new mission, so that it can continue to serve as one of our nation’s most essential military assets for decades to come. “To that end, I worked to ensure that last year’s National Defense Authorization Act contained not only full funding for B-21 development, but full funding for the first of many equipment and support facilities that will be needed for the B-21 mission at Ellsworth, including a low-observable coating restoration facility, a wash rack and maintenance hangar, an expanded flight simulator facility, and more. “Ellsworth is well on its way to becoming ‘Raider Country.’ “And there’s more new construction on the way. “Currently I am working to secure additional funding for the low-observable coating restoration facility, as well as funding for two additional construction projects – a weapons generation facility and a radio frequency facility – that will be needed to ensure Ellsworth is able to fully conduct the nuclear and stealth B-21 mission. “I am also working to ensure that the Air Force is able to invest in unmanned systems to complement the mission of the B-21. “And I continue to work to enhance the Powder River Training Complex. “I intend to introduce a measure for this year’s National Defense Authorization Act to establish a pilot program that would develop ‘dynamic airspace’ – the more efficient scheduling of airspace and airspace boundaries that evolve as exercises or other flights progress. “I believe dynamic airspace will better enable the Pentagon to meet training requirements for 5th generation aircraft like the B-21, which need larger volumes of airspace to accommodate longer engagement distances. “However, dynamic airspace should benefit all users of the National Airspace System, from commercial planes and general aviation to unmanned aircraft systems and space launches. “I look forward to working with the leaders of the Armed Services and Commerce Committees to advance this proposal. “I’m also focused on ensuring that Ellsworth has the resources it needs to take care of our military families, particularly as more families move into the area with the impending arrival of the B-21 mission. “That includes making sure that ample housing is available and that the Douglas School District is able to integrate and support Air Force members’ children and provide sufficient classroom space. These are critical quality-of-life issues for our military men and women – matters that heavily influence whether they want to stay in the service or leave for the private sector, where many of their skills are in high demand. “And I am committed to ensuring that our military families are able to thrive at Ellsworth. “Finally, as always, I continue to focus on making sure that our B-1s have the resources they need. “We still have a ways to go before our B-1s are fully replaced by the B-21, and I am committed to ensuring that our B-1s remain a responsive and lethal component of Global Strike Command until their mission is over. “Mr. President, on Armed Forces Day and every day, I am more grateful than I can say for our Ellsworth airmen, our South Dakota Army and Air National Guard, and all the men and women of the United States military. “It is because of them that we live in peace and safety.  “And the freedom that we enjoy is secured by their sacrifice. “May God bless all our military men and women and keep them safe as they stand on watch for us. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/thune-armed-forces-day-recognizes-service-sacrifice-of-americans-in-the-u-s-military"

John Thune (R-S.D.) joined his colleagues in urging the U.S. Department of Labor to oppose the Biden administration’s proposal to make substantial, misguided, and burdensome changes to the wage regulations issued under the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts (DBRA), a federal labor law that is already overly complicated and costly for the construction industry to comply with. The senators underscored the consequences of these proposed changes, which would unfairly benefit unions and further inflate wages and regulatory burdens at the cost of taxpayers, leading to higher construction costs and higher housing prices. “The current proposal, by reverting to regulations and policies last employed in the Carter Administration, represents a massive step backward,” the senators wrote. “Further, it fails to adopt necessary reforms recommended by government watchdogs, only exacerbating deficiencies in wage survey and data collection, further inflating construction costs at great detriment to the taxpayer.”“By repealing the Reagan-era reforms and ignoring the urgent recommendations of government watchdogs to truly modernize the DBRA, the Administration is willfully promulgating fundamentally misguided policy that for decades has resulted in grossly inflated wages, contravening the original intent of Davis-Bacon,” continued the senators.“With inflation already reducing the worth of the bill, the proposal contained within this NPRM will only further limit the number of infrastructure projects the federal government can pursue, greatly inflate the cost to the taxpayer of necessary infrastructure projects at rates far above market value, all while imposing boundless administrative and paperwork burdens on small to mid-size contractors. We therefore urge the Administration to refrain from pursuing this misguided proposal,” the senators concluded.The letter was led by U.S. Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and was also signed by U.S. Sens. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.).In March, Thune introduced the Housing Supply Expansion Act, legislation that would address the shortage of affordable housing options across the nation by making targeted reforms to requirements under the DBRA. These reforms would reduce labor costs and administrative burdens on construction contractors, which would free up capital that could be redirected toward building additional affordable housing. The DBRA – as it stands – can disincentivize the creation of new affordable housing due to the high costs it places on construction contractors.Read the full letter here.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/thune-urges-dol-to-oppose-biden-administration-s-efforts-to-adopt-costly-labor-rules"

John Thune (R-S.D.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), members of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, introduced the Agriculture Innovation Act, legislation that would strengthen agricultural data collection and research to connect farmers and ranchers with the most effective conservative practices. The legislation would improve the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) secure and confidential data collection procedures for assessing how various conservation and production practices increase crop yield, bolster soil health, and otherwise boost productivity. USDA currently manages and stores valuable producer data, but the data can be better utilized to bolster producers’ understanding of which conservation practices help reduce risk and increase profitability. “South Dakota farmers and ranchers are familiar with the many challenges that accompany their way of life,” said Thune. “Among them is measuring the economic value that conservation practices have on production, especially as the agriculture community tries to reduce risk and increase productivity amid a global food security crisis. That’s why Congress should help producers and trusted researchers – like land-grant universities – better utilize USDA’s data to more effectively identify the conservation practices that would best improve productivity on farm and ranch operations.” “As the economic backbone of rural communities across our state, farmers and producers deserve the most up-to-date resources possible to inform their operations,” said Klobuchar. “This bipartisan legislation will provide farmers with better access to comprehensive USDA data, ensuring they are able to use the most effective conservation practices for boosting productivity and improving crop yield.” “It can be difficult for producers to see that soil health and conservation agriculture really pay off,” said Levi Neuharth, chairman of the South Dakota Soil Health Coalition. “With the Agriculture Innovation Act, the ability to make use of the extensive, real-world data that USDA already collects to show that healthy land management practices make producers more profitable and more resilient to volatile changes in weather and the markets would be helpful.”  “Earlier this year, USDA announced a billion-dollar investment in Climate Smart Commodities. We need to update the way USDA gathers and analyzes data to make sure this investment is being used effectively,” said Keith Alverson, farmer and owner, K2 Farms Inc. “The Agriculture Innovation Act is an important step in ensuring farmers are equipped with the right tools to feed America, conserve the land, and strengthen our bottom line.” The Agriculture Innovation Act would: The legislation has been endorsed by the National Corn Growers Association, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, Natural Resources Defense Council, AGree Coalition, Ducks Unlimited, BPC Action, National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, Pheasants Forever, American Farmland Trust, Environmental Defense Fund, American Sportfishing Association, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, Izaak Walton League of America, the National Wildlife Federation, American Fly Fishing Trade Association, American Woodcock Association, Angler Action Foundation, Archery Trade Association, Danone North America, Mishra and Roznik, Arizona State University Morrison School of Agribusiness, National Deer Association, Quail Forever, Ruffed Grouse Society, Supporters of Agriculture Research, Unilever United States, and the Wildlife Management Institute. Thune and Klobuchar recently introduced legislation to improve the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) by bolstering access to grazing, providing more enrollment options to producers, and addressing CRP implementation issues following the 2018 farm bill. Thune, who has helped write four farm bills throughout his time in Congress, will continue introducing farm bill proposals ahead of the current bill’s expiration, which is set for September 2023.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/thune-klobuchar-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-connect-producers-with-effective-conservation-practices"

For decades, the FDA has been the gold standard for approving and regulating medical products and food. Yet this year, the actions of the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) has raised questions regarding its ability to fulfill its core oversight responsibilities. The safety of, and access to, infant formula should be among CFSAN’s highest priorities, as this food is vital for the growth and development of infants. To this end, we write to request a response from FDA on its activities that may have contributed to the exacerbated infant formula shortages and specific questions in the following paragraphs. It is our responsibility as U.S. Senators to do everything with our authority to hold the FDA accountable and legislate in areas that will enable the agency to meet the expectations of the American people.  Our hearts and prayers are with the parents and their families whose babies tragically died due to infant formula bacterial contamination. We understand and want to support the FDA in thoroughly evaluating all reported and potential infant formula contaminations. However, based on the timeline and where we are today, it is unclear as to why nearly three months have gone by and the FDA has failed to expeditiously conduct and conclude its investigation. On February 17, Abbott Nutrition initiated a proactive, voluntary recall of three of its powdered formulas manufactured at their facility in Michigan following four consumer complaints of potential Cronobacter bacteria contamination. The following day, FDA warned consumers not to use these products. On April 15, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded the bacteria isolated from two of the sick infants and the Michigan facility had no connection. And as of last week, no connection has been found, yet the facility remains idle.We are also concerned as to why FDA leadership failed to be proactive in mitigating the shortage crisis parents are now facing. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed many vulnerabilities across all sectors of industry, and our food supply chain was woefully unprepared to handle challenges here and from foreign partners. Infant formula supplies at local grocery stores were relatively stable for the first half of 2021. The out-of-stock percentage started to climb steadily in the later half and continued to worsen throughout this year. Abbott Nutrition’s voluntary recall exacerbated the shortage, and yet no policies were taken to mitigate the sharp increases to the current out-of-stock 43 percent the Administration is now scrambling to address. It’s also concerning that FDA and key officials in the Administration did not anticipate this crisis or take action within days following Abbott Nutrition’s voluntary recall considering the company holds 48.1 percent of the U.S. market in infant formula.Families are getting to the brink of pursuing unsafe and potentially dangerous options to feed their infants including homemade infant formula. And physicians are, once again, running defense on misinformation due to a lack of federal action to get the word out on safe alternatives. In addition, the shortage will trickle into other federal agencies, diverting and stretching resources from other crises like illicit fentanyl. In April, the U.S. Customers and Border Protection (CBP) seized $30,000 worth of unapproved infant formula across 17 shipments at the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania port of entry.Based on the timeline, it is unclear why federal health agencies have not been able to complete this investigation in a more expeditious manner or plan ahead to mitigate this additional supply chain disruption. Therefore we respectfully request your responses to the following questions:The shortage, felt by all families in need, is disproportionately impacting vulnerable populations. As you know, Medicaid is a major source of coverage for low-income vulnerable populations including pregnant women, infants, and children. In 2020, Medicaid covered 42 percent of births. In addition, 49 percent of infants born in the U.S. participate in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. While breastfeeding has been on the rise, many infants rely on formula partially or as their sole source of food.The FDA must do everything within its statutory authority to ensure it facilitates access to safe, quality foods. We would appreciate a reply no later than Wednesday, May 25, 2022. Thank you for your attention to this matter and please do not hesitate to reach out to us or our staff should the agency require resources or cooperation from other agencies to fulfill its obligations.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/thune-colleagues-demand-fda-explanation-on-failures-that-caused-baby-formula-shortages"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today expressed his deep gratitude to the men and women of our nation’s law enforcement community. Thune warned against the dangers of anti-police sentiment and rhetoric, and he discussed the need to send a unified message that police officers perform an essential public service. Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, before I begin, I want to mention the severe storms that hit eastern South Dakota last Thursday. “I visited Castlewood on Saturday to get a look at the damage, and it is extensive. “Homes and a school have been damaged, and many of our farmers were hit hard and lost critical equipment.  “My thoughts and prayers are with all those South Dakotans who were affected, in particular the family and friends of the two women who were killed in the storm. “My office will be doing everything possible to help those affected get the assistance they need to recover. “Mr. President, this week is National Police Week – a time set aside to honor the service of our nation’s law enforcement officers, and pay tribute to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. “Mr. President, while there are a number of tough jobs out there, being a law enforcement officer is in a different league. “I can think of only one other career path where a willingness to lay down your life for your fellow citizens is part of the job description. “Law enforcement officers don’t know what they will face when they get up every day. “They don’t know what they’ll face when they respond to a call. “But they go out anyway. “We call, and they come. “Day or night. “No matter the danger. “Mr. President, in addition to the physical dangers they face, police officers also bear a heavy mental burden.  “Most of us don’t have to confront evil in our everyday life – thanks in large part to the sacrifices of our nation’s law enforcement officers. “But police officers have to get up close and personal with evil on a daily basis. “They get a front-row seat to fallen humanity. “And they pay a price. “Mr. President, being a police officer has always been a tough job. “But over the past couple of years, it’s gotten even harder. “The defund the police movement and anti-law-enforcement sentiment have taken a tremendous toll on police departments and police officers. “Morale has sunk – which has resulted in increased resignations and retirements. “Police departments are understaffed, which has stretched officers to the limit and limited their ability to respond to crimes. “And unsurprisingly, police departments are struggling to recruit officers.  “Being a police officer is a difficult enough job as it is – it’s not surprising that people would be reluctant to go into this field knowing that the reward for their sacrifices will be constant criticism and vilification. “Defund the police rhetoric has also put officers in increased danger. “I find it hard to believe that the 59 percent increase in murders of police officers in 2021 had nothing to do with the fanning of anti-police sentiment. “And defund the police rhetoric – and soft-on-crime policies associated with it – are taking a toll on public safety – and contributing to the surge in violent crime we’ve been seeing. “Mr. President, the defund the police movement is a movement that should never have gotten off the ground. “It is based on a lie – that America’s law enforcement officers are evil and racist. “It is also based on the absurd premise that society can exist without the police, or that police officers can be replaced by social workers and psychologists. “Mr. President, there may well be individuals who fall into a life of crime as a result of tough circumstances. “But there are also a lot of criminals who choose evil deliberately, not because of a difficult past, but simply for their own personal gain – whether that looks like money or power or revenge or violence.   “And as long as we live in a world where people deliberately choose evil, we are going to need men and women who are willing to step up and confront that evil and do their best to ensure that the perpetrators face justice.  “Mr. President, when the defund the police movement arose two years ago, the Democrat Party should have stepped up and denounced it. “Instead, they equivocated – and some Democrats openly embraced defund the police rhetoric. “Now the president and other Democrats, perhaps motivated by poll numbers showing that Americans are seriously concerned about crime, are trying to distance themselves from anti-law-enforcement rhetoric. “But it’s pretty difficult to take the president seriously on this when he’s filled key administration posts with individuals who have spoken supportively about defund the police efforts. “Even the vice president is on the record praising efforts to divert money from police departments. “Mr. President, defund the police rhetoric needs to disappear from public discourse. “We need to be making it clear as a society that policing is an essential job and that police officers perform an essential public service. “I’m proud to support legislation like the Back the Blue Act, which would increase penalties for deliberately targeting a law enforcement officer and give officers new tools to protect themselves. “Police officers face the possibility of serious injury or death on a daily basis. “The least we can do is make sure that we are doing everything we can to discourage attacks on our law enforcement officers. “In addition to supporting legislation like the Back the Blue Act and the Protect and Serve Act, I will also continue to urge the president to take action to secure the border. “Border security is not just something that affects border communities. “Lax border security has consequences for the entire country. “South Dakota law enforcement leaders and officials tell me that they’re seizing drugs that they can trace directly back to the cartels who smuggle these drugs across the border. “We currently have a very serious fentanyl problem in this country. “In fact, right now fentanyl overdose is the leading cause of death for U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 45. “And where is all this fentanyl coming from? “Mostly it’s being trafficked across our southern border. “And there is no question that the worse the situation at the border gets, the easier it is for drug smugglers to evade detection and capture – which means more drugs flowing into our country and more of our law enforcement officers having to deal with the consequences.  “Mr. President, in my job I have the privilege of interacting with law enforcement regularly – whether it’s members of the Capitol Police, who protect Congress, or local law enforcement in South Dakota. “As a senator, I’ve been in more than one situation where I’ve gotten to see up close what happens when danger threatens – and law enforcement officers step into the breach to protect those in peril. “And I am more grateful than I can say for all the men and women in South Dakota, in D.C., and around the country who have made the choice to serve. “I am also tremendously grateful for their families. “It’s no small thing to say goodbye to a husband or wife or mom or dad every morning knowing that there’s a chance that he or she may not come home that night. “And no mention of the sacrifices made by our law enforcement officers would be complete without mentioning the sacrifices made by their families. “Mr. President, the mission statement of the police department in Rapid City, South Dakota, is ‘Community First, Service Above Self, Integrity-Driven.  One Interaction at a Time.’ “That definitely describes our Rapid City officers. “And it’s a pretty good description of law enforcement officers across South Dakota and around the country. “Community first. “Service above self. “We are lucky to have men and women around our country who put their communities first and choose service above self. “And I pray that we will always remember that. “And so again, Mr. President, this Police Week – and every week – I want to express my deep gratitude to the men and women of our nation’s law enforcement community. “Thank you for putting your lives on the line every day to keep our homes, our families, and our communities safe. “Thank you for your sacrifice. “God bless you all. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink:

These are the people we call when there is a car accident, when someone is in trouble or in need, or when someone’s safety is at risk. These are the people who run toward danger and violence when the natural reaction for others is to run away from it. They have dedicated their lives to protecting our communities and keeping our friends, families, and neighbors safe.We owe our men and women in law enforcement a great debt – a debt few can fully comprehend. They go out and risk their lives every day of the week, every minute of the day – through holidays and other family celebrations. And they bear a heavy physical and emotional burden. It’s tough to have to see such highs and lows on a daily basis – to spend years rescuing children who are in trouble or supporting victims of violence or bringing bad guys to justice. They confront these kinds of things so we don’t have to – and they pay a price. We owe them and their families our profound gratitude.  We can and we should be doing more to support law enforcement, from local South Dakota communities to the overwhelmed agents at the southern border and everywhere in between. Earlier this month, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, while testifying before Congress, said that morale in the Border Patrol is low, which shouldn’t come as any surprise. Shockingly, Secretary Mayorkas also said that there were more than 389,000 individuals the Border Patrol saw but was unable to apprehend at our southern border during fiscal year 2021. Our Border Patrol officers do heroic work, but they are stretched incredibly thin and have been for more than a year now. Criminals, including human traffickers, drug smugglers, and gang members, regularly attempt to cross our southern border, and when they do, it impacts local law enforcement in communities throughout the country. In essence, the border crisis turns every town in America into a border town.One of the most important ways we can support law enforcement is with our words and with our actions. Unfortunately, Democrats have spent the last two years championing the “defund the police” movement and soft-on-crime policies, which have resulted in skyrocketing crime and murder rates, low morale among officers, and a record number of police being killed in the line of duty. I know most South Dakotans agree, but let me be perfectly clear: Defunding the police is a terrible idea. We need to fully fund law enforcement, support our police and other law enforcement officers, and back the blue.I am so thankful to those in South Dakota law enforcement who have made our state such a safe place to live, work, and raise a family. Please know that you’re appreciated for all you do.Every week, but especially during National Police Week, I want to recognize and express my sincere gratitude to the men and women who serve our communities and remember those who paid the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.

John Thune (R-S.D.) today joined Fox and Friends to discuss the ongoing shortage of baby formula in the United States. Thune noted that this is yet another demonstration of the Biden administration’s incompetence, partly due to adhering to an ideological agenda without regard for the numerous consequences and higher costs for American families. On the shortage of baby formula: “They didn’t catch it on day one, and as typical in this administration, they want to blame somebody else. So they’re blaming Abbott and the other manufacturers, but the FDA should have known about this. They should have reacted a lot sooner.  “And this is another in a long list of examples in the Biden economy of products that people either can’t get or are paying a lot more for. This is the inflationary issue that they’ve created, and this shortage is another example, I think, of basic government competence. “And I’ve said this before, but you can disagree or agree with them on policies and their ideology and all that, and there’s plenty to disagree with there. But on a basic level, this is a government that just doesn’t do things well. They’re not a competent government.” On the Biden administration’s failure to anticipate the shortage: “It’s like so many other things in this administration. They always seem like they’re caught off guard. Part of it is because they aren’t paying attention to the signals out there. They aren’t reacting quickly enough, and they aren’t putting, you know, solutions and mechanisms in place to respond to a crisis like this. “But this is a crisis for American families. I mean, they’re paying more for everything, and in cases like baby formula, which, you know, basic survival items, when you can’t get it, that is a major crisis. And one, certainly, that they should have anticipated a long time ago.” On the administration adhering to an ideological agenda regardless of the consequences for American families: “I think part of it, Will, is this is an administration that is bent on an ideological agenda, and they seem intent on pursuing it no matter what the consequences. Gas price is a good example. I mean, why would you shut down energy production in this country unless your goal is to get everybody into electric vehicles?” … “They don’t care about high gas prices because it fits that ideological agenda. “What I’m hoping they’re gonna find out in the midterm elections is that’s a really bad strategy. And we need a check and balance against these guys. I mean, if you leave them and their administration to their own devices, you’re going to get a lot of left-wing policies, they’re going to cause a lot of pain for a lot of American people.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/thune-on-fox-news-baby-formula-shortage-shows-biden-administration-s-incompetence"

Thune noted that in contrast, Republicans believe that individuals, not Washington bureaucrats, are the best judges of what they, their families, and their children need. Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, if Democrats have made one thing clear over the past 16 months, it’s that they think that the federal government – or maybe just Democrats – knows best. “It’s evident in just about everything they do. “And there’s pretty much no end to the things they think the federal government should be in charge of. “Health care. “Child care. “Education. “Elections. “The list goes on. “Take the current debate over abortion.  “If there’s one thing Democrats are clearly terrified of, it’s putting this issue in the hands of the American people. “Overturning Roe v. Wade would return the issue of abortion to the people and their elected representatives, and Democrats are keen to make sure that doesn’t happen – probably because they know that the American people are not in agreement with Democrats’ extreme abortion agenda. “And so the news that the Supreme Court might overturn Roe and return the issue of abortion to the people has been met with hysteria from Democrats. “More than one has responded by calling for packing the Supreme Court so that Democrats can ensure that they get the abortion decisions they desire.  “And of course yesterday Democrats responded to the Supreme Court’s pending decision by holding a vote on what has to be the most extreme abortion legislation ever considered by the U.S. Congress – a bill that would rip away even the smallest protections for the unborn and make abortion on demand, at any time, for essentially any reason, the law of the land.   “Meanwhile, today the Senate Budget Committee is holding a hearing on a favorite Democrat proposal – putting the government in charge of Americans’ health care. “Under Medicare for All, Americans could look forward to a future in which the government decides what health care they can access and what medications and procedures will be covered. “Never mind the nearly 180 million Americans who have access to health insurance through their jobs, many of whom are satisfied with their coverage. “No, that coverage would be decimated in favor of Democrats’ preferred one-size-fits-all approach. “I’m not sure what Democrats have seen that makes them think government can efficiently run health care. “But maybe they’ve never had to deal with the IRS. “Oh, and let’s not forget about the part where it’s been projected that this government-run system could cost taxpayers more than $30 trillion.  “So what’s the problem with Democrats’ attitude, Mr. President?  “Why should all of us be concerned by the fact that Democrats think that the federal government – or maybe just the Democrat Party – knows best? “Well, for starters, it’s clearly apparent that government does NOT always know best. “Take our current inflation crisis. “A big reason we’re currently dealing with the worst inflation in 40 years is Democrats’ decision to flood the economy with unnecessary government money with their American Rescue Plan spending spree. “This legislation was billed as critical COVID relief that was going to help families and our economy recover. “Instead, it helped plunge our economy into a massive inflation crisis that has left individuals and families struggling to afford necessities like gas and food. “To give another example, the president’s Department of Homeland Security recently created a so-called Disinformation Governance Board.  “And the individual who has been chosen to head up this disinformation board is someone who herself has been a purveyor of online misinformation – as well as being hostile to what she apparently considers excessive free speech.   “And yet apparently the Biden administration thinks we should trust her to rule on disinformation. “Of course, Mr. President, this is not to say that we should distrust every move the government makes, or that the government can never do anything good. “But assuming that government always knows best is to vastly overestimate the government’s abilities. “The federal government, like society, is made up of flawed human beings. “And being a member of Congress or a presidential administration does not come anywhere close to conferring infallibility. “Mr. President, another big problem with Democrats’ government-knows-best attitude is that it usually involves a plan to have government take over ever-greater areas of American life. “And more government control usually involves less individual freedom. “Take the child care plan Democrats included in their Build Back Better legislation. “First, of course, Democrats take the opportunity to add a lot of new child care mandates and regulations. “But more than that, Democrats’ government subsidy program is set up to favor certain kinds of child care and child care providers. “It’s set up to favor institutional child care, rather than home care or other models like neighborhood co-ops. “And it’s set up to place religious providers at a disadvantage. “That’s right. “Despite the fact that more than half of working families who use center-based care opt for faith-based centers, Democrats’ program is set up to put these providers at a disadvantage. “Democrats obviously think that child care is better conducted in secular, institutional settings, and so they set up their legislation to favor that kind of child care – no matter what parents actually prefer. “That’s pretty much par for the course for Democrats, of course, who have made it very clear that they have their doubts as to whether parents are the best decision-makers for their children. “Who can forget the Democrat candidate for governor of Virginia, who memorably said, “I’m not going to let parents come into schools and actually take books out and make their own decision. … I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach” – a view President Biden seemed to echo just days ago. “I’d love to hear the reasons why Democrats think that government can make better decisions for children than the parents who know their children as individuals and raise them and love them.   “But to get back to my main point here … “The child care program in Democrats’ tax-and-spending spree is a perfect example of what happens when government starts taking over. “The government, instead of the individual, starts making the decisions. “And the more substantial the government involvement, the larger the government’s role in decision-making is likely to be. “Again, that’s not to say that the government has no role to play in American life. “We need the federal government. “Our national defense, for example, is most practically handled at the federal level. “But the federal government should be – and is meant to be – limited. “And allowing the government to take over ever-larger aspects of American life – whether it’s child care, health care, or anything else – is a recipe for the loss of individual liberty. “Finally, Mr. President, Democrats’ government-knows-best attitude is a problem because, as we’ve clearly seen, it quickly leads to an attitude of Democrats-know-best – which quickly leads to pushing for special privileges for Democrats. “Take recent conflicts involving the Supreme Court. “Democrats have made it abundantly clear that they believe that the only legitimate Supreme Court is a Supreme Court that hands down decisions in line with Democrats’ policy preferences. “And they haven’t just implied this, Mr. President. “More than one Democrat has actually straight-out called this Supreme Court illegitimate – despite the fact that every single justice on the Supreme Court was duly nominated and confirmed in accordance with the Constitution. “In the Senate, despite having the slimmest possible majority – in fact, a merely technical majority – and absolutely no mandate for radical change, Democrats have pushed to abolish the legislative filibuster so that they can steamroll through far-left Democrat legislation, including a partisan federal takeover of election law – and, of course, the most extreme abortion legislation ever considered in Congress. “Just imagine the howls that would have resulted if Republicans had announced that we were going to abolish the legislative filibuster to institute a 20-week abortion ban – a ban that is much more in line with the sentiments of the majority of Americans than Democrats’ far-left abortion legislation. “Or take the protests that have been going on at Supreme Court justices’ homes. “The president and other Democrats have made it clear that they are perfectly fine with demonstrators congregating at the private homes of Supreme Court justices to try to intimidate them into changing their vote. “I have to ask, would Democrats be fine with pro-life activists appearing at the homes of Justice Breyer, Justice Kagan, and Justice Sotomayor to try to intimidate them into changing their vote?  “I think we all know the answer to that. “But because abortion is one of Democrats’ pet issues, clearly the usual rules don’t apply. “’Government knows best’ quickly becomes ‘Democrats know best’ – which leads to one rule for Democrats and one rule for everyone else. “Mr. President, ‘government knows best’ is not a vision Republicans share. “We believe that individuals, not Washington bureaucrats, are the best judges of what they, their families, and their children need – and that government should be a backstop, not Big Brother. “We also know that the more government expands, the more individual liberty shrinks – which is why we are firmly committed to a philosophy of limited government. “Our country was founded to safeguard individual liberty – and preserving that liberty is a sacred trust. “That’s why Republicans will continue to oppose Democrats’ Washington-knows-best, big-government philosophy. “And why we will continue to fight to make sure that Americans’ right to run their own lives and shape their own destinies is protected. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/thune-democrats-government-knows-best-mentality-has-failed-the-american-people"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed the upcoming Senate vote on the Democrats’ Abortion on Demand Act, legislation that would prop up the abortion industry and make abortion on demand, at any time, for essentially any reason, the law of the land.  Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, let’s get two things straight about the abortion legislation on the floor before us today: “One, this legislation does not represent the views of a majority of the American people. “And two, this legislation is some of the most extreme abortion legislation in the world. “Mr. President, it’s a little hard to believe we’re having a vote on this bill again – mere weeks after it was defeated in the Senate. “But I guess when the abortion lobby calls, our Democrat colleagues come running. “Mr. President, the bill before us today – the so-called Women’s Health Protection Act – would prop up the abortion industry and make abortion on demand, at any time, for essentially any reason, the law of the land.    “My Democrat colleagues would like to convey the impression that with this legislation, they’re merely attempting to codify a widely held belief from which no reasonable person dissents.   “That, Mr. President, is baloney. “The American people don’t even come close to supporting abortion on demand up until the moment of birth. “Gallup has been polling on abortion for decades, and in all that time the percentage of Americans who believe abortion should be legal under any circumstance has always remained under 35 percent. “An Associated Press poll from this past June found that 65 percent of Americans believe that abortion should generally be illegal in the second trimester – or from about 13 weeks of pregnancy – while a whopping 80 percent of Americans believe that abortion should generally be illegal in the third trimester. “Why? “Well, Mr. President, I suspect it’s because the American people are well aware that when we’re talking about abortion, we’re talking about the killing of human beings – innocent human beings.   “And that’s not exactly something Americans are comfortable with. “Americans are used to defending the weak and the innocent – not killing them. “So it’s not exactly surprising that Americans are not joining the Democrat Party in wholeheartedly embracing abortion up until the moment of birth.  “Mr. President, Democrats do everything they can to run away from the humanity of the unborn baby. “But they’re fighting a losing battle. “Because science and medical technology and plain old common sense all point inexorably to the humanity of the unborn child. “It’s pretty hard to look at a fully formed baby on an ultrasound, kicking her feet and sucking her thumb, and think she’s anything but a human being. “And once you’ve acknowledged the self-evident truth that that baby is a human being, it’s pretty hard to argue that she shouldn’t be protected. “And so it’s no surprise that almost 50 years after Roe, Americans still do not wholeheartedly embrace abortion. “Mr. President, in addition to being totally out of step with the American mainstream, Democrats’ Abortion on Demand Act is also far outside of the mainstream of abortion law globally. “Thirty-nine of the 42 European countries that allow elective abortion limit such abortions to 15 weeks or earlier.    “Thirty-two of those countries limit elective abortion to at or before 12 weeks’ gestation. “Meanwhile, Democrats want to enshrine abortion on demand up until the moment of birth. “Mr. President, thanks to Roe v. Wade, our country is already outside the global mainstream when it comes to protecting unborn human beings. “In fact, we are currently one of just a tiny handful of countries in the world that allow elective abortion past 20 weeks of pregnancy. “Among those other countries are China and North Korea – not exactly the kind of company we want to be keeping when it comes to defending human rights. “But the so-called Women’s Health Protection Act is even more extreme than Roe. “Not only would it allow abortion through all 40 weeks of pregnancy, it would sweep away almost every commonsense restriction that has been upheld under Roe. “Parental notification. “Informed consent. “Waiting periods. “All of those would be gone under Democrats’ abortion on demand bill. “Plus it would open the door to federal funding of abortion – forcing Americans who oppose abortion to subsidize it with their tax dollars. “Furthermore, under this legislation, conscience protections for doctors and hospitals who do not want to perform abortions would be in jeopardy. “The Democrat leader has suggested that this bill would not jeopardize the right of Catholic hospitals to refuse to perform abortions. “I’d like to believe him. “But it’s pretty hard to do so when this bill removes the right to invoke the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as a defense. “The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, of course, is a 1993 law passed by Congress to ensure that Americans’ constitutional right to live in accordance with their religious beliefs is protected. “That law was actually sponsored by the Democrat leader … back when the Democrat Party still believed in protecting religious freedom. “And while I would love to believe that Democrats are still interested in protecting conscience rights, it’s pretty hard to believe when their bill takes steps to prevent providers from claiming protection under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. “Why would you include such a provision in your legislation unless you intended to make sure that health care providers could not cite their religious faith to ensure that they are not forced to participate in abortions? “Mr. President, with the legislation before us today, Democrats aren’t attempting to codify some widely held consensus on abortion; they’re attempting to codify the most extreme views of the extreme pro-abortion lobby. “It’s pretty sad that the Democrat Party has come to this. “The party that has historically portrayed itself as the defender of the little guy is now the party seeking to deny even the smallest protections to the littlest and most vulnerable guys and girls among us – unborn human beings.   “But hey, I guess Democrats can at least claim that they’re standing up for the abortion industry.  “Mr. President, I believe that we’re better than this. “We have to be better than this. “And I hope that not only Republicans but some of my Democrat colleagues will stand up and say that we can do better than a law that rips away even the smallest protections for unborn Americans. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/thune-democrats-bow-to-abortion-lobby-force-show-vote-to-allow-abortion-on-demandv"

John Thune (R-S.D.) today recognized Ukraine’s tremendous achievements in successfully standing up to Russian aggression in its fight for freedom. Thune noted that the Ukrainian people cannot sustain this war without military support from the United States and other free countries, and he called on European partners to make robust contributions to help put Ukraine in the strongest position possible to win the war.   Thune’s remarks below (as prepared for delivery): “Mr. President, for more than 70 days now the Ukrainian people have endured. “And more than endured. “Have fought back. “Have stood up to their invaders. “And have achieved amazing things against a superior force – superior, at least, on paper. “Many feared that Russia would crush Ukraine in days. “Instead, Ukraine has not only withstood Russian aggression, but has inflicted humiliating defeats on Russia. “Twelve – twelve – Russian generals have reportedly been killed. “Russia has lost thousands of its troops, as well as hundreds of tanks and scores of aircraft. “One estimate from British intelligence suggests that Russia may have lost more than a quarter of its ground combat strength. “Ukrainians successfully pushed Russia out of Kyiv suburbs, have retaken territory outside of Kharkiv, and still – still – maintain a defiant hold at the steel plant in Mariupol despite being encircled by Russian troops. “But at the same time we recognize Ukraine’s successes – and the fierce determination that has made them possible – it’s also important to remember the devastation this war has inflicted. “Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been killed. “Somewhere around 12 million Ukrainians have fled their homes. “And the list of Russian atrocities gets longer every day. “Schools and hospitals intentionally bombed. “Executions and mass graves. “Torture. “Rape. “The deliberate targeting of civilians. “Apparent war crimes.“In a few short weeks, Russia has brought unimaginable devastation. “The port city of Mariupol [Mary-a-pole] – once home to more than 400,000 people – has been reduced to rubble. “The city essentially no longer exists. “Across Ukraine, an untold number of homes and buildings have been destroyed. “It will take years to rebuild and remove the imprint of Russian aggression from the landscape. “And some things cannot be entirely recovered. “Just last night, Russia intentionally struck civilian centers in Odessa, bombing a shopping mall and a consumer warehouse without regard for innocent human life. “Mr. President, the Ukrainian people have displayed an incredible gallantry and resolve. “They have embraced this fight and the cause of their country’s freedom. “And they have not spent any time waiting around for anyone else to come and save them. “In fact, a recent news story highlighted the fact that the Ukrainians not only continue to oppose the Russians, they’ve actually started rebuilding in places, even as the war continues to rage. “But it’s also important to remember that the Ukrainian people cannot sustain this war without military support from the United States and other free countries. “The weapons and military resources we have supplied are playing a crucial role in enabling Ukraine to continue standing up to Russian aggression. “And it’s essential that we continue that support for as long as the Ukrainian people need it. “At the end of April the president sent Congress a request for $33 billion in emergency supplemental funding for critical security and economic assistance to Ukraine.“Negotiations are ongoing about how we iron out a few matters, and the topline number may change, but I hope that Congress can act quickly to get Ukraine the military equipment it needs, as well as humanitarian support to help the millions of Ukrainians who have been displaced. “We also need to make sure that our European partners are making similar contributions to help put President Zelenskyy in the strongest possible position to bring this war to an end.   “It would be a tragedy for Ukraine to have bought all this time with our help, only to lose the initiative now. “And so I hope that we can get this funding out the door as quickly as possible, and that Democrats will not slow things down by attaching extraneous funding requests or unrelated policy riders. “$33 billion is a substantial sum of money. “But as the news reports showing Ukrainian highways dotted with bombed-out Russian tanks attest, Ukraine is putting our military aid to good use. “And the cost of inaction on our part – of allowing Vladimir Putin to destroy Ukraine and threaten NATO – would be much greater. “We should not be so naive as to think that Putin’s campaign of Soviet expansion will end with Ukraine. “There are rightfully concerns that he will seek to escalate into former Soviet countries in Eastern Europe or even further. “He has already hinted at a willingness to use nuclear weapons – and he proved in Syria that he is certainly okay with the use of chemical weapons.  “(I hope defenders of the Iran nuclear deal are making note of what nuclear power looks like in the hands of a nation with a malign agenda.) “We cannot allow Putin to think that he can pursue his expansionist dreams unopposed. “And the United States and all NATO members must remain committed to our shared defense – and to supporting Ukraine in its fight for freedom. “NATO countries should also preserve our open-door policy to nations that are seeking to contribute to the collective security of the alliance. “There can never be too many allies in the quest to preserve peace and maintain a strong defense against tyranny.“And we should welcome any nation that seeks to help further those goals.  “Mr. President, currently Russia’s main areas of control span from east of Kharkiv through previously contested parts of the Donbas and now along the coast of the Sea of Azov and past Crimea in an attempt to fully block Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea.“Russia has failed to capture Kyiv or break the resolve of the Ukrainian people. “So now Putin wants to close Ukraine off from the world, which will harm not only Ukrainians, but also Ukraine’s trading partners that rely on Ukraine’s substantial agricultural capacity. “Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, corn, and sunflower oil. “And if Ukraine’s ability to produce and export these products is compromised – which is already happening – we’re likely to see not only price hikes but serious food shortages as a result. “The World Food Programme reports that an additional 47 million people around the world could be facing acute hunger if the war in Ukraine continues.  “In a world in which hunger persists and famine looms, Putin’s war of aggression in Ukraine threatens to cause casualties far beyond Ukraine’s borders. “Which brings us back once again to the importance of supporting the Ukrainian people in their fight. “Mr. President, as President Zelenskyy said the other day in reference to the United States and Ukraine, we defend common values – democracy and freedom. “We do indeed, Mr. President. “We do indeed. “The Ukrainian people are currently giving their all to secure a future of democracy and freedom in Ukraine. “Let’s continue to make it clear that they are not alone in that fight. “And let’s make sure they have the tools they need to win this war and secure Ukraine’s freedom permanently. “Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Permalink:

In establishing the ROUTES council, this committee directed the department, through the council, to ‘ensure that the unique transportation needs and attributes of rural areas and Indian tribes are fully addressed during the development and implementation of programs, policies, and activities of the department.’” …“I think that unique needs and attributes of rural areas, things like population density, need to be adequately addressed in the rule. As you know, measures to reduce emissions in urban areas, such as increased public transit, are generally not viable in rural areas. So I would ask that if this particular review was not done by the ROUTES Council that the rule be withdrawn from OMB and that review be undertaken.” On Automated Vehicle Demonstration program: “I have worked over the past several years in a bipartisan fashion to enact automated vehicles legislation – which I believe is the key to ensuring AVs are tested and deployed under a safe and consistent regulatory framework – and I remain committed to advancing this critical emerging technology. In the absence of legislation, I believe it is essential for the department to establish a framework for the testing and deployment of AVs. Measures such as granting exemption petitions or updating relevant regulations are crucial to modernizing vehicle safety standards and gathering relevant safety data, ensuring the U.S. maintains leadership in this important technology.” Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/thune-questions-transportation-secretary-on-rural-priorities-automated-vehicles"

We are concerned that the Biden administration is foregoing America’s trade and strategic leadership by failing to pursue such commitments, whether through its Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) or through its decision not to pursue comprehensive free trade agreements, which was reflected in the President’s 2022 Trade Policy Agenda. The lack of ambitious market-opening initiatives not only disadvantages U.S. workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses today, it jeopardizes America’s competitiveness, resilience, and security in the long-term.Unlike traditional trade agreements, the IPEF is not expected to include critical market access commitments. The failure to include such commitments puts American exporters, including agricultural producers, at a competitive disadvantage in the global market. It also signals to the world that the United States is not committed to fully engaging commercially or strategically in the region. Thus, while some aspects of the IPEF may have potential, it is not a credible counterweight to the market-opening agreements that other countries, including China, are actively advancing.America cannot afford to sit on the sidelines in trade. For generations, a large part of our nation’s economic success has been based on the United States advocating for more, not less, open markets. For example, U.S. farm and food product exports grew from $46.1 billion in 1994 to more than $177 billion in 2021, which was largely due to greater market access opportunities for American exporters. These U.S. exports lead to good-paying jobs at home and help spread the reach of American influence abroad. Free trade agreements are also far from relics of the past, as Ambassador Tai recently implied at a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee. In fact, 13 of the 16 enacted U.S. free trade agreements were passed by Congress since the turn of this century. Opening new markets for customers, reducing barriers for business, and enforcing robust trade agreements are cornerstones of our national prosperity.Regrettably, U.S. trade leadership has thus far taken a backseat to other priorities under this administration. But, as you know, global trade does not simply pause until the administration deems it worthy of pursuing. Opening new markets means more high-paying jobs for workers and lower-cost goods for consumers at home. The administration’s failure to engage on Trade Promotion Authority or find other avenues to open markets means our workers and producers will continue to lose ground to competitors. In contrast, China continues to advance its Belt and Road Initiative; it recently concluded the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world’s largest free trade agreement; and it now aspires to join the higher quality Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.We respectfully urge you to include market access and enforceable commitments as part of the IPEF, and any other U.S. trade agreements, and we stand ready to work with you to strengthen American trade leadership.Permalink: https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/thune-crapo-boozman-lead-republican-colleagues-in-urging-biden-administration-to-prioritize-u-s-trade-and-agriculture-agenda"
