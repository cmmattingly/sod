https://www.lujan.senate.gov/press-releases/lujan-collins-casey-introduce-bill-to-ensure-access-to-mental-health-resources-during-public-health-emergencies/,"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), and Bob Casey (D-PA) introduced the Securing Uninterrupted Pandemic Preparation of Resources & Therapies (SUPPORT) Act to ensure the nation is prepared to address the behavioral health needs that follow natural and human-caused disasters and emergent events, including public health emergencies. Current efforts include partnering with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to operate the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP), which provides community-based behavioral health outreach and psycho-educational services, as well as immediate crisis counseling via the Disaster Distress Helpline.“The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact every aspect of normal life,” said Senator Luján. “Isolation, social distancing, and closures have saved lives, but at the expense of the mental health of so many Americans. Despite the sharp rise in anxiety and depression reported countrywide, too few were able to access care. The September 2020 Census Bureau survey showed that about one third of those who reported a negative impact on their mental health also reported forgoing mental health treatment. This legislation will help equip the government to better meet the mental health needs of the American people in tumultuous times.”“The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health challenges and substance use disorders across our communities,” said Senator Collins. “In Maine, nearly 30 percent of adults are reporting symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder, and drug overdose deaths have reached record levels. In reassessing what we have learned during COVID-19 about the secondary health effects of this pandemic, it is clear Congress must take steps now to ensure our country is better prepared to identify and respond to the behavioral health needs of all Americans in all times of need. This bipartisan legislation will strengthen the federal government’s mission to support continued access to mental health and substance use disorder services during future public health emergencies and other emergent events.”“For nearly two years, COVID-19 has caused unprecedented stress for children and families who are adjusting to school and work disruptions or may be coping with the loss of a loved one from the virus. Congress must do everything we can to address the mental health challenges that Americans are facing and prepare for future pandemics. I co-sponsored this legislation to support a robust federal response to mental health needs during public health emergencies,” said Senator Casey.The SUPPORT Act would require the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which plays a critical role in such preparation, to support continued access to treatment for mental health and substance abuse disorders and to report on agency’s activities and partnerships in supporting services during public health emergencies. The bill would also direct the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to evaluate the programs and activities conducted by SAMSHA, its advisory committees, and awardees in their mission to continue treatment of mental health and substance use disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic.Full text of the legislation is available HERE.###"
https://www.lujan.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-lujan-stansbury-welcome-over-1-million-to-support-health-well-being-trainings-for-health-care-professionals-at-unm-health-sciences/,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and U.S. Representative Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) are welcoming over $1 million in grant funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to support the Health and Public Safety Workforce Resiliency Training Program at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center.“For nearly two grueling years, New Mexico health care workers have shown up day after day to care for our communities during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Heinrich. “But this battle takes a toll. That’s why I’m proud this funding is heading to UNM so that the proper care and training can be implemented to support our local health workforce who continue to have our community’s back.”“Throughout the pandemic, we’ve referred to health care workers as heroes,” said Luján. “This grant funding provides the appropriate resources to support the health and wellbeing of our local American heroes. The pandemic has been taxing on us all, but especially on health care professionals. As the UNM Health Sciences Center has supported our communities in these tumultuous times, it’s critical that we secure the necessary services to support them.”“Our health care workers are real-life heroes, working on the front lines of this pandemic and caring for our communities. We must take care of our health care workers and ensure they have the resources they need to be well,” said Stansbury. “UNM Hospital workers and health care professionals across the state have worked tirelessly over the last two years. We must do everything we can to support their resilience and ensure that all of us are doing our part in fighting the pandemic by getting vaccinated, masking up, testing, and staying safe.”The purpose of this program is to plan, develop, operate or participate in health professions and nursing training activities using evidence-based or evidence-informed strategies, to reduce and address burnout, suicide, mental health conditions and substance use disorders and promote resiliency among health care students, residents, professionals, paraprofessionals, trainees, public safety officers, and employers of such individuals, collectively known as the “Health Workforce,” in rural and underserved communities.###"

The program allows law enforcement officers to redirect low-level offenders engaged in drug or prostitution activity to community-based services, instead of jail and prosecution. By diverting eligible individuals to services, LEAD is committed to improving public safety and public order, and reducing the criminal behavior of people who participate in the program.“Violent crime in our communities must be taken seriously so that we can keep people and communities safe. This funding helps our law enforcement and prosecutors up their focus on violent crime,” said Heinrich. “It does that by expanding this successful diversion program for nonviolent and low-level offenders – especially young people – providing the rehabilitation that will create a safer and healthier community for us all.”“The rehabilitation focus of this program directs nonviolent offenders toward community-based services. This will allow law enforcement to prioritize violent crime prevention,” said Luján. “It is critical that we empower law enforcement to keep our communities safe, while also showing compassion to low-level offenders – often young people who deserve a second chance. This funding is a commitment to public safety and to building up our young people.”“This important investment improves public safety and provides non-violent, low-level offenders with opportunities to learn new skills and give back to their communities,” said Leger Fernández. “The LEAD diversion program reduces recidivism, changes lives, and ensures law enforcement has the resources to address violent criminal activity. We must prioritize crime prevention so that we can create safe, healthy communities.”This funding will result in enhanced coverage during peak off-business hours, late nights, and during the weekends, in addition to establishing an expanded intake network in order to maximize the number of beneficiaries of the program. This project will result in 80 individuals that are referred by law enforcement for pre-arrest diversion to treatment, and will provide transitional housing assistance for at least four of these individuals.###"
https://www.lujan.senate.gov/press-releases/lujan-statement-on-dissolvement-of-land-grants-committee/,"Nambé, N.M. – U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) issued the following statement on the decision to dissolve the New Mexico Local Government, Land Grants & Cultural Affairs Committee:“I am deeply disappointed by the decision to dissolve the New Mexico Local Government, Land Grants & Cultural Affairs Committee. The representation of land grants, acequias, traditional, and rural communities must always be at the forefront of New Mexico public policy. They are a critical part of the heart, soul, and history of our state. These communities also represent the economic potential that our future holds, but only if we keep them as a top priority.“Prior to statehood, and subsequently through our state’s constitution, land grant, acequia, and traditional land issues have always been reflected as critical priorities for our state. My father created an interim committee to work on these issues when he was Speaker of the House. I was thrilled when Speaker Egolf made it a standing committee, which is why I am so disappointed to see this decision.“The decades-long work by these committees has laid the foundation for the important work I am doing on these issues at the federal level. After communicating with Speaker Egolf, I’m encouraged that he’ll be sitting down and meeting with leaders from land grant and acequia communities on how best to move forward. This committee is not only part of our history, but part of our future.”###"

Also, the Senator’s staff worked with the New Mexico Department of Health to schedule lifesaving vaccine appointments for constituents.“Families across New Mexico deserve progress on the critical issues affecting our communities,” said Luján. “After this year’s economic and public health challenges, I’m proud to have delivered results to improve the lives of my constituents. Compared to this time last year, millions of Americans are more protected from COVID thanks to vaccines and other mitigation efforts, our kids are back in school, our economy is bouncing back, and our country is on a robust course to recovery. In the new year, I will continue to dedicate myself to New Mexico, fighting for policies that uplift working families.”###"

https://www.lujan.senate.gov/press-releases/members-of-n-m-delegation-call-for-increased-oversight-at-corecivic-detention-facility-in-torrance-county-after-asylum-seekers-face-barriers-to-legal-representation/,"WASHINGTON (Dec. 17, 2021) – U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and U.S. Representatives Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) and Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.) are calling on U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials to increase oversight on CoreCivic’s management of the Torrance County Detention Facility (Torrance) in Estancia, New Mexico, after Haitian asylum seekers have faced significant barriers to legal counsel.“In May 2021, DHS publicly stated it would not tolerate the mistreatment of individuals in civil immigration detention or substandard conditions of detention. Yet, the Department continues to detain individuals at Torrance, which failed an [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)]-contracted inspection less than four months ago,” wrote the lawmakers. “In the year leading up to the failed inspection, Torrance received 43 grievances from individuals detained at the facility regarding safety concerns, medical care, and food violations. The fact that Torrance had advance notice of the inspection, and still failed it, underscores the deeply rooted structural problems at the facility.”In the letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, ICE Acting Director Tae Johnson, and President and CEO of CoreCivic, the lawmakers explain that approximately two months after the Torrance facility failed its inspection, ICE transferred in a group of approximately 80 Haitian asylum seekers, some of who suffered inhumane abuse in Del Rio, Texas, by U.S. Border Patrol.These individuals have experienced severe barriers to legal and language interpretation services. Four individuals were given deportation orders who had not had access to legal representation.The lawmakers are expressing that without legal representation and language interpretation services, Haitian asylum seekers detained in Torrance face a nearly impossible task of being prepared for their immigration hearings and thus finding refuge in the United States.Read the full text of the letter below or by clicking here.Dear Secretary Mayorkas, Acting Director Johnson, and Mr. Hininger:We write to request the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) conduct increased oversight on CoreCivic’s management of Torrance County Detention Facility (Torrance) in Estancia, New Mexico and for ICE and CoreCivic to implement immediate remedial measures addressing current barriers to legal counsel and language interpretation services experienced by Haitian asylum seekers detained at this facility.In May 2021, DHS publicly stated it would not tolerate the mistreatment of individuals in civil immigration detention or substandard conditions of detention. Yet, the Department continues to detain individuals at Torrance, which failed an ICE-contracted inspection less than four months ago. In the year leading up to the failed inspection, Torrance received 43 grievances from individuals detained at the facility regarding safety concerns, medical care, and food violations. The fact that Torrance had advance notice of the inspection, and still failed it, underscores the deeply rooted structural problems at the facility.Approximately two months after Torrance failed its inspection, ICE transferred into the facility a group of approximately 80 Haitian migrants. Some of these individuals suffered inhumane abuse in Del Rio, Texas at the hands of U.S. Border Patrol (USBP), actions which were strongly condemned by the American public and President Biden. At Torrance, these individuals have faced severe barriers to legal representation, prohibiting them from being able to prepare for their asylum hearings, which are scheduled in an immigration court with an asylum denial rate of 93%. It took over two months for ICE to grant a group of attorneys and legal representatives permission to speak with many of these individuals , during which at least four were given deportation orders who had not had access to legal representation. Providing detainees with access to legal services, particularly for non-English and non-Spanish speakers, is integral to a fair and just immigration system.Furthermore, due to CoreCivic’s failure to provide language interpretation services, Haitian Creole-speaking detainees are unable to communicate with detention officers present at the facility. Documented onsite visits reveal CoreCivic staff have provided individuals limited information about the asylum process and without interpretation to Haitians in Creole. On the rare occasions that attorneys had success meeting with Haitian detainees, they were also not provided interpretation services to effectively communicate with their clients. Due to the lack of interpretation services and the steep barriers blocking access to counsel, Haitian asylum seekers detained in Torrance face the nearly impossible task of being prepared for their immigration hearings and thus finding refuge in the United States.Lastly, given that some of the Haitian migrants at Torrance were subject to the USBP’s abusive treatment in Del Rio, Texas, DHS must take all necessary actions to ensure that potential witnesses are not removed from the United States pending the Office of Professional Responsibility’s investigation on such abuse. For this reason, and the aforementioned barriers to legal representation at Torrance, we request DHS and ICE take the following actions:Thank you for your attention and we look forward to hearing about the actions you will expeditiously take to remediate these issues.Sincerely,###"

The defense bill has passed both chambers of Congress with strong bipartisan support and now heads to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law.“After serving over a decade on Armed Services Committees in the House and Senate, I’m proud to continue supporting New Mexico’s military installations and the incredible service members dedicated to carrying out our national security missions,” said Heinrich, now Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies. “This bill makes major investments to provide our Armed Forces with the state-of-the-art equipment they need to stay ahead of our adversaries and to advance our leadership in emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Directed Energy, and Hypersonics. I’m especially pleased that we are passing provisions that I authored to advance the Department of Defense’s Artificial Intelligence and digital capabilities so we can maintain our competitive advantage in the rapidly changing cyber space. These provisions, among many others, benefit New Mexico’s economy, and advance our state’s position as a leader in national security for years to come.”Heinrich concluded, “I’m proud that this legislation maintains a strong commitment to our service members who keep all of us safe, and makes historic reforms to the military’s handling of sexual assault cases.”“Today, I was proud to support the passage of the annual defense authorization bill that supports New Mexico’s service members and their families, our four military installations, and two national laboratories,” said Luján. “I’m proud this legislation includes a much-needed pay raise for service members, long overdue military justice reforms to provide independent oversight of sexual assault cases, and other critical diversity measures to ensure that our military leadership reflects the brave men and women serving our nation. This NDAA also delivers on the commitment DOD and DOE made by pushing the Air Force to remediate contaminated water caused by PFAS and other legacy waste disposal around Los Alamos.”“This year’s NDAA increases military pay, addresses vital needs of our service members and their families, and funds programs important to our economy and national security,” said Stansbury. “New Mexicans have a long and proud history of answering the call to serve, and I am proud to be able to represent our communities and to help deliver key funding for our bases and National Labs.”“Today, the Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act with provisions to improve the quality of life for our brave service members, including increased pay, strengthened parental leave, and funding for education. I’m proud to have secured an amendment requiring Air Force reporting on PFAS contamination and remediation. I also secured funding for UNM to stimulate the workforce development needed for our science and innovation economy,” said Leger Fernández. “This bill also makes historic changes to how the military handles sexual assault. These life-saving reforms will better protect our women and men in uniform.The National Defense Authorization Act supports a total of $777.7 billion in fiscal year 2022 funding for national defense. Within this topline, the legislation authorizes $740.0 billion for the Department of Defense (DOD) and $27.8 billion for national security programs within the Department of Energy (DOE).The full text of the FY22 NDAA can be found here.A summary of the FY22 NDAA can be found here.###"

https://www.lujan.senate.gov/press-releases/members-of-n-m-congressional-delegation-new-mexico-governor-applaud-passage-of-american-rescue-plan/,"Washington, D.C. ­– U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), and U.S. Representatives Deb Haaland (D-N.M.) and Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.), and New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham applauded the final passage of the American Rescue Plan to provide critical relief for New Mexico families, workers and small businesses, and local, state, and Tribal governments. The legislation now heads to the president’s desk.The American Rescue Plan will:A full breakdown of the American Rescue Plan is available HERE. “The American Rescue Plan marks the beginning of the end of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Senator Heinrich. “This $1.9 trillion relief package ramps up an effective national vaccine campaign, supplies the single greatest infusion of dedicated resources to Indian Country in American history, and significantly expands the Child Tax Credit – creating a historic reduction in child poverty. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The American Rescue Plan is a way for New Mexico, our Tribal communities, students, parents, restaurant and small business owners, and more to begin returning to a life a lot more normal than what we experienced this past year. Help is on the way.”“The American Rescue Plan will invest in every corner of New Mexico to help our state recover and rebuild from this pandemic. Now that the House and Senate have passed this legislation, the president will sign this legislation into law and provide needed relief for New Mexico families. This monumental legislation will help put our economy back on the right track, support workers and small businesses, and provide relief for state, local, and Tribal governments,” said Senator Luján. “More work remains ahead to put an end to this virus, but the American Rescue Plan is a step in the right direction for New Mexico.”“As someone who lived in poverty and didn’t have a savings for most of my adult life, I know what it’s like to be one emergency away from being homeless. This pandemic has put a strain on New Mexico families, hospital workers, small businesses, and many families who have lost multiple family members to this horrible virus,” said Representative Haaland. “Everyone in our state deserves to feel whole again. That’s why the American Rescue Plan is so important. With $1400 checks in people’s pockets and extended unemployment benefits, New Mexicans will have immediate financial stability, and long term investments for vaccine distribution will make sure we can get more vaccines into people’s arms and teachers and students are safe to go back to school while jumpstarting an equitable recovery.”“We made a promise to the American people to act boldly to rescue our country from the pandemic. Today, we delivered on that promise,” said Representative Leger Fernández. “I’ve listened to mayors, local officials, Tribal leaders and families across my district, Republicans and Democrats. I asked them – what do you need to address this crisis? This plan answers their request for direct payments, for help to open their fairgrounds and small businesses. New Mexicans told us what they need. With the passage of this bill today, we are closer to recovery.”“The American Rescue Plan is the most significant legislation targeted at lifting up Americans since the days of FDR. It is the most sweeping anti-poverty legislation since the days of LBJ’s Great Society. Words almost fail in describing what a game-changer this is, and I could not be more proud of our Democratic Congressional delegation for their essential contributions to this package, or more grateful to President Biden and Vice President Harris for their leadership in meeting this moment. The benefits to New Mexicans are astounding — the billions in targeted investments that will help us end the pandemic and help get children safely and expeditiously back into classrooms, the benefits to families with children, the assistance for hard-hit businesses and workers, the health care coverage expansions, the behavioral health support, the health equity support, the billions for states and local governments and profound investments in tribal communities. New Mexico stands more than ready to get these funds where they need to go to lift up families and workers and businesses all across our state — together we will end this pandemic and, accelerated by the assistance of the American Rescue Plan, build ourselves back better than ever before,” said Governor Lujan Grisham.###Aaron Morales (Heinrich) 202-228-1578 press@heinrich.senate.gov; Monica Garcia (Luján) press@lujan.senate.gov; Felicia Salazar (Haaland) 202-981-1594; Maria Hurtado (Leger Fernández) Maria.Hurtado@mail.house.gov 202-253-1819"

Senators Heirnich and Luján and Representative Leger Fernández will continue working to support broadband and telehealth opportunities throughout New Mexico.A summary for the USDA Rural Development awards are:“I fought to include funding in the CARES Act that ensures that rural broadband and telehealth services can continue to expand – even amidst the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Heinrich. “That’s why I’m proud to see this funding be awarded to a variety of projects across New Mexico that provide critical education and health care services to those that need it most. I will keep fighting to ensure that New Mexico’s higher education and health care systems have the resources they need to make sure our state emerges from this storm stronger, and more connected than before.”“For New Mexico’s higher ed institutions and health care providers, the COVID-19 pandemic has made it abundantly clear that Internet technology is essential to their work. Unfortunately, one year into this pandemic, many colleges and health care providers still lack the necessary tools to best serve New Mexicans,” said Luján. “This strong investment from the USDA will allow New Mexico Highlands University and Fort Lewis College to offer greater academic offerings and student support, and allow our rural clinics to provide pediatric, women’s, and behavioral telehealth services to tens of thousands of New Mexicans.”“I’ve spoken with leaders and communities across my district, from our eastern borders, to our northwest quadrant, and it’s clear that countless New Mexicans living in rural and Tribal communities have faced this pandemic without the technology infrastructure they need to learn or to receive telemedical care,” said Leger Fernández. “This funding will help eliminate the barriers in accessing education and provide essential technology to expand access to health care services for these communities.”New Mexico Highlands University is receiving $510,363 to create a distance learning hub/end-user site at the main campus in Las Vegas, and at a second end-user site in Mora, N.M. The system will eliminate barriers to higher education for residents of remote communities in San Miguel and Mora counties. This funding will enable New Mexico Highlands University to offer remote courses and to implement remote student support programs (especially for STEM students). In addition to equipping the remote site, the project will fund the purchase of computers configured specifically for distance learning. These computers will be loaned to students. The Mora site also be made available to community members for activities such as workforce development.“NMHU is a regional comprehensive university and we take that term “regional” very seriously. This wonderful award will enable us to more powerfully serve the region in new and more powerful ways. Many thanks to the USDA for collaborating with us on this important project,” said NMHU President Sam Minner.An investment of $263,640 will be used to purchase telemedicine equipment to help Santa Teresa Children’s Day and Night Clinic implement a comprehensive health care and wellness programs. Six fully-equipped and upgraded telemedicine carts will be provided to five hub/end-user sites. These sites include three elementary schools and two community clinics. Each site will have the capacity to receive primary care services for children and adults, women’s health, and mental health and behavior services, including substance misuse prevention and treatment. The sites are expected to serve approximately 14,000 people in Dona Ana, Socorro, Sierra and Union counties.Ben Archer Health Centers is receiving an approved grant of $153,963 to provide remote medical, dental and behavioral health care services for underserved and uninsured patients, and distance learning education for health care professionals in Dona Ana, Luna, Otero and Sierra counties. An interactive system involving telemedicine carts with accessories will enable live audio-video interactions between health care professionals and patients. Teleconference equipment for conference rooms will facilitate distance learning and group sessions, and laptops for medical, dental and behavioral providers will be used to provide services to patients in rural communities.Fort Lewis College will also receive $950,060 that will help the college implement a distance learning system to connect students in areas that include San Juan County in New Mexico. The distance learning program will help improve academic outcomes, advance student well-being and strengthen partnerships with tribal governments and rural communities while bridging the digital divide for Fort Lewis College students. ###"
https://www.lujan.senate.gov/press-releases/lujan-american-rescue-plan-will-give-new-mexicans-a-fair-shot/,"Albuquerque Journal: American Rescue Plan lifts NM families out of povertyBy U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.)March 7, 2021This weekend, the Senate voted on critical COVID-19 relief legislation to support struggling families and small businesses and to get vaccine shots into the arms of New Mexicans. This help couldn’t have come soon enough.Forty-six percent of New Mexico households have lost employment income since March 2020. For households with children, that share jumps to more than half.But the truth is that many families were struggling long before the coronavirus. In 2019, the Federal Reserve reported that nearly half of Americans could not cover a $400 emergency expense, like a car repair or medical bill. Before the pandemic, nearly half of New Mexicans were unable to cover a three-month loss of income.The American Rescue Plan passed by the Senate includes a simple solution to put cash back in the pockets of working New Mexicans: Tax relief.The new COVID relief package expands the popular Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Child Tax Credit (CTC), and Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC), a commonsense move that has garnered bipartisan support in the past.While childless workers have historically been locked out of the poverty reduction benefits of the EITC, this plan nearly triples the maximum credit for taxpayers without qualifying children from $543 to $1501. The package changes the age limits to ensure that 135,000 New Mexicans get to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks.Families with children will see the greatest benefits. The improved CTC provides a $3,600 credit for children under the age of 6, and increases the credit for children between 6 and 16 from $2,000 to $3,000. It makes sure that individuals making under $75,000, and families making under $150,000, receive the full benefit. Because families with children need real assistance now, it also ensures the tax credit is provided monthly to each household, not once a year at tax season. That’s an extra $300 each month for all families with children under age 17, and $250 a month for families with children under age 6.According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, expanding the CTC would lift an estimated 32,000 New Mexico children out of poverty, and cut child poverty by half in the state, from 13.1% to 6.5%. Expanding the CTC in the American Rescue Plan also has the potential to reduce Hispanic child poverty by 45.4% and Native American childhood poverty by 61.5% nationwide.Finally, the package expands the CDCTC to cover half of child-care costs up to $4,000 for one child and $8,000 for two or more children, making child-care costs more affordable and allowing parents to return to work.The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the dire reality that too many New Mexicans are one emergency away from financial catastrophe. While the American Rescue Plan isn’t the magic bullet for eliminating all of New Mexicans’ financial hardships, it will help lift tens of thousands of New Mexicans, especially children, out of poverty and give them a fair shot to get ahead during one of the toughest eras in our history.I’m proud to see these progressive provisions included in the American Rescue Plan, and I want to share the good news with New Mexico’s families.###"

https://www.lujan.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-lujan-vote-for-american-rescue-plan-to-deliver-relief-for-new-mexico/,"Senators Secure Critical Aid for New Mexico to Help End the Pandemic, Provide Relief for Struggling Americans, and Create a Better Economy WASHINGTON (March 6, 2021) – Today, U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M) voted for the American Rescue Plan Act, a comprehensive $1.9 trillion package that will provide economic relief and critical resources to New Mexicans, Tribal communities, public health and education systems, and state and local governments. The bill now goes back to the House, which must approve it before sending the legislation to the president’s desk.The American Rescue Plan Act passed by the Senate will:“Too many New Mexicans are facing uncertainty right now because of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rural hospitals and health care workers need more resources. Restaurants and small businesses are struggling to keep their doors open. Teachers and families are eager to get back into learning spaces and child care centers that are safe and healthy. New Mexicans are facing daunting economic hardships and need assistance to help weather this crisis,” said Heinrich. “That’s why I supported the passage of the American Rescue Plan to expand affordable health care, stand up an effective and equitable national vaccine distribution plan, support our rural and Tribal communities, give a boost to broadband, fund critical health care services for our nation’s veterans, secure the resources that schools and small businesses need to safely reopen, and provide immediate relief to families bearing the brunt of this crisis.”“Since New Mexico’s first COVID-19 cases were confirmed nearly one year ago, this virus has ravaged our communities and created economic uncertainty. One year later, New Mexicans are still struggling,” said Luján. “The American Rescue Plan saves lives and livelihoods, supports workers and small businesses, invests in rural and Tribal communities, provides a lifeline to our farmers and ranchers, helps reopen our schools safely, and ensures that vaccine shots get into the arms of New Mexicans. It also provides essential relief for families through $1,400 direct payments, enhanced unemployment benefits, and tax credits. With the passage of the American Rescue Plan in the Senate, New Mexico communities will get the support they need to recover or rebuild.”Vaccines and Health CareVaccines and TestingVaccines and testing are essential to slow the spread of COVID-19. The American Rescue Plan Act contains billions in funding to get vaccines to Americans more quickly and provide crucial supplies, testing, and staffing to stop the spread of COVID-19. The bill includes:Health Coverage During the Pandemic and BeyondBetween March and September 2020, as many as 3 million Americans lost their employer-sponsored health insurance. Americans must have affordable health insurance during and after this unprecedented public health crisis. The American Rescue Plan Act will ensure access to health coverage by:Health EquityThe COVID-19 pandemic has made it clearer than ever that we must address racial and ethnic disparities and promote health equity. A disproportionate number of people of color have been diagnosed with, hospitalized by, or died from COVID-19, and communities of color currently have lower vaccination rates.The American Rescue Plan Act will work to address systemic inequities through a $25.2 billion investment in underserved communities and communities of color, including:Behavioral HealthThe COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on the mental health of many Americans, further straining mental and behavioral health and substance use disorder services that have been historically underfunded. The American Rescue Plan Act aims to increase access to mental health and substance use disorder services, treatment, and prevention with $4 billion in funding, including:Financial Help for FamiliesRecovery Checks: The American Rescue Plan Act delivers immediate, direct relief to struggling families and individuals in the form of:Unemployment Insurance: Approximately 19 million Americans are relying on the unemployment insurance program. Last year, Congress extended the emergency federal unemployment programs established in the CARES Act and the number of weeks that unemployed workers can receive these benefits. These extensions are currently set to expire or be phased out after March 14. The American Rescue Plan Act ensures that emergency unemployment benefits continue to be a lifeline for Americans who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own due to the pandemic. Specifically, this legislation:Housing Assistance: The American Rescue Plan Act contains billions in funding to help ensure that families and individuals have a roof over their heads, including:Food and Nutrition Assistance:Expanding Tax Relief for Working FamiliesEarned Income Tax Credit (EITC): This plan will expand the EITC for taxpayers with no qualifying children by:Child Tax Credit (CTC):Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC):Supporting Small Businesses and FarmersSupport for Small Businesses:Support for our Agriculture and Food Sectors:Safely Reopening Schools for In-Person LearningThe American Rescue Plan will provide $170 billion to help K-12 schools and institutions of higher education reopen safely for in-person learning and address students’ needs.Safely Reopen K-12 Schools and Address Students’ NeedsSchools continue to face disruptions due to COVID-19 and need resources to reopen safely and to serve students whether they are learning in-person, remotely, or a hybrid of both. We must also work to make up for learning loss that exacerbates longstanding inequities in our education system.The American Rescue Plan Act would provide $130 billion – along with additional state and local relief – for K-12 schools to respond to students’ needs and implement necessary public health protocols for the safe reopening of schools. Such activities could include implementing recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state, Tribal, and local public officials, repairing ventilation systems, reducing class sizes for social distancing, purchasing PPE, and hiring additional staff to support students.It also recognizes that students have lost significant ground in the wake of the pandemic and requires states and school districts to dedicate a significant portion of their funds to address learning loss and help students get back on track.Vaccinate More AmericansIncreasing vaccinations and slowing the spread of COVID-19 will help get our schools and economy open faster. Educators are essential workers, and many states have given them priority for vaccinations. The American Rescue Plan Act dedicates $160 billion for a national vaccination campaign and other health efforts, including testing, tracing, genomic sequencing, public health staffing, and supplies to slow the spread of COVID-19 in our communities.Support Institutions of Higher Education & Their StudentsThe American Rescue Plan Act would provide $40 billion in funding to help colleges and universities and their students make it through the pandemic. Funding to institutions will stabilize them from massive budget shortfalls and cuts and will help cover the costs of implementing public health protocols necessary to combat COVID-19. Public and non-profit institutions must use at least half of their funding for emergency financial aid grants to students to help them meet basic needs like housing, food, child care, and health care. These emergency financial aid grants are urgently needed for students who have experienced significant financial pressure from the economic crisis.Higher education collectively employs approximately 3.5 million people across the United States and is a critical part of the economy. However, since the pandemic began, more than 650,000 jobs have been lost at colleges and universities, often disproportionately impacting people of color and low-wage workers.Supports Native American CommunitiesThe American Rescue Plan Act would provide over $31 billion to Native communities – the single largest infusion of dedicated resources to Native communities in U.S. history. It would deliver immediate relief for hard-hit Native American families and Tribal businesses, and build a bridge toward economic recovery and resilience for Tribal Nations.Provide Tribal governments with $20 billion in emergency funding to combat the COVID-19 crisis. The American Rescue Plan Act will provide historic emergency funding to Tribal Nations. This funding will support efforts to obtain sufficient personal protective equipment, increase access to clean water and electricity, and expand internet access so that children can learn remotely and more families can obtain basic health care through telemedicine. These resources will help to reduce stark and persistent inequities in COVID-19 transmission, hospitalization, and death, while improving economic conditions and opportunity.Mount a national program to vaccinate and contain COVID-19 that equitably includes Native communities. The legislation will directly invest $2.34 billion to support Native health systems implement critical measures to contain the virus, including dedicated funding for Tribes, urban Indian health programs, and the Indian Health Service to participate in the national vaccination program and other health efforts.Deliver immediate relief to working Native families and communities bearing the brunt of this crisis by devoting nearly $1 trillion to help working families. This will:Supporting our Nation’s VeteransProvide critical funding for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA): Provides $13.5 billion for health care services and additional resources to care for our nation’s veterans. Because of COVID-19, VA needs this additional support to cover the impact of delays in care, more expensive care due to putting off needed care, and more reliance on VA due to economic strain. This funding will also help continue CARES Act-supported VA programs to prevent suicide, provide women’s health care, serve homeless veterans, and expand telehealth.Secure assistance for unemployed veterans: Provides nearly $400 million to help get veterans back to work by funding up to 12 months of rapid retraining assistance and a housing allowance for veterans who are unemployed as a result of the pandemic and do not receive other veteran education benefits.Increase claims and appeals processing to reduce the backlog caused by COVID-19: Provides VA $272 million to mitigate the backlog in claims processing caused by the pandemic. This additional funding will help cover overtime costs so staff can work through these delays and help the Board of Veterans’ Appeals conduct more telehearings. Additionally, a significant portion of these funds will help digitize and improve access to veterans’ military records so that veterans can get more timely responses to their requests for VA benefits.Bolster VA’s supply chain modernization: The pandemic has exposed weaknesses in VA’s medical supply chain. This legislation provides $100 million in funding to accelerate VA’s supply chain modernization, which is crucial for improving the Administration’s public health emergency response.Support State Veterans Homes: Provides $500 million to help states upgrade State Veterans Homes across the country and $250 million in onetime emergency payments to support these facilities and ensure they can care for our veterans during the pandemic.Fund stronger oversight through VA’s Office of Inspector General (OIG): Provides $10 million to help VA’s OIG continue their stringent oversight of VA’s response to the pandemic.Prohibit copayments for medical care for veterans during the pandemic: Allows VA to waive copays that would otherwise be charged to veterans for VA health care services during this unprecedented health emergency and reimburses veterans who have already submitted payments.Emergency Employee Leave Fund: Includes $80 million to provide certain VHA personnel with paid emergency leave – renewing VA’s commitment to those employees who have worked to care for veterans during the pandemic.Supporting Essential Community ServicesThe American Rescue Plan will provide emergency funding to ensure that communities have access to critical services:Additionally, Senators Heinrich and Luján helped secure the following provisions in the American Rescue Plan that: ###"

More than 65,000 New Mexicans have been forced out of the workplace due to this pandemic. From New Mexico’s smallest towns and villages to our largest cities, more relief is needed to keep a roof over families’ heads and food on the table.“This report underscores the urgency of passing the American Rescue Plan to boost our economy, get more vaccine shots into the arms of Americans, and ensure that our communities have the tools needed to recover and rebuild from this pandemic.

In a letter, the senators emphasized the rise in anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic symptoms among children amid this pandemic, especially among children from underrepresented minorities.“As the 117th Congress considers additional COVID-19 response funding, we ask you to include targeted support for the behavioral health needs of our nation’s children through the expansion of the Pediatric Mental Health Care Access (PMHCA) program with a $16 million dollar annual allocation,” the senators wrote.The senators continued: “Children, their families and pediatric providers’ access to PMHCA should not be based on zip code. Currently, the program operates in 21 states, where these funded programs have increased screening, referral, or treatment of children’s mental health, with a focus on health equity and quality improvement. Given how the pandemic has exacerbated the existing need for increased child and adolescent behavioral health care, we must act to prevent and respond to these needs by providing their community pediatric providers with telehealth support to diagnose, treat, and refer children with behavioral health conditions.”A full copy of the letter can be found below and here.Dear Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell,As the 117th Congress considers additional COVID-19 response funding, we ask you to include targeted support for the behavioral health needs of our nation’s children through the expansion of the Pediatric Mental Health Care Access (PMHCA) program with a $16 million dollar annual allocation. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) administers the PMHCA to reduce the national shortage of child and adolescent mental/behavioral health specialists. HRSA currently partners with 21 states under existing funding and the additional $16 million will permit HRSA to expand that partnership to remaining states, D.C., and the territories.Families often have trusted relationships with their known providers and are likely to seek their guidance when their loved ones face mental health crises. Since PMHCA’s creation in the 21st Century Cures Act, it expanded family and providers’ access to mental health experts to improve health and functional outcomes. The program also gives providers a safety net to obtain mental health consultations in real time. Expanding pediatric primary care providers’ access to mental health consultation extends the limited pediatric mental health subspecialty workforce, provides care where it is accessible to families, and increases the number of children with mental health disorders receiving early and continuous treatment. Best practices for addressing psychiatric needs suggests early treatment is most effective rather than no treatment or delayed help.The COVID-19 pandemic challenged communities, families, and individuals in unprecedented ways. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that between April and October 2020, the proportion of mental health–related emergency department visits for children aged 5–11 increased by 24% and for 12– to 17-year-olds increased 31%, compared to 2019. Studies also reported more anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic symptoms among children, especially among children from underrepresented minorities.Children, their families and pediatric providers’ access to PMHCA should not be based on zip code. Currently, the program operates in 21 states, where these funded programs have increased screening, referral, or treatment of children’s mental health, with a focus on health equity and quality improvement. Given how the pandemic has exacerbated the existing need for increased child and adolescent behavioral health care, we must act to prevent and respond to these needs by providing their community pediatric providers with telehealth support to diagnose, treat, and refer children with behavioral health conditions.We are seeking $16 million in annual funding in the next COVID-19 relief package for HRSA to expand PMHCA access to all states, D.C., and the territories. We look forward to working with you to support the delivery of this critical funding for child mental health.Thank you for your attention to this request.###"

https://www.lujan.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-lujan-support-biden-plan-to-fully-utilize-defense-production-act-increase-supply-of-necessary-medical-equipment-and-supplies/,"WASHINGTON (Jan. 19, 2021) – U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján joined 24 of their Senate colleagues in a letter to President-elect Joe Biden, supporting his incoming administration’s plan to quickly utilize all available authorities under the Defense Production Act (DPA) to rapidly increase the production and stockpiling of medical, testing and protective equipment supplies.Since the beginning of the pandemic, Heinrich and Luján have been calling on the Trump administration to fully utilize the DPA to ramp up nationwide production of testing supplies, personal protective equipment (PPE), and medical equipment. The Trump administration failed to do this, which has created continued supply chain issues that are having dangerous impacts on the nation’s response to COVID-19, as well as the nation’s ability to scale up vaccine production and distribution.In their letter to the President-elect, the senators support the Biden administration’s intended use of executive action to utilize all authorities under the DPA and deploy a more functional response to the COVID-19 pandemic.The senators write, “Given the continued supply chain issues that we have seen over the past year, we believe it is in the best interest of the American public to shore up our access to critical supplies immediately and in the long term through all available DPA authorities.”They continue, “The DPA can help us reach our goal of vaccinating enough of the American public to achieve herd immunity by ramping up production of sterile needles, rubber stoppers, syringes and other vaccine supplies now … we need to use every tool available to make up the ground we have lost. The DPA could also be used to regulate vaccine distribution, ensure that companies do not charge for the vaccine in the future and enhance production of materials needed for vaccines to address future pandemics.”The senators note how American manufacturers and workers have stepped up to increase domestic manufacturing of PPE throughout the pandemic, but that the DPA must also be used to ensure these manufacturers, many of whom have acted in the interest of public health, have greater access to affordable, domestically-sourced raw materials.The senators conclude, “Make no mistake, a dependable and resilient domestic manufacturing capacity to respond to a global pandemic is a national security imperative. Given the opaque nature of the transition and the lack of transparency from the current administration, we understand that your team may not yet have full insight into the state of the medical supply pipeline and Strategic National Stockpile.

https://www.lujan.senate.gov/press-releases/lujan-makes-strong-case-for-additional-covid-relief/,"Washington, D.C. – Speaking on the Senate floor for the first time, U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) shared the stories of New Mexicans impacted by COVID-19 and made a strong case for passing the budget resolution that will allow the Senate to pass a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package. As a new member of the Senate Committees on Health, Labor, Education, and Pensions; Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; Indian Affairs; and Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Senator Luján highlighted the areas these committees would oversee in an eventual COVID package.Video of Senator Luján’s remarks is available here. Below are excerpts from his speeches.On vaccination and schools reopening:“More than 3,000 of my fellow New Mexicans have lost their lives to COVID-19.They were New Mexicans like Teresa, an essential medical worker [in] Springer, New Mexico. She bravely went to work to test patients for COVID-19 and stop the spread of the disease.Tragically, Teresa contracted COVID-19 and passed away over the Christmas holiday, leaving behind her husband, Roger, and their three children. But Congress has another chance to spare families the pain Teresa’s family is experiencing. The very thing that drove Teresa every day to go and save others.This resolution will allow Congress to mount an aggressive public health response and prioritize resources where they are needed most – for vaccines, testing, and public health programs that fight COVID.…“Vaccines are essential to the priorities I have heard from many of my constituents: safely opening schools as soon as possible—because this pandemic is widening the achievement gap that already existed. To meet this goal, Congress must invest in safely reopening schools and make facility improvements to ensure every educator, the people who prepare the food, drive the buses, keep the schools looking clean, social workers and nurses, and every student is safe to return.America must provide quality distance learning to those that are not yet ready to return and to work to address widespread learning loss that exacerbates the achievement gap.”On nutrition assistance:“In New Mexico, one in 3 children and one in 5 adults are at risk of hunger. In the wealthiest country in the world, this is simply unacceptable.The budget resolution focuses on getting relief to the people who need it the most, beginning with an extension of the 15 percent increase in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance benefits through September 2021. Increasing SNAP benefits has proven to be one of the most effective forms of economic stimulus.And it has the dual benefit of allowing families to purchase the food that they need to stay healthy, as well as supporting businesses that accept SNAP dollars.The budget resolution also bolsters the WIC program to ensure that children and their mothers have access to a nutritious diet necessary for healthy development – an important investment in the future of our country.This funding increase is especially significant for states like New Mexico, where nearly a quarter of children are born into families with incomes that fall below the federal poverty line.”On Tribal needs:“This resolution strikes at the heart of the health disparities and circumstances that make Tribal communities more vulnerable to COVID-19.It provides Tribal and Pueblo governments with critical funding to take action against this deadly virus and the havoc it has wreaked on their citizens, economies, and public health infrastructure.The budget resolution provides necessary investments to support Tribal governments, which have struggled to maintain public and social safety-net services.It also provides the Indian Health Service, which is the primary vaccine provider for over 330 Tribal Nations and Urban Indian Health Organizations, with funding and resources to respond to this crisis.Access to nearby hospitals and emergency services may be dozens or even hundreds of miles away in my state, and we must do everything in our power to ensure that every hospital and clinic has the staff and supplies to get families the care they need.Our response to COVID-19 must support and protect the most vulnerable among us. Today’s resolution recognizes that, and I’m proud to support it.”…On broadband and infrastructure:“New Mexico faces a digital divide, and the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing disparities between the students who have broadband access and the one in four who don’t.Failing to address these disparities risks widening the homework gap and making it harder for students, especially those living in rural and Tribal communities, to catch up.The budget resolution under consideration does right by students, not only helping them survive the public health emergency but also thrive long term.By providing emergency funding for rail and air infrastructure, it also saves jobs and communities in New Mexico.Our small airports and rail stations are hubs of commerce that connect rural New Mexico with markets across the United States and the world.” ###"

https://www.lujan.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-lujan-introduce-locally-driven-conservation-bills-in-new-congress/,"WASHINGTON (Feb. 3, 2021) – U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources (ENR) Committee, and U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) have introduced the Buffalo Tract Protection Act, the Pecos Watershed Protection Act, and legislation to establish Cerro de la Olla Wilderness within the Río Grande del Norte National Monument in northern New Mexico.The Buffalo Tract Protection Act would withdraw four parcels of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in southern Sandoval County, including the Buffalo Tract and the Crest of Montezuma, from any mineral development, including gravel mining. The legislation previously passed by a voice vote in a key legislative business meeting in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in December of 2019.“The Crest of Montezuma and the Buffalo Tract are home to important ecosystems and have been used by communities along the Rio Grande Valley for centuries,” said Heinrich. “Numerous residents have shared their concerns with me about the future of these lands and the potential damage that would result from gravel mining. Mineral development would negatively impact public health, quality of life, and water supplies. I look forward to maintaining the momentum of this legislation and working with the community to see it cross the finish line in the 117th Congress.”“I’m proud to join Senator Heinrich in reintroducing the Buffalo Tract Protection Act, the Pecos Watershed Protection Act, and legislation to establish the Cerro de la Olla Wilderness. Through my work with farmers and ranchers, community leaders, and everyday New Mexicans, I know that preserving our public lands is crucial to growing New Mexico’s outdoor economy and maintaining our way of life,” said Luján. “I’ve always made it a priority to stand up for our land, water, and wildlife corridors, and in the Senate, I’ll continue fighting for to preserve our precious natural resources for future generations.”Read the full text of the Buffalo Tract Protection Act by clicking here. Find a map of the proposed boundaries by clicking here.The Pecos Watershed Protection Act would withdraw all federally-managed minerals in the watershed and would prevent leasing, patent, or sale of all publicly-owned minerals, including oil and gas as well as gold, silver, copper, and other hard rock minerals.In November of 2020, the legislation was considered in a key hearing in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests, and Mining. In the hearing, Senator Heinrich expressed the community support behind the Pecos Watershed Protection Act and how “the Pecos watershed is one of those places where the community has come together and said that the river at the heart of this valley, and at the heart of this community, is literally the most important thing we can protect and pass on to our heirs.” Senator Heinrich also noted that many community members are still reeling from a spill of toxic waste from a closed mine in the 1990s that took decades and millions of dollars to clean up.Read the full text of the Pecos Watershed Protection Act by clicking here.Heinrich and Luján’s legislation to establish Cerro de la Olla Wilderness would preserve traditional uses and provide sanctuary to a wide range of wildlife species, while maintaining current access routes.“Cerro de la Olla towers over the Taos Plateau and the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument. Much like Ute Mountain, Cerro de la Olla is also a shield volcano with upper elevations that offer solitude and unparalleled views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the East, the San Juan Mountains to the West, and the Rio Grande Gorge down below,” said Heinrich. “These mountains serve as an important wildlife corridor and provide security habitat for species such as elk, mule deer, black bears, and mountain lions. This legislation has gained the support of a wide range of community members, as well as the Taos County Commission and Taos Pueblo. Protecting this peak and its spectacular views has long been a priority for the Taos community. I’m glad to reintroduce this legislation and will continue the work to provide the opportunity to expand the monument and protect an iconic New Mexico view shed.”Read the full text of legislation to establish Cerro de la Olla by clicking here.

https://www.lujan.senate.gov/press-releases/lujan-joins-legislation-to-fully-fund-title-i-special-education-for-new-mexico-schools/,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) joined Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and U.S. Representative Susie Lee (D-Nev.) to reintroduce the Keep Our Promise to America’s Children and Teachers (PACT) Act to put Congress on a path to fully fund Title I and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) on a mandatory basis.“During this pandemic, it’s crucial that New Mexico schools have the resources needed to help our most vulnerable students succeed and reach graduation. Critical programs like Title I and IDEA help ensure that students living in low-income communities and those with special needs have access to a high-quality education,” said Luján. “Every student in New Mexico deserves the opportunity to reach their full potential, and I’m proud to join this legislation to deliver on Congress’ promise to fully fund these important programs.”Title I, which gives assistance to America’s highest-need schools, is a critical tool to ensure that every child, no matter the zip code, has access to high-quality public education. However, it has been deeply underfunded, shortchanging our most vulnerable students living in poverty. According to the National Education Association, the Title I formula was underfunded in Fiscal Year 2019 by $29 billion. Similarly, IDEA calls on the federal government to fund 40 percent of the cost of special education, but Congress has never fully funded the law. According to the National Education Association, IDEA state grants are currently funded at just 13.8 percent – the lowest percentage since 2000. The Keep Our PACT Act would create a 10-year mandatory glide path to fully fund both Title I and IDEA, ensuring that education is a priority in the federal budget. It is supported by over 30 education, civil rights, and disability rights organizations nationwide, including the National Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers, the Alliance to Reclaim Our Schools, The School Superintendents Association (AASA), Journey for Justice Alliance, the NAACP, and The Arc.In addition to Senators Van Hollen and Luján, this legislation is supported by U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.).###Contact: Adán Serna, press@lujan.senate.gov"
https://www.lujan.senate.gov/press-releases/bennet-lujan-klobuchar-lead-27-senators-in-calling-for-additional-emotional-and-behavioral-health-resources-for-capitol-workers-following-attack-on-u-s-capitol/,"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) led 27 senators in requesting additional resources to support the mental health of employees working in the U.S. Capitol complex. Following the insurrection on January 6, 2021, demand for existing mental health programs has surged, leaving many workers in the Capitol complex, including janitorial staff and members of the press, without additional resources to help them cope with any trauma they may have experienced related to the attack on the Capitol.In their letter, the senators urge Architect of the Capitol James Brett Blanton, Senate Acting Sergeant at Arms Jennifer Hemingway, Librarian of Congress Dr. Carla Hayden, and the U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) Acting Chief of Police Yogananda Pittman to work with them and the relevant House and Senate committees to expand the emotional and behavioral health services and resources available to congressional staff; janitorial and food service workers; members of the press corps; and Capitol Police. “As we work toward accountability and governing after the attack, Congress must ensure that support services, including emotional and behavioral health services, and resources are available to and appropriate for all who work in the Capitol to help promote healing,” wrote Bennet and the senators.They continued: “We thank [the Senate Employee Assistance Program] and [the House of Representatives Office of Employee Assistance] for responding to this crisis by rapidly scaling up their services and working relentlessly to ensure that Senate and House staff is aware of and understands the resources available to them. Nonetheless, needs are increasing, especially among Black, Indigenous, and People of Color, and we should expand these services to include all Capitol personnel, including contract workers and their families, who may be affected and need help. This would warrant further investment in the services and resources these offices provide.”Following the attack on the Capitol, members of the Senate and House of Representatives returned to their respective chambers to finish certifying the results of the Electoral College. Janitorial crews also immediately returned to their duties to clean up the damage and vandalism. A member of the USCP, Brian Sicknick, died the day after the attack due to injuries sustained in the riot, and two other police officers have tragically died by suicide in the weeks following the attack.

We additionally express our concerns regarding the procedures and policies in place to protect and support Members of Congress, their staff, and other essential workers, like contract staff, members of the press corps, and the U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) in the United States Capitol both during and after the traumatic event.On January 6, 2021, the Capitol was overwhelmed by violent insurrectionists while the Senate and House were in session. We are grateful for the heroic actions taken by U.S. Capitol staff, including the USCP, congressional and non-congressional staff, and other supporting entities like the Secret Service, D.C. Metropolitan Police, and the soldiers of the National Guard. Many put themselves in harm’s way to protect us, our colleagues, and our staff. Following the attacks, non-congressional workers like contract janitorial staff had to return to work to clean up the disturbing aftermath of the incident. As we work toward accountability and governing after the attack, Congress must ensure that support services, including emotional and behavioral health services, and resources are available to and appropriate for all who work in the Capitol to help promote healing. The United States Senate and the House of Representatives, through the EAP and OEA, respectively, assist Members, congressional staff, USCP, and their family members for personal and work-related problems, including emotional and behavioral support services. We thank EAP and OEA for responding to this crisis by rapidly scaling up their services and working relentlessly to ensure that Senate and House staff is aware of and understands the resources available to them. Nonetheless, needs are increasing, especially among Black, Indigenous, and People of Color, and we should expand these services to include all Capitol personnel, including contract workers and their families, who may be affected and need help. This would warrant further investment in the services and resources these offices provide.Many of the Capitol’s essential workers and support staff are contract employees and many do not currently have access to support services through EAP. In some cases, access to these vital programs is tied to Title V, Sec. 2107, which does not classify contract workers as “congressional employees”. This stipulation is not mandatory and we would ask you to ensure that all workers in the U.S. Capitol, regardless of class or classification, and their families have access to these services, especially trauma counseling.As Members of Congress, we strongly urge you to work with us, the Senate Rules Committee, the House Administration Committee, and the Senate and House Appropriations Committees to expand the services and resources you provide. This should include ensuring the following:Capitol workers and journalists investigate and ensure the health of the U.S. Capitol, the very heart of our democracy. Everyone must feel safe, supported and protected while fulfilling their duty within the halls of the United States Congress. Sincerely,###"

The Emergency Relief for Farmers of Color Act would provide $5 billion to America’s Black, Indigenous, Hispanic and farmers of color who, in addition to being hard hit by the current public health and economic emergencies, have long struggled to keep their farms and ownership of their land in rural communities due to discrimination by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and other government agencies. The legislation follows the U.S. Senate’s passage of a budget resolution that paves the way for Congress to provide $1.9 trillion in critical relief and aid to help hardworking American families, and will be included in the pandemic relief package.“As a small farmer, I know that farming is a tough job on any day and COVID-19 has exacerbated the challenges facing New Mexico’s farmers and ranchers. Yet, Hispanic, Native American, and Black farmers in New Mexico did not receive their fair share of COVID-19 relief under the last administration,” said Luján. “Sadly, this treatment did not come as a surprise to New Mexico’s farmers of color, who have experienced discrimination by the USDA for generations. This legislation is an important step toward addressing this historic injustice, and it provides farmers and ranchers of color with the targeted relief needed to survive the pandemic and thrive in the years to come.”            Historically, Black, Indigenous, Hispanic, and farmers of color have struggled to keep their farms and ownership of land in rural communities due to discrimination by USDA and other government agencies. Black farmers in America alone have lost more than 12 million acres of farmland over the last century, mostly since the 1950s: according to data from USDA, while at its peak in 1920 there were approximately 925,000 Black farmers in the United States, accounting for roughly one-sixth of U.S. farmers, by the year 2017 USDA’s Census of Agriculture reported there were only about 35,000 farms with Black producers — just 1.7% of the total number in the U.S. Additionally, hundreds of millions of acres of farmland have been lost across all communities of color due to discriminatory practices at the federal level, and many farmers of color who remain in agriculture struggle with burdensome debt.To address this discrimination and land loss, the Emergency Relief for Farmers of Color Act provides $4 billion in direct relief payments to help farmers of color pay-off outstanding USDA farm loan debts and related taxes, and help them respond to the economic impacts of the pandemic. Additionally, the legislation provides another $1 billion fund to support activities at USDA that will root out systemic racism, provide technical and legal assistance to agricultural communities of color, and fund under-resourced programs that will shape the future for farmers and communities of color. Specifically, this $1 billion fund will include:For more information on the Emergency Relief for Farmers of Color Act, see the fact sheet HERE.### "

The resolution calls on the President to use executive authority to cancel federal student loan debt and ensure there is no tax liability for student borrowers resulting from administrative debt cancellation. Today, over 43 million people in the United States are buried under $1.6 trillion in federal student loan debt, including 223,000 individuals and $7.5 billion in New Mexico. Canceling up to $50,000 in student loan debt would eliminate full debts for between 77 and 86 percent of borrowers, or for 35 to 39 million people. Studies show that cancelling student debt would substantially increase Black and Latino household wealth and help narrow the racial wealth gap, provide immediate relief to millions of Americans during the pandemic and recession, and provide massive consumer-driven stimulus to our economy. “Pursuing higher education should not lead to a lifetime of debt that holds people back from important milestones like having a child, buying a home, or starting a business. Sadly, that’s the reality for too many Americans struggling with mounting student loan debt. The federal government must act to alleviate this financial stress, cancel student loan debt, and help Americans recover and rebuild from this pandemic,” said Senator Luján. “I’m proud to join Majority Leader Schumer, Senator Warren, and my colleagues to introduce a strong student loan debt cancellation resolution and help Americans to regain control over their financial futures.”Congress has already granted the Secretary of Education the legal authority to broadly cancel student debt under section 432(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1082(a)), which gives the Secretary the authority to modify, “… compromise, waive, or release any right, title, claim, lien, or demand, however acquired, including any equity or any right of redemption.” The Department of Education has used this authority to implement modest relief for federal student loan borrowers during the COVID-19 pandemic. This resolution:###"

The resolution is an important procedural step needed to urgently pass a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package with a simple majority.“January was the deadliest month on record since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic – and New Mexicans have lost more than 3,300 of our friends, neighbors, and loved ones to this virus. From our largest cities to our smallest villages, New Mexico families and small businesses owners cannot afford to wait for relief.“In an early morning vote, the Senate joined the House in passing a budget resolution that sets the guidelines for a COVID-19 relief package to help our communities combat this pandemic and give New Mexicans the tools needed to help recover and rebuild. Congress is one step closer to delivering additional direct payments, providing much-needed support to workers and small businesses, and ensuring that vaccine shots get into the arms of New Mexicans.”Senator Luján spoke on the Senate floor earlier this week to uplift the voices of New Mexicans and make a strong case for passing the budget resolution. As a new member of the Senate Committees on Health, Labor, Education, and Pensions; Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; Indian Affairs; and Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Senator Luján highlighted the areas these committees would oversee in an eventual COVID package – including vaccinations, schools reopening safely, nutrition assistance, and Tribal needs.###"

The nature of this pandemic has increased social isolation and stress, while decreasing access to treatment and harm reduction resources, with significant repercussions for individuals facing addiction. Reported overdoses and deaths have spiked over the past year, even as vital federal resources were delayed despite the scale of need U.S. communities continue to experience.In their letter, the Senators request that President Biden prioritize funding for federal grants and programs aimed at opioid and SUD prevention, treatment, harm reduction and recovery in his upcoming budget proposal to Congress. The Senators also request increased support for the addiction treatment provider workforce, including through existing loan repayment and training grant programs. Finally, the Senators urge the President to request robust funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) ongoing work to support and expand essential services for overdose prevention, including demonstrations for harm reduction services, as well as support for ongoing efforts at the state, local, Tribal and territorial level.In the letter to President Biden, the Senators write: “Despite the strong federal investment in the past few years, the opioid and SUD epidemic continues to evolve and ravage communities across the country, and the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to exacerbate this crisis. We urge you to support robust additional funding to fully support the needs of providers and state, local, Tribal and territorial governments as they work to prevent and treat substance use disorders during this challenging time. It is essential that we commit to allocating resources to a range of evidence-based public health programs, and that we fund these efforts at a level that appropriately reflects the magnitude of this crisis.”“Too few Americans with substance use disorder are able to access healthcare professionals who understand how to prevent, diagnose, and treat addiction,” said Paul H. Earley, MD, President of the American Society of Addiction Medicine. “In order to expand access to high-quality, evidence-based care, the United States must invest in the addiction treatment workforce, including loan repayment and provider training grant programs that incentivize more professionals to specialize in addiction treatment.”The letter was also signed by Senators Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Ct.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Angus King (I-Maine), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I).The text of the letter is available HERE and below.Dear Mr. President,We commend you and your administration’s early leadership and determination to address the country’s significant public health challenges. We write to urge strong federal support and funding to end the opioid and substance use disorder (SUD) crisis, which has been exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As you work to develop and implement a comprehensive public health strategy and transmit the President’s Budget for Fiscal Year 2022 to Congress, we urge you to consider the needs of state, local, Tribal and territorial governments and treatment providers that are responding to the opioid and SUD crisis under the most challenging of circumstances. We respectfully request your support for federal grants and programs aimed at opioid and SUD prevention, treatment, harm reduction and recovery.The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered the opioid and SUD prevention, treatment and recovery landscape in this country, and the needs of patients, communities and providers are clear. The nature of the COVID-19 public health emergency has increased social isolation and stress while decreasing access to treatment and harm reduction resources, with significant repercussions for individuals facing addiction.Reported overdoses and deaths have spiked over the past year, even as vital federal resources were delayed due to inaction in spite of the scale of need our communities continue to experience.The tremendous efforts of our states, supported by a pattern of significant federal investments, have made a difference and saved lives. Congress has long demonstrated a strong bipartisan commitment to addressing this epidemic through legislation such as the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (P.L. 115-271), and through annual appropriations bills that have prioritized targeted federal investments in opioid and SUD response funding. Importantly, the Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 and 2021 funding legislation gave states, localities and tribes the necessary flexibility to respond to the changing nature of this crisis by ensuring that State Opioid Response (SOR) grant funding could be used to address misuse of cocaine and methamphetamines, in addition to opioids.Further, important emergency funding for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA) grants has been appropriated in COVID-19 response legislation, and we are pleased to see that your American Rescue Plan includes $4 billion in funding to increase access to opioid.In addition to the need for additional emergency funding for opioid and SUD grant programs in future COVID-19 response legislation, we urge you to support additional Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) and State Opioid Response (SOR) grant funding in the FY22 budget, with continued flexibility, to address this crisis.In addition, it has never been more important to follow the public health guidance and embrace harm reduction strategies as an effective tool to reduce medical emergencies, drug overdoses and deaths.It is critical to fight against stigma and take an all-of-the-above approach in combating the opioid and SUD epidemic. To this end, we urge you to prioritize and expand funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Infectious Disease and the Opioid Epidemic Program to support and expand essential services for overdose prevention, including harm reduction services. Further, we ask for your administration to support in any way possible ongoing harm reduction efforts at the state, local, Tribal and territorial level, such as syringe services programs (SSPs), including by ensuring SOR and SAPT funding can be used for these harm reduction purposes.Finally, the nation’s opioid and SUD treatment providers play a critical role in battling the addiction crisis, and they have done so under challenging circumstances long before the COVID19 pandemic. We ask for your support of our heroic SUD treatment workforce in your budget request, including by prioritizing funding for SUD professional loan repayment and provider training grant programs administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).Despite the strong federal investment in the past few years, the opioid and SUD epidemic continues to evolve and ravage communities across the country, and the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to exacerbate this crisis. We urge you to support robust additional funding to fully support the needs of providers and state, local, Tribal and territorial governments as they work to prevent and treat substance use disorders during this challenging time. It is essential that we commit to allocating resources to a range of evidence-based public health programs, and that we fund these efforts at a level that appropriately reflects the magnitude of this crisis. We appreciate your consideration of this request.Sincerely,###"

https://www.lujan.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-lujan-introduce-family-act-urge-congress-to-pass-permanent-paid-leave-solution-to-spur-economic-recovery/,"WASHINGTON (Feb. 9, 2021) – U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján have introduced the Family and Medical Insurance Leave (FAMILY) Act to create a permanent, national paid family and medical leave program, offering a key solution to the country’s public health and economic challenges.The FAMILY Act, introduced by U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), creates an affordable, self-sustaining program that would provide up to 66% wage-replacement for 12 weeks in the event of a serious health condition, birth or adoption of a child, or family medical emergency. Modeled after successful state efforts, the program would be created through a shared fund that makes paid leave affordable for employers of all sizes and for all workers – young and elderly, single and married, and men and women. The New Mexico state legislature has also gained momentum with securing earned sick leave for employees. On Thursday, February 5, HB 20, the Healthy Workplace Act, passed out of the House Labor, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee.A new report released by the National Partnership for Women & Families shows that while the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) guaranteed the right to take unpaid leave for some workers, unpaid leave is inaccessible for 66% of working New Mexicans because they are either ineligible under FMLA the or cannot afford to take unpaid leave.“In the middle of an ongoing pandemic, New Mexicans should not face the impossible choice of caring for their health and family or keeping their job,” said Heinrich. “Yet, the reality is that hard working people in New Mexico and across the country have to make this decision if they need medical treatment or if they have to take care of a newborn or sick parent. Meanwhile, the lack of a paid leave program strains employers and the economy. The FAMILY Act should be included in future COVID relief to ensure that families and businesses have the stability and economic security they need to succeed during these trying times.”“Too many New Mexicans –especially women of color – are being shut out of the workforce as they care for their loved ones during this pandemic. It’s time to right this injustice, support New Mexico families, and help our economy recover by making paid leave available to all,” said Luján. “I’m proud to support the FAMILY Act, and I’ll continue fighting for robust COVID-19 relief to get working families back on their feet.”Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, women have been disproportionately affected by job losses. December job data revealed that the economy suffered a net loss of 140,000 jobs — and each of those jobs lost belonged to a woman. In particular, Black women and Latinas lost their jobs, while White women made significant gains. According to a report from the National Women’s Law Center, more than 2 million women have left the U.S. workforce since the pandemic began, with many forced to leave due to family considerations or because they work in some of the hardest hit sectors of our economy. These women, and particularly women of color, are also more likely to be employed in roles that lack paid sick leave and the ability to work from home. Without a permanent paid leave solution, more women are at risk of losing their livelihoods, more workers are at risk of getting sick when they can’t stay home, and our economic recovery is at risk of being stalled.This legislation has been endorsed by 89 national organizations including Paid Leave for All, National Partnership for Women and Families, PL+US, NAACP, Black Woman’s Roundtable, AFL, SEIU, CWU, National Woman’s Law Center, National Hispanic Council, Moms Rising, FAMILY Values @ Work, CLASP, HRC, American Sustainable Business Council, Main Street Alliance, Small Business Majority."

Churches, non-profits, and local government agencies led the charge to feed, shelter, and support families fleeing violence and persecution,” said Luján. “It was important to hear directly from these organizations about services they provide, how they fill the void of federal agencies, and how they are preparing for the future.

That’s why I voted for a budget resolution that will allow Congress to advance a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package,” Senator Luján continued. “Funding included in this package will be aimed at dramatically increasing rates of testing, bolstering the supply chain to increase the availability of testing supplies and personal protective equipment, hiring and training public health workers to administer the vaccine, and increasing vaccine production.”As a member of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Senator Luján met with health care leaders from Hidalgo Medical Services; Presbyterian Medical Services’ Catron County Medical Center; La Clínica de Familia; the Southern New Mexico Family Medicine Residency Program, Memorial Medical Center; the Center for Health Innovations; and the New Mexico Primary Care Training Consortium.The health care leaders provided their insights and ideas on how to support primary and behavioral health care, increase the health care workforce, expand telemedicine, support public health preparedness, and ensure that rural, border, and frontier communities receive their fair share of vaccine doses. ###"
https://www.lujan.senate.gov/press-releases/lujan-praises-fcc-decision-to-provide-low-income-families-with-emergency-internet-subsidies/,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) issued the following statement after the Federal Communications Commission approved a plan to provide low-income Americans with emergency subsidies up to $50 to pay their monthly Internet bills.“The COVID-19 pandemic has made it abundantly clear that broadband access is essential – for learning, working, and staying safe and informed. But for too many working families, the cost of high-speed Internet is more than they can afford, especially as they deal with the economic repercussions of this public health crisis. That’s why I fought to pass funding to help families cover these costs as part of December’s COVID relief package,” said Luján. “Once implemented, the FCC’s emergency relief will allow thousands of families in New Mexico to stay connected. I applaud Acting FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel for her leadership in establishing this critical program.”The Emergency Broadband Benefit Program first passed the House in the HEROES Act in May of 2020, and was signed into law in the Consolidated Appropriations Act in December. The program will provide eligible households with discounts of up to $50 a month for broadband service, and up to $75 a month if the household is on Tribal lands. It also will provide a one-time discount of up to $100 on a computer or tablet for eligible households.Under the law, the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program is open to households that participate in an existing low-income or pandemic relief program offered by a broadband provider; Lifeline subscribers, including those that are on Medicaid or accept SNAP benefits; households with kids receiving free and reduced-price lunch or school breakfast; Pell grant recipients; and those who have lost jobs and seen their income reduced in the last year.   ###"

Can you just speak to the importance of the program now at NTIA, which is the Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program, and the importance of making sure that we have an FCC that is functioning, and also that we have a strong NTIA program that will deploy broadband to Tribal communities,” Luján asked.Forsman answered, “This is crucial of course not only for our governments to operate, but for us to be able to participate on virtual platform, but also as we all know for schools, for telehealth, and for communication for homebound elders … and one thing we find is that there’s a lot of variety throughout Indian Country, as you know. There are places that are severely underserved and other places where there might be partially good service and poor service in other areas.”###"
https://www.lujan.senate.gov/press-releases/lujan-joins-van-hollen-to-reintroduce-campaign-finance-reform-bills-to-strengthen-the-fec-revitalize-presidential-public-financing/,"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) joined U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) to reintroduce two campaign finance reform bills to bring dramatic and necessary change to our nation’s current inadequate campaign finance system. The first, the Empowering Mass Participation to Offset the Wealthy’s Electoral Role (EMPOWER) Act, would revitalize presidential campaign public financing and is led by Congressman David Price (D-N.C.) in the House. The second, the Restoring Integrity to America’s Elections Act, would eliminate gridlock and strengthen the Federal Elections Committee (FEC) and is led by Congressman Derek Kilmer (D-Wash.) in the House of Representatives. Both bills are incorporated within the sweeping For the People Act.With the growing influence of big money in politics, it’s time for Congress to reform America’s outdated campaign finance system. These bicameral bills will help ensure candidates put the interests of voters above special interests, while strengthening accountability for those who violate campaign law,” said Senator Luján. “After leading campaign reform efforts in the House, I look forward to working with Senator Van Hollen to advocate for fairer campaigns in the Senate.”EMPOWER ActThe presidential public financing system is one of the country’s most significant post-Watergate campaign finance reforms. It offers public matching funds to presidential primary candidates who demonstrate their viability by raising small contributions and, in exchange, abide by voluntary limits on campaign spending. It also offers a grant of public funds to presidential general election candidates who agree to forego private fundraising. Public financing has helped level the playing field for lesser-known presidential candidates, funding almost every presidential campaign for more than two decades after its enactment. Unfortunately, in today’s world of unlimited contributions from corporations and individuals through super PACs, it is no longer feasible for presidential candidates to participate in the presidential public financing system as it currently stands. The Citizens United decision and related court cases have led to not only massive increases in campaign fundraising but a larger share of those funds coming from special interest groups who now wield an outsized influence on our political process. The EMPOWER Act would modernize the presidential public financing system and bring back a competitive public funding option for presidential candidates that encourages public participation and incentivizes candidates to be responsive to every American instead of wealthy hidden campaign donors.

Bill text can be found here.The EMPOWER Act is endorsed by: Democracy21, Common Cause, End Citizens United, Public Citizen, the Brennan Center for Justice, and NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice.The Restoring Integrity to America’s Elections ActThe FEC has increasingly become deadlocked on critically important decisions because of the even partisan divide of its six commissioners. In 2016, nearly 40% of regular enforcement cases deadlocked, compared to 4.2% in 2006. Worse yet, those votes that did not deadlock were nearly all housekeeping matters or minor violations. The Restoring Integrity to America’s Elections Act will revitalize the FEC by breaking the deadlock of its leadership structure and strengthening its enforcement actions through faster and more efficient processes. Under this bill the number of appointed commissioners would be reduced from six to five, with two members from each major party and one independent. This change would bring the FEC more in line with how most other independent agencies are structured and end deadlock, while ensuring the president’s party would not hold the majority. Additionally, the legislation creates a Blue-Ribbon Advisory Panel, convened by the president to recommend individuals for appointment to the Commission. A fact sheet on the legislation can be found here. Bill text can be found here.The Restoring Integrity to America’s Elections Act is endorsed by: Democracy21, End Citizens United, Common Cause, and Public Citizen. Yesterday, two former FEC Commissioners, Trevor Potter and Ann Ravel, endorsed provisions of the Restoring Integrity to America’s Elections Act in the For the People Act in a letter to Congressional leadership. ###"
