http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-introduces-legislation-to-reauthorize-and-improve-womens-business-center-program-enhancing-support-for-local-entrepreneurs,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship, joined Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD), Chair of the Senate Small Business Committee, and several of their Senate Democratic colleagues in introducing the Women’s Business Centers Improvement Act of 2022—legislation to reauthorize and improve the U.S. Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Women’s Business Center (WBC) Program. The WBC program played a key role in the SBA’s support of small businesses during the pandemic. The business centers, including the Patsy T. Mink Center for Business & Leadership on Oahu, served more than 88,000 clients in 2021, a 36 percent increase from the 64,000 clients served in 2019.“As our economy continues to recover from the pandemic, supply chain issues, and labor shortages, it is important that we do everything we can to support our small, local businesses. This bill will increase access to crucial resources and opportunities for women businessowners in Hawaii and across the country,” said Senator Hirono. “Last month, I visited the only Women’s Business Center in Hawaii—the Patsy T. Mink Center for Business & Leadership—where I saw, firsthand, the ways these centers are supporting female entrepreneurs and enabling their success. I am proud to cosponsor the Women’s Business Center Improvement Act.”In Hawaii, the Patsy T. Mink Center for Business & Leadership is the only SBA-designated Women’s Business Center. From 2019 to 2020, the Center trained over 1,700 program participants and hosted 55 training events. These efforts enabled the creation of 12 new businesses and supported over 850 jobs.The Women’s Business Center program is a national network of more than 140 centers that offer counseling, training, networking, workshops, technical assistance, and mentoring to entrepreneurs. Women’s Business Centers (WBCs) support entrepreneurs at all stages of the business development process, including assistance with writing a business plan, conducting market research, navigating the federal procurement process, and other business management and operations skills. While WBCs serve all entrepreneurs, they are required by law to serve a representative number of socially and economically disadvantaged women. As a result, WBCs often offer more flexible hours and programming when compared to other entrepreneurial development programs offered by the SBA.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans registered 5.4 million new businesses in 2021—the highest total on record and a nearly 2 million increase from 2019 when there were 3.5 million new business applications. Currently, the SBA provides grants up to $150,000 annually to eligible private, nonprofit, and community-based organizations to operate WBCs. Current law also requires grant recipients to match every $2 in federal funding with $1 in nonfederal funds during the first two years of the program followed by a 1:1 federal-nonfederal match for each year thereafter. The nonfederal match may be in the form of cash, in-kind contributions, and program income. The statute is long overdue for an update.The Women’s Business Centers Improvement Act of 2022:Additionally, under the bill, the SBA Administrator may waive, in whole or in part, the nonfederal match requirement for one year based on an analysis of the economic conditions of the grant recipient, the demonstrated ability of the recipient to raise nonfederal funds, and the past performance of the recipient.In addition to Senators Hirono and Cardin, the Women’s Business Centers Improvement Act of 2022 is also sponsored by Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Jacky Rosen (D-NV).The bill is endorsed by the Association of Women’s Business Centers (AWBC).As a member of the Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship, Senator Hirono has worked to secure federal support for Hawaii’s local, small businesses throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Last month, she hosted the U.S. Small Business Administration Administrator Isabella Guzman for a tour of organizations supporting small businesses and small businesses on Oahu. They visited the Patsy T. Mink Center for Business & Leadership (MCBL), which was established by YWCA Oahu, the U.S. Small Business Administration, and a community of partners to become the only Women’s Business Center (WBC) in Hawaii.The full text of the bill is available here.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-joins-29-colleagues-in-urging-biden-administration-to-strengthen-privacy-protections-for-women-seeking-reproductive-health-care,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) joined 29 of her Senate colleagues in a letter led by Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), in calling on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to take immediate action to safeguard women’s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially get the health care they need. Specifically, the Senators urged the Biden Administration to strengthen federal privacy protections under the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to broadly restrict providers from sharing patients’ reproductive health information without their explicit consent—particularly with law enforcement or in legal proceedings over accessing abortion care. The push from the Senators comes as legislators and prosecutors across the country have sought to enforce Republicans’ abortion bans by investigating women and doctors for seeking and providing abortion care.“Our nation faces a crisis in access to reproductive health services, and some states have already begun to investigate and punish women seeking abortion care. It is critical that HHS take all available action to fully protect women’s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially seek medical care,” wrote the Senators.In their letter to Secretary Xavier Becerra, the Senators urge HHS to take immediate action to strengthen federal privacy protections under HIPAA, bolster enforcement of the protections, educate providers about their obligations, and ensure patients understand their rights. In June, in the wake of the Dobbs decision, Becerra pledged to work to protect patient and provider privacy.“To safeguard the privacy of women’s personal health care decisions and ensure patients feel safe seeking medical care, including reproductive health care, we urge you to quickly initiate the rulemaking process to strengthen privacy protections for reproductive health information,” urged the Senators. “In particular, HHS should update the HIPAA Privacy Rule to broadly restrict regulated entities  from sharing individuals’ reproductive health information without explicit consent, particularly for law enforcement, civil, or criminal proceedings premised on the provision of abortion care.”Since the Dobbs decision, the new patchwork of state abortion bans has caused widespread confusion among health care providers over whether they are required to turn over patients’ health information to state and local law enforcement. This confusion fundamentally threatens women’s health, as patients may delay or avoid seeking the care they need out of fear their sensitive health information could be weaponized against them. In recent weeks, states have investigated and sought to punish patients and providers for seeking and providing abortion care.In addition to Senators Hirono and Murray, the letter was joined by Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Ed Markey (D-MA), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Jack Reed (D-RI), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Tina Smith (D-MN), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Mark Warner (D-VA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).A long-time champion for abortion access, Senator Hirono is committed to protecting the fundamental right to abortion care for all. She has led several initiatives relating to abortion care and reproductive health, such as introducing the My Body, My Data Act, legislation to protect personal reproductive health data by minimizing the information collected and retained, and preventing that information from being disclosed or misused; the bill would protect reproductive health data from sources like fertility tracking apps.The full text of the letter is available here and below.The Honorable Xavier BecerraSecretaryU.S. Department of Health and Human Services200 Independence Avenue, S.W.Washington, D.C. 20201 Dear Secretary Becerra:Since the Supreme Court’s decision to strip away the constitutional right to abortion, patients across the country have lost access to reproductive health care, and providers have scrambled to adapt to the immense confusion, fear, and upheaval this ruling has caused. In some states, legislators and prosecutors have already sought to investigate and punish women seeking abortion care. To protect patients, and their providers, from having their health information weaponized against them, we urge you to take immediate action to strengthen education on and enforcement of federal health privacy protections, and to initiate the rulemaking process to augment privacy protections under Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations.Every day, health care personnel across this nation care for patients who are pregnant or may become pregnant. This care may include anything from an annual check-up to obstetrical visits to emergency care. In order for patients to feel comfortable seeking care, and for health care personnel to provide this care, patients and providers must know that their personal health information, including information about their medical decisions, will be protected. Recognizing this critical need, in 1996, Congress passed HIPAA, which directed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to issue privacy regulations for personal health information. HHS issued corresponding privacy regulations (the “HIPAA Privacy Rule”) in 2000, with several subsequent updates over the years.The Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision has caused widespread confusion among health care providers on health privacy protections, and whether they are required to turn over health information to state and local law enforcement. Stakeholders have told us about providers who have felt uncertain about whether they must turn over personal health information to state and law enforcement officials, including cases where providers believed they had to turn over information when doing so is only permitted—but not required—under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. In other cases, providers did not know that certain disclosures are actually impermissible. Stakeholders have even described clashes between providers and health care system administrators on whether certain information must be shared. Many of these issues seem to arise from misunderstandings of what the HIPAA Privacy Rule requires of regulated entities and their employees.This confusion is likely to grow as state lawmakers continue to implement a patchwork of laws restricting access to abortion and other reproductive health care services. Already, some states have laws in effect criminalizing abortion providers, and some states have enacted laws that penalize anyone who “aids or abets” an abortion, potentially exposing everyone from a referring provider to a receptionist to legal liability. Some state legislators have even proposed to bar women from traveling to another state for abortion care. And even before Dobbs, states had already prosecuted women following their abortions or miscarriages. In many cases, these laws have been used to disproportionately criminalize or surveil women of color for their pregnancy loss.Actions to prohibit abortion access and undermine health privacy are likely to have devastating consequences for women’s health. Out of concern that their reproductive health information may be used against them, women may delay or avoid disclosing a pregnancy or obtaining prenatal care. They may fear initiating treatments for conditions like cancer or arthritis, where treatment could impact a pregnancy, even as health care providers may hesitate to provide them. And women who experience complications from a pregnancy or abortion may avoid seeking desperately needed emergency care, risking devastating health consequences and even death. These concerns are not without justification – in recent years, numerous medical providers have reported women to law enforcement for seeking care following an abortion, a miscarriage, or other pregnancy-related medical issue.HHS has the tools to protect patients and health care providers, even in the wake of this devastating decision. For over twenty years, the HIPAA Privacy Rule has protected the privacy of individuals’ health information, laying out when health information may or may not be shared without a patient’s explicit consent. In addition, the HIPAA Privacy Rule has long recognized that stronger protections may be needed for particularly sensitive health information, such as psychotherapy notes. We commend you for the actions the Department has already taken to clarify privacy protections in the wake of the Dobbs decision, including the issuance of additional guidance on the HIPAA Privacy Rule. However, given the growing likelihood that women’s personal health information may be used against them, HHS must also take proactive steps to strengthen patient privacy protections.To safeguard the privacy of women’s personal health care decisions and ensure patients feel safe seeking medical care, including reproductive health care, we urge you to quickly initiate the rulemaking process to strengthen privacy protections for reproductive health information. In particular, HHS should update the HIPAA Privacy Rule to broadly restrict regulated entities from sharing individuals’ reproductive health information without explicit consent, particularly for law enforcement, civil, or criminal proceedings premised on the provision of abortion care.In addition, while HHS moves forward with the rulemaking process, the Department should take the following steps to improve awareness and enforcement of current privacy protections in the HIPAA Privacy Rule:Our nation faces a crisis in access to reproductive health services, and some states have already begun to investigate and punish women seeking abortion care. It is critical that HHS take all available action to fully protect women’s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially seek medical care. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.Sincerely, ###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-colleagues-introduce-bipartisan-bicameral-resolution-commemorating-hispanic-heritage-month,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) joined Senators Bob Menendez (D-NJ), John Cornyn (R-TX), and 43 of her Senate colleagues in introducing a commemorative resolution recognizing September 15th through October 15th, 2022, as Hispanic Heritage Month. The resolution celebrates the heritage, culture and immense contributions of Latinos to the United States.“Our country, our culture, and our communities have been shaped and strengthened by the contributions and achievements of Latino Americans,” said Senator Hirono. “As we honor Hispanic Heritage Month, let us recommit to breaking down the barriers that Latino communities continue to face.”The commemoration of Hispanic Heritage Month started in 1968 as ‘Hispanic Heritage Week’ under President Lyndon B. Johnson and was expanded in 1988 by President Ronald Reagan to cover a 30-day period starting on September 15th and ending on October 15th. Latinos currently make up 18.5 percent of the U.S. population and are projected to grow to 107 million people by 2065 as 24 percent of the population. Cárdenas’ resolution notes that Hispanic-Americans contribute more than $2.6 trillion to the United States economy, more than the GDP of all but the top 17 nations in the world.In addition to Senators Hirono, Menendez, and Cornyn, the resolution is co-sponsored by Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Ed Markey (D-MA), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Jack Reed (D-RI), Chris Coons (D-DE), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Angus King (I-ME), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Patty Murray (D-WA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tom Carper (D-DE), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Mark Warner (D-VA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Jon Ossoff (D-GA), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Susan Collins (R-ME), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Bill Hagerty (R-OK), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Rick Scott (R-FL).The full text of the resolution is available here.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/video-hirono-condemns-national-abortion-ban-calls-out-republican-hypocrisy-in-press-conference,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) joined Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), along with several of their Democratic colleagues, in a press conference to speak out against Senate Republicans’ recently-introduced legislation to ban abortion nationwide and punish providers for providing abortion care. The bill, introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), would ban abortion after 15-weeks across the country, including in states like Hawaii where abortion is currently legal.“I’m glad to join my colleagues in pointing out that the issue was never about states’ rights, it was all about controlling a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body,” said Senator Hirono during the press conference. “And when a woman can’t make decisions about her own body and about abortion, this affects her family, her community, and our economy.”Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Republicans have ramped up efforts to impose a nationwide ban on abortion, stripping millions of people of their right to make decisions about their own lives, bodies, and futures. Senate Democrats are fighting back against these anti-abortion attacks and making clear that Democrats will not stand by as Republicans work to chip away at the rights of Americans across the country.“As mentioned, the vast majority of Americans support a woman’s right to bodily autonomy, but apparently Republicans don’t think so,” continued Senator Hirono. “If Republicans take control over the Senate, they are going to push for a national ban. And that means that states like Hawaii, which was the first state in the nation to protect a woman’s right to choose—we supported abortion before Roe was decided—and all other states that come forward, or already have in place, basically codifying Roe—under this national ban bill, would fall by the wayside.”Senator Hirono’s full remarks are below and can be viewed here.So many of us have been on the side of a woman’s right to choose and abortion rights for decades. If you add up all of the years of all of us fighting that battle, this battle, it’s going to be over 100 years, I’d say.I’m glad to join my colleagues in pointing out that the issue was never about states’ rights, it was all about controlling a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body. And when a woman can’t make decisions about her own body and about abortion, this affects her family, her community, and our economy.As mentioned, the vast majority of Americans support a woman’s right to bodily autonomy, but apparently Republicans don’t think so. So, we have the senior Senator from South Carolina saying that he would like to—he has—propose a 15-week national ban. Why 15 weeks? Because that’s something “he’s comfortable with”—something he is comfortable with.And this is not some sort of hypothetical debate because if Republicans take control over the Senate, they are going to push for a national ban. And that means that states like Hawaii, which was the first state in the nation to protect a woman’s right to choose—we supported abortion before Roe was decided—and all other states that come forward, or already have in place, basically codifying Roe—under this national ban bill, would fall by the wayside.And note that a lot of the very people who talk about requiring people to wear a mask, that is interfering with their personal freedoms, but they think nothing of forcing women to have babies. So, asking somebody to wear a mask, oh my goodness that is just too much, but forcing a woman to have a baby? Not a problem—talk about government overreach, talk about hypocrisy. ###"

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/video-hirono-sponsored-legislation-to-protect-survivors-of-sexual-assault-and-harassment-passes-out-of-senate-judiciary-committee,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to advance legislation sponsored by Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) to limit the enforceability of non-disclosure agreements and non-disparagement agreements (NDAs) where a sexual harassment or sexual assault dispute arises and survivors wish to break their silence. The bipartisan, bicameral Speak Out Act now advances to the full Senate.“This bill will provide survivors of sexual harassment and sexual assault who have signed a predispute NDA with the option to tell their story, because for too long, survivors have been denied the option by people in power…who used NDAs to cover up sexual assault,” Senator Hirono said during the Judiciary Committee hearing on the bill. “Survivors of sexual harassment and sexual assault deserve better than being forced into silence, and I am going to work to pass this bill on the Senate floor to make sure survivors can break this silence.”        Under current law, individuals and organizations can use NDAs to prevent survivors of sexual harassment or assault from speaking publicly about these incidents. The threat of legal retaliation creates and enables a culture of silence that allows predators to continue their illegal conduct, while their victims are forced out of their careers and the workforce entirely.Specifically, the Speak Out Act would:In addition to Senator Hirono, the bipartisan, bicameral Speak Out Act was introduced by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Lindsey Graham (R-SC).  The House companion bill was introduced by Representatives Lois Frankel (D-FL) and Ken Buck (R-CO).Senator Hirono is a strong advocate for survivors of sexual assault and harassment, and consistently works to advance legislation to protect survivors. She cosponsored the bipartisan Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act, which prevents perpetrators from being able to push survivors of sexual harassment and assault into the secretive, biased process of forced arbitration, and was signed into law earlier this year.###"

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/video-hirono-delivers-remarks-in-support-of-nomination-of-dr-geeta-rao-gupta-on-the-senate-floor,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) delivered remarks on the Senate floor in support of the nomination of Dr. Geeta Rao Gupta to serve as Ambassador-at-large for Global Women’s Issues and condemning Republicans’ continued obstruction of her nomination. For months, Republicans blocked consideration of Dr. Gupta’s nomination because she supports the right to access abortion care, endangering the health and safety of women in the U.S. and around the world.“Dr. Gupta has spent her life working to empower women across the globe,” said Senator Hirono in her remarks. “But for months now, Republicans have blocked consideration of her nomination. Why? Not because she is unqualified. Dr. Gupta’s record is impeccable and her qualifications are clear.”“Republicans are blocking her nomination simply because she supports the fundamental right of all women to make decisions about their bodies and their futures, including the decision to get an abortion,” Senator Hirono continued. “Apparently, it’s no longer enough for my Republican colleagues to push their extreme anti-abortion agenda. Now that they’ve overturned Roe v. Wade, they are opposing anyone who even expresses support for abortion access.”In her remarks, Senator Hirono also highlighted the threat this GOP opposition poses to the health and safety of women in the U.S. and around the world, and urged Republicans to end their baseless obstruction.“My Republican colleagues raise concerns about the state of women and girls in Afghanistan. And yet, in another example of their hypocrisy, they are opposing a nominee who would be in a position to actually help support these women,” said Senator Hirono. “As Ambassador-at-large for Global Women’s Issues, Dr. Gupta will bring decades of experience to empower women, improve their economic security, and end violence against women and girls.”Senator Hirono’s full remarks are below and can be viewed here.M. President, I rise today in support of Dr. Geeta Rao Gupta’s nomination to serve as Ambassador-at-large for Global Women’s Issues. And I’m glad to be here with my friend from New Hampshire to argue for her confirmation.As head of the State Department’s Office of Global Women’s Issues, the Ambassador-at-large leads our diplomatic efforts to promote the rights and empowerment of women and girls around the world. Who can argue with that kind of a mission? From supporting women’s economic participation to combatting domestic and gender-based violence, this work is critically important, and Dr. Gupta is well suited to take on this important task.Dr. Gupta has spent her life working to empower women across the globe. She has led several non-profit organizations focused on advancing gender equity, and has served as co-Chair of the World Bank’s Gender-Based Violence Task Force. But for months now, Republicans have blocked consideration of her nomination. Why? Not because she is unqualified. Dr. Gupta’s record is impeccable and her qualifications are clear.No, Republicans are blocking her nomination simply because she supports the fundamental right of all women to make decisions about their bodies and their futures, including the decision to get an abortion. Apparently, it’s no longer enough for my Republican colleagues to push their extreme anti-abortion agenda. Now that they’ve overturned Roe v. Wade, they are opposing anyone who even expresses support for abortion access, even if it’s their personal views and not one that they are going to be pushing forward in the position that we are being asked to confirm them for.Last year, the Republicans did the same thing to President Biden’s nominee to be Deputy Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA)—opposing his nomination because of their opposition to SBA’s totally lawful PPP loans to Planned Parenthood clinics providing critical health care to communities across the country. The Republicans, I have to say, have been on a tear about, ‘How dare the SBA provide these lawful PPP loans to Planned Parenthood?’ Apparently it escapes their notice that these are lawful loans.So, Republicans’ opposition to Dr. Gupta’s confirmation is a dangerous position, and one that threatens the health, safety, and prosperity of women here in the United States and around the world. For example, my Republican colleagues raise concerns about the state of women and girls in Afghanistan. And yet, in another example of their hypocrisy, they are opposing a nominee who would be in a position to actually help support these women.As Ambassador-at-large for Global Women’s Issues, Dr. Gupta will bring decades of experience to empower women, improve their economic security, and end violence against women and girls. There is no legitimate reason for anyone to not support her nomination to this important role. The chaos and fear across the country generated by the Supreme Court’s Roe decision is spilling over to block this nomination.I thank Senator Shaheen for her focus on Dr. Gupta’s nomination and her dedication to women and girls at home and abroad. And I urge my Republican colleagues to do the right thing for a change and end their bad-faith obstruction of Dr. Gupta’s nomination.###"

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/video-hirono-urges-immigration-reform-to-address-health-care-workforce-strain,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety, emphasized the need for immigration reform to address the strain caused by the shortage of health care workers in Hawaii and across the country during a Subcommittee hearing. In the hearing, Senator Hirono questioned Dr. Ram Sanjeev Alur, a physician at the Marion Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and Sarah Peterson, an attorney with almost two decades of immigration law experience, about what can be done to alleviate this workforce shortage. “If there’s one thing that the pandemic showed, it was the importance of the essential workers, of whom—many of them, of course, our doctors, our nurses, our health care workers—stretched thin to the brink of exhaustion during the two years of the pandemic, and it’s still not over,” said Senator Hirono during the hearing.As she stressed the urgency that is needed to address this worker shortage, Senator Hirono expressed concern that Hawaii is currently experiencing a shortage of over 700 physicians, and highlighted Governor David Ige’s recent emergency rule that allows out-of-state nurses to temporarily practice in Hawaii without obtaining a license from the state.“How long can these [health care] systems continue to use the kind of ‘quick patches,’ such as a governor issuing an emergency order, for a problem that needs long-term investment and policy changes,” Senator Hirono asked Dr. Ram Sanjeev Alur, a physician at the Marion Veterans Affairs Medical Center.“The shortage is already an emergency,” said Dr. Alur. He went on to say that the pandemic placed immense stress on the U.S. health care workforce, which has still not recovered. Dr. Alur also emphasized that rural areas would be disproportionately impacted by this shortage, which is projected to continue.Hawaii is home to more than 250,000 immigrants, with a significant number of them employed in the health care field—immigrants make up almost half of all health aides, nearly a quarter of all nurses, and about 20 percent of physicians. Nationwide, immigrants account for 18 percent of the 14.7 million health care workers in the U.S.As a Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hirono is working to fix our immigration system and address the health care worker shortage. She is a cosponsor of the Citizenship for Essential Workers Act, which would provide a pathway to citizenship for essential workers, including health care workers, and their immediate families. Senator Hirono is also working with colleagues to recapture unused visas from prior years to fully utilize all the legal immigration slots that Congress intended, visas that could help stabilize our health care system.A link to download video of the Senator’s full question line is available here.###"

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/video-hirono-speaks-out-against-radical-gop-proposal-for-nationwide-abortion-ban-on-the-senate-floor-,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, delivered remarks on the Senate floor speaking out against the radical nationwide abortion ban recently introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC). Despite previous Republican statements that abortion laws should be decided by the states, Senator Graham’s bill would ban abortions after 15-weeks of pregnancy across the country, including in states like Hawaii where abortion currently remains legal.“When the extreme far-right Supreme Court overturned Roe, my Republican colleagues lauded this horrendous decision, claiming that a woman’s right to an abortion should be left to the states,” said Senator Hirono in her remarks. “But now they are admitting what we knew all along. This was never about states’ rights. This has always been about Republicans using their power to control women and our bodily autonomy.”Senator Hirono highlighted the hypocrisy of the Republican proposal and the very real threat it poses to women and communities in states like Hawaii where abortion currently remains legal.“This is not some sort of hypothetical debate, or ‘hysteria’ as some of my Republican colleagues have claimed. If Republicans take control of the Senate, we now know what they will do—they will work to pass a national abortion ban,” said Senator Hirono. “And for voters in states who are pushing back against their radical legislators, and exercising their right to bring the issue of abortion to the ballot—including states like Kansas and Michigan—this bill would overrule their efforts.”Senator Hirono’s full remarks are below and can be viewed here.When the extreme far-right Supreme Court overturned Roe, my Republican colleagues lauded this horrendous decision, claiming that a woman’s right to an abortion should be left to the states.But now they are admitting what we knew all along. This was never about states’ rights. This has always been about Republicans using their power to control women and our bodily autonomy.Despite the fact that the vast majority of the American public supports reproductive freedom, and despite the fact that voters across the country are overwhelmingly voting to protect this freedom, Republicans are pandering to their extreme MAGA base and have introduced a nationwide ban on abortion after 15 weeks.Why 15 weeks, you ask? Because that’s what the senior Senator from South Carolina, who introduced this legislation, said he would quote “feel comfortable at.” So, we now have a Republican Senator attempting to restrict the bodily of autonomy of women across the country, because that’s what he “feels comfortable at.” It’s not enough that the overturning of Roe has created fear and confusion all across the country, we now have the introduction of a nationwide abortion ban further adding to the chaos.This is not some sort of hypothetical debate, or “hysteria” as some of my Republican colleagues have claimed. If Republicans take control of the Senate, we now know what they will do—they will work to pass a national abortion ban, which would mean even in my home state of Hawaii—which was the first state in the country to decriminalize abortion, even before the Roe decision—we did this in Hawaii in 1970.And for voters in states who are pushing back against their radical legislators, and exercising their right to bring the issue of abortion to the ballot—including states like Kansas and Michigan—this bill would overrule their efforts. But of course, to add to their utter hypocrisy, if states like Texas or Mississippi want to be even more restrictive, even more harmful to women than a 15 week ban, that would be a-ok according to the Senator from South Carolina and his extreme bill.Allowing Republicans to regain control of Congress would be catastrophic not only for women, but for our entire country. Because when we women can’t control what we do with our bodies, of course this impacts our families, our communities, our economy.And so, this November, people are going to have a choice—do you want to let extreme MAGA Republicans tell you what you can and can’t do with your own body? Or do you want to hold these politicians accountable for pushing their far-right extreme agenda, and perpetuating the chaos, confusion and fear that women, families, communities, and our health care professionals—let’s not forget all the doctors who are out there wondering how they can provide the kind of care that they are trained to do right now; how they can do that in the face of this kind of ban in so many states across the country, not to mention a nationwide abortion ban.So the chaos, confusion, being experienced all across the country following the Dobbs decision is only multiplied by this nationwide abortion ban bill. Talk about government overreach. When I hear my colleagues talking about how it should be states’ rights or government should not be telling us what to do, the word ‘hypocrites’ doesn’t even go far enough to call them out on what they’re doing.This is an outright attack on women in this country. That is how I see it, that is how more and more women, and those who support our right to make decisions about our own bodies—that is how we see it. And why? Because that is what’s happening.###"

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/video-hirono-investigates-twitters-alleged-mishandling-of-data-and-information,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, highlighted the serious privacy and national security threats posed by Twitter’s alleged mishandling of data and information at a full Committee hearing. In the hearing, Senator Hirono questioned Mr. Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, a data security expert and Twitter’s former head of security who recently alleged serious privacy and security failures by the company, about the dire consequences of the company’s unwillingness to address the concerns raised in his whistleblower disclosure.“Your testimony and all of your responses to the various questions we’ve asked you says to me that the situation regarding data security and national security issues with regard to Twitter is massive and that Twitter is not doing very much to be helpful at all,” Senator Hirono said to Mr. Zatko during the hearing. “In fact, there are major disincentives to Twitter doing anything—to spending the time or the resources to address the concerns that you raise.”In the hearing, Senator Hirono also expressed concern that, based on Mr. Zatko’s testimony, Twitter is allegedly unable to adequately address efforts made by foreign governments and identify foreign agents who infiltrate the company, which poses significant risks to national security.“From what you’re telling me, [Twitter] cannot even identify foreign agents in their midst,” Senator Hirono asked Mr. Zatko.Mr. Zatko confirmed this claim during his testimony, saying that, to his awareness, Twitter was not making any effort to identify foreign agents that may have infiltrated the company. He then explained what changes should be implemented in order to address these shortcomings.“I think holding people accountable is a good start,” said Zatko. “But you can only hold people accountable if you can measure and quantify what their targets are, and what changes need to happen. And if you say, such as what I saw, Twitter needs to have a mature software security program, that’s a very ambiguous and qualitative term. So, holding accountability and setting quantitative goals and standards that can be measured and audited independently, I believe, is what’s going to be required to change management structures and drive change in companies when it’s needed, such as this.”During the exchange, Senator Hirono also emphasized that effective standards do not currently exist in the U.S. to hold companies like Twitter accountable and deter them from compromising user data and information. Specifically, she inquired about what Twitter currently does with its user information after the user has closed their account.“You discovered that Twitter compromises its user data long after its users close their accounts,” Senator Hirono continued. “In fact you stated the accounts are simply deactivated while the data is not fully deleted. At the time of your departure from Twitter, was that the company’s continuing general practice?”Mr. Zatko confirmed this process, saying the Chief Privacy Officer informed him that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other regulators had inquired about whether Twitter deleted user information when users leave the platform, and the response that the company had been previously provided would no longer be sufficient.“Instead of answering whether we delete user data, we intentionally have replied, ‘We deactivate users,’ and try to side step the program because we know we do not delete user data and cannot comply with that if they demand us to,” said Zatko.However, in order to properly delete this data, Mr. Zatko stated that Twitter would need to manage and organize the data and information they collect on its users.“[Twitter] would need to know what data they have, where it is, and why they got it, and who it’s attached to in order to [delete the data],” said Zatko. “If they did that, which should be a fundamental expectation that I would have as a user, yes—at that point they could absolutely delete the information.”A link to download video of the Senator’s full question line is available here.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/video-hirono-highlights-inflation-reduction-acts-health-care-savings-for-hawaii-families-and-seniors,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono delivered remarks at Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s weekly press conference highlighting the historic provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 to make health care more affordable for people in Hawaii and across the country. The IRA will lower health care costs for seniors by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for prescription drugs and capping out of pocket drug costs for Medicare recipients at $2,000 a year. The law also includes a provision sponsored by Senator Hirono to ensure Medicare recipients can receive all necessary vaccinations at no cost.“One thing that is going to make a difference to so many seniors right now is that those seniors under Medicare will be able to get their vaccinations free,” said Senator Hirono. “[Democrats] are the party that has been addressing and doing the kinds of actions that really enable lowering of drug costs, fighting climate change, without a single Republican vote. There is a huge difference between what we care about and what they focus on.”Senator Hirono’s full remarks are below and can be viewed here.Linsey Graham’s bill is yet another example of how out of touch the Republicans are with issues that really matter to the American people.Focusing on the Inflation Reduction Act and the lowering of prescription drug costs—there are about close to 300,000 seniors in Hawaii who rely on Medicare, and lowering prescription drug costs in Medicare and enabling us to negotiate these costs is something that so many of us who are here, when the Affordable Care Act was first enacted, something that we have been pushing for for over ten years. It took that long for us to enact this right to negotiate, something that the VA—which is the largest health care system in our country—has been doing for decades.Also, capping out of pocket costs for seniors at $2,000 is going to enable over a million seniors in our country to be able to have those costs capped. One thing that is going to make a difference to so many seniors right now is that those seniors under Medicare will be able to get their vaccinations free, especially, for example, the shingles vaccine. One out of three older Americans will be affected by shingles and a lot of them don’t get the vaccine because they had to pay for it—no longer. And it happened to be a bill that I have been pushing for a lot of years.This goes to show, as we have been saying—we, Democrats have been saying—is that we are the party that has been addressing and doing the kinds of actions that really enable lowering of drug costs, fighting climate change, without a single Republican vote. There is a huge difference between what we care about and what they focus on.###"

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-announces-500k-to-help-hawaii-small-businesses-expand-into-overseas-markets,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Small Business Committee, announced that the Hawaii Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism (DBEDT) will receive $500,000 through the U.S. Small Business Administration’s (SBA) State Trade Expansion Program (STEP). The funding will be used to support Hawaii’s small businesses as they work to expand into overseas markets and create more jobs. The funding comes just weeks after Senator Hirono hosted SBA Administrator Isabella Guzman for a tour of organizations supporting small businesses and small businesses on Oahu as part of her ongoing efforts to support Hawaii’s local businesses.“Access to global markets is essential for small businesses in Hawaii, especially as they work to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Senator Hirono. “For the last decade, the State Trade Expansion Program has enabled Hawaii’s small businesses to expand into overseas markets by providing millions in financial support—creating hundreds of jobs and generating over $80 million in new exports. I am glad to see Hawaii receiving $500,000 in new STEP funding, which will allow even more businesses and entrepreneurs across our state to expand. As a member of the Senate Small Business Committee, I’ll continue working to support Hawaii’s small businesses, business owners, and the employees who power them.”Only 1 percent of America’s more than 30 million small businesses export their products and services because they often lack the relationships and expertise necessary to secure business in the global marketplace. Congress created STEP in 2010 to increase opportunities for small businesses to engage in international trade. The program awards grants to state economic development agencies so they can help small businesses attend international trade shows and connect with customers in foreign markets. The grants also allow economic development agencies to provide counseling and training to help small businesses understand the rules of international trade.Since its creation in 2011, the Hawaii STEP program (HiSTEP) has received more than $5 million in federal funding through STEP to provide assistance to over 900 businesses in the state. HiSTEP has also supported the creation of over 900 jobs, and created over $172 million in economic impacts—generating millions in state taxes. Senator Hirono voted to create STEP during the 111th Congress, and has since advocated for increases in program funding.“SBA’s State Trade Expansion Program has an extensive record helping small businesses grow their revenue by reaching beyond their borders to new markets and customers,” said SBA Administrator Isabella Guzman. “Scaling these awards to meet growing opportunity and demand will help ensure that America’s 33 million small businesses and innovative startups are positioned to succeed with the resources and support they need to seize opportunities abroad, grow through trade and compete in this increasingly global economy.”This year marks the ten-year anniversary of STEP funding, which continues to support export growth and international expansion among small businesses. To date, the program has awarded $215.5 million in grants that directly support small businesses going global. Since its creation, STEP has recorded over $3.8 billion in exports with more than 12,000 small businesses receiving grants to fund their export opportunities and increase their footprint across 141 countries.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-joins-colleagues-in-bicameral-push-to-permit-individuals-living-with-hiv-and-hbv-to-serve-in-the-military,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, joined five of her Senate colleagues in urging the Department of Defense (DOD) to permit individuals living with well-managed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) to enlist and serve in the military. Given the advancements in medicine for both HIV and HBV, the risk of battlefield transmission is near zero and people living with HIV and HBV can manage their condition with as little as one pill a day and are able to lead very long and healthy lives. Allowing individuals with HIV and HBV to enlist would help the military meet its troop recruitment and retention goals, which Senator Hirono is focused on as a member of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel.“We are pleased to learn that DOJ will no longer defend the constitutionality of regulations barring the deployment and commissioning of service members with HIV who are currently serving in the U.S. military. We now ask that the Biden administration follows this conclusion and allows individuals living with HIV to enlist, to seek appointment, and to otherwise join the U.S. military,” said the senators. “For far too long, people living with HIV and HBV have faced harmful and discriminatory policies in our armed forces that create unnecessary barriers to serve. The current policy banning these individuals from enlisting or joining a commissioning program is outdated and without merit, and does not reflect the military’s commitment to equality, diversity, and the inclusion of all races, ethnicities, religions, and sexual orientations in service. Anyone who is qualified and has a desire to serve their country should be allowed to do so, and we remain optimistic the administration will heed this important call.” Just recently, multiple district court cases affirmed this notion by stating that the categorical bars to the deployment and commissioning of service members with HIV violate the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. The argument that these viruses make an individual less fit to serve is outdated, harmful, and discriminatory, and places unnecessary barriers on these individuals who wish to serve their country.The letter, led by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Chris Coons (D-DE), was also joined by Senators Brian Schatz (D-HI), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), and Bob Casey (D-PA). U.S. Representative Mike Quigley (IL-05), Vice-Chair of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, Representative Sara Jacobs (CA-53), and Representative Barbara Lee (CA-13) led 31 of their House colleagues in sending an identical letter to the Biden administration.The full text of the letter is available here.As a member of the Senate Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee, Senator Hirono is working to make sure the military can meet its recruitment and retention goals, and that those who want to serve can do so. In July, she urged DOD to consider providing family planning options, including cryopreservation for servicemembers, citing family planning challenges as one of the top reasons individuals—particularly women—choose not to join, or leave the military. Similarly, in June, she led a group of her Senate colleagues in calling on DOD to protect abortion access for servicemembers.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-statement-on-updated-dod-plan-for-red-hill-defueling-and-closure-,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, released the following statement on the Department of Defense’s updated plan for the defueling and closure of the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility:“DOD has updated its defueling plan and added additional information in response to feedback from state, local, and community leaders. This updated plan should continue to prioritize safety, while streamlining certain processes to allow for a faster defueling timeline. While we await the Department of Health’s review of this updated plan, it’s important that DOD continues laying the groundwork for successful defueling and closure.“I’ve urged DOD to quickly name a Commander for the Task Force who will be responsible for Red Hill’s closure to ensure all components of the defueling process move forward in a timely manner. This Commander should be a leader who is committed to transparency, collaboration, and garnering community trust to get the job done. We all share one goal—safely defueling and permanently closing the Red Hill facility as quickly as possible and I expect this plan to get us closer to that important goal. As a Member of the Armed Services Committee, I’ll continue working with our Congressional delegation and the federal government to ensure this process continues moving forward.” ###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-statement-on-final-biden-administration-rule-reversing-harmful-trump-immigration-policy,"WASHINGTON, DC — Today, U.S. Senators Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the only immigrant serving in the Senate, released the following statement on the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) final “Public Charge” rule. This rule, which DHS Secretary Mayorkas finalized today, replaces the Trump administration’s xenophobic rule which made it significantly more difficult for many immigrants to become lawful permanent residents by lowering the threshold for who is likely to become a “public charge,” or someone primarily dependent on the government for assistance. Senator Hirono has led efforts in the Senate to block and reverse the Trump Administration’s discriminatory rule. Most recently, in April, Senator Hirono led 12 of her colleagues in submitting comments in support of the Biden Administration’s proposal.“As part of his all-out assault on immigrants, the former President made it significantly more difficult for hard-working immigrants, including those with U.S. citizen children, to enter the country or become lawful permanent residents. This xenophobic and deeply harmful wealth test not only prevented immigrants from accessing essential benefits they were entitled to but also created a climate of fear among immigrant communities. I heard from hardworking, taxpaying immigrants in Hawaii who were afraid to see their doctor, or access other essential services, even during the pandemic,” said Senator Hirono. “I’m very grateful to Secretary Mayorkas and the Biden Administration for reversing this discriminatory rule, and restoring stability for our immigrant families. DHS must now coordinate with other federal agencies and states to ensure consistent and accurate information is disseminated to all immigrant communities. Immigrants make our country stronger, and I will continue to fight to ensure they are welcomed into this country and treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.”  Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), an individual seeking permanent residency in the United States can be inadmissible if they are a determined to be a “public charge.” The INA does not define public charge and for the two decades prior to the Trump Administration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) only looked at whether an immigrant received cash assistance and government-funded institutionalized care to determine whether they were likely to become dependent on public assistance in the future.In 2019, the Trump administration lowered the threshold for becoming a public charge, making it more difficult for many immigrants, including many with U.S. citizen children, to become lawful permanent residents. The Trump rule counted assistance from many more programs, including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), housing and transportation benefits, most medical care and more. The Biden Administration’s updated regulation would roll back the Trump-era standards and exclude benefits related to public emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic or benefits accessed by dependents.In addition to leading formal comments in support of the Biden Administration’s efforts to replace the harmful changes established by the Trump Administration, Senator Hirono also introduced legislation that would have blocked federal funding for the implementation of the Trump Administration’s Public Charge rule. She has also introduced LIFT the BAR, legislation that would remove other barriers that deny immigrant families the healthcare and basic needs to live safer and more productive and secure lives.###"

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-warren-murray-duckworth-applaud-landmark-abortion-access-measure-for-veterans-amid-republican-attacks,"WASHINGTON, DC — Today, U.S. Senators Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Patty Murray (D-WA), and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) condemned Republican attacks on the Biden Administration’s landmark decision last week to allow the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to provide abortion care to veterans and their eligible dependents to protect the health and life of the woman and in cases of rape or incest. The action comes after Senators Hirono and Warren led Senators Murray, Duckworth and 21 Democratic colleagues in urging the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to immediately begin providing abortion services for veterans and eligible dependents following the far-right Supreme Court’s disastrous Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade.Because of the Dobbs decision, over 800,000—or half of women veterans in this country—live in states that are certain or likely to ban abortions. Prior to last week’s announcement, VA was prohibited from providing any abortion care or abortion counseling. Despite the landmark step forward to protect women’s health, Republicans have stated they will seek to block the VA’s efforts to provide abortion care in medical emergencies or case of rape or incest. Republicans in Congress have made clear they are “working to put a stop to” the policy announced by the Biden Administration, and Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall has even vowed to enforce his state’s abortion ban against VA doctors providing care in accordance with the new rule.“Following the Supreme Court’s disastrous ruling overturning the right to an abortion, nearly half of female veterans in this country live in states that are certain or likely to ban abortion, which is why we led our colleagues in calling on the VA to provide abortion services to the veterans it serves. We’re glad to see the VA quickly heeding our calls to begin offering abortion services in instances of rape, incest, and the life of a mother. This decision is an important step—one that will save lives,” said Senator Hirono. “But instead of applauding the VA, Republicans are falsely claiming that this ruling is ‘contrary to long-standing, settled law.’ They are using fear and confusion to sow chaos and deprive women of their fundamental rights, instead of standing up for the veterans who have served our country. It’s shameful—and we’ll keep fighting back every day.”“As Republican politicians strip away abortion rights, I'm glad that the Biden admin and the VA are taking critical steps to protect veterans’ rights to an abortion,” said Senator Warren. “I'm going to keep working with my colleagues to ensure the VA has the tools it needs to protect abortion care for all veterans.” “Last week, when the Biden Administration announced that for the first time ever VA will be able to provide abortion care to ensure none of our veterans or their eligible dependents will have to face medical emergencies, or stay pregnant after a rape or incest, I was excited to see meaningful progress to protect the right to abortion,” said Senator Murray. “And I was enraged to see yet another cruel, extreme reaction from anti-abortion Republicans who quickly made clear they want to block this proposal and take this care away from our veterans. It should be shocking to all of us that Republicans would put their own political ideology ahead of the wellbeing of our veterans—those who served our country in uniform and who put their lives on the line to keep us safe.”“I applaud Secretary McDonough’s leadership to help make sure that our Veterans have full access to the healthcare they need—including abortions. This decision could both save lives and enhance military recruitment and readiness,” said Senator Duckworth. “Our Veterans—who often have higher rates of chronic health conditions—have sacrificed the unimaginable for our nation and the last thing they should worry about is that our country will abandon them, risk their health and deny their fundamental rights. Just as we owe our Veterans the right to pursue having a family however they choose, we owe the heroes who risked everything overseas access to medically necessary care back at home—and for some Veterans, that includes abortions—and I’ll keep working to make sure this right is protected for all Americans.”The lawmakers were joined by Allison Jaslow, an Iraq War veteran and co-founder of Operation Liberty, a veteran-led, non-partisan effort to protect the reproductive freedom of U.S. servicemembers and veterans after the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe.“Thanks to action from the Administration, women veterans in states like Texas, Oklahoma, and Alabama - whether they were a patient of the VA before now or not- will now have somewhere to turn to get the reproductive health care that they may need, have earned, and deserve,” said Jaslow. “It's also heartening to see in the guidance that was issued last week, how much trust the VA is putting in patients who are seeking care, and the physicians they are getting that care from. This is a long-overdue policy change, but a necessary one in this moment of crisis. Make no mistake, this decision will save lives, and lawmakers who are vowing to fight to ensure that a total ban on abortion remains at the VA are misguided at best, and at worst, attacking veterans healthcare in an effort to advance a broader ideological agenda. Either way, it's unacceptable.”""Veterans and their families have always faced unique barriers to abortion access. But  following the devastating Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, abortion care has become even more difficult for veterans across the country to access,"" said Lindsay Church, Executive Director of Minority Veterans of America. ""This reality disproportionately harms racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ people, and service members, veterans, and their families living in poverty. The Department of Veterans Affairs has taken critical measures to lift restrictions that once made it impossible to get access to abortion counseling and care through VA, in order to provide services in the cases of rape, incest, and threats to the life and health of the patient. While we support the Department's efforts to expand care regardless of state law, VA can and must do more to protect a patient's right to make decisions for their own bodies, no matter their circumstance. Veterans fought for rights they are now being denied and it's on our policymakers to protect these rights swiftly and without delay.""###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-honors-workers-ahead-of-labor-day,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) released the following statement ahead of Labor Day:“On Labor Day, we honor working people in Hawaii and across the country who keep our communities and our economy running. Workers have helped keep us healthy, fed and safe over the past two and a half years, and as we continue to rebuild from COVID-19, they are central to our economic recovery. Working people play an essential role in our society, and far too many are still treated without the dignity and respect they deserve. That’s why I will continue to fight for safe working conditions, livable wages, fair contracts and more. It’s also why I’m working to pass legislation to protect and strengthen workers’ fundamental right to organize, bills like the PRO Act and my effort to organize public sector workers. All people deserve to be able to work and live in dignity, and I’ll never stop fighting to help ensure they can.”Senator Hirono is a strong advocate on behalf of working people in Hawaii and across the country. She is a cosponsor of the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act of 2021, which expands labor protections related to employees’ rights to organize and collectively bargain in the workplace. In 2019, Senator Hirono introduced legislation to strengthen rights for public employees to organize, act concertedly, and bargain collectively in states that do not afford these basic protections.###"

Hirono (D-HI) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) applauded the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) announcement that it will begin offering abortion services in cases of rape, incest, and the life of the mother. In July, Senators Hirono and Warren led 23 of their colleagues in calling on VA to immediately begin offering abortion services after the far-right Supreme Court’s disastrous Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Because of the Dobbs decision, over 800,000—or half of women veterans in this country—live in states that are certain or likely to ban abortions.Upon the VA's announcement, Senators Hirono and Warren released the following statement:“As the far-right Supreme Court and right-wing legislators work to eliminate the fundamental right to abortion, the federal government, including the VA, must do more to protect abortion access. That’s why we led our colleagues in calling on the VA to provide abortion care to the veterans it serves, millions of whom now live in states where abortion access has been restricted.“We’re glad to see the VA quickly heeding our calls to begin offering abortion services in instances of rape, incest, and the life of a mother. This is an important first step. The VA must go further and provide these services to all veterans, regardless of circumstances. It’s critical that women are trusted and free to make decisions about their bodies.”Veterans and CHAMPVA beneficiaries can learn more about VA reproductive health services here.In addition to Senators Hirono and Warren, the July 28th letter calling on VA to offer abortion services was also signed by Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Angus King (I-ME), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Edward J.

Earlier this month, Senator Hirono introduced the Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act to protect doctors against Republicans’ non-stop attacks and ensure they can safely provide abortion care in states where it is still legal. She also led a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services urging them to make medication abortion more easily accessible. In July, she introduced the Right to Contraception Act, as well as the Expanding Access to Family Planning Act, to protect access to critical reproductive health care services, like birth control, and cancer screenings. Senator Hirono also introduced the Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act of 2022, which clarifies that it is illegal for anti-choice states to limit travel for abortion services, and would empower impacted individuals to bring civil action against those who restrict a woman’s right to cross state lines to receive legal reproductive care. ###"

Hirono (D-HI), announced the release of a new commemorative quarter design honoring Edith Kanaka`ole. The quarter’s design is one of five released today by the United States Mint honoring prominent women in American history, including Bessie Coleman, Jovita Idar, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Maria Tallchief, as part of the Mint’s American Women Quarters Program. Senator Hirono previously urged the Mint to include Kanaka`ole as one of the women highlighted.“Edith Kanaka`ole was a prominent leader in the revitalization of Hawaiian language and culture—notably as a renowned kumu hula,” said Senator Hirono. “She helped preserve and spread Hawaiian language, traditions, and history, contributing so much to the Native Hawaiian community, Hawaii, and our nation. It is fitting that she be honored with this special recognition. I’m pleased to see the design for her commemorative quarter today, and I  look forward to seeing these quarters put into circulation, so that people in every corner of our country can learn more about Edith Kanaka`ole and her remarkable life.”Authorized by  the Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020, the American Women Quarters Program features coins with designs emblematic of the accomplishments and contributions of prominent American women. Contributions come from a wide spectrum of fields including, but not limited to, suffrage, civil rights, abolition, government, humanities, science, space, and the arts. The women honored come from ethnically, racially, and geographically diverse backgrounds. As required by the law, no living person will be featured in the coin designs, and thus all the women honored must be deceased. The Mint is issuing five coins with different reverse designs annually over the four-year period from 2022 through 2025.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/following-request-from-hirono-and-grijalva-gao-report-confirms-political-interference-in-trump-department-of-the-interior-grant-review-process,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), Chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, applauded the release of a new report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommending changes to the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) competitive grant making process in light of inconsistencies and irregularities found in multiple DOI bureaus’ grant review processes during the Trump Administration. Sen. Hirono and Chairman Grijalva first requested GAO investigate DOI’s grant and cooperative agreement review process in February 2020 after media reports of potential political interference in DOI-funded studies on health effects of mountaintop removal mining and the inspection program for offshore oil and gas production.“Federal grants should be awarded to applicants best-qualified to make use of them based on clearly laid out criteria,” said Senator Hirono. “This report is further proof that during the Trump Administration, politics often took priority over science, harming grant applicants and delaying their important work. I’m glad the Interior Department has agreed with the recommendations in this report, which will help ensure that future administrations award grants based solely on the merits of the application. I thank Chairman Grijalva for his partnership in this effort and GAO for conducting a thorough review that will help DOI better protect our environment and support federal grantees.”“This report confirms what we suspected and the Trump administration denied: disgraced former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke hired an unqualified football buddy to kill highly-ranked grant applications that he didn’t like. In textbook Trump fashion, Zinke’s buddy documented almost none of it so he wouldn’t have to defend his indefensible decisions to the American people. He killed jobs, educational opportunities for young people, and efforts to protect endangered species and address climate change,” said Chairman Raúl M. Grijalva, House Committee on Natural Resources.The report found that during the Trump Administration, political appointees in certain DOI bureaus, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), applied undue scrutiny to certain applications. “According to FWS officials, it appeared that the Senior Advisor, in particular, closely scrutinized applications focused on certain topics, such as endangered species and climate change, rather than considering the merit of individual grant applications or program policy factors, such as leveraging resources between similar programs,” the report reads.In light of these findings, GAO made two recommendations to better standardize the grant making process at DOI.

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-hosts-us-small-business-administrator-for-tour-of-oahu-small-business-centers,"HONOLULU, HI – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Small Business Committee, hosted U.S. Small Business Administration Administrator Isabella Guzman for a tour of organizations supporting small businesses and small businesses on Oahu. During the day-long event, Senator Hirono and Administrator Guzman visited centers focused on promoting Native Hawaiian and women-owned small businesses, as well as small- and medium-sized manufacturing businesses. The day-long tour is part of Hirono’s ongoing effort to support Hawaii’s small businesses as they continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. During the tour, Senator Hirono and Administrator Guzman highlighted how the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act will open up historic opportunities for small businesses and innovative startups here in Hawaii through historic investments.“Small businesses are an essential part of Hawaii’s economy, and I applaud them for their resiliency throughout the pandemic. I’m proud to have worked to secure billions in federal funding to help small businesses weather and rebuild from the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Senator Hirono. “I appreciated the opportunity to welcome Administrator Guzman to Hawaii to show her the innovative programs and initiatives taking place across our state to support small businesses and entrepreneurs, especially those from historically underserved communities. With help from federal programs like the Paycheck Protection Program, as well as other support from the Small Businesses Administration, Hawaii’s small businesses are in a strong position to continue serving our communities and our state for years to come. I also fought hard to pass the Inflation Reduction Act—which was recently signed into law—in order to not only lower costs for families, but also to support small businesses and innovative startups, while combatting climate change.”""Hard work and resilience are deeply ingrained in Hawaiian culture, and the small businesses here have truly demonstrated those qualities as they’ve met challenges, pivoted, innovated, and thrived. Small businesses help fuel our economy and create jobs, and I’m proud to partner with Senator Hirono to work with business owners, resource partners,  and local leaders so we can continue to support Native Hawaiian small businesses and women and veteran entrepreneurs and help them access the capital and resources they need to succeed,"" said Administrator Guzman. ""President Biden has set a tone for this Administration that we will put equity at the heart of everything we do. Advancing equity and access to resources and affordable capital for small business owners is a top priority at SBA. And with landmark new policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, small businesses will be even more prepared to seize new opportunities and continue leading the way in our economic recovery now and into the future.""The officials started their day meeting with the Native Hawaiian Organizations Association (NHOA), a trade association established to provide a unified voice for Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHOs). NHOs provide economic benefits to the State of Hawaii and the Native Hawaiian community by developing job opportunities, building the capacity of innovative industries, and supporting important social and economic programs. Photos of that meeting can be found here.They then visited the Patsy T. Mink Center for Business & Leadership (MCBL), which was established by YWCA Oahu, the U.S. Small Business Administration, and a community of partners to become the only Women’s Business Center (WBC) in Hawaii. WBCs are SBA resource partners designed to assist women in starting and growing small businesses, and seek to “level the playing field” for women entrepreneurs who still face unique obstacles in the business world. During the visit, they also met with Hawaii SBDC, which provides business counseling and related services to Hawaii small businesses on Kauai, Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii Island. Photos of that visit can be found here.Following that visit, Senator Hirono and Administrator Guzman toured the Hawaii Technology Development Corporation’s (HTDC) Entrepreneurs Sandbox, a community center for innovators of all ages. The Entrepreneurs Sandbox encourages creativity, technology, innovation and entrepreneurship and features a collaboration and event area ideal for town hall meetings and community gatherings, digital media studio, coworking space, meeting rooms, and a few small offices. Photos from that tour can be found here.Afterwards, they visited Iolani Palace before ending their day with a visit to Roy’s Restaurant in Hawaii Kai, which received more than $15 million in federal relief funding during the COVID-19 pandemic, helping to keep approximately 500 employees on payroll. Photos of those visits can be found here and here.As a member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Senator Hirono has worked to secure federal support for Hawaii’s small businesses and nonprofits throughout the COVID-19 pandemic—including through new programs like the U.S. Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF). Since the beginning of the pandemic, PPP has provided nearly $800 billion in forgivable loans to 11.8 million businesses and nonprofits in the United States, including $3.8 billion to 45,000 businesses and nonprofits in Hawaii—providing a lifeline for companies across the state. RRF has provided $28.5 billion in grants to 101,000 businesses, including $414.4 million in grants to 1,100 Hawaii businesses.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-convenes-reproductive-rights-working-group-for-follow-up-conversation-following-supreme-court-decision-overturning-roe,"HONOLULU, HI – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) convened a working group of local reproductive leaders and health care experts to discuss reproductive freedom in Hawaii and across the country. The conversation was a follow-up to a roundtable Senator Hirono previously hosted at the beginning of July shortly after the far-right majority on the Supreme Court issued its disastrous Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Attendees included representatives from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Hawaii Center for Nursing, Papa Ola Lokahi, Planned Parenthood Regional Office, and Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, as well as State Representatives and other women’s advocates. “Today I convened a second roundtable conversation to hear from leaders in government and health care across Hawaii about the state of abortion access and what more we can do to protect reproductive freedom in our state,” said Senator Hirono. “There is a lot of fear and confusion as a result of the Supreme Court’s disastrous decision, which is why it is so important that we make sure people know abortion remains legal in Hawaii. We are staying in touch with each other to make sure women in Hawaii have the information and resources they need, while working to expand access to abortion services.”  A long-time champion for abortion access, Senator Hirono is committed to protecting the fundamental right to abortion care for all. Earlier this month, Senator Hirono introduced the Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act to protect doctors against Republicans’ non-stop attacks and ensure they can safely provide abortion care in states where it is still legal. She also led a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services urging them to make medication abortion more easily accessible. In July, she introduced the Right to Contraception Act, as well as the Expanding Access to Family Planning Act, to protect access to critical reproductive health care services, like birth control, and cancer screenings. Senator Hirono also introduced the Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act of 2022, which clarifies that it is illegal for anti-choice states to limit travel for abortion services, and would empower impacted individuals to bring civil action against those who restrict a woman’s right to cross state lines to receive legal reproductive care. Video of Senator Hirono discussing the roundtable is available here###"

Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, toured TheBus Electric Fleet Charging Station with leaders from the City and County of Honolulu Department of Transportation Services (DTS) and Oahu Transit Services to highlight federal investments in Hawaii’s clean energy infrastructure. Earlier this month, the City and County of Honolulu received a $20 million federal Low or No Emissions (Low-No) grant from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to help expand its electric fleet. TheBus fleet currently includes 17 electric buses, and this additional federal funding will help the City and County add 36 to 38 more electric buses to its fleet as part of its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2045.“As we work to combat climate change, transitioning to electric vehicles is one of the most important things we can do to reduce carbon emissions and protect our environment,” said Senator Hirono. “That’s why Democrats fought to include historic investments in electric vehicles, including buses, and the infrastructure needed to operate them in both the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. Today—the beginning of TheBus offering free fares for a week—I toured an electric charging station in Honolulu and saw firsthand how these funds are working to benefit the thousands of people who rely on public transportation to get to work, while reducing our carbon footprint. I also had the opportunity to thank some of our bus drivers who have worked on the frontlines throughout this pandemic to keep our communities and our economy running. Thanks to these important pieces of legislation, I look forward to seeing Hawaii’s electric vehicle infrastructure continue to grow in the years ahead.”The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which Senator Hirono helped pass last year, includes $7.5 billion over five years for transit agencies to modernize their bus fleets, including over $5.5 billion for the Low-No Grant Program and nearly $2 billion for the Grants for Buses and Bus Facilities Program. Earlier this month, Senator Hirono also helped pass the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes $1 billion for Environmental Protection Agency grants to states or municipalities to cover the incremental cost of purchasing heavy-duty vehicles, like school and transit buses and garbage trucks.As Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Energy, Senator Hirono is working to expand the presence of electric vehicles and speed the transition to clean, renewable energy in Hawaii and across the country. In July, she convened a Subcommittee hearing on lowering energy costs that featured testimony from the President and CEO of Kauai Island Utility Cooperative about the long-term cost-savings offered by renewable power and electric vehicles. In June, she introduced legislation to require the Department of Defense to transition its fleet of non-combat vehicles to electric vehicles. Additionally, she also recently helped pass the Chips and Science Act, which includes billions in funding to support and accelerate Hawaii’s transition to clean, renewable electricity.Photos and b-roll video of the Senator’s tour can be found here###"

Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, met with local business owners and military leaders, and delivered remarks at the 2022 Daniel K. Akaka American Logistics Association (ALA) Hawaii Food Show & Conference. The ALA Hawaii Food Show features many products made in Hawaii, distributed solely in Hawaii, or unique to Hawaii, and helps to get these products in U.S. military commissaries and exchanges in Hawaii and around the world.

The festival was a celebration of the people, history, art, music, and cultures of Cambodia, Palau, and Hawaii. “As a proud Kaimuki High School graduate, I am glad to see Kaimuki highlighting the diversity of its student body with this inaugural event,” said Senator Hirono. “It was great to see staff members, and others from the community, interacting with and teaching the students about various aspects of their cultures. I enjoyed visiting my alma mater and getting to know some of the students—they represent the future of Hawaii. I will continue to support our public school students across Hawaii in the classroom and throughout their lives and careers.” The Senator participated in five different learning sessions with the students—she learned about preparing ingredients to make different Hawaiian, Palauan, and Cambodian dishes, and also practiced her lei making. Kaimuki High School hosted the event in partnership with the Asia Pacific Dance Festival, a production of the East-West Center Arts Program and the University of Hawaii Outreach College.

MA'O Farms is a local, organic farm and nonprofit organization that grows produce for local vendors and businesses. They also teach youth and other members of the community about improving health and nutrition, developing the local agriculture industry, and promoting sustainability and self-sufficiency.“Now, more than ever, it is important that we support our local farmers and businesses,” said Senator Hirono. “MA'O Farms promotes nutrition and sustainability in every aspect of their operations—from growing their own produce, to working with local vendors, and developing the next generation’s leaders in sustainable agriculture while teaching our communities about using local produce to lead healthier lives. I‘m proud to have worked to secure nearly $900,000 in federal aid for MA'O Farms in this year’s appropriations process. This funding will enable the creation of a new processing facility, and allow the farm to expand its operations and further advance its mission of developing a comprehensive local food system here in Hawaii.” Following the visit to MA'O Farms, Senator Hirono headed to Aloha Shoyu’s bottling facility in Kapolei, where she met with the Vice Presidents of the company and spoke with them about how the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages have impacted their business, and how they are working to address and recover from these challenges.“Since the start of the pandemic, small businesses like Aloha Shoyu have worked—and continue to work—hard to remain resilient and overcome many obstacles,” said Senator Hirono. “Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, small businesses across Hawaii—including Aloha Shoyu—received millions in federal funds which have enabled them to stay afloat during these unprecedented times. I will continue to work with my colleagues on the Small Business Committee to support and advocate on behalf of local businesses in Hawaii and across the country.”As a member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Senator Hirono has worked to secure federal support for Hawaii’s small businesses and nonprofits throughout the COVID-19 pandemic—including through new programs like the U.S. Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-and-kahele-urge-fcc-to-advance-broadband-and-spectrum-access-for-native-communities,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) and Representative Kaiali'i Kahele (D-HI), along with Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), and Martin Heinrich (D-NM) and Representatives Ed Case (D-HI) and Teresa Leger Fernández (D-NM) sent a letter to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel urging the FCC to consider more ways to advance Native communities’ access to and ownership of spectrum over their lands. According to a recent estimate from the American Indian Policy Institute, nearly a third of Tribal lands in the United States lack internet access.“Many rural and underserved communities in Hawaii have struggled with inequitable broadband access for years,” said Senator Hirono. “Expanding broadband services for Tribal Nations and other Native communities, including Native Hawaiians, will help alleviate disparities and enable access to crucial resources such as online education and telemedicine.”“In today’s digital era, equal opportunity is impossible without equal access to high-speed, reliable internet. Connectivity is key in ensuring that everyone can benefit from essential, modern day resources such as telehealth, online learning and remote job opportunities. Mahalo FCC Chairwoman Rosenworcel for your commitment to increase broadband access on Tribal lands, and I look forward to continuing our work with this administration to ensure Native communities across our country are not left behind,” said Congressman Kahele.Over 1.5 million people living on Tribal lands lack access to broadband services. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated this disparity, limiting access to telemedicine, virtual and remote learning, and public safety programs, among other services.“We ask that you continue to support the economic development of Tribal Nations and Native communities by working to advance their spectrum access and ownership,” said the lawmakers. “Advancing Native spectrum access and ownership is the best way for the FCC to work toward fulfilling the federal government’s trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations.”In the letter, the lawmakers recognize the Commission’s previous investments and commitments to advancing Tribal broadband and the Chairwoman herself has spoken to the necessity of bridging the digital divide that disadvantages many Tribal communities. Still, the lawmakers note that while “these steps are all important and commendable,” more can be done to facilitate economic development in these communities.“The need is clear,” concluded the lawmakers. “So is the solution: enhance Tribal self-sufficiency and self-governance by facilitating Tribal spectrum access and ownership.”The full text of the letter is available here.Senator Hirono has consistently advocated to expand access to broadband and emerging information technology for communities in need. During the pandemic, Senator Hirono supported numerous efforts to expand general access to broadband for businesses, workers and families, students, and others. Last year, she supported the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (P.L. 117-58), which Congress passed in November, to provide an historic investment of $65 billion to improve broadband access in local communities. ###"

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-presses-fbi-director-to-protect-native-hawaiian-community-during-judiciary-committee-hearing,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, pressed FBI Director Christopher Wray on what the Bureau is doing to protect the Native Hawaiian community from sexual exploitation at a full Judiciary Committee hearing. During the hearing, Senator Hirono highlighted how sexual exploitation disproportionately impacts Native Hawaiian women and children in the state of Hawaii.“According to the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, Native Hawaiian women and girls represent 67% to 77% of sex trafficking victims identified in recent studies,” said Senator Hirono during the hearing. “Native Hawaiians also represent 37% of reported child sex trafficking cases.”Senator Hirono also emphasized the need for the FBI to include the Native Hawaiian community in its efforts to address the missing and murdered Indigenous people crisis and violence against Native communities.“The federal government owes the same trust responsibility to Native Hawaiians as it does to American Indians and Alaska Natives,” said Senator Hirono during the exchange. “Even if [the Violence Against Women Act] doesn’t specifically allow for protection of Hawaiian women and children, there’s nothing that stops the FBI from including Native Hawaiian women and children as part of your charge.”A full transcript of Senator Hirono’s exchange with FBI Director Wray is below and a link to download video is available here.Senator Hirono: Let me turn to child sexual exploitation among Native Hawaiians. This kind of exploitation impacts Native Hawaiian children in the state of Hawaii disproportionately, and according to the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, Native Hawaiian women and girls represent 67% to 77% of sex trafficking victims identified in recent studies. Native Hawaiians also represent 37% of reported child sex trafficking cases and the federal government owes the same trust responsibility to Native Hawaiians as it does to American Indians and Alaska Natives.Bills like the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), where Native Hawaiian nonprofit organizations and tribal nonprofit organizations are both eligible for the same grant programs, but the VAWA bill fails to allow Native Hawaiian women and children to qualify for any type of support or innovation. So here’s my question: I hope that the Bureau will begin to include Native Hawaiians in your work to address the missing and murdered Indigenous people crisis, and violence against Indigenous people, because even if VAWA doesn’t specifically allow for protection of Hawaiian women and children, there’s nothing that stops the FBI from including Native Hawaiian women and children as part of your charge. Can you begin to talk about it and include them in your programmatic efforts?Director Wray: I will say that I think you put your finger on an important issue, and that our Honolulu office has been working very hard to target and aggressively pursue federal charges on known and repeat human trafficking offenders. And what they’re seeing, what they tell me, is that you’re seeing gangs and drug trafficking organizations exploit vulnerable victims, and in particular, the lion’s share—as you say with the statistics that you were citing—the lion’s share of that is on displaced or marginalized sectors, especially Native Hawaiians. And, in fact, I think it was just this past week, our Honolulu office recovered, I think, three minor females who were missing and at risk on the Big Island. And I know they’re very aggressively working that issue.Senator Hirono is a strong advocate for ensuring the federal government meets the trust responsibility owed to all Native Americans, including American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians, and is a longstanding supporter of programs and resources that uplift women and children. In May, she introduced a resolution designating May 5th as National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-colleagues-introduce-term-limit-measure-to-restore-balance-fairness-to-supreme-court,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – In an effort to restore balance and fairness to the nation’s highest court, Senators Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Brian Schatz (D-HI) introduced the Supreme Court Tenure Establishment and Retirement Modernization (TERM) Act, which would establish term limits for Supreme Court justices while preserving constitutional protections for judicial independence in decision-making. Under the TERM Act, a new justice would take the bench every two years and spend 18 years in active service.“Far-right groups have spent years working to tip the Supreme Court’s balance in their favor, leaving us with an outcome-driven Court that increasingly disregards precedent, separation of powers, and the rule of law,” said Senator Hirono. “We are already seeing the detrimental consequences of this right-wing power grab—from overruling common sense gun safety law, and restricting the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to combat climate change, to eliminating the fundamental right to abortion care. We need to restore balance and fairness to our nation’s highest court. Creating term limits for Supreme Court justices is a first step in that process.”The Supreme Court TERM Act would:As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hirono has consistently championed more robust ethics and accountability for the federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court. In May, she introduced a new version of the Twenty-First Century Court Act to promote accountability and increase transparency in federal courts. Two months prior, Senator Hirono joined a bicameral letter demanding answers regarding Justice Clarence Thomas’s potential violation of federal ethics law after reports on the efforts of his wife, Ms. Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Senator Hirono is also an original cosponsor of the Supreme Court Ethics Act of 2021, legislation directing the Judicial Conference of the United States to issue a judicial code of conduct for judges and justices of U.S. courts, including Justices of the Supreme Court.Far-right special interests have spent decades building a secretive network to pack the federal courts with judges selected to greenlight donor-friendly policies, and to run multi-million-dollar ad campaigns to keep those confirmations on track.  One estimate by investigative journalists valued this operation to capture our judiciary at more than $580 million.The American people strongly sense that the Supreme Court needs to be reformed.  A recent poll by the Associated Press found that 67 percent of Americans support term limits for Supreme Court justices. America is alone among modern constitutional democracies in allowing its high-court justices to serve for decades without term or age limits, resulting in some Presidents appointing no justices and others appointing as much as a third of the Court.  Regularizing appointments every two years will ensure a Supreme Court that is more representative of the nation, reflecting the choices of recently elected Presidents and Senators.The Supreme Court TERM Act would build on the existing retirement system for Article III judges, which the Court has repeatedly upheld as constitutional.  The bill would also preserve judicial independence by ensuring that Supreme Court justices who assume senior status remain fully compensated members of the federal judiciary for life, capable of exercising official duties on and off the bench for as long as they choose.Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA-04) introduced companion legislation last week in the House of Representatives.###"

Hirono (D-HI) joined Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) in sending a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) urging concrete actions the Department can take to help meet President Biden’s goal of protecting and expanding access to medication abortion. This letter comes ahead of the deadline set by the President's Executive Order Protecting Access to Reproductive Health Care Services. In their letter, the lawmakers urge the Department to protect access to medication abortion. Right-wing state legislatures across the country have passed laws banning the use of FDA-approved medication for abortion, further stripping away women’s access to abortion care and undermining the FDA’s authority to protect the nation’s public health.“For more than two decades, people have been using Mifepristone and misoprostol for medication abortion,” write the lawmakers. “Years of research have affirmed that medication abortion is safe and effective, and medication abortion now accounts for more than half of all abortions nationwide. Following the Supreme Court’s reckless decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, we agree with the Administration that it is more important than ever to defend and expand access to abortion for the 34 million women and girls of reproductive age who are at risk of losing access to this right.”In response to the Supreme Court’s devastating decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned nearly 50 years of judicial precedent, President Biden signed an Executive Order directing HHS to take action to protect access to medication abortion and to submit a report on those efforts within 30 days, which is this Sunday, August 7, 2022. Recommendations offered by the lawmakers could help the administration reach this goal.In the letter, the lawmakers commended President Biden’s executive order and outlined seven powerful steps that HHS could take in accordance with President Biden’s order to expand access to medication abortion: “We support your efforts to take all possible actions to protect abortion access, and as you work to meet this goal, we urge you to consider these options, which we believe will have the greatest impact on expanding access to medication abortion across the nation,” concluded the lawmakers.The full text of the letter is available here.A long-time champion for abortion access, Senator Hirono is committed to protecting the fundamental right to abortion care for all.

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-introduces-bipartisan-bill-to-eliminate-copays-for-veterans-accessing-contraception,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, joined Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Susan Collins (R-ME), and 17 of their Senate colleagues in introducing the bipartisan Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act to eliminate copayments for contraception covered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). While civilians can receive contraception without a copay through the Affordable Care Act and active duty servicemembers can receive health care—including basic contraceptive services—without copays through TRICARE, VA healthcare only waives contraception copays for a limited number of veterans. The legislation is originally authored by U.S. Representative Julia Brownley (D-CA) and was approved by the House of Representatives in June by a bipartisan vote of 245-181.“Access to contraception is a fundamental, constitutional right,” said Senator Hirono. “But while civilians and active duty servicemembers can access contraception free of charge, hundreds of thousands of veterans receiving VA care are still forced to pay out-of-pocket costs. We owe it to our veterans to ensure they receive the quality, comprehensive health care they deserve, including contraception.  The Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act will help do exactly that.”Under current law, only a restricted group of veterans, including 50 percent disabled veterans and veterans below specific income levels, are exempt from copayments for contraception. This legislation will eliminate out-of-pocket costs levied against countless veterans, including women who make up the fastest growing group of veterans enrolling in the VA healthcare system.   The Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act is also cosponsored by U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Angus King (I-ME), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Patty Murray (D-WA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Ron Wyden (D-OR).The full text of the legislation is available here.As a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, Senator Hirono is committed to supporting our nation’s veterans and enabling access to reproductive health care and contraception. Last month, she called upon the Department of Veterans Affairs to take immediate administrative action to offer abortions and all abortion-related services to veterans and eligible dependents. Senator Hirono also introduced the Right to Contraception Act to codify the fundamental and constitutional right to contraception. In June, she introduced the Affordability is Access Act to help ensure that people across the country can access and afford over-the-counter birth control options and plan their own reproductive lives, on their own terms.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-votes-to-pass-honoring-our-pact-act-to-expand-va-health-care-for-veterans,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, voted to pass the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, comprehensive, bipartisan legislation to expand VA health care for veterans with health conditions related to burn pit and Agent Orange exposure. Passage of the comprehensive, bipartisan legislation was delayed last week after 25 Republican Senators who had previously voted to advance the bill abruptly pulled their support, citing baseless political objections.As a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, Senator Hirono helped negotiate the bipartisan bill. Upon Senate passage, Senator Hirono released the following statement:“Millions of servicemembers have been exposed to burn pits and other toxic materials while enlisted in our armed forces,” said Senator Hirono. “They have risked their lives in service to our country, and we have a duty to ensure they receive the proper care and support for conditions caused by these toxic exposures. The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act meets our duty to these veterans by providing access to the care they need and deserve.“I am glad we’ve finally passed this critical bill, but it is shameful that passage was needlessly delayed by Republicans more interested in playing political games than delivering for our veterans. With the lives of toxic-exposed veterans hanging in the balance, depriving them of life-saving health care for even one additional day is completely inexcusable.“I look forward to seeing this bill signed into law, and I will continue working to help ensure that every veteran in Hawaii and across our country has access to high-quality care through the VA.”The legislation is named for Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson, who deployed to Kosovo and Iraq with the Ohio National Guard, and died in 2020 from toxic exposure as a result of his military service. Specifically, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022 will: The bill passed the House of Representatives earlier this month by a vote of 342-88 and now goes to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law.As a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, Senator Hirono is committed to supporting our nation’s veterans. In March, Senator Hirono helped pass in the Senate bipartisan legislation to expand access to breast cancer screening and care for veterans. She also introduced the Veterans and Family Information Act which required the VA to make information more accessible for non-English language speakers, enabling veterans and their families to better understand the benefits, programs, and resources available to them. Senator Hirono also introduced the Every Veteran Counts Act directing the VA to establish and regularly update a database of veterans’ demographic data.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-protect-doctors-from-republicans-anti-abortion-attacks,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono, joined Senators Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Alex Padilla (D-CA), and Jacky Rosen (D-NV) in introducing the Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act to protect doctors against Republicans’ non-stop attacks and ensure they can safely provide abortion care in states like Hawaii where it is still legal. The legislation would protect providers in states where abortion remains legal from any efforts to restrict their practice or create uncertainty about their legal liability. This week, the Senators will take to the Senate floor to seek unanimous consent to pass the legislation.“Republicans will stop at nothing to block people from accessing critical reproductive care, and now they’re trying to put health care providers in jail simply for doing their jobs,” said Senator Hirono. “The Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act will protect providers who offer reproductive services in states like Hawaii where abortion remains legal. I will continue to fight to protect the rights of all individuals to make decisions about their own bodies and their futures.”Republicans’ nonstop attacks against women’s reproductive freedom has long targeted doctors, with state laws like Texas’ SB8 allowing for anyone to bring a lawsuit against an abortion provider. But in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, these attacks have ramped up—with Republican state legislators drafting legislation that would make it a crime to perform an abortion on a state resident even in another state where abortion is legal. And already, abortion providers are facing non-stop attacks from Republican politicians, including Dr. Caitlin Bernard—an abortion provider who is facing legal threats after providing legal abortion care to a 10-year-old rape victim who was forced to cross state lines. Dr. Bernard’s case is emblematic of what abortion providers across the country are facing, as Republicans lob legal threats and intimidate doctors providing legal abortion care.The Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act will help protect against these attacks, ensuring that providers in states where abortion remains legal are protected from any efforts to restrict their practice or create uncertainty about their legal liability. Specifically, the bill will ensure that providers in states where abortion remains legal are protected from any efforts to restrict their practice or create uncertainty about their legal liability. It will: In addition to Senators Hirono, Murray, Luján, Padilla, and Rosen, the legislation is also co-sponsored by Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Ed Markey (D-MA), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Tina Smith (D-MN), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Jack Reed (D-RI), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL).The bill has been endorsed by: Dr. Caitlin Bernard, Physicians for Reproductive Health, the National Women’s Law Center, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Catholics for Choice, the National Partnership for Women & Families, the Center for Reproductive Rights, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and the National Council of Jewish Women.The full text of the legislation can be found here. A one-pager is available here.A long-time champion for abortion access, Senator Hirono is committed to protecting the fundamental right to abortion care for all. In addition to introducing the Right to Contraception Act last month, she also introduced the Expanding Access to Family Planning Act, to protect access to critical reproductive health care services, like birth control, and cancer screenings. Earlier this month, Senator Hirono also introduced the Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act of 2022, which clarifies that it is illegal for anti-choice states to limit travel for abortion services, and would empower impacted individuals to bring civil action against those who restrict a woman’s right to cross state lines to receive legal reproductive care. In May, Senator Hirono delivered a floor speech emphasizing the need to defend abortion rights. Earlier this year, she also introduced a resolution to honor abortion providers and thanked them in a floor speech on National Abortion Provider Appreciation Day. ###"

Hirono, member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senator Raphael Warnock (D-GA), along with 27 of their Senate Democratic colleagues, in calling on the Biden Administration to work urgently to increase the rate of refugee admissions for the remainder of Fiscal Year (FY) 2022. In a letter to President Joe Biden, the Senators further urge the President to maintain or increase the target of 125,000 refugee admissions in FY 2023 and take meaningful steps to meet this target.“According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), a record high of more than 89.3 million people, 42 percent of whom are children, were displaced at the end of 2021. The displaced population includes 27.1 million refugees,” the Senators wrote. “UNHCR estimates that in 2023 over two million refugees will need to be resettled. In our own region, Central America faces a growing refugee crisis, with more than 800,000 people who have sought refuge in neighboring nations or have been internally displaced… We urge your Administration to ensure that the United States scales up capacity to process refugees in these regions and across all nationalities with protection needs, particularly those who have been languishing in precarious situations awaiting resettlement, such as family reunification cases.”Since the enactment of the Refugee Act of 1980, the United States resettled an average of more than 80,000 refugees per year, until the Trump Administration slashed the refugee admissions ceiling each year it was in office, ending at an historic low of just 15,000 for FY 2021. These drastic cuts have hobbled the resettlement infrastructure in this nation and made it difficult to quickly rebuild the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). The U.S. resettled 11,411 refugees last fiscal year, the lowest figure since the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980.The Senators continued, “We commend you for recommitting the United States to its historic role as a global leader in refugee resettlement by setting a ceiling of 125,000 for FY 2022. However, we are deeply concerned that as of June 30, 2022, the United States has only resettled 15,100 refugees this fiscal year. Despite the challenges of rebuilding the USRAP that your Administration inherited, we can and must do better. The dismantling of programs by the Trump Administration has hindered our efforts to resettle more refugees, and as such, your Administration must take the necessary steps to promptly ensure the United States has a robust, functioning, durable refugee resettlement system.”The Senators concluded, “The success of [Operation Allies Welcome] and Uniting for Ukraine have proven that, under your leadership, our country is fully capable of bringing vulnerable displaced people to safety in the United States when you commit the government to doing so. We urge you to expeditiously and safely admit all qualified refugees who are waiting to be resettled. Additionally, we urge you to set a robust target for USRAP in FY2023 as soon as possible and devote sufficient resources to meet this target.”In addition to Senators Hirono, Durbin, and Warnock, the letter was signed by Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Ed Markey (D-MA), Angus King (I-ME), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Tom Carper (D-DE), Tina Smith (D-MN), Patty Murray (D-WA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Chris Coons (D-DE), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mark Warner (D-VA), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Jack Reed (D-RI), and Michael Bennet (D-CO).The full text of the letter to President Biden is available here and below.August 1, 2022Dear President Biden:We respectfully ask that you work urgently to increase the rate of refugee admissions for the remainder of Fiscal Year (FY) 2022. Furthermore, we urge you to maintain or increase the target of 125,000 refugee admissions in FY 2023 and take meaningful steps to meet this target.We applaud your Administration’s work to expeditiously bring to the United States 85,000 Afghan nationals, U.S. citizens, and lawful permanent residents through Operation Allies Welcome (OAW). Similarly, we commend your support for those displaced by Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine through the Uniting for Ukraine parole program, which has allowed Americans to welcome and support more than 20,000 people in just the first three months of its operation. The success of these initiatives demonstrates our government’s capacity to swiftly offer protection to vulnerable people fleeing war and persecution.According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), a record high of more than 89.3 million people, 42 percent of whom are children, were displaced at the end of 2021. The displaced population includes 27.1 million refugees. UNHCR estimates that in 2023 over two million refugees will need to be resettled. In our own region, Central America faces a growing refugee crisis, with more than 800,000 people who have sought refuge in neighboring nations or have been internally displaced. Haiti is also facing a rapid decline in internal security and a compounding political, environmental, and humanitarian emergency. In West Africa, amidst an ongoing civil war, Cameroon is facing high levels of internal displacement, as well as receiving thousands of foreign refugees. These are just a few examples of the current refugee challenges around the world. We urge your Administration to ensure that the United States scales up capacity to process refugees in these regions and across all nationalities with protection needs, particularly those who have been languishing in precarious situations awaiting resettlement, such as family reunification cases.Since the enactment of the Refugee Act of 1980, the United States resettled an average of more than 80,000 refugees per year, until the Trump Administration slashed the refugee admissions ceiling each year it was in office, ending at an historic low of just 15,000 for FY 2021. We understand that the Trump Administration’s drastic cuts to refugee admissions also hobbled the resettlement infrastructure in United States, with many refugee resettlement organizations closing offices and laying off employees.Combined with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and staffing vacancies resulting from a yearlong hiring freeze at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services imposed by the previous Administration, these cuts have made it difficult to quickly rebuild the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). Although you raised the refugee ceiling to 65,000 for FY 2021, the United States only resettled 11,411 refugees last fiscal year, the lowest figure since the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980.We commend you for recommitting the United States to its historic role as a global leader in refugee resettlement by setting a ceiling of 125,000 for FY 2022.

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/amid-troop-recruitment-and-retention-challenges-hirono-urges-dod-to-study-impact-of-offering-fertility-preservation-services-,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Amid troop recruitment and retention challenges, U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, urged the Department of Defense (DOD) to consider providing family planning options, including cryopreservation. In a letter sent today to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Hirono highlights that one of the top reasons individuals—particularly women—choose not to join, or leave the military is because of the impact serving has family planning—and that providing servicemembers with family planning options, including cryopreservation, could serve as a valuable recruitment and retention tool.Multiple studies—including a 2018 RAND study and a 2020 GAO study—found that issues related to pregnancy affect a women’s’ decision to stay in or leave the military. Cryopreservation—a process of preserving biological material by cooling the sample to low temperatures—is one way to address the concern and make it easier for servicemembers to continue to serve, which is why foreign military services, including the British Armed Forces, are increasingly offering cryopreservation for their servicemembers as a component of basic healthcare.“A TRICARE cryopreservation program would give servicemembers, particularly women, significant flexibility in deciding when to start a family,” writes Senator Hirono. “This could keep our military competitive with the civilian sector and serve as a retention tool among servicemembers who feel they must choose between their military career and having a family. We need to understand how providing family planning options, including cryopreservation, would impact servicemembers.Specifically, Senator Hirono is calling on DOD to conduct a study to:“No one should have to sacrifice their career in the military for starting a family,” Senator Hirono concludes. “We owe it to these servicemembers to ensure they have the tools and command support to begin a family when they choose, while continuing to serve our country. Additionally, increasing the number of the female recruits will be critical to not only reaching DOD’s diversity goals, but their recruitment goals as well. Providing family planning options could be a critical tool in making that happen.  We urge you study the offering and funding of cryopreservation services to our military personnel.”Last month, Senator Hirono offered an amendment to the FY2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to study the impact of cryopreservation on servicemembers.The full text of the letter is below and can be found here.Dear Secretary Austin,The Department of Defense has identified a number of factors that have led to significant recruitment and retention challenges.  One of the top reasons service members, particularly women, choose not to join, remain, or leave the Armed Forces is the impact military service has on family planning. I urge the Department of Defense (DOD) to consider how providing family planning options would impact servicemembers.      Pregnancy and childbirth present particular challenges for women serving in the military. Multiple studies—including a 2018 RAND and a 2020 GAO study—found that issues related to pregnancy affect a woman’s decision to stay or leave the military, especially the difficulty of timing pregnancies to fit within rigid career timelines.  There are many career field-specific medical restrictions while pregnant—such as the inability for pilots to be in a flight status or troops to move under weight of their equipment—that can impact a female servicemember’s decision on whether or when to become pregnant. These medical restrictions present particular challenges to career advancement as a pregnancy can impact deployability and duty assignment and force women of childbearing age to decide between starting a family or advancing their military career. While the military must do more to address pregnancy discrimination from within the ranks and better support women who have children while serving, providing servicemembers with family planning options, including cryopreservation, a process of preserving biological material by cooling the sample to low temperatures, could serve as a valuable recruitment and retention tool.This issue does not just impact women as both male and female servicemembers risk infertility due to combat-related injuries and toxic exposure, which often influences decisions to pre-emptively preserve the ability to have children post deployments. Across the U.S. and around the world, egg freezing and in vitro fertilization are starting to become more common as employer provided benefits in the civilian sector. Furthermore, foreign military services, like the British Armed Forces, are increasingly offering cryopreservation for their servicemembers as a component of basic healthcare. While U.S. servicemembers can currently access cryopreservation by paying out of pocket, many cannot afford the procedure.A TRICARE cryopreservation program would give servicemembers, particularly women, significant flexibility in deciding when to start a family. This could keep our military competitive with the civilian sector and serve as a retention tool among servicemembers who feel they must choose between their military career and having a family. We need to understand how providing family planning options, including cryopreservation, would impact servicemembers.I call on DOD to study the demand for cryopreservation among servicemembers, whether offering cryopreservation to servicemembers will lead to greater retention, and the cost of cryopreservation if offered to active-duty servicemembers. I urge DOD to conduct a study to: Evaluate multiple details concerning the desire for and feasibility of a program which would allow service members to freeze their eggs or sperm as a means to bolster force retention. Specifically, DOD should:The people who join the military already sacrifice an incredible amount in order to serve their country. No one should have to sacrifice their career in the military for starting a family. We owe it to these servicemembers to ensure they have the tools and command support to begin a family when they choose, while continuing to serve our country. Additionally, increasing the number of the female recruits will be critical to not only reaching DOD’s diversity goals, but their recruitment goals as well. Providing family planning options could be a critical tool in making that happen.  We urge you study the offering and funding of cryopreservation services to our military personnel.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-announces-1-billion-for-red-hill-closure-in-senate-appropriations-bill,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today announced the inclusion of $1 billion in funding for the defueling and closure of the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in the Fiscal Year 2023 Department of Defense spending bill released today by the Senate Appropriations Committee. This funding was included pursuant to the amount authorized in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)—which Senator Hirono secured as Chair of the Senate Armed Services Seapower Subcommittee. The full Senate is expected to consider this funding measure in a year-end omnibus package later this year. When enacted, this authorization and annual appropriation will give the U.S. Navy the direction and resources it needs to safely defuel and close Red Hill for good.  “The safe and timely defueling and closure of the Red Hill facility is of the utmost importance for the health and safety of families on Oahu,” said Senator Hirono. “That’s why I pushed DOD to close Red Hill and secured authorization for the $1 billion needed for the facility’s safe closure in this year’s NDAA. Following the request of the Hawaii delegation, the Senate Appropriations Committee provided this critical funding in their released defense appropriations bill. I will keep fighting to ensure the Senate passes this spending measure this year, getting us one step closer to the permanent closure of the massive facility. As we work to advance the closure of Red Hill, the Department of Defense needs to provide a detailed plan for this funding that addresses community concerns and prioritizes the safety of the people of Hawaii.”In an Armed Services Committee hearing earlier today, Senator Hirono questioned Brendan Owens, nominee to be Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment, about Red Hill and the Defense Department’s plan to the safe defueling and closure of the facility.

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-warren-lead-effort-urging-va-to-immediately-begin-offering-abortion-services-to-veterans-and-eligible-dependents,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) led 23 of their colleagues in calling on the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to take immediate administrative action to offer abortions and all abortion-related services to veterans and eligible dependents. Following the far-right Supreme Court’s disastrous Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade, over 800,000—or half of women veterans in this country—live in states that are certain or likely to ban abortions.Under current VA regulations, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is prohibited from providing abortions and abortion counseling as part of the medical benefits package. In a letter sent to VA Secretary Denis McDonough, the members highlight that because the VA has the statutory authority to provide abortions, they therefore must immediately begin a rulemaking process to change the current regulations and update the VHA’s medical benefit package to provide abortion and abortion-related services. The letter highlights that Secretary McDonough also recently expressed that the VA has the statutory authority to provide abortions. “Last month’s disastrous Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization overturned the nearly fifty-year precedent established by Roe v. Wade and removed constitutional protection for abortion access from millions of individuals in this country, including an ever-growing number of veterans and dependents who are able to become pregnant,” write the lawmakers. “This decision makes it even more critical that veterans receive access to the reproductive care to which they are entitled. Thus, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) must urgently begin rulemaking to allow veterans and eligible dependents to receive abortions and all abortion-related services.”  “We contend that the VA has the statutory authority and discretion to provide abortions and abortion-related services and resources,” the lawmakers continue. “The VA’s authority to provide care to veterans is established in the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996. That statute provides that the VA Secretary ‘shall furnish hospital care and medical services which the Secretary determines to be needed’ to certain veterans. Importantly, the VA has used its authority under the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 to provide reproductive care such as pregnancy care and infertility services, even though such care was initially excluded from the health care packages allowed under the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992.”In addition to Senators Hirono and Warren, the letter is also signed by Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Angus King (I-ME), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Edward J.

This decision makes it even more critical that veterans receive access to the reproductive care to which they are entitled. Thus, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) must urgently begin rulemaking to allow veterans and eligible dependents to receive abortions and all abortion-related services. Current regulations of the VA prohibit the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) from providing abortions and abortion counseling as part of the medical benefits package. Additionally, CHAMPVA, the VA’s insurance program for certain dependents and survivors of veterans, does not cover abortion services, unless the life of the mother is endangered.We contend that the VA has the statutory authority and discretion to provide abortions and abortion-related services and resources. The VA’s authority to provide care to veterans is established in the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996. That statute provides that the VA Secretary “shall furnish hospital care and medical services which the Secretary determines to be needed” to certain veterans. Importantly, the VA has used its authority under the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 to provide reproductive care such as pregnancy care and infertility services, even though such care was initially excluded from the health care packages allowed under the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992.Moreover, we agree with your testimony to the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee stating that the VA has the power to offer abortion services and abortion counseling “as a regulatory matter.” As you explained last week, “[i]t is a long-held view of the VA general counsel that [the Department is] not statutorily prohibited from providing abortion counseling or abortion services.”Finally, the VA has the authority to “provide medical care” to the dependents and survivors of veterans through CHAMPVA “in the same or similar manner” to dependents and survivors of service members.In FY 2020, approximately 550,000 women veterans used VA health care, and over 400,000 dependents and survivors accessed care through the CHAMPVA program. The VA must do everything in its power to provide critical reproductive care to veterans and their dependents across the country.We call on you to take swift and decisive action to ensure all of our veterans and CHAMPVA beneficiaries can access abortions and all abortion-related services.  ###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-urges-republicans-to-pass-the-right-to-contraception-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) called on her Republican colleagues to protect the right to contraception in a speech on the Senate floor. The Right to Contraception Act, legislation she introduced last week with Senators Edward J. Markey (D-MA) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), would codify the fundamental and constitutional right to contraception, which the Supreme Court first recognized more than half a century ago in its decision in Griswold v. Connecticut. Senator Hirono’s remarks were delivered right before Senator Markey asked the Senate to pass the Right to Contraception Act via unanimous consent, which Republicans objected to.  Senator Hirono highlighted many of the intentionally misleading statements Republicans have made about concerns about the Supreme Court overturning the right to contraception, including a colleague who said it was ‘pure hysteria.’ “This is not ‘pure hysteria’ to the millions of women across the country who woke up one morning in June and no longer had a constitutional right. When it comes to this far-right, agenda-driven Supreme Court, nothing is off the table, and nothing is ‘pure hysteria,’” said Senator Hirono in her remarks.  “Last month, the far-right majority on the Supreme Court overturned nearly 50 years of precedent and took away the constitutional right to get an abortion,” she went on to say. “This decision was the result of a decades-long effort by far-right Republicans and right-wing groups to pack the courts with politicians in robes, and they’re just getting started. For this MAGA majority, controlling women’s bodies doesn’t just stop at forcing women to give birth, they actually want to ban contraception.”The Right to Contraception Act was introduced after Justice Thomas signaled his intent to revisit Griswold v. Connecticut in his opinion to overturn Roe. Codifying the constitutional right to obtain contraceptives would protect against efforts by Republican-led states to restrict contraception and ensure that an overturning of the Griswold decision by the far-right Supreme Court majority would not endanger access to contraceptives. Last week, the House of Representatives voted 228-195 to pass its version of the Right to Contraception Act.In her remarks, Senator Hirono challenged comments made by Senate Republicans suggesting the right to contraception is not at risk. She highlighted the fact that several Republican-led state legislatures are already preparing to take away access to contraception, and urged her Republican colleagues to support the Right to Contraception Act.“So I say to my Republican colleagues—if any of you object this bill, come down to the Senate floor and tell the American people the truth,” said Senator Hirono. “Today, my Republican colleagues have a choice—do they support the right to contraception, and an individual’s right to make decisions about our bodies and our health care, or will they allow the government to tell millions and millions of women what to do?”The Right to Contraception Act would uphold access to contraception by:A long-time champion for abortion access, Senator Hirono is committed to protecting the fundamental right to abortion care for all. In addition to introducing the Right to Contraception Act last week, she also introduced the Expanding Access to Family Planning Act, to protect access to critical reproductive health care services, like birth control, and cancer screenings. Earlier this month, Senator Hirono also introduced the Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act of 2022, which clarifies that it is illegal for anti-choice states to limit travel for abortion services, and would empower impacted individuals to bring civil action against those who restrict a woman’s right to cross state lines to receive legal reproductive care.The full text of Senator Hirono’s remarks is below and video can be found here.As we focus on contraception rights this afternoon, listen to some of the comments made by my Republican male colleagues:“They’re not going to change the law on contraception.” ""There is zero threat of contraception being taken away."" ""Pure hysteria."" “I have no reason to believe these precedents are going to fall.”These are some of the statements by my Republican colleagues—all of them male, by the way—have made regarding contraception: ""Pure hysteria,"" they say.This is not “pure hysteria” to the millions of women across the country who woke up one morning in June and no longer had a constitutional right. When it comes to this far-right, agenda-driven Supreme Court, nothing is off the table, and nothing is “pure hysteria.”Last month, the far-right majority on the Supreme Court overturned nearly 50 years of precedent and took away the constitutional right to get an abortion. This decision was the result of a decades-long effort by far-right Republicans and right-wing groups to pack the courts with politicians in robes, and they’re just getting started.For this MAGA majority, controlling women’s bodies doesn’t stop at forcing women to give birth, they actually want to ban contraception. We know this because in his concurring opinion to overturn Roe, Justice Thomas wrote that the Supreme Court should re-consider—re-consider—the rulings that protect same-sex relationships, marriage equality, and yes, contraception.This kind of signaling by a Justice of the Supreme Court should be taken seriously. So my Republican colleagues saying, “they have no reason to believe” precedent will be overturned is resorting to magical thinking that no one should believe. After all, the Supreme Court just overturned a nearly 50 year precedent that women in this country relied on for nearly half a century—half a century, that’s two generations. In fact, radical MAGA Republicans in state legislatures across the country are gearing up.In Ohio, House Republicans introduced a bill that would effectively ban all abortions from the moment of conception, and potentially other forms of birth control like IUDs. Other Republicans have refused to rule out banning certain forms of contraception. We are living in a post-Roe world where our rights are on the chopping block. So no, this is not “pure hysteria.” The American public knows this. Democrats know this.So I say to my Republican colleagues—if any of you object to this bill, come down to the Senate floor and tell the American people the truth. Just be honest if you do not support guaranteeing the right to contraception, because in this post-Roe world, any suggestion that this Court won’t overturn precedent is no longer something to hide behind.But if my Republican colleagues do support the right to contraception, then they should have no problem with supporting our bill, which would create a statutory right for individuals to access contraception, protect the right of health care providers to provide contraceptives to their patients, and empower individuals by extending a private right of action against any state or government official that hinders these rights.Today, my Republican colleagues have a choice—do they support the right to contraception, and an individual’s right to make decisions about our bodies and our health care, or will they allow the government to tell millions and millions of women what to do?###"

              Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) called on her Republican colleagues to protect the right to contraception in a speech on the Senate floor. The Right to Contraception Act would codify the fundamental and constitutional right to contraception, which the Supreme Court first recognized more than half a century ago in its decision in Griswold v. Connecticut. Senator Hirono’s remarks were delivered right before Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA) asked the Senate to pass the Right to Contraception Act via unanimous consent.

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-allow-use-of-us-foreign-assistance-for-abortion-care-overseas,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Tina Smith (D-MN) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), introduced the Abortion is Health Care Everywhere Act, which would repeal the 1973 Helms Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act to ensure that U.S. foreign assistance may be used to provide the full scope of comprehensive health care, including safe and legal access to abortion services. The bill also includes language clarifying that under U.S. government policy, safe abortion care is a critical component of comprehensive maternal and reproductive care.“The fight to secure reproductive health care for all does not stop at our borders,” said Senator Hirono. “By ending the prohibition on foreign aid being used for abortion care, the Abortion is Health Care Everywhere Act will help expand access to critical reproductive services in some of the world’s most vulnerable communities. As we fight to defend fundamental reproductive rights in the U.S., this legislation will help millions around the world exercise their right to access comprehensive reproductive health care services.”The Helms Amendment endangers lives by prohibiting U.S. foreign assistance from being used for “the performance of abortion as a method of family planning” abroad. However, in practice, the Amendment has been applied as a total ban on U.S. foreign aid being used to provide any abortion care service—including the provision of information—even in cases of rape, incest, and life endangerment, despite exemptions for these specific cases in statute. According to research by the Guttmacher Institute, repealing the Helms Amendment would lead to 19 million fewer unsafe abortions and 17,000 fewer maternal deaths each year.Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) introduced H.R. 1670, the House companion bill, which now has 177 cosponsors.The full text of the legislation is available here.The Abortion is Health Care Everywhere Act is endorsed by a diverse coalition of more than 180 organizations including Advocates for Youth, American Jewish World Service, Catholics for Choice, Center for Reproductive Rights, Guttmacher Institute, Ipas, NARAL Pro-Choice America, Open Society Policy Center, PAI, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Population Connection Action Fund, and Population Institute.A long-time champion for abortion access, Senator Hirono is committed to protecting the fundamental right to abortion care for all.

Hirono (D-HI) voted to pass landmark legislation to invest in American innovation and strengthen domestic supply chains. The bipartisan Chips and Science Act includes historic investment in scientific research and development, funding to support Hawaii’s transition to renewable energy, and tens of billions in federal funding for the domestic manufacturing of semiconductors, which are used in everything from cars to cell phones. The bill also includes Senator Hirono’s STEM Opportunities Act, which provides funding for guidance, research, data collection, and other activities to promote opportunities for women and minorities in STEM at colleges and universities and federal science agencies.The Chips and Science Act passed the Senate by a vote of 64-33, and now heads to the House of Representatives for consideration.“Building strong and resilient supply chains is critical to ensuring the U.S. remains competitive in the 21st century,” said Senator Hirono. “The Chips and Science Act delivers the robust funding needed to strengthen our supply chains while also providing historic investment in our nation’s research and development infrastructure to help ensure the United States remains the global leader in innovation. I’m especially glad that this bill includes several provisions to diversify our innovation ecosystem by building pathways for women, people of color, and other marginalized communities to pursue careers in science and research, including my STEM Opportunities Act.

Hirono (D-HI), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Patty Murray (D-WA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) announced their effort to pass the Right to Contraception Act this week in the Senate, following passage of companion legislation in the House of Representatives last week. Senator Hirono introduced the Right to Contraception Act last week with Senators Markey and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) to codify the right to contraception, which the Supreme Court first recognized more than half a century ago in its decision in Griswold v. Connecticut. Codifying the constitutional right to obtain contraceptives would protect against efforts by Republican-led states to restrict contraception and ensure that an overturning of the Griswold decision by the far-right Supreme Court majority would not endanger access to contraceptives. The senators will move forward on Wednesday to pass the Right to Contraception Act through unanimous consent on the floor of the Senate.“Overturning Roe has wreaked havoc across the country, and radical Republicans are just getting started,” said Senator Hirono in her remarks. “Everyone in this country needs to realize that nothing is off the table, and that’s why we must now protect the right to contraception. Our bill, the Right to Contraception Act, would create a statutory right for individuals to access contraception. This bill also protects the right of health care providers to provide contraceptives to their patients. It also empowers individuals by extending a private right of action against any state or government official that hinders these rights. We need to put every single Republican on the record on whether they support the right to contraception and, indeed, the right to bodily autonomy.”In the wake of a disastrous Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade and Justice Thomas’ concurring opinion that sets the stage for further erosion of Americans’ right to make decisions about their reproductive health care, this legislation would safeguard Americans’ right to access and use contraception; guarantee medical providers’ ability to inform their patients of and disseminate a range of contraception options, including emergency contraceptives; and provide the Department of Justice and others the legal recourse to enforce this right as states across the nation rollback bedrock privacy protections.In addition to Senators Hirono, Markey, and Duckworth, the Right to Contraception Act has been cosponsored by Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Tom Carper (D-DE), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Jack Reed (D-RI), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Tina Smith (D-MN), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Mark Warner (D-VA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI).  The Right to Contraception Act is endorsed by Planned Parenthood Federation of America, NARAL Pro-Choice America, National Women’s Law Center, National Organization for Women, Power to Decide, National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, Reproductive Health Access Project, Catholics for Choice, Association of Maternal & Child Health Programs, Upstream USA, National Center for Lesbian Rights, National Partnership for Women & Families, Jewish Women International, Positive Women’s Network-USA, and the National Council of Jewish Women.The full text of Senator Hirono’s remarks is below and video is available here.Overturning Roe has wreaked havoc across the country, and radical Republicans are just getting started. I’m proud to stand here with my colleagues.For this far-right Supreme Court and MAGA Republicans, controlling women’s bodies doesn’t just stop at forcing women to give birth. They actually want to ban contraception. In his concurring opinion to overturn Roe, Justice Thomas wrote, “The Supreme Court should next reconsider the rulings that protect access to contraception, same-sex relationships, and marriage equality.”This is called signaling.When a far-right Supreme Court Justice, now in the majority, signals—we have to pay attention. Justice Alito always said that the original Roe decision was wrongly decided back when it was decided. So the same time, radical Republicans in state legislatures across the country are gearing up. In Ohio, House Republicans introduced a bill that would effectively ban abortions from the moment of conception and potentially other forms of birth control, such as IUDs. Other Republicans have refused to rule out banning certain forms of contraception.Everyone in this country needs to realize that nothing is off the table, and that’s why we must now protect the right to contraception. Our bill, the Right to Contraception Act, would create a statutory right for individuals to access contraception. This would be a national bill. This bill also protects the right of health care providers to provide contraceptives to their patients, it also empowers individuals by extending a private right of action against any state or government official that hinders these rights. We need to put every single Republican on the record on whether they support the right to contraception and, indeed, the right to bodily autonomy.You know what the bottom line is? Who should have control over our bodies—us or a bunch of politicians? And we say, it should be us.And on the way over here, I ran into a group of young people—they were in high school and in college—and they were putting together a quilt that says ‘Support ERA’ because their argument is that if we were to ratify the ERA, then all these protections—that Clarence Thomas has signaled should be subject to revisit by the Supreme Court—would all be protected. These young people get it. They are in the fight now because they know that their rights are being taken away. It gives me hope that those of us, when I was in college, abortion was not legal. And then it’s been legal for 50 years, and to think that a right that we thought we had and we fought for, is being taken away after 50 years, and therefore all these young people have fewer rights than we had—it is amazing to me.And as one of my friends, who happens to be the Vice President now, said at one of our judiciary committee hearings—is there anything we can force men to do that comes close to what we are forcing women, and people who can bear children, to do in this country, and the person who testified could not think of anything. But I look at the men here—what if government were to tell you that you all had to go get vasectomies? Think about it. And to force women to bear children, not to have bodily autonomy, from the moment of conception—that’s where this country is heading, and that’s why we need this law.A long-time champion for abortion access, Senator Hirono is committed to protecting the fundamental right to abortion care for all. In addition to introducing the Right to Contraception Act last week, she also introduced the Expanding Access to Family Planning Act, to protect access to critical reproductive health care services, like birth control, and cancer screenings.

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-urges-biden-to-address-challenges-families-with-low-incomes-and-underserved-communities-face-amid-formula-shortage,"WASHINGTON, D.C. –U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) urged President Biden to address the specific barriers to accessing and affording formula that participants in the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program and other members of underserved communities face. In a letter to the President, Senator Hirono highlighted the fact that, even as the Administration takes steps to alleviate the nationwide formula shortage, WIC participants and people living in low-income, rural, and underserved communities—such as migrant farmworker families—still face difficulties in physically accessing and affording formula. Senator Hirono requested that a portion of the formula being flown in under Operation Fly Formula be set aside and distributed to WIC vendors in underserved communities, and that steps are taken to ensure these families are provided with the necessary information so they can access the formula.“No parent should have to worry about how to keep their child fed,” wrote Senator Hirono in her letter. “In fiscal year 2020, 6.2 million participants were served each month by the WIC program, which included nearly 50 percent of all infants born in the United States. Many of these 6.2 million participants rely on the WIC program to cover formula expenses, which can total hundreds of dollars each month for one dependent.”Currently, WIC purchases cannot be made online, meaning that participants can only use their benefits in brick and mortar stores. With barren shelves and limited formula options, this shortage poses a significant access barrier for WIC participants. “Many are forced to choose between driving hours to find formula that can be purchased with WIC benefits or paying high out of pocket prices online,” wrote Senator Hirono.This crisis has also impacted migrant farmworker families. In addition to facing time, financial, and language barriers, farmworker migrants often do not participate in federal food assistance programs due to ineligibility or fear of being denied green cards as a relic of the Trump administration’s xenophobic “Public Charge” rule. “Migrant farmworkers keep our nation fed,” wrote Senator Hirono. “They should not be forced to worry about how to keep their own families fed.”Specifically, the letter requests:“Getting our physical and online store shelves restocked with formula during this nationwide shortage is of utmost importance. However, we cannot leave behind some of our most vulnerable community members,” concluded Senator Hirono in her letter. “Taking these steps will help level the playing field and make progress on ensuring that everyone—no matter their income, language, profession, or location–has access to formula necessary to feed our nation’s children.”Since the start of the formula shortage, Senator Hirono has consistently worked to address this crisis and has advocated on behalf of families across the country. In May, she sent a letter to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) urging them to expedite their efficient and thorough investigation of Abbott Nutrition’s Sturgis facility and to develop a long-term plan to alleviate future problems with supply and distribution, including any coordination with other federal partners, to help prevent future shortages. Senator Hirono also joined a letter urging President Biden to assign a White House coordinator on infant formula to address the shortage and implement a national strategy to increase the resiliency of the infant formula supply chain and protect against future contamination and shortages.The full text of the letter is available here and below.President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20500Dear Mr. President:Thank you for your recent efforts to alleviate our nation’s formula shortage by launching Operation Fly Formula. By July 24, this operation will have brought in over 61 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of formula to help caregivers all across the country feed some of our nation’s youngest and most vulnerable children. However, serious challenges remain for caregivers to physically access formula as well as afford escalating formula prices. These challenges are especially acute for those participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC program, and those living in low-income, rural, and underserved communities such as migrant farmworker families. No parent should have to worry about how to keep their child fed. As such, we request that you make specific accommodations, detailed below, to ensure that WIC participants and these communities are able to access and afford the formula they need to feed their children.According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Economic Research Service (ERS), in fiscal year 2020 6.2 million participants were served each month by the WIC program, which included nearly 50 percent of all infants born in the United States. Many of these 6.2 million participants rely on the WIC program to cover formula expenses, which can total hundreds of dollars each month for one dependent. In fact, a study conducted by USDA ERS found that between 2004 and 2006, between 57 and 68 percent of all formula sold in the U.S. was purchased through the WIC program.Currently, WIC purchases cannot be made online, meaning that participants can only use their benefits in brick and mortar stores. Usually, when store shelves are fully stocked with a full suite of formula options, this might not be a significant obstacle for program participants. However, at a time when store shelves are barren, offering only a few different options that might not meet the needs of the consumer, this can become a significant access barrier for WIC participants. As a result, many are forced choose between driving hours to find formula that can be purchased with WIC benefits or paying high out of pocket prices online. Indeed, reports have indicated that some formula flown in via Operation Fly Formula have been only available via online purchase, excluding access WIC participants and forcing them to compete with the general population to find formula on store shelves.This crisis is impacting migrant farmworkers especially hard. Of WIC program participants, as of 2018 nearly 30,000 were farmworker migrants. According to the Department of Labor National Agricultural Workers Survey from 2019-2020, one-third of all migrant farmworkers are women and one-half of all migrant farmworkers live with one or more minors. Many migrant farmworker mothers are unable to breastfeed their children for long periods of time, due to the nature of their work. As such, reliance on formula is high within those communities.Like WIC participants, time and money are often in short supply for farmworkers to obtain formula. Additionally, farmworker migrants often do not participate in federal food assistance programs either due to ineligibility or fear of being denied green cards as a relic of the Trump administration’s xenophobic “Public Charge” rule. Furthermore, language barriers often prevent farmworkers from knowing where and when they can access formula and can make them susceptible to scams. Migrant farmworkers keep our nation fed. They should not be forced to worry about how to keep their own families fed.We appreciate the administration’s recent announcement on steps that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is taking that will strengthen resiliency in WIC. These long-term improvements will help prepare us for any future crisis. However, the time required to implement these steps will likely outlast the current crisis. As such, to help alleviate the myriad barriers that these caregivers are immediately facing in order to feed our nation’s children, we request the following:Getting our physical and online store shelves restocked with formula during this nationwide shortage is of utmost importance. However, we cannot leave behind some of our most vulnerable community members. Taking these steps will help level the playing field and make progress on ensuring that everyone – no matter their income, language, profession, or location – has access to formula necessary to feed our nation’s children.Thank you for your attention to this matter.  Sincerely,###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-announces-20-million-in-additional-federal-funding-to-keep-keiki-fed,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) announced that Hawaii will receive $20 million in additional assistance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to keep keiki fed. The funding, some of which was authorized in the Keeping Kids Fed Act that Senator Hirono helped pass in both the House and Senate before it was signed into law last month, is meant to help Hawaii address supply chain issues and food inflation in its school meal programs.“Growing up, my school had to create a special program so I could “earn” my lunch by working as a cashier in the cafeteria,” said Senator Hirono. “I knew even as a young girl that it is wrong for any child to go hungry at school for lack of lunch money, which is why I’ll keep fighting to do everything I can to make sure our keiki are fed. I’m glad that, thanks in large part to the bipartisan legislation we passed earlier this year, Hawaii will receive 20 million in additional federal funding to help ensure all of our children have enough to eat. As we work to rebuild from the COVID-19 pandemic, this funding will help ease the burden on educators, child care providers, and families throughout our state.”Senator Hirono has consistently worked to help ensure all keiki in Hawaii have enough to eat. In June, she helped pass the Keeping Kids Fed Act, which provides critical funding and flexibility to get children healthy meals over the summer and next year as schools and nonprofits continue to deal with supply chain challenges and high food prices. She also joined a letter calling for an extension of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) child nutrition waivers ahead of their expiration and a robust set of child nutrition priorities. In March, she signed a similar letter and cosponsored legislation to extend these waivers through next September. Senator Hirono also led the Hawaii delegation in urging the USDA to take whatever steps necessary to prevent thousands of children and families from being forced into food insecurity. In April, she also met Hawaii Department of Education officials to discuss the need to extend flexibilities that have allowed schools to continue feeding students throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.The funding comes from an increase in the reimbursement rate schools and child care providers receive for free and reduced-price meals they serve. Effective July 1, 2022, the reimbursement schools receive for each meal served will increase by approximately $0.68 per free/reduced-price lunch and $0.32 per free/reduced price breakfast. Other reimbursement rates, including rates for paid school meals and child care meals, are available online.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-deutch-reintroduce-bicameral-legislation-to-strengthen-and-expand-social-security,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) and Representative Ted Deutch (D-FL) re-introduced the Protecting and Preserving Social Security Act, legislation that would strengthen Social Security’s financial state and ensure that seniors continue to benefit from the programs they have paid into throughout their lives.“Social Security is a cornerstone of our nation’s social safety net that helps millions of seniors, people with disabilities, and other vulnerable Americans pay for essentials like food and housing,” said Senator Hirono. “While our country continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting increase in cost of living expenses, people deserve to know Congress won’t ever let these benefits—which people have worked for throughout their lives—dry up. The Protecting and Preserving Social Security Act will strengthen the system so qualified recipients get the benefits they deserve now and for decades to come, while also making sure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share.”This bill will make significant progress toward extending the Social Security lifeline. According to the Social Security Administration’s Office of the Chief Actuary, the Protecting and Preserving Social Security Act is expected to extend the date of projected depletion of the OASI and DI Trust Fund Reserves from 2035 to 2052. The bill would also reduce the federal deficit by approximately $12.3 trillion by the end of the 75-year projection period.“Social Security ensures that hardworking Americans can retire with dignity ,” said Congressman Deutch. “And yet, this crucial lifeline is on track for depletion by 2035. Every day, I hear stories from seniors in my district about the importance of their Social Security checks to their quality of life and to their day to day survival. This bill will not only continue these lifesaving benefits but strengthen them for decades to come.”The Protecting and Preserving Social Security Act aims to improve the Social Security system’s fairness, solvency, and benefits. Specifically, the bill: “With prices rising, it's more important than ever for Social Security's annual cost of living adjustments to reflect the real expenses beneficiaries face every day. The Protecting and Preserving Social Security Act would do just that, by updating the formula used to calculate the adjustments. Furthermore, it ensures that when families lose a loved one, they aren't unfairly required to pay back a full month of the deceased's Social Security benefits,” said Nancy Altman, President of Social Security Works. “This wise legislation makes these important improvements while restoring Social Security to long-range actuarial balance by requiring that the highest-paid workers contribute to Social Security all year long, just like the rest of us. Social Security Works enthusiastically endorses this common-sense legislation and thanks Representative Deutch, along with Senator Hirono, sponsor of the Senate counterpart bill, for their important leadership on this issue.”“The proven economic impact of the Social Security program deserves the type of constructive legislative action that Senator Hirono and Representative Deutch have proposed in the Protecting and Preserving Social Security Act,” said Max Richtman, President and CEO, National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. “The millions of members and supporters of our organization are in lock-step with seniors nationwide who have been asking for fairness in how the Social Security payroll tax is applied.  If all wage earners pay the 6.2% payroll tax, as this bill requires, Social Security’s solvency can be extended until 2052. Seniors also need the proposed COLA formula, the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly, that more accurately reflects their spending priorities to help ensure their Social Security benefits are keeping up with rising inflation. It’s worth noting that while Social Security benefits are a lifeline for most seniors, the disabled and their families, the benefits also provide a significant stream of financial strength to our state and local communities. This bill will help fortify Social Security, seniors and the economy. It’s a worthy proposal that needs to become a worthwhile law.”“The Protecting and Preserving Social Security Act will protect the Social Security benefits Americans have earned through a lifetime of work,” said Richard Fiesta, Executive Director of the Alliance for Retired Americans. “It will extend the solvency of the trust fund by requiring wealthy Americans pay their fair share into the Social Security system. It's just  wrong that working  Americans pay a higher percentage of their income into Social Security than millionaires and billionaires do. Our 4.4 million retiree members commend Representative Deutch and Senator Hirono for their leadership on this critical issue. We also thank them for their 100% lifetime pro-retiree scores in the Alliance’s annual Congressional Voting Record.”The full text of the bill is available here.In addition to Senator Hirono, the Protecting and Preserving Social Security Act is cosponsored by Senators Tina Smith (D-MN) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR).Senator Hirono has been a strong advocate for Social Security and has consistently worked to ensure Social Security recipients get the benefits they have earned. In 2020, she introduced the Social Security COVID Correction and Equity Act, legislation that provided temporary emergency relief for Social Security beneficiaries, and corrected the formula used for determining benefits to prevent substantial cuts for individuals turning 60.  ###"

              Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI) urges the Senate to advance legislation to provide additional, guaranteed funding for the Title X Family Planning Program in a speech on the Senate floor.
              "
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-pushes-to-strengthen-federal-family-planning-services-in-senate-floor-speech,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI) urged the Senate to advance legislation to provide additional, guaranteed funding for the Title X Family Planning Program in a speech on the Senate floor. The Expanding Access to Family Planning Act, legislation she introduced with colleagues earlier this week, would protect access to critical reproductive health care services—like birth control, cancer screenings and more—by providing a consistent and strong source of funding for the Title X Family Planning Program. Senator Hirono’s speech was delivered immediately before Senate Republicans blocked the legislation from moving forward.In 2019, the Trump Administration implemented a dangerous gag rule prohibiting providers who receive Title X funds from informing patients about the full range of reproductive health care options available to them, including abortions. This resulted in all Hawaii clinics rejecting Title X funding and thousands of women in Hawaii losing access to critical family planning services. While the Biden Administration reversed that rule, this legislation would protect access to reproductive care by statutorily requiring providers to inform patients of all of their options, including abortion and abortion services.As the right-wing majority on the Supreme Court and MAGA Republicans work to eliminate reproductive freedoms, the Expanding Access to Family Planning Act would help ensure everyone can continue to access the family planning services they need.“As the right-wing Supreme Court and MAGA Republicans work to eliminate reproductive freedom, it’s critical we protect and strengthen Title X,” said Senator Hirono in her remarks. “That’s exactly what the Expanding Access to Family Planning Act will do. This bill would nearly double funding for Title X family planning services by providing $500 million in mandatory funding for Title X for each of the next 10 years. It will also ban Title X providers from discriminating against patients and require pregnancy counseling services receiving Title X funds to provide patients with all of the information about their options. Republicans have made clear that they will do anything to get rid of our reproductive freedoms—so we must pass this bill to make sure this program isn’t at the whim of those trying to strip us of our healthcare.”  In her remarks, Senator Hirono also highlighted the disastrous impacts of the Title X gag rule implemented by the Trump Administration, which banned Title X providers from sharing information with patients about how they could access abortion services.“This gag rule wreaked havoc across the country,” Senator Hirono continued. “It forced providers to decide whether they wanted to receive Title X funding knowing that health care providers wouldn’t be able to provide women with accurate and comprehensive information or say no to this critical family planning funding that supports women across the country through clinics like Planned Parenthood and other non-profits.  In my home state of Hawaii, the entire network of Title X clinics said no to this dangerous rule and rejected the funding, forcing our state to foot the bill. But ultimately, this resulted in a loss of services to thousands of women. Overall, Trump’s rule slashed Title X’s patient capacity in half.”Specifically, The Expanding Access to Family Planning Act would:A long-time champion for abortion access, Senator Hirono is committed to protecting the fundamental right to abortion care for all. This week, she introduced the Right to Contraception Act. This legislation, backed by over half of the Senate Democratic caucus, would codify the fundamental and constitutional right to contraception. Senator Hirono also introduced the Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act of 2022, which clarifies that it is illegal for anti-choice states to limit travel for abortion services, and would empower impacted individuals to bring civil action against those who restrict a woman’s right to cross state lines to receive legal reproductive care.In June, Senator Hirono led several initiatives relating to abortion care and reproductive health. She led her colleagues in urging the Department of Defense to take immediate steps to support and protect female servicemembers seeking abortion services, and introduced the Affordability is Access Act (AAA) to help ensure access to over-the-counter birth control options. Senator Hirono also introduced the My Body, My Data Act, legislation to protect personal reproductive health data by minimizing the information collected and retained, and preventing that information from being disclosed or misused; the bill would protect reproductive health data from sources like fertility tracking apps.The full text of Senator Hirono’s remarks is below and video is available here.M. President, I rise today in support of the Expanding Access to Family Planning Act, which will help ensure millions of Americans can continue receiving family planning services through the Title X program.For more than forty years, Title X has helped ensure hundreds of thousands of women regardless of income, background, insurance status, or hometown—have access to basic reproductive health care, including wellness exams, cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases.While this program—which was created with bipartisan support—has been around for decades, we’ve seen what happens when MAGA Republicans are in control. President Trump slashed funding for Title X and imposed a dangerous domestic gag rule that banned doctors from telling people how they could access abortion services.This gag rule wreaked havoc across the country. It forced providers to decide whether they wanted to receive Title X funding, knowing that health care providers wouldn’t be able to provide women with accurate and comprehensive information, or say no to this critical family planning funding that supports women across the country through clinics like Planned Parenthood and other non-profits.  In my home state of Hawaii, the entire network of Title X clinics said no to this dangerous rule and rejected the funding, forcing our state to foot the bill. But ultimately, the gag rule resulted in a loss of services to thousands of women. Across the country, Trump’s rule slashed Title X’s patient capacity in half—jeopardizing family planning and contraceptive care for 1.6 million patients nationwide.While President Biden reversed this rule, we can’t take anything for granted. As the right-wing Supreme Court and MAGA Republicans work to eliminate reproductive freedom, it’s critical we protect and strengthen Title X. That’s exactly what the Expanding Access to Family Planning Act will do.This bill would nearly double funding for Title X family planning services by providing $500 million in mandatory funding for Title X for each of the next 10 years. It will also ban Title X providers from discriminating against patients and require pregnancy counseling services receiving Title X funds to provide patients with ALL of the information about their options.Republicans have made clear that they will do anything to get rid of our reproductive freedoms—so we must pass this bill to make sure this program isn’t at the whim of those trying to strip us of our healthcare.  While Republicans continue to attack our fundamental rights, Democrats are doing everything we can to protect them. That’s why, in addition to this important bill, earlier this week, I introduced legislation to codify the right to contraception.This is about who gets to make decisions about our bodies, women, or a bunch of right-wing politicians. I believe—and the American people overwhelming agree—individuals, not politicians, should be making these deeply personal decisions. Our Right to Contraception Act and the Expanding Access to Family Planning Act will help ensure they can.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-highlights-urgent-need-to-restrict-access-to-military-style-assault-weapons-amid-nations-gun-violence-epidemic-at-judiciary-committee-hearing,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, emphasized the need to restrict widespread civilian access to military-style assault weapons amid the nation’s gun violence epidemic at a full Judiciary Committee hearing. During the hearing, Senator Hirono condemned the right-wing majority on the Supreme Court for making it easier for individuals to access military-style assault weapons and asked policy experts about the dangers of these weapons of war. Senator Hirono has long advocated for stronger gun safety laws, and has redoubled her advocacy following the recent mass shootings in Buffalo, Uvalde, Highland Park, and elsewhere.Specifically, Senator Hirono asked Dr. Kyleanne Hunter, a senior political scientist for the RAND Corporation, questions regarding the need to collect better information and transparent data on incidents of gun violence in order to develop comprehensive, evidence-based gun safety legislation.“As a public health issue, shouldn’t we be able to have a lot more information about incidents of gun violence?” asked Senator Hirono during the hearing. “Gun death is the highest cause of death for young people in our country, you would think that we would want to better understand the causalities and what we can do.”Senator Hirono also expressed concern that state-level gun safety laws, including Hawaii’s, would be challenged, in light of the recent Supreme Court decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen. In an exchange with Duke University Law Professor Joseph Blocher, Senator Hirono expressed doubt as to whether the right-wing majority on the Supreme Court would support national or state bans on assault weapons or large capacity magazines, and she reiterated the need to limit civilians’ ability to purchase military-style assault weapons.“The Supreme Court is not asking the question of whether or not, or how often these kinds of assault weapons—however way we describe them—are used in self-defense,” said Senator Hirono. “They’re asking whether it’s dangerous and unusual, and when you have 20 million of these kinds of items in our environment, that’s not particularly unusual. That’s why this is a Supreme Court that is moving us toward enabling more and more people to own all kinds of guns, and we are already awash in guns in our country.”A full transcript of Senator Hirono’s question line is below and a link to download video is available here.Senator Hirono: Dr. Hunter, would you consider gun violence in our country a national health issue?Dr. Hunter: Absolutely, it is a public national health issue.Senator Hirono: A public health issue, and therefore, as a public health issue shouldn’t we be able to have a lot more information about incidents of gun violence, and perhaps why—black women, for example—would go out and buy guns in this environment?Dr. Hunter: Absolutely, evidence-based public health approaches to solving problems is something that is essential. We have seen it with motor vehicle accidents, we have seen it in approaching the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and meaningful solutions to include legislation, as well as public investiture in private companies to make better decisions, as well as informing consumers to make better decisions, comes from transparent data. And right now, as researchers, we don’t have that data to give you the best information possible to make the laws—a comprehensive set of laws—that are going to keep us safe.Senator Hirono: I agree with you, and as our colleague testified that gun death is the highest cause of death for young people in our country, you would think that we would want to better understand the causalities and what we can do. Professor Blocher, after Bruen, I would say that there’s going to be a lot of questions about various state laws that may fit within the Bruen kind of a situation, including, by the way, Hawaii. I don’t know if you’re familiar with the fact that Hawaii has some of strictest gun laws in the country, and probably the lowest gun violence rate in our country. And already after Bruen, the Supreme Court has already sent a case challenging Hawaii’s laws back to the Ninth Circuit for a new ruling. So after Bruen, would you expect a lot more challenges to state law, such as in Hawaii’s case? And what does that do for state’s efforts to lower gun violence in their states?Professor Blocher: Thank you for the question, Senator, not only would I expect it, I think we have already seen it—cases that have been sent back down for further consideration in light of historical record; issues which we thought to be resolved by prior Second Amendment cases, including the constitutionality of prohibitions like Highland Park’s municipal assault weapons ban, I think absolutely will be relitigated. My hope and expectation is that judges will recognize what then-Judge Amy Coney Barrett wrote in a dissenting opinion when she was on the Seventh Circuit, which is that history is consistent with common sense. And the framing generation understood that dangerous persons could be disarmed. Likewise, they understood that dangerous and unusual weapons could be prohibited, and so I hope that the juris prudence continues to reflect that fact.Senator Hirono: Well, after Bruen, do you think that this Supreme Court will sustain a national ban on assault weapons and do you think this Court would support a state’s ban on assault weapons? And what about bans on large capacity magazines, do you think that the Supreme Court would sustain such bans, at either the national or state levels?Professor Blocher: One of the difficult things about answering the question is the degree to which Bruen has introduced uncertainty, but here’s how I would think it through—in lead up to Bruen, anyway, such laws had faired extremely well in Second Amendment litigation, so there is a juris prudence that already exists. Courts upheld these laws under a variety of different rationales, some concluding that those weapons are dangerous and unusual, and therefore, fall outside of the scope of the Second Amendment; some courts concluding that the government had a sufficient interest, and that these laws are sufficiently tailored to that interest—some of those certainly will be relitigated.Here’s, I think, three factors at least we can consider, in predicting the Supreme Court’s response: One is that the Court has again affirmed that dangerous and unusual weapons can be prohibited, and in Heller, an opinion by Justice Scalia, the Court equated dangerous and unusual weapons with M-16s and the like. And for all the reasons you’ve heard today, AR-15s and M-16s are different but they are similar, and the “and the like” may include AR-15s as well. There’s an argument that these weapons are in common use, the National Shooting Sports Foundation often points to the fact that 20 million have been sold in the past few decades, I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of that number, but I would say that 20 million assault weapons in circulation in the past few decades does not mean 20 million assault weapons owners. That ownership is probably concentrated in a much smaller proportion of gun owners, who themselves are a minority of the American population, so we’re maybe talking about 4-5 million Americans out of 300+ million, also 20 million weapons is only 5 percent of the civilian weapons stock—I’m not sure whether that constitutes “common” or not.What I really want to know, to be able to evaluate the question—and what I hope the Supreme Court would ask in light of Bruen, which directs us to consider the burdens on self-defense—is how often are these weapons used in self-defense in comparison to their use in gun massacres and mass shootings? We heard today an earlier example where one was, but when Maryland’s prohibition on assault weapons was challenged, neither the challengers nor law enforcement could point to a single example of a Maryland-er using an assault weapon for self-defense. And if that’s the case, and if we take the industry and Justice Thomas—for that matter—at their word that these are “modern sporting rifles,” then I think they’re two times removed from the historical interest in self-defense.Senator Hirono: Well, the thing is, the Supreme Court is not asking the question of whether or not, or how often these kinds of assault weapons—however way we describe them—are used in self-defense. See, that is not the question they’re asking. They’re asking whether it’s dangerous and unusual, and when you have 20 million of these kinds of items in our environment, that’s not particularly unusual. That’s why this is a Supreme Court that is moving us toward enabling more and more people to own all kinds of guns, and we are already awash in guns in our country.Last month, Senator Hirono voted to pass the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to take meaningful steps to make communities safer from gun violence, which was signed into law by President Biden. In a Judiciary Committee hearing at the beginning of June, Senator Hirono highlighted the need for gun safety laws and questioned experts about how to combat the growing domestic terrorism threat in the U.S.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-markey-duckworth-introduce-bill-to-codify-the-right-to-contraception,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined Senators Edward J. Markey (D-MA) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) in introducing the Right to Contraception Act. This legislation, backed by over half of the Senate Democratic caucus, would codify the fundamental and constitutional right to contraception, which the Supreme Court first recognized more than half a century ago in its decision in Griswold v. Connecticut.“For this far-right results-oriented Supreme Court and MAGA Republicans, controlling women’s bodies doesn’t just stop at forcing women to give birth, they actually want to ban contraception,” said Senator Hirono. “Everyone in this country needs to realize that nothing is off the table for MAGA Republican controlled state governments and this Court—and we need to act now to protect the right to contraception. We need to put every single Republican on the record on whether they support the right to contraception, or whether they will allow states and this Court to stop millions and millions of women from making decisions about their own health care.”The introduction follows Justice Clarence Thomas’ concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization—overturning Roe v. Wade—in which he urged the Court to reconsider its 1965 Griswold decision. Several states have already restricted access to contraception by cutting off public funding for it, defining abortion broadly enough to include contraception, and allowing health care providers to refuse to provide services related to contraception based on their own personal beliefs.The Right to Contraception Act would uphold access to contraception by:On July 14, Representative Kathy Manning (D-NC) introduced the companion bill (H.R. 8373) in the House of Representatives, which the House is expected to vote on later this week. The White House issued a statement of support the Right to Contraception Act on Monday.The full text of the legislation is available here.In addition to Senators Hirono, Markey, and Duckworth, this legislation is cosponsored by Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CN), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Tom Carper (D-DE), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Chris Murphy (D-CN), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Jack Reed (D-RI), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Tina Smith (D-MN), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Mark Warner (D-VA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI).The Right to Contraception Act is endorsed by Planned Parenthood Federation of America, NARAL Pro-Choice America, National Women’s Law Center, National Organization for Women, Power to Decide, National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, Reproductive Health Access Project, Catholics for Choice, Association of Maternal & Child Health Programs, Upstream USA, National Center for Lesbian Rights, National Partnership for Women & Families, Jewish Women International, Positive Women’s Network-USA, and the National Council of Jewish Women. “With Justice Thomas's concurring opinion, the far-right Supreme Court has put its game plan in plain sight: overturn Roe, then come for contraception,” Rebecca Hart Holder, Executive Director, Reproductive Equity Now. “At this moment of crisis, we need to do everything in our power to protect reproductive health care, and that starts with codifying the right to contraception. Thank you to Senators Markey, Hirono, and Duckworth for leading this fight in the Senate and making it crystal clear that reproductive health care is a non-negotiable human right.”“No amount of funding for or access to contraception will ever negate the need for abortion. However, as we face the loss of abortion access in roughly half of the states, protecting and expanding access to quality, affordable birth control has never been more critical,” Clare Coleman, President and CEO of the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association. “We commend Sens. Markey, Hirono, and other co-sponsors of the Right to Contraception Act for removing barriers to care so that everyone who wants or needs birth control can access it without interference. We look forward to continuing to work with our champions to protect reproductive health for all.”“Power to Decide is proud to stand with Senators Markey and Hirono, and the many legislative champions who are supporting the Right to Contraception Act,” Raegan McDonald-Mosley, MD, MPH, CEO, Power to Decide. “We share your frustration that measures like this are still so necessary, when millions of people across the country already struggle to access contraception and other basic health care they need. We urge members of Congress to take this important step to ensure everyone has the opportunity to protect their reproductive well-being, now and in the future.”A long-time champion for abortion access, Senator Hirono is committed to protecting the fundamental right to abortion care for all. This week, she introduced the Expanding Access to Family Planning Act, to protect access to critical reproductive health care services, like birth control, and cancer screenings. Senator Hirono also introduced the Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act of 2022, which clarifies that it is illegal for anti-choice states to limit travel for abortion services, and would empower impacted individuals to bring civil action against those who restrict a woman’s right to cross state lines to receive legal reproductive care.In June, Senator Hirono led several initiatives relating to abortion care and reproductive health.

Hirono (D-HI) joined Senators Tina Smith (D-MN), Patty Murray (D-WA), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), along with 32 Democratic colleagues in the Senate, in introducing the Expanding Access to Family Planning Act. The bill would protect access to critical reproductive health care services—like birth control, cancer screenings and more—by providing a consistent and strong source of funding for the Title X Family Planning Program.“As MAGA Republicans work to deprive people across the country of fundamental reproductive care, it is essential that we protect Americans’ access to family planning services,” said Senator Hirono. “Thousands of people in Hawaii and across the country rely on the Title X Family Planning Program for essential reproductive health care, but the program’s unreliable funding makes it susceptible to attacks from radical Republicans. By securing strong, long-term funding for the Title X program, the Expanding Access to Family Planning Act will help ensure everyone can continue to access the critical family planning care they need and deserve now and in the future.”The Title X Family Planning Program is the only federal program dedicated to providing comprehensive family planning and preventive health services. Hundreds of thousands of Americans rely on the program for essential health care. In 2020 alone, over 1.5 million patients received family planning services through Title X. Title X is funded through the annual appropriations process, which subjects the program to an unpredictable funding stream that is insufficient to meet the national need.

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-colleagues-introduce-tax-filing-simplification-act-of-2022,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), joined Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and 21 of their colleagues in introducing the Tax Filing Simplification Act of 2022. This legislation would simplify the tax filing process for millions of Americans, saving them hours and hundreds of dollars. Along with lowering costs and eliminating red tape for all taxpayers, simplified filing tools would ensure that more eligible people – including millions of low-income Americans – receive important tax refunds, like the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit. According to recent polling, 77% of Americans support this legislation.“We should be making it easy for individuals and families to file their taxes, but our complicated system results in too many people spending far too much time and money every year,” said Senator Hirono. “The Tax Filing Simplification Act will help change that. By simplifying the filing process, this bill will save filers time and money, and help ensure everyone—especially families and individuals with low incomes—receive the tax refunds they qualify for.”This legislation follows years of issues with the Free File program, which was outsourced by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to the tax prep industry and serves just 3% of taxpayers when 70% are eligible. Longtime Free File Alliance member Intuit has been sued for scamming taxpayers into paying for filing services that should have been free, and faced reports of ongoing abuse of revolving door tactics to defend the broken tax filing system. The Government Accountability Office recently recommended that the IRS develop additional options for free online filing, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen agreed that investing in truly free and simple tax filing tools like those proposed in this legislation is “definitely a priority.”The Tax Filing Simplification Act makes several changes to simplify and decrease the costs of the tax filing process for millions of American taxpayers by:  The full text of the legislation can be found here.

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-senate-democratic-colleagues-press-va-secretary-to-end-discrimination-against-same-sex-spouses,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono, member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee (SVAC), joined Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) and 40 of their Senate Democratic colleagues in sending a letter to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Denis McDonough requesting answers and speedy action to ensure same-sex veteran couples have access to the full and complete spousal benefits they are owed.“Each of our veterans and their spouses deserve the same quality care and services once they leave the military—no matter who they love. Our veterans and their families, who selflessly served our nation and have sacrificed so much, must be afforded the benefits they have so rightly earned. This is not only a matter of fairness and equity, it is the morally right thing to do,” wrote the senators. “Yet, we have recently heard from numerous survivors about issues they are facing when they attempt to access the full Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits that they are entitled to under the law.”In the letter, the senators underscored reported examples of VA’s refusal to deem same-sex marriages as having met the statutory marriage duration or deadline requirements when couples were legally barred from marrying within that timeframe immediately before the veteran’s death. The senators highlighted how denying benefits in cases where same-sex couples failed to meet marriage duration requirements have left them ineligible for benefits due to living in places where marriage laws barred them from marrying—even though they were in loving, committed relationships and would have married earlier if they could. Whereas other federal agencies like the Social Security Administration took action to accept and reconsider claims for survivor benefits by same-sex spouses and partners who were previously unable to meet marriage duration requirements, VA has failed to provide recourse for same-sex couples held back by unconstitutional and discriminatory laws. The senators called for VA to make eligible for benefits bona fide same-sex relationships who have been denied benefits solely because they could not meet a strict marriage durational requirement.In addition, the senators noted VA’s setting of effective dates for benefits deepens the unconstitutional practice of same-sex marriage bans. Even after the Department of Justice announced that it would no longer enforce laws banning benefits to same-sex spouses of veterans, VA interpreted the announcement to apply retroactively, but only “as to claims for benefits based on same-sex marriages that were pending on direct review as of” the date of the Attorney General’s announcement, cutting short benefits of those in same-sex marriages who initially applied for such benefits, and were denied due to bans on same-sex marriage. The senators made clear that VA must end its discriminatory treatment of veterans’ spouses based on who they love, and apply effective dates as though the former unconstitutional laws were never enacted.The senators conclude, “We promise to take care of all our veterans after they serve our country, and that includes ensuring that their partners have access to full and complete spousal benefits. Correcting this error will help end the discriminatory treatment of potentially thousands of same-sex veteran couples and allow them to access the benefits they are owed.”In addition to Senators Hirono and Murray, the letter was also signed by Senators Warnock (D-GA), Duckworth (D-IL), Blumenthal (D-CT), Baldwin (D-WI), Markey (D-MA), Luján (D-NM), Smith (D-MN), Hassan (D-NH), Whitehouse (D-RI), Murphy (D-CT), Sanders (D-VT), Gillibrand (D-NY), Heinrich (D-NM), Durbin (D-IL), Warren (D-MA), Klobuchar (D-MN), Menendez (D-NJ), Casey (D-PA), Kaine (D-VA), Schumer (D-NY), Cortez Masto (D-NV), Bennet (D-CO), Padilla (D-CA), Wyden (D-OR), Reed (D-RI), Shaheen (D-NH), Warner (D-VA), Booker (D-NJ), Merkley (D-OR), Rosen (D-NV), Feinstein (D-CA), Peters (D-MI), Brown (D-OH), Cantwell (D-WA), Coons (D-DE), Cardin (D-MD), Schatz (D-HI), Leahy (D-VT), and Kelly (D-AZ).This letter follows a similar letter Senator Hirono signed last December to Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen and Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service Charles Rettig calling for the Biden Administration to revise current guidance that has led to members of the LGBTQ+ community being denied pension survivor benefits after losing their life partner. That request is still under review with the agency.Full text of the letter is available here and below.Dear Secretary McDonough:We write to inquire about the discriminatory treatment of certain same-sex veteran couples who are being denied full and complete spousal benefits. We must ensure that the unconstitutional laws of the past do not further harm the surviving loved ones of our country’s LGBTQ+ veterans.Each of our veterans and their spouses deserve the same quality care and services once they leave the military – no matter who they love. Our veterans and their families, who selflessly served our nation and have sacrificed so much, must be afforded the benefits they have so rightly earned. This is not only a matter of fairness and equity, it is the morally right thing to do.Yet, we have recently heard from numerous survivors about issues they are facing when they attempt to access the full Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits that they are entitled to under the law. It has come to our attention that VA is refusing to deem same-sex marriages as having met the statutory marriage duration or deadline requirements when the couples were legally barred from marrying within that timeframe immediately before the veteran’s death. For example, dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) benefits may only be awarded if the surviving spouse was married to the veteran for at least one year or within 15 years of the veteran’s discharge, and for eight years in the case of enhanced DIC benefits. Survivor’s pension benefits also have a one-year marriage duration requirement.By denying benefits in cases where same-sex couples failed to meet marriage duration requirements, VA ignores the reality that discriminatory marriage laws where these couples lived barred them from marrying—even though they were in loving, committed relationships and would have married earlier if they could. It was not until the Supreme Court held in Obergefell v. Hodges a constitutional right to marry that same-sex relationships were properly recognized, including the “constellation” of rights associated with marriage, such as the “rights and benefits of survivors.”  After courts found unconstitutional the nine-month marriage duration requirement under the Social Security Act when applied to same-sex couples who were barred from meeting the requirement due to discriminatory marriage laws, the Social Security Administration began accepting and reconsidering claims for survivor benefits by same-sex spouses and partners who were unable to be married for the requisite nine months because of these bans on same-sex marriage. VA should do the same for veterans survivor benefits. Just like the unconstitutional laws banning same-sex couples from marrying, denials for veterans benefits that are tied to those marriage bans are unconstitutional too.Specifically, VA must make eligible for benefits bona fide same-sex relationships where either the same-sex couple had married but were prevented from being married for the time required under the statute, or where they were prevented from marrying each other at all. While marriage duration requirements may be defensible as a proxy for detecting or deterring sham relationships between opposite-sex couples—who have always enjoyed the right to marry—they cannot serve that function for same-sex couples who were barred from marrying one another. Surviving same-sex partners and spouses of veterans who were unable to marry because of now unconstitutional marriage laws should not be denied benefits solely because they did not meet a strict marriage durational requirement. We urge VA to be mindful of other past, discriminatory practices that upended the lives our veterans and their families – like the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy – and look primarily to the surviving partner’s own statements about whether and when they would have married but for unconstitutional bans on same-sex marriage.It also has come to our attention that VA’s setting of effective dates for benefits furthers these unconstitutional same-sex marriage bans. After the Supreme Court held that the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages under state law in June 2013, the Department of Justice subsequently announced on September 4, 2013, that it would no longer enforce laws banning benefits to same-sex spouses of veterans. The VA General Counsel interpreted the announcement to apply retroactively but only “as to claims for benefits based on same-sex marriages that were pending on direct review as of” the date of the Attorney General’s announcement. For claims received or re-applied for after the Attorney General’s announcement, “such claims could receive an effective date up to one year prior to receipt of the claim, but in no event earlier than September 4, 2013.”By setting an effective date no earlier than September 4, 2013, VA is giving credence to the unconstitutional laws that prevented same-sex spouses from obtaining veterans benefits in the first place. A spouse married to an opposite-sex veteran would have had no issues receiving benefits immediately. However, VA is cutting short benefits of those in same-sex marriages who initially applied for such benefits and were denied due to bans on same-sex marriage. Moreover, any delay by a widow of a same-sex veteran in filing a claim for spousal benefits can be directly linked to VA’s enforcement of unconstitutional laws that would have led to the ultimate denial of such benefits. VA must stop its discriminatory treatment of veterans’ spouses based on their sex or sexual orientation, and apply retroactive effective dates as if the unconstitutional laws struck down by the Supreme Court were never enacted. Prior claims not previously appealed should be permitted to be reopened, as well as new claims to be filed.We promise to take care of all our veterans after they serve our country, and that includes ensuring that their partners have access to full and complete spousal benefits. Correcting this error will help end the discriminatory treatment of potentially thousands of same-sex veteran couples and allow them to access the benefits they are owed. Thank you for your attention to this important matter, and we look forward to hearing back from you soon. Sincerely, ###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-protect-the-right-to-cross-state-lines-to-seek-abortion-care,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined Senators Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Patty Murray (D-WA), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) in introducing the Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act of 2022. The bill clarifies that it is illegal for anti-choice states to limit travel for abortion services, and would empower the Attorney General and impacted individuals to bring civil action against those who restrict a woman’s right to cross state lines to receive legal reproductive care.“Now that Republican-controlled states have free-reign to make abortion illegal, many women will be forced to travel to other states to seek reproductive care,” said Senator Hirono. “Just when we thought Republicans couldn’t go any lower, they’re now trying to prohibit interstate travel to seek health care—and prosecute those who do. Democrats introduced a bill to help make sure this won’t happen. The Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act will help ensure people across our country can safely exercise their constitutional right to travel, including to seek or provide reproductive care, without fear of legal prosecution. I will continue to do everything in my power to protect the right of all individuals to make decisions about their bodies and their futures.”Legislation introduced in Missouri and draft legislation proposed by anti-choice extremists illustrate that interstate travel for reproductive health care is under attack. The Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act of 2022 underscores the Constitutional protections for interstate travel and provides redress for women whose rights are violated. The legislation would also protect health care providers in pro-choice states, like Hawaii, from prosecution and lawsuits for serving individuals traveling from other states.A long-time champion for abortion access, Senator Hirono is committed to protecting the fundamental right to abortion care for all. Earlier this month, she convened a working group of Hawaii reproductive leaders to discuss the impact the Supreme Court’s decision will have on women in Hawaii, how to better support access to reproductive care in the state, and how public officials, physicians, and organizations can work together to better support women across the country.In June, Senator Hirono led several initiatives relating to abortion care and reproductive health. She led her colleagues in urging the Department of Defense to take immediate steps to support and protect female servicemembers seeking abortion services, and introduced the Affordability is Access Act (AAA) to help ensure access to over-the-counter birth control options. Senator Hirono also introduced the My Body, My Data Act, legislation to protect personal reproductive health data by minimizing the information collected and retained, and preventing that information from being disclosed or misused; the bill would protect reproductive health data from sources like fertility tracking apps.In addition to Senators Hirono, Cortez Masto, Whitehouse, Murray, and Gillibrand, the legislation is also cosponsored by Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CN), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Jack Reed (D-RI), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Chris Murphy (D-CN), Tina Smith (D-MN), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Chris Coons (D-DE), Ed Markey (D-MA), Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).The full text of the legislation can be found here.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-introduces-bipartisan-bill-to-prohibit-non-disclosure-agreements-in-cases-of-sexual-misconduct,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to introduce the Speak Out Act, a bipartisan bill that would prohibit predispute non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) in instances in which sexual harassment or sexual assault has been alleged in violation of federal, tribal, or state law and in situations in which survivors wish to break their silence.“For too long, non-disclosure agreements have been abused to silence survivors of sexual assault and harassment and protect those who perpetrate these crimes,” said Senator Hirono. “The use of NDAs to stop survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment from telling their stories should be limited. This legislation works to do just that, and builds on the progress made by the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act signed into law earlier this year. This bill will help survivors come forward so that those responsible can be held accountable. I am glad to join my colleagues in leading this bipartisan, bicameral legislation that aims to finally end this harmful, toxic system.”Under current law, organizations can use NDAs to prevent survivors of sexual harassment or assault from speaking publicly about these incidents. The threat of legal retaliation creates and enables a culture of silence that allows predators to continue their illegal conduct, while their victims are forced out of their careers and denied justice. The Speak Out Act would:The House companion bill was introduced by Representatives Lois Frankel (D-FL) and Ken Buck (R-CO).Senator Hirono is a strong advocate for survivors of sexual assault and harassment, and consistently works to advance legislation to protect survivors. She cosponsored the bipartisan Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act, which prevents perpetrators from being able to push survivors of sexual harassment and assault into the secretive, biased process of forced arbitration, and was signed into law earlier this year.Senator Hirono has also worked to end sexual harassment and assault in the military. Since 2013, she has championed the Military Justice Improvement Act to establish an impartial, fair, and accountable military justice system to address sexual assault. In 2020, she introduced the I am Vanessa Guillen Act to remove decisions about prosecuting cases of sexual harassment and assault from the chain of command. This past April, she introduced the Sexual Harassment Independent Investigations and Prosecutions (SHIIP) Act, a bill containing key provisions of the I am Vanessa Guillen Act not included in the FY2022 National Defense Authorization Act.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-leads-energy-subcommittee-in-examining-way-to-reduce-energy-prices-in-the-us,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), Chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy, convened a subcommittee hearing to discuss ways to reduce energy prices in the United States. During the hearing, the Subcommittee heard testimony from experts, including Kauai Island Utility Cooperative President and CEO David Bissel about the long-term cost-savings offered by renewable power and electric vehicles. Additionally, Senator Hirono emphasized the importance of advancing legislation to accelerate the adoption of more affordable and cleaner sources of energy.“Different states and regions will have different energy mixes, but Congress should provide individuals and businesses with long-term incentives to speed up the transition to cheaper, cleaner sources of power, higher energy efficiency, and more affordable transportation options,” said Senator Hirono in her opening remarks. “Congress should also support clean energy manufacturing and supply chains right here in the United States. As we deal with high oil and gas prices now, we need to keep our eye on how we can accelerate the transition to more affordable options while making our country much more energy self-reliant in the long term, like Hawaii is doing.”Senator Hirono also highlighted Hawaii’s leadership in the transition to renewable energy, including the state’s clean energy initiative, the first in the country to set a goal of 100 percent renewable power by 2045.“Record oil prices in 2008 solidified Hawaii’s commitment to stop being held hostage by global oil markets and move toward renewable power. The state established the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative with the help of the Department of Energy, eventually setting a goal of 100 percent renewable power by 2045,” Senator Hirono continued. “Hawaii is leading our nation’s transition to clean energy, and creating a blueprint that others can follow.”In addition to Mr. Bissell, witnesses included Commissioner Julia Fedorchak, Chair of the North Dakota Public Service Commission; John Larsen, Partner at Rhodium Group; and Ron Ness, President of the North Dakota Petroleum Council.As Chair of the Energy Subcommittee, Senator Hirono is focused on lowering energy costs for communities in Hawaii and across the country. In May, Senator Hirono questioned Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on the Department of Energy’s efforts to lower energy costs for families and expand access to clean, affordable, and reliable energy. Earlier this year, Hawaii received over $3.6 million in federal funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP), which provides grants for households with low incomes to save money by increasing the energy efficiency of their homes.Video of Senator Hirono’s opening statement can be found here and a transcript is below. Video of her question line can be found here.The subcommittee will come to order. I would like to join with Senator Hoeven, the Ranking Member, in welcoming our panel of witnesses.  Today’s hearing will examine pathways to lower energy prices in the United States.As we meet this afternoon people across the United States and around the world are dealing with high energy prices. Many families are struggling to afford the groceries they need while paying the cost of driving to daycare and work.  Small businesses are trying to figure out if they can afford to expand, given the rising cost of making deliveries and paying power bills. Rising oil and natural gas prices are driving inflation in the rest of the economy.Fortunately, average prices at the pump have fallen 39 cents per gallon nationwide in the last month. But prices remain far too high in Hawaii and elsewhere.In the past year, the American people have faced the disruptions from the pandemic recovery and the consequences of Putin’s horrific war against Ukraine. In April, all 100 senators voted to end imports of Russian energy, even though it meant higher oil and gas prices.The President continues to engage with our allies and partners on how to move away from Russian oil and natural gas and stabilize global supplies. The United States is the largest producer of oil and gas in the world and it was a net exporter of petroleum in 2020 and 2021. Our reliance on fossil fuels, even when we produce it here, means we will be stuck paying the prices set in the global market, subject to OPEC and affiliated producers like Russia.We are still going to be using fossil fuels in cars, power plants, and industrial plants. But there are cheaper and cleaner alternatives now and in our future. We already know from the International Energy Agency that renewable energy sources like wind and solar are the cheapest sources of power available. And electric vehicles are already cheaper over their lifetime than comparable gasoline models, with more affordable hybrid and electric vehicle options on the way. The question for Congress is how do we help states and individuals achieve the benefits of those cheaper and cleaner alternatives? Hawaii has charted an ambitious course. Because of Hawaii’s unique geography, it is the most petroleum-dependent state in the country. Record oil prices in 2008 solidified Hawaii’s commitment to stop being held hostage by global oil markets and move toward renewable power. The state established the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative with the help of the Department of Energy, eventually setting a goal of 100 percent renewable power by 2045. Hawaii is now at 40 percent renewable power statewide.But Hawaii’s continued reliance on oil for the majority of its power is why electricity rates jumped 34 percent in April from a year earlier and electricity costs almost triple the U.S. average. Each island in Hawaii has its own electric grid, unconnected to other islands. We’re going to hear today from Mr. Bissell about how the electric cooperative on the island of Kauai reached 70 percent renewable power and avoided the worst impacts of the global oil shock.Hawaii is leading our nation’s transition to clean energy, and creating a blueprint that others can follow. Different states and regions will have different energy mixes, but Congress should provide individuals and businesses with long-term incentives to speed up the transition to cheaper, cleaner sources of power, higher energy efficiency, and more affordable transportation options.  Congress should also support clean energy manufacturing and supply chains right here in the United States.As we deal with high oil and gas prices now, we need to keep our eye on how we can accelerate the transition to more affordable options while making our country much more energy self-reliant in the long term, like Hawaii is doing. I’m looking forward to hearing from our panelists this afternoon about the path forward for affordable, reliable, and increasingly clean sources of energy across the nation.With that, I will turn to the Ranking Member, Senator Hoeven, for his opening statement.###"

Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, questioned health care and legal experts in a full committee hearing about the implications of the Supreme Court’s disastrous decision overturning Roe v. Wade on abortion access and other constitutional rights, and what can be done to protect abortion access for all.In the hearing, Senator Hirono reiterated the importance of individuals being able to make decisions about their own bodies.“It is the woman, not a bunch of politicians, who should decide her bodily autonomy,” said Senator Hirono in her remarks. “As I listen to all of my colleagues who support the Supreme Court’s recent decision, they intentionally lose sight of who should be making the decision about what to do with our own bodies—us or a bunch of politicians?”Senator Hirono asked UC Berkeley Law Professor Khiara Bridges to elaborate on the faulty logic of the Supreme Court’s opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.“With the approach of originalism, the Justices who took that approach go all the way back to our founding fathers, and pretend that they know what our founding fathers meant when they drafted the Constitution,” said Senator Hirono.Senator Hirono also highlighted her concern that the right-wing majority on the Supreme Court would attempt to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges next, threatening the future of same-sex marriages and the constitutional rights of the LGBTQ+ community.“Every single decision of the Supreme Court is a precedent, but the one group that can overturn precedent is the Supreme Court and they are very busy doing so,” said Senator Hirono. “We have a radical group of very conservative Justices who are going to be making further decisions like this.”Senator Hirono also asked Dr. Colleen McNicholas, Chief Medical Officer of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, about the chaos created as a result of Dobbs.A long-time champion for abortion access, Senator Hirono is committed to protecting the fundamental right to abortion care for all. Earlier this month, she convened a working group of Hawaii reproductive leaders to discuss the impact the Supreme Court’s decision will have on women in Hawaii, how to better support access to reproductive care in the state, and how public officials, physicians, and organizations can work together to better support women across the country.

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-warren-and-colleagues-introduce-bicameral-legislation-to-expand-youth-access-to-voting,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, introduced the Youth Voting Rights Act, comprehensive legislation to enforce the Twenty-Sixth Amendment and expand youth access to voting. This legislation, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), was also introduced in the House by Representative Nikema Williams (D-GA).“Every eligible American, including youth voters who turn 18, should be able to exercise their constitutional right to vote,” said Senator Hirono. “Public officials around the country are making decisions that will affect young people for generations to come, and they deserve to have a say in how these decisions are made. As we continue fighting to protect voting rights, the Youth Voting Rights Act will make it easier for young people to vote in elections and expand youth participation in our democracy, especially for historically disenfranchised groups like young people of color and young people with disabilities. I’ll continue working to protect and expand voting rights for young people and all Americans.”The Twenty-Sixth Amendment, formally ratified on July 1, 1971, prohibits the denial of the right to vote on account of age for all citizens aged 18 or older. But over fifty years after its ratification, the Twenty-Sixth Amendment’s promise remains unfulfilled. Young voters participate in elections at lower rates than voters in older age cohorts. Their provisional ballots and mail-in ballots are rejected at disproportionate rates. And they routinely face serious obstacles to voter registration and in-person voting.Voting is a fundamental right in any democracy, as bipartisan supermajorities in Congress and the states nearly unanimously recognized when the United States adopted the Twenty-Sixth Amendment in the fastest ratification process in American history. Specifically, the bill would:The full text of the legislation can be found here. A one-page summary can be found here.Senator Hirono has been a long-time champion of voting rights legislation and protections. Last month, she cosponsored the Register America to Vote Act, which would require every state to create a system to register all eligible citizens to vote when they turn 18, and ensure all eligible voters are covered by automatic registration through motor vehicle agencies. At the start of the pandemic, Senator Hirono introduced the Natural Disaster and Emergency Ballot Act of 2020, legislation to ensure that Americans are able to vote, even in a public health emergency, by expanding early in-person voting and absentee vote-by-mail to all states. In March 2020, she also called on the Senate to pass the For the People Act, to expand voting access for Americans.Senator Hirono also cosponsored the Native American Voting Rights Act of 2021 to protect the right to vote and ensure equal access to the electoral process for Native communities. She is also a cosponsor and strong advocate of the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, and last December, she delivered remarks on the Senate floor urging her colleagues to pass voting rights legislation.In addition to Senators Hirono and Warren, the Youth Voting Rights Act is also cosponsored by Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Ed Markey (D-MA), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI).The House companion legislation is cosponsored by Representatives Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), Jamaal Bowman (D-NY), Chuy Garcia (D-IL), Ted Lieu (D-CA), Dwight Evans (D-PA), Mondaire Jones (D-NY), Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA), Juan Vargas (D-CA), Ritchie Torres (D-NY), Sara Jacobs (D-CA), Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ), John Sarbanes (D-MD), and Deborah Ross (D-NC).The bill is endorsed by a wide range of democracy and youth organizations including: American Civil Liberties Union, Common Cause, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Campaign Legal Center, Demos, League of Women Voters of the United States, End Citizens United / Let America Vote Action Fund, MoveOn, NextGen America, The Andrew Goodman Foundation, ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge, When We All Vote, the Fair Elections Center’s Campus Vote Project, Students Learn Students Vote, The Civics Center, and Tufts University’s Institute for Democracy in Higher Education. ###"

Hirono (D-HI), an immigrant born in Japan who was the first Asian and Japanese American woman to serve in the United States Senate, released the following statement on the assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe:  “I am shocked and deeply saddened by the assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Prime Minister Abe was a transformational figure in Japan who dedicated his life in service of his country. A friend to the United States, Prime Minister Abe fought for the Japanese people and strengthened the relationship between our two countries.“I’ve had the privilege of meeting Prime Minister Abe a number of times, including during a State dinner at the White House in 2015, as well as during official trips to Japan in 2013 and 2017. During our most recent meeting, we discussed a number of topics, including the importance of the trilateral alliance of the United States, Japan and South Korea.“This senseless murder was a barbaric act—and one that I condemn in the strongest terms possible.“I spoke with Ambassador Tomita this morning to express my deepest condolences to Prime Minister Abe’s family and to the people of Japan. As an immigrant born in Japan, I join President Biden and stand with the Japanese people during this time. We will honor Prime Minister Abe’s legacy by continuing to work to strengthen our relationship with Japan, which is a critical ally in protecting the security of the Indo-Pacific region and plays a vital role in Hawaii’s economy and culture.”As a leading champion of U.S.-Japan relations in Congress, Senator Hirono met with Prime Minister Abe several times, most recently on a Congressional Delegation trip to Japan in 2017. In 2016, she joined Prime Minister Abe and President Barack Obama for a wreath laying at Pearl Harbor to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. In 2015, Senator Hirono served on the Escort Committee for Prime Minister Abe’s address to a joint session of Congress. In 2013, she met with Prime Minister Abe during a Congressional Delegation to Japan and several other Asia-Pacific nations.In November 2021, Senator Hirono was honored by the Japanese government with the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star, in recognition of her work to strengthen bilateral relations and promoting legislative exchanges between Japan and the United States.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-visits-infrastructure-projects-community-organizations-on-kauai,"HONOLULU, HI –Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) was on Kauai, where she toured the Wailua River Bridge infrastructure project before visiting the Hawaii Food Bank Kauai Chapter and the Boys & Girls Club of Hawaii’s (BGCH) Lihue Clubhouse.The Senator began her day with a tour of the Wailua River Bridge, where she was joined by Kauai County Mayor Derek Kawakami and Hawaii State Department of Transportation (HDOT) Deputy Director of Highways Ed Sniffen. Kauai is set to receive more than $44 million in federal funding, including nearly $20 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), for a repair project that will replace the nearly 80-year-old wooden piles supporting the bridge with reinforced concrete piles, which will be better able to withstand heavy rains and flooding. Under the BIL, Hawaii will receive approximately $1.5 billion in formula funding for highways and bridges over the next five years. “The Wailua Bridge is an essential piece of infrastructure on Kauai,” said Senator Hirono. “But like so much of our infrastructure in Hawaii and across the country, it requires repairs to continue serving communities on the island. Thanks to federal investment, including funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the bridge is getting the structural updates and improvements it needs to ensure it can remain in use for decades to come. This is just one of the many projects the BIL is supporting to modernize and rebuild Hawaii’s infrastructure for the 21st century.”After touring the bridge, Senator Hirono visited the Hawaii Food Bank’s Kauai Chapter, which provides food to those in need on Kauai. In 2021, the food bank distributed nearly 2 million pounds of food to people on Kauai, including more than 210,000 pounds of fresh produce. Thanks to federal COVID relief funding, the food bank was able to purchase additional food to meet increased demand during the pandemic. “Hawaii Food Bank does critical work to ensure those experiencing food insecurity in Hawaii have enough to eat,” said Senator Hirono. “Over the past two years, they’ve gone above and beyond to keep our communities fed, with a focus on providing fresh, local produce to those they serve. As we continue working to rebuild from the pandemic and support Hawaii families, I’m grateful for organizations like the Hawaii Food Bank and their commitment to combating hunger on Kauai and across Hawaii.”Senator Hirono ended her day on Kauai with a visit to the Boys and Girls Club of Hawaii’s (BGCH) Lihue Clubhouse, which provides safe, positive, and engaging learning environments for youth on Kauai, as well as programs to prepare young people to succeed into the future. Last year, Senator Hirono secured $1.2 million in Congressionally Directed Spending for BGCH to help them better serve youth throughout the state. “Boys and Girls Clubs provide safe, supportive environments for young people in Hawaii to focus on themselves and their futures,” said Senator Hirono. “From homework help to leadership development, and so much more, BGCH helps set Hawaii youth up to succeed, which is why I was glad to be able to secure federal funding to support their mission. It was great to meet the enthusiastic young people and see firsthand the power of BGCH’s many programs—including STEM and arts education. With this new federal funding, BGCH will be able to support even more young people in Hawaii, fostering a generation ready to take on the challenges of tomorrow.”###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-statement-on-two-hawaii-medal-of-honor-recipients,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, released the following statement on President Biden awarding the Medal of Honor to four U.S. army soldiers—including two from Hawaii—who fought in the Vietnam War:“Staff Sergeant Kaneshiro and Specialist Five Fujii are heroes to this country, and I am proud to see two Hawaii veterans being recognized with the Medal of Honor for their brave and selfless actions during the Vietnam War. I’d like to extend my aloha and gratitude to them both for their service and sacrifice.“I had the privilege to speak with Mr. Fujii last week to congratulate him and personally thank him for his service to our country. Servicemembers like Mr. Fujii and Mr. Kaneshiro risk their lives to protect our nation, and we have an obligation to support them following their service. I am committed to continuing my work to ensure every veteran in Hawaii and across the country has access to the health care, resources, and benefits they deserve.”Staff Sergeant Edward N. Kaneshiro received the Medal of Honor posthumously for acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty while serving as an infantry squad leader near Phu Huu 2, Kim Son Valley, Republic of Vietnam, on Dec. 1, 1966.  Staff Sergeant Kaneshiro and his team entered the village of Phu Huu 2 while on a search and destroy mission and were attacked by North Vietnamese.  Staff Sergeant Kaneshiro destroyed one enemy group with rifle fire and two others with grenades, which enabled the orderly extrication and reorganization of the platoon and ultimately led to a successful withdrawal from the village.  He served in Vietnam between July 18, 1966, until his death on March 6, 1967, as a result of a hostile gunshot wound.Specialist Five Dennis M. Fujii received the Medal of Honor for acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty while serving as crew chief aboard a helicopter ambulance during rescue operations in Laos and the Republic of Vietnam from February 18 – 22, 1971.  During a mission to evacuate wounded Vietnamese military personnel, Specialist Five Fujii’s medevac helicopter took on enemy fire and was forced to crash land.  Although injured, he waved off a rescue from another helicopter and remained behind as the only American on the battlefield.  During that night and the next day, although wounded, he administered first aid to allied casualties. For more than 17 hours, he repeatedly exposed himself to hostile fire as he left the security of his entrenchment to better observe enemy troop positions and to direct air strikes against them until an American helicopter could attempt to airlift him from the area.  Upon completion of his tour, he joined the Army Reserve and currently resides in Hawaii.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-convenes-working-group-of-hawaii-reproductive-leaders-following-disastrous-scotus-decision-overturning-roe,"HONOLULU, HI – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) convened a working group of reproductive leaders and health care experts following the disastrous Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Senator Hirono held an initial conversation today, with many more to come, to discuss the impact this decision will have on women in Hawaii, how to better support access to reproductive care in the state—particularly for low-income and minority communities—and how the state can work together to better support women across the country.“While Hawaii has strong protections to ensure women have the right to reproductive care, our communities are feeling the impact and the uncertainty this disastrous decision has caused. We’ve heard from doctors and nurses whose patients aren’t sure about their rights—and this chaos and confusion disproportionately impacts low-income communities and communities of color,” said Senator Hirono. “This working group will continue to focus on how this decision is harming women in Hawaii and address ways to increase access to abortion across the islands.”  The working includes representatives from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Hawaii Center for Nursing, Hawaii Women Lawyers, Papa Ola Lokahi, Planned Parenthood Regional Office, Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, as well as State Representatives, and other women’s advocates.  ""Hawai'i has always been a leader in the right to abortion, and in this state no woman or pregnant person, and no health care provider should be afraid that's going to change,” Jennifer Allen, CEO of Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates. “We applaud Senator Hirono's lifelong leadership on abortion access, and her work to bring together a strong and diverse group of stakeholders to respond to the fall of abortion rights after the Supreme Court's unconscionable overturning of Roe v. Wade.""“The Hawai’i Section of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists joins with Senator Mazie Hirono in condemning the U. S. Supreme Courts’ Dobbs decision. We know firsthand the harms that patients can suffer when they cannot access the full range of evidence-based reproductive health care, including abortion care,” said Reni Soon, woman’s advocate. “We are committed to continuing to serve our patients with compassion and excellent clinical care, and to protecting and expanding access to abortion throughout Hawai’i.”###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-statement-on-scotus-decision-to-restrict-epa-authority-,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, released the following statement regarding the Supreme Court’s decision in West Virginia v. EPA:“Once again, the extremist right-wing majority on the Supreme Court has made a harmful decision that will have detrimental consequences on the lives of people for generations to come. The devastating impacts of climate change are clear, and restricting the EPA’s authority to reduce carbon pollution and cut fossil fuel emissions will only expedite these consequences, putting the wellbeing of our families and communities at risk. This decision sets a dangerous precedent and poses a great threat to public health and the future of our planet.”This decision, driven by the right-wing majority on the Supreme Court, restricts the scope of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions by holding that EPA cannot set standards that reflect the full extent of possibilities in shifting the power sector towards renewable energy and other less-polluting power sources. In the months leading up to the decision, many observers correctly warned that the Court would use the case not only to limit the ways in which the EPA can regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, but also to establish a novel legal doctrine that would give anti-regulation judges a potent tool for striking down other federal regulations that require industries to spend money to protect the wellbeing of the public.In January, Senator Hirono joined over 190 congressional Democrats in submitting an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in this case. The brief supported the EPA’s authority to combat air pollution, including the greenhouse gas pollution that causes climate change. In 2020, Senator Hirono also introduced the Clean Economy Act, which would have required the United States to reach net-zero greenhouse emissions by no later than 2050, in an effort to combat the consequences of climate change.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/photos-and-video-hirono-visits-akaka-va-clinic-construction-site-meets-with-kapolei-small-businesses-and-cnha,"HONOLULU, HI – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) visited the construction site for the Daniel Kahikina Akaka VA Clinic, followed by a visit to the Ka Makana Alii Shopping Center in Kapolei and the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement (CNHA) Emergency Assistance Center and Pop-Up Makeke Warehouse.The Senator began her day with a visit to the construction site for the Daniel K. Akaka VA Clinic. Earlier this month, President Biden signed into law legislation introduced by Senator Hirono to name the new clinic after the late Senator Akaka. Video of Senator Hirono discussing her tour can be found here. “During his tenure in the Senate, and as chair of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, Senator Akaka was a strong advocate on behalf of veterans in Hawaii,” said Senator Hirono. “Today I visited the new site—which I’m proud is now named after Senator Akaka—to get an update on the clinic’s construction and the services it will provide. Once finished, it will provide critical health care for our veterans living not only in Hawaii, but throughout the Pacific region, and will help expand Tripler Army Medical Center’s capacity to serve veterans as well. I am honored to continue Senator Akaka’s work to serve and support veterans on Oahu and across Hawaii.”After visiting the construction site, Senator Hirono headed to Ka Makana Alii Shopping Center to visit multiple women-owned small businesses and meet with small businessowners. She spoke to these businesses about the challenges they have faced as a result of the pandemic. Senator Hirono has worked to secure federal support for Hawaii’s small businesses throughout the COVID-19 crisis so they can continue to serve communities across the state. “Over the last two years, we have seen the negative impact the pandemic has had on small businesses in Hawaii and across the country,” said Senator Hirono. “Now, with supply chain disruptions and staffing shortages, small businesses and business owners are still fighting to recover. I am dedicated to working to ensure that funding is made available and effectively used to provide relief during these challenging times. I will continue to support and advocate on behalf of our local shops, restaurants, and other small businesses.”Senator Hirono also visited the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement (CNHA) Emergency Assistance Center and Pop-Up Makeke Warehouse. A non-profit organization dedicated to supporting Native Hawaiian communities, CNHA’s mission is to enhance the cultural, economic, political, and community development of Native Hawaiians. Pop-Up Makeke is one of their many initiatives—it is an online marketplace that allows people to shop from hundreds of Hawaii’s small businesses in one convenient location. “CNHA offers a robust list of programs and resources to support Native Hawaiian communities across the islands,” said Senator Hirono. “They offer crucial services to these communities, such as financial assistance for housing and workforce development training, and they also work to promote local businesses and entrepreneurs. I will continue my efforts to advance legislation, secure federal funding, and work with organizations like CNHA to support Native Hawaiian communities.”A member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, Senator Hirono is committed to supporting our nation’s veterans. She helped negotiate and recently voted to pass the Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, comprehensive, bipartisan legislation to expand VA health care for veterans with health conditions related to burn pit and Agent Orange exposure. In March, Senator Hirono helped pass in the Senate bipartisan legislation to expand access to breast cancer screening and care for veterans. Hirono also introduced the Veterans and Family Information Act which required the VA to make information more accessible for non-English language speakers, enabling veterans and their families to better understand the benefits, programs, and resources available to them. She also introduced the Every Veteran Counts Act directing the VA to establish and regularly update a database of veterans’ demographic data.As a member of the Senate Small Business Committee, Senator Hirono has worked to secure federal support for Hawaii’s small businesses throughout the COVID-19 crisis. In March, she successfully advocated for the Biden Administration to extend COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan relief for small businesses. Last year, she urged U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Isabel Guzman to ensure SBA was prioritizing pandemic relief for underserved businesses.Senator Hirono is a longstanding champion of programs to support Hawaii’s indigenous, Native Hawaiian community. In 2020, the University of Hawaii received $1.5 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to expand education programs focused on food, agriculture, and natural resources – this funding enabled Native Hawaiian-serving institutions to promote educational equity for underrepresented students, expand education programs, and provide job training in these fields. Last September, the Department of Education awarded over $28 million in grants through the Native Hawaiian Education Program (NHEP) to provide assistance to several educational, community-based, and other similar organizations in Hawaii.Photos of the Senator’s visits can be found here###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-hirono-statement-on-navy-plan-for-red-hill-defueling,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, released the following statement after the U.S. Navy submitted its plan for the permanent defueling and closure of the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility on Oahu:“Earlier this month, I fought to authorize $1 billion in federal funding in the National Defense Authorization Act for the safe closure of Red Hill. The facility’s ongoing operation has endangered the well-being of families and communities on Oahu and at this point, the most important thing for the health and safety of the people of Hawaii is for the defueling to happen safely. In addition to safely defueling Red Hill in a timely manner, the Navy must also meet its obligation to remediate the long-term environmental impacts of the facility.“While the Department of Defense has briefed us on the plan, I have not yet had the opportunity to review it in detail. My understanding is that the plan provides actionable steps resulting from months of planning, dedicated oversight from a task force led by senior leadership, and the appropriate amount of engineering rigor to ensure the Navy implements the third party’s assessment, which must be completed prior to defueling. The Hawaii Department of Health must certify this plan before it can be implemented. While we all want to ensure this is done quickly, it must be done safely. We cannot sacrifice safety for speed. “As we move forward, transparency, accountability, and collaboration among all stakeholders will be of the utmost importance. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I will continue to conduct rigorous oversight to ensure the Navy and the Department of Defense honor the commitments they made in this plan and communicate regularly with impacted communities, state and local agencies, and other stakeholders.” Senator Hirono steps on Red Hill:###"

Hirono (D-HI) and Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) announced that they will serve as Senate Co-Chairs of the Congressional Creative Rights Caucus. They join House of Representatives Co-Chairs Congresswoman Judy Chu (D-CA) and Congressman Drew Ferguson (R-GA) to make the caucus bicameral and bipartisan.“I am excited to join Senator Tillis and Representatives Chu and Ferguson in bringing the Congressional Creative Rights Caucus to the U.S. Senate. Creative industries—such as film, television, music, literature, fine arts, and more—are an important part of our national economy. In my home state of Hawaii alone, the creative economy contributed $4.2 billion in gross domestic product and created over 54,000 jobs and small businesses in 2020,” Senator Hirono said. “But creators also give us so much more. Their works bring us together, capture our history, and allow us to share our culture with the world. I look forward to working with my colleagues to highlight the contributions of our nation’s creators and to make sure their works are protected now and into the future.”“As the former Chairman and now the Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, I have worked hard to preserve and protect the rights of our creative community,” said Senator Tillis. “I am excited to further my bipartisan work by being named Co-Chair of the Creative Rights Caucus alongside my friend Senator Hirono. I look forward to working with her and our House Co-Chairs, Representatives Chu and Ferguson, to protect and promote America’s creative community and ensure we continue to be the world’s global leader in creative industries in the 21st century.”""I am excited to welcome Senators Mazie Hirono and Thom Tillis as Senate Co-Chairs to the Creative Rights Caucus. Creative industries are a core part of our economic fabric, and the bicameral extension of this caucus further cements our promise to continue advocating for entertainment workers and building a strong American economy,” said Rep. Judy Chu. “I look forward to continuing to work alongside Co-Chair Rep. Drew Ferguson and gaining fresh, unique perspectives from our new Senate Co-Chairs.""“The creation of a Creative Rights Caucus in the Senate is a positive step and I welcome Senators Tillis and Hirono as its co-Chairs,” said Congressman Ferguson. “I look forward to working in a bipartisan, bicameral way to protect the important work of our creative community and ensure their concerns are heard in Congress. As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I will continue to support strong intellectual property protections – especially in international trade agreements – to safeguard American creators so they can continue to spur innovation and economic growth.”The bipartisan, bicameral Creative Rights Caucus educates Members of Congress and the public about the importance of preserving and protecting the rights of the creative community in the United States. American creators of motion pictures, music, software, and other creative works rely on Congress to protect their copyrights, human rights, First Amendment rights, and intellectual property rights.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-leads-members-in-urging-dod-to-support-and-protect-female-servicemembers-seeking-abortion-services,"HONOLULU, HI – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), led Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Jacky Rosen (D-NV)—all members of SASC, as well as Michael Bennet (D-CO) and John Hickenlooper (D-CO), in urging the Department of Defense to take immediate steps to support and protect female servicemembers seeking abortion services following the Supreme Court’s dangerous and deeply harmful decision to overturn Roe. As a result of the decision, hundreds of thousands of troops, dependents and DoD civilians have lost access to safe abortions and now face threats of criminal prosecution depending on their duty station. In a letter sent to Secretary Austin today, the members highlighted that it is Secretary Austin’s responsibility to protect the health and safety of these individuals, as well as ensure they are free from retaliation, influence and retribution for seeking abortion care.  “The men and women who join the military sacrifice an incredible amount in order to serve their country. We owe it to these servicemembers to look after them and ensure they have the ability to continue accessing safe reproductive health care no matter where their military service sends them,” the members wrote.The members requested Secretary Austin provide answers to a series of questions, including how DoD will protect servicemembers from legal prosecution, how this decision will impact access to leave and travel regulations for abortion care, and how DoD will protect a woman’s right to privacy and protect women from retaliation, influence or retribution as a result of seeking abortion care? Additionally, the members asked DoD to take immediate action allow people to be granted permission to take necessary travel to seek abortion care, grant individuals—including those stationed overseas— Permissive Temporary Additional Duty to seek abortion care instead of having to use annual leave, and establish independent advocates or liaisons to assist individuals in need of abortion services.“As a result of the ruling, a servicemembers’ reproductive and health care rights have become dependent on their duty station,” wrote the members. “Many of the states expected to prohibit or greatly limit abortions are home to military installations including Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Texas. In Missouri, even in cases of ectopic pregnancies, doctors are forced to wait to the point at which a mother's life is threatened before lifesaving abortion procedures can be performed.  These law could force servicemembers in these states to face criminal prosecution or life-threatening circumstances.”The members also highlighted that not only does this decision violate the trust servicemembers place in our military, but it will also impact recruitment and retention in our Armed Forces. “It further threatens recruitment and retention as servicemembers will undoubtedly elect to leave the military rather than run the risk of being assigned to a duty station where they and their family will be denied fundamental rights.”Full text of the letter is available here and below. 30 June, 2022 The Honorable Lloyd J. Austin IIISecretary of Defense1000 Defense PentagonWashington, D.C.20301-1000 Dear Secretary Austin,Last Friday the Supreme Court released a dangerous and deeply harmful ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, overturning the nearly fifty-year precedent established by Roe v. Wade and denying women autonomy over their own bodies. Although only days old, the decision has already eliminated fundamental human and reproductive rights from millions of women across the country. Entrusted to your care are hundreds of thousands of troops, dependents, and Department of Defense (DOD) civilians who have lost access to safe abortions and now face threats of criminal prosecution for seeking out those services. As the leader of our military services, it falls on you to preserve the health and welfare of our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Guardians.As a result of the ruling, servicemembers’ reproductive and health care rights have become dependent on their duty station. Many of the states expected to prohibit or greatly limit abortions are home to military installations including Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Texas. In Missouri, even in cases of ectopic pregnancies, doctors are forced to wait to the point at which a mother's life is threatened before lifesaving abortion procedures can be performed. These laws could force service members in these states to face criminal prosecution or life-threatening circumstances. This untenable situation violates the trust servicemembers place in the Armed Forces when they swear an oath to defend the Constitution and this country. It further threatens recruitment and retention as service members will undoubtedly elect to leave the military rather than run the risk of being assigned to a duty station where they and their family will be denied fundamental rights.A memorandum written this week by Mr. Gilbert Cisneros, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, explained that “covered abortions” at Department facilities will continue as before but failed to speak to abortion access or protections for the rank and file. We remain concerned and seek to better understand the implications this draconian ruling will have on Defense Department personnel. We ask that you provide responses to the following questions:We call on you to take immediate action to protect the service members under your charge by implementing DOD-wide policy that:The men and women who join the military sacrifice an incredible amount in order to serve their country. We owe it to these service members to look after them and ensure they havethe ability to continue accessing safe reproductive health care no matter where their military service sends them. We urge you expand on the Under Secretary’s memorandum and give this request the fullest possible consideration.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-visits-wellness-and-health-centers-providing-services-on-windward-side-of-oahu,"HONOLULU, HI – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) visited the windward side of Oahu to meet with participants and staff of the Kawailoa Youth and Wellness Center’s Kinai ‘Eha Program, which aims to provide alternative education to young adults in need of personal empowerment. Afterward, the Senator visited the Waimanalo Health Center to meet with staff and see its new Hale Ola ‘Alua building. The center provides medical, vision, and behavioral health services for the community. “The Kinai ‘Eha program, and those like it, are essential in supporting at-risk youth and young adult members of our communities,” said Senator Hirono. “These programs not only foster hard skills, such as workforce development, they also nurture the mental wellbeing and foster the leadership skills of our keiki, teens, and young adults by working to address problems such as trauma, poverty, and family conflict. Programs such as Kinai ‘Eha can change lives, which is why I recently secured $1.5 million to support these services. The resources and support offered by Kawailoa are valuable, and they have the ability to shape the futures of Hawaii’s youth.”Kawailoa seeks to replace youth incarceration with educational, vocational, and workforce development using evidence-based cultural programs and integrative services. The success of these programs were highlighted last week when it was reported that, for the first time since it opened in 1961, there were no girls incarcerated at the Hawaii Youth Correctional Facility as a result of years-long efforts to steer youth towards community programs instead of juvenile corrections. “For the last three decades, the Waimanalo Health Center (WHC) has provided services to improve the health and wellbeing of people who live in the Waimanalo community,” said Senator Hirono. “Community health centers are critical to people across Hawaii, and provide help to those who might otherwise not have access to health care services. Each year, WHC receives about $2 million in federal funds, and I will work to ensure that they continue to receive this financial assistance. I am glad to see WHC’s facilities expanding, and look forward to supporting them as they continue to grow and serve our communities.”Senator Hirono has been a champion for Hawaii’s Community Health Centers, including Waimanalo, and has helped them secure federal funding to better serve communities across the state. She has also worked to secure federal funding for other programs and resources that support Native Hawaiian communities. In 2020, the University of Hawaii received $1.5 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to expand education programs focused on food, agriculture, and natural resources – this funding enabled Native Hawaiian-serving institutions to promote educational equity for underrepresented students, expand education programs, and provide job training in these fields. Last September, the Department of Education awarded over $28 million in grants through the Native Hawaiian Education Program (NHEP) to provide assistance to several educational, community-based, and other similar organizations in Hawaii. In the beginning of June, Senator Hirono also toured RYSE (Residential Youth Services and Empowerment) and We Are Oceania’s (WAO) Youth Empowerment Center, which serve vulnerable youth in Hawaii.Photos of the Senator’s visits can be found here ###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-statement-on-bill-signed-into-law-to-keep-keiki-fed,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) released the following statement about the bipartisan Keep Kids Fed Act recently signed into law by President Biden:“Growing up, my school had to create a special program so I could “earn” my lunch,” said Senator Hirono. “I knew even as a young girl that it is wrong for any child to go hungry at school for lack of lunch money. I’m glad Congress worked in a bipartisan way to pass this bill, which the President has now signed into law, which will help ensure that keiki in Hawaii and across the country will not have to worry about being fed in summer programs and during the coming school year. This legislation will provide some relief for families still struggling to recover from the pandemic and supply chain disruptions. I will continue to do everything I can to better support children and families across Hawaii.”The Keep Kids Fed Act passed the Senate unanimously last Thursday, and will provide critical funding and flexibility to get children healthy meals this summer and next year as schools and nonprofits continue to deal with supply chain challenges and high food prices. This bill became law as key flexibilities for these programs were set to expire on June 30, which would have left millions of kids across the country without access to healthy, nutritious meals.Earlier this month, Senator Hirono joined a letter calling for an extension of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) child nutrition waivers ahead of their expiration and a robust set of child nutrition priorities. In March, she signed a similar letter and cosponsored legislation to extend these waivers through next September. Senator Hirono also led the Hawaii delegation in urging the USDA to take whatever steps necessary to prevent thousands of children and families from being forced into food insecurity. In April, she also met Hawaii Department of Education officials to discuss the need to extend flexibilities that have allowed schools to continue feeding students throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/video-during-pride-month-hirono-meets-with-hawaii-lgbtq-organizations,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) convened a roundtable conversation with member organizations of the Hawaii Department of Health’s Sexual and Gender (SGM) Minority Working Group to discuss the services they offer and the challenges facing the communities they serve. As Pride month comes to a close, Senator Hirono heard from representatives from groups including Hawaii Health & Harm Reduction Center, the Lavender Clinic, Kumukahi Health and Wellness, Tomita Psychotherapy and Consultation, Maui AIDS Foundation, and Ka Aha Mahu about the work they do to support Hawaii’s LGBTQ+ community. The group also discussed the implications for LGBTQ+ individuals in Hawaii and across the country, of the Supreme Court’s disastrous ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.“As we celebrate Pride month and Hawaii’s vibrant LGBTQ+ community, we must also remain vigilant about the many challenges LGBTQ+ people still face in Hawaii and across the country,” said Senator Hirono. “Hawaii has long been a leader in advancing equal opportunity for all, including the LGBTQ community. However, even in Hawaii, LGBTQ+ individuals continue to face discrimination when it comes to living safely in their communities, access to health care, job security, housing and more. That’s why organizations like the ones I met with today, who provide resources, support, and care for LGBTQ+ and other marginalized communities across Hawaii, are so critical,” said Senator Hirono.“Especially given the fact that the radical right-wing members of the Supreme Court made clear their intentions to revisit marriage equality. I appreciated the chance to learn more about the important work these organizations do, and I’ll continue fighting to make sure everyone can live safely and openly as their authentic selves,” she added.“The Dobbs ruling casts a dark pall over the substantive policy gains that sexual and gender minorities have made in recent decades, including the decriminalization of adult consensual sexual relations and the affirmation of LGBTQ+ rights related to marriage, employment, and access to care services,” said Nikos Levernez, Hawaii Health and Harm Reduction’s Grants and Advancement Manager. “It is important for Hawaii state policymakers to reaffirm a woman’s fundamental right to access needed family planning services, including contraception, abortion care, and in-vitro fertilization. Hawaii should also clarify that its express state constitutional right to privacy is more robust than privacy rights under the federal Constitution. Hawaii Health & Harm Reduction Center stands firmly with women, sexual and gender minorities, and those from under-resourced communities in the protection and furtherance of their health and well-being.”Senator Hirono has been a consistent champion for LGBTQ+ rights. Last week, she took to the Senate floor to block Senate Republicans’ attempt to pass anti-transgender legislation to ban trans women and girls from participating in sports consistent with their gender. Earlier this month, Senator Hirono introduced a resolution recognizing June as LGBTQ+ Pride Month. In March, she introduced a resolution with her Senate colleagues recognizing International Transgender Day of Visibility. Senator Hirono is a sponsor of the Equality Act, which would extend federal civil rights protections to LGBTQ+ individuals. She previously introduced the Youth Access to Sexual Health Services Act to support access to sexual health services for marginalized youths, including medically accurate and complete, age, developmentally, and culturally appropriate sexual health information.Video of Senator Hirono discussing the meeting is available here###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-joins-30-colleagues-in-letter-to-president-urging-bold-and-immediate-action-to-protect-abortion-access-in-a-post-roe-america,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined a letter signed by 34 of her Democratic colleagues urging President Biden to take “bold action” to protect the right to abortion. The letter, led by Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, was sent in the aftermath of the conservative wing of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.“Now is the time for bold action to protect the right to an abortion. You have the power to fight back and lead a national response to this devastating decision, so we call on you to take every step available to your Administration, across federal agencies, to help women access abortions and other reproductive health care, and to protect those who will face the harshest burdens from this devastating and extreme decision,” wrote the Senators. The letter comes as 22 states have trigger ban laws in place to restrict access that are trigged by the courts’ decision. Right wing conservatives have made clear they will not stop with overturning Roe: next, they will push for a national abortion ban. Former Vice President Mike Pence even said last week that Republicans “must not rest and must not relent” until abortion rights are gone in “every state in the land.” “There is no time to waste: nearly half of the states already had laws in place to ban abortion or severely restrict access as soon as the Supreme Court decision came down. Many states enacted those laws immediately, and at least a dozen are set to follow suit in the coming days and weeks. Those laws will leave millions of Americans without access to essential reproductive health care. The chilling reality is that our daughters and granddaughters now have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers. Women across the country are now being told by states what choices they can and cannot make when it comes to their own health and reproductive choices. This is dangerous and horrifying and it will endanger women’s lives,” continued the Senators. “We cannot stand idly by as Republicans rip away women’s rights. And we know they will not stop with this decision—they are already eyeing a national abortion ban.” In addition to Senators Hirono and Murray, the letter was signed by Senators Markey (D-MA), Merkley (D-OR), Wyden (D-OR), Heinrich (D-NM), Gillibrand (D-NY), Blumenthal (D-CT), Rosen (D-NV), Duckworth (D-IL), Bennet (D-CO), Brown (D-OH), Warren (D-MA), Klobuchar (D-MN), Schatz (D-HI), Van Hollen (D-MD), Hassan (D-NH), Reed (D-RI), Kaine (D-VA), Smith (D-MN), Cortez Masto (D-NV), Murphy (D-CT), Carper (D-DE), Stabenow (D-MI), Kelly (D-AZ), Feinstein (D-CA), Hickenlooper (D-CO), Kaine (D-VA), Cantwell (D-WA), Sanders (I-VT), Shaheen (D-NH), Booker (D-NJ), Whitehouse (D-RI), Baldwin (D-WI), and Durbin (D-IL).Senator Hirono is a staunch advocate for abortion rights and reproductive freedom. Last week, she introduced the My Body, My Data Act, legislation to protect personal reproductive health data by minimizing the information collected and retained, and preventing that information from being disclosed or misused; the bill would protect reproductive health data from sources like fertility tracking apps. Senator Hirono also hosted a roundtable with patients from across the country to hear directly about how Roe and the right to abortion have shaped their lives—and to make clear what’s at stake with the Supreme Court set to end Americans’ constitutional right to abortion any day.Earlier this month, she met with reproductive health care leaders and providers from Hawaii to hear about the challenges they face and to discuss the importance of protecting abortion access. Senator Hirono also introduced the Affordability is Access Act (AAA) to help ensure access to over-the-counter birth control options, in an effort to allow people to plan their own reproductive lives, on their own terms. She also advocated to protect servicemembers’ access to abortion care. In May, Senator Hirono delivered a floor speech emphasizing the need to defend abortion rights. Earlier this year, she introduced a resolution to honor abortion providers and thanked them in a floor speech on National Abortion Provider Appreciation Day. Senator Hirono also cosponsored S.1975, the Senate companion to the House-passed Women’s Health Protection Act (H.R.3755), which would protect the right to access abortion care throughout the United States.The full text of the letter is available here and below.Dear Mr. President: Yesterday, the Supreme Court decided Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey and held that the right to abortion is no longer protected by the Constitution. This decision eliminates nearly 50 years of settled law and allows states to curtail access to abortion in any circumstance beginning at the moment of conception. This is an unprecedented assault on women and the result of decades of activism by Republican extremists. We call on you to combat these attacks and take immediate action to use the full force of the federal government to protect access to abortion in the United States. There is no time to waste: nearly half of the states already had laws in place to ban abortion or severely restrict access as soon as the Supreme Court decision came down. Many states enacted those laws immediately, and at least a dozen are set to follow suit in the coming days and weeks. Those laws will leave millions of Americans without access to essential reproductive health care. The chilling reality is that our daughters and granddaughters now have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers. Women across the country are now being told by states what choices they can and cannot make when it comes to their own health and reproductive choices. This is dangerous and horrifying and it will endanger women’s lives. We cannot stand idly by as Republicans rip away women’s rights. And we know they will not stop with this decision—they are already eyeing a national abortion ban. We appreciate that in your speech yesterday, you acknowledged the reality that the “health and life of women across this nation are now at risk.” Now is the time for bold action to protect the right to an abortion. You have the power to fight back and lead a national response to this devastating decision, so we call on you to take every step available to your Administration, across federal agencies, to help women access abortions and other reproductive health care, and to protect those who will face the harshest burdens from this devastating and extreme decision. Thank you for your attention to this important matter. Sincerely, ###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-statement-on-supreme-court-decision-overturning-roe-v-wade,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI) released the following statement after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson, overturning Roe v. Wade and ending the constitutional right to abortion:“Today is a horrific day in America. The Supreme Court was confronted with a fundamental question: who should have control over a woman’s body, a woman or a bunch of politicians. Today, the Supreme Court decided it should be a bunch of politicians. Their decision to overturn Roe will go down as one of the worst decisions in the history of the Court.“The far-right MAGA majority on the Supreme Court has stripped women in this country of a fundamental constitutional right we have relied on for nearly 50 years—which is what Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and extreme Republicans have wanted all along. Democrats in Congress are going to keep fighting to do everything we can to support women across the country—including expanding access to free contraception, protecting women’s health data, and passing the Women’s Health Protection Act to enshrine the right to abortion into federal law.“Women are going to suffer and die because of this decision. Republicans are going to have to answer for this in November.“Justice Thomas has signaled this is not the end of their assault on our individual rights and freedoms. Everyone must awaken to the fact that this is just the tip of the iceberg. We must rally together and elect more Democrats in November to protect our Democracy and our civil rights.”Senator Hirono is a staunch advocate for abortion rights and reproductive freedom. Earlier this week, she introduced the My Body, My Data Act, legislation to protect personal reproductive health data by minimizing the information collected and retained, and preventing that information from being disclosed or misused; the bill would protect reproductive health data from sources like fertility tracking apps. Senator Hirono also hosted a roundtable with patients from across the country to hear directly about how Roe and the right to abortion have shaped their lives—and to make clear what’s at stake with the Supreme Court set to end Americans’ constitutional right to abortion any day.Earlier this month, she met with reproductive health care leaders and providers from Hawaii to hear about the challenges they face and to discuss the importance of protecting abortion access. Senator Hirono also introduced the Affordability is Access Act (AAA) to help ensure access to over-the-counter birth control options, in an effort to allow people to plan their own reproductive lives, on their own terms. She also advocated to protect servicemembers’ access to abortion care. In May, Senator Hirono delivered a floor speech emphasizing the need to defend abortion rights. Earlier this year, she introduced a resolution to honor abortion providers and thanked them in a floor speech on National Abortion Provider Appreciation Day. Senator Hirono also cosponsored S.1975, the Senate companion to the House-passed Women’s Health Protection Act (H.R.3755), which would protect the right to access abortion care throughout the United States.###"

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/on-50th-anniversary-of-title-ix-hirono-blocks-gop-attempt-to-advance-anti-transgender-legislation,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, blocked Republicans from advancing the anti-transgender Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, legislation to ban transgender women and girls from participating in sports consistent with their gender. In her remarks on the Senate floor, Senator Hirono disputed the false, detrimental claim that allowing trans women and girls to play sports is harmful to cisgender women and girls, and highlighted the ways in which this legislation would harm all women and girls.  “My Republican colleagues falsely claim that allowing transgender women and girls to play sports is harmful to cisgender women and girls. They continue to hurl insulting lies about transgender girls dominating sports,” said Senator Hirono. “If my Republican colleagues were actually worried about women and girls in athletics, they would join our efforts to address unequal athletic opportunities in school, unequal pay, sexual abuse and harassment, and more. But this isn’t about supporting women and girls, this is about discrimination.”Senator Hirono’s remarks come on the 50th anniversary of Title IX, which outlawed sex-based discrimination in schools and was championed by the late Hawaii Congresswoman Patsy Mink. Earlier today, Senator Hirono delivered remarks at the Capitol honoring Congresswoman Mink and celebrating the legacy of Title IX.“Republicans have the wrong priorities. We shouldn’t be banning anyone from playing sports—we should be fighting the discrimination that all women and girls continue to face in athletics, in the classroom, and in the workplace. I am proud to stand up and oppose this harmful legislation and continue to advance Patsy Mink’s legacy of equal opportunities for all,” Senator Hirono added.Senator Hirono’s full remarks are below and video of her remarks can be found here.Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I rise today in opposition to S. 251—legislation that would ban transgender women and girls from participating in sports consistent with their gender.My Republican colleagues falsely claim that allowing transgender women and girls to play sports is harmful to cisgender women and girls. They continue to hurl insulting lies about transgender girls dominating sports.But what is true, is that these bans are deeply harmful to transgender girls—particularly transgender girls of color—girls who are gender nonconforming or born with intersex traits, as well as cisgender girls. These “sex tests” invade every girls’ privacy and open the door to harass anyone who is perceived as “different.”If my Republican colleagues were actually worried about women and girls in athletics, they would join in our efforts to address unequal athletic opportunities in school, unequal pay, sexual abuse and harassment, and more.But this isn’t about supporting women and girls, this is about discrimination.Earlier today, I stood in statutory hall as we unveiled the portrait of the late Congresswoman Patsy T. Mink on today’s 50th anniversary of Title IX becoming law.Title IX, which was renamed the Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act, says, and I quote, “no person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”37 words that are just as relevant today as they were 50 years ago. Patsy fought for equal opportunities for all, and this bill stands in direct opposition to her work.And to listen to my colleague talking about Title IX as being that act that is going to support his bill, I can tell you as someone who knew and was friends with Patsy T. Mink, she would be standing right next to me to say that Title IX in no way or shape supports what my colleague is attempting to do.Republicans have the wrong priorities. We shouldn’t be banning anyone from playing sports—we should be fighting the discrimination that all women and girls continue to face in athletics, in the classroom, and in the workplace.I am proud to stand up and oppose this harmful legislation and continue to advance Patsy Mink’s legacy of equal opportunities for all.  For these reasons, I object.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-honors-patsy-mink-at-us-congress-portrait-unveiling-on-the-50th-anniversary-of-title-ix,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) delivered remarks at a portrait unveiling for the late Congresswoman Patsy Mink at the U.S. Capitol on the 50th Anniversary of Title IX becoming law. Senator Hirono celebrated the life and legacy of Congresswoman Patsy Mink, who introduced and championed Title IX. In honor of her leadership on the issue, Title IX was renamed the Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act after Congresswoman Mink’s passing in 2002. Photos from that event are available here.“Patsy was a champion for social justice, equality, and civil rights, and a trailblazer in every sense of that word,” Senator Hirono said in her remarks. “37 words long, Title IX represented a sea change for women in our country. 50 years later, Title IX is just as important today as it was when Patsy fought for it. Thanks to Title IX, more women than ever before are leading in government, business, and of course, in medicine. But while we have come a long way since Patsy was rejected from medical school because of her gender—of course we still have a way to go for true equity. We need to strengthen Title IX and protect the rights of every student to a welcoming and supportive school environment. By working to build on the progress Congresswoman Patsy Mink worked so hard to secure, we are helping generations of women and girls to come to have the support they need to thrive in school and beyond.”Full text of Senator Hirono’s remarks are available below. To download video from the event, click here.Aloha everyone. I am really honored to be here with all of you, and I am so happy that my delegation from Hawaii–we are all here, and of course, Speaker Pelosi, I know that we owe this portrait to you, and when it was unveiled I literally had tears in my eyes.  I have to tell you that when I first got elected to Congress in 2006, and I met with Nancy Pelosi for the first time, she shared with me the story of how when Nancy was first in her early years in the U.S. House, Patsy Mink was the first, if not among the first, to say to her, “One day, you’re going to become Speaker of the House.” And I’m really happy that Speaker Pelosi shared that story with me because it really showed me how prescient Patsy was in all that she did, but how much she supported women in office.So, of course, I am honored to be here with all of you to celebrate the life and legacy of an icon in American history and my dear friend, Patsy Takemoto Mink. And it’s wonderful to see Dr. Wendy Mink here, and of course, Billie Jean King, an icon herself.As noted, Patsy was a champion for social justice, equality, and civil rights, and a trailblazer in every sense of that word. I was lucky enough to work with Patsy over a number of years, probably decades, when I was serving in Hawaii and Patsy was in D.C. The last time I saw Patsy was in 2002 when we were both in the famous Kailua 4th of July parade. She invited me to have lunch with her after the parade and it was to encourage me to keep going, to persevere, as I ran for governor that year.Patsy’s life and career were lessons in perseverance.As a young student in Hawaii, Patsy had hopes of becoming a doctor. But as a brilliant young woman, she was denied acceptance into medical school, told that they already had enough women. See, they could just say that, overtly back in the day. Now, they’re a little more careful about those kinds of comments these days, but not enough.So if no medical school, Patsy said to herself – I’m sure – ‘What next?’ Then what? She applied to the University of Chicago’s law school, where she was placed as a foreign student. Some people still don’t know that Hawaii is a state. But back then, it wasn’t, it was a territory, but she was certainly a U.S. citizen, not a foreign student. Upon graduation, she wasn’t offered a job by any Chicago firm. Sound familiar?Patsy knew things had to change.She was in her thirties when she decided to run for office. First, for the Hawaii territorial legislature in 1956, then she went on to become the first Asian American woman elected to Congress in 1965. In fact, she was the first woman of color to be elected to Congress. And the discrimination she experienced firsthand fueled her work for decades to come, and her legacy that lasts today.Of course, she fought to make sure that no other woman was ever told “no” simply because of gender, and to ensure that women in our country have every opportunity that men have. It was this perseverance that ultimately resulted in her sponsorship and passage of Title IX, which as noted, was renamed in honor of her. But Title IX, 37 words, banned sex-based discrimination in schools.Today, we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Title IX, which was renamed for Patsy by George Miller, when he was Chair of the Education Committee, and I had the opportunity to serve with George Miller on the Education Committee for six years when I was in the U.S. Congress.37 words long, Title IX represented a sea change for women in our country. 50 years later, Title IX is just as important today as it was when Patsy fought for it. Thanks to Title IX, more women than ever before are leading in government, business, and of course, in medicine. But while we have come a long way since Patsy was rejected from medical school because of her gender—of course we still have a way to go for true equity.We need to strengthen Title IX and protect the rights of every student to a welcoming and supportive school environment. By working to build on the progress Congresswoman Patsy Mink worked so hard to secure, we are helping generations of women and girls to come to have the support they need to thrive in school and beyond.I am so glad that visitors to our Nation’s Capitol will be able to learn more about Patsy and her many accomplishments, and that they will be reminded of the power of perseverance.Mahalo everyone.###"

Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, hosted a roundtable with patients from across the country to hear directly about how Roe and the right to abortion have shaped their lives—and to make clear what’s at stake with the Supreme Court set to end Americans’ constitutional right to abortion any day.“What could be more fundamental than our right to control our own bodies? To wake up one morning to realize we no longer control our own bodies, which is exactly what will happen when the Supreme Court decision is made public and final,” said Senator Hirono. “That’s what we’re facing in this country. The impact of this decision is going to be deep and wide and, tragically, felt by millions and millions of people in this country. There are so many consequences of the elimination of Roe v. Wade that we have only begun to really recognize. The bottom line is that we need to tell our stories and organize.”“We’re now approaching 10 months living under SB8, the 6-week abortion ban in Texas, and awaiting a decision from the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. To say that we’ve already been experiencing a string of overlapping crises feels like an understatement,” said Sarah, a We Testify storyteller. “My abortion allowed me to recognize my power and create a life for myself that I’m proud of.”“We are very grateful for Senators Murray and Hirono’s leadership during this challenging time. The potential upending of Roe v. Wade will devastate the more than 60 percent of abortion recipients who are people of color,” said Isra Pananon Weeks, Interim Executive Director and Chief of Staff, National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum (NAPAWF). “Reproductive justice is a matter of life and death, and the path to abortion care can be an arduous one – AAPI community members can face language barriers, stigmas, and low rates of insurance obstructing their access to reproductive freedom.”Senator Hirono is a staunch advocate for abortion rights and reproductive freedom.

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-duckworth-lead-colleagues-in-calling-on-tsa-to-address-inconsistent-enforcement-of-screening-processes-for-breastfeeding-individuals,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, led 12 of their colleagues in calling on the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to address inconsistent implementation of the 3-1-1 Liquids Rule Exemption travel policy for breastmilk and formula at airport security checkpoints, and ensure lactating individuals and their infants can travel safely without fear of harassment.Under the TSA’s 3-1-1 Liquids Rule Exemption, travelers are permitted to bring formula and breastmilk in quantities greater than 3.4 ounces in carry-on baggage on board an aircraft, as well as ice packs, freezer packs, frozen gel packs and other accessories required to prevent formula and breastmilk from spoiling. However, the overly vague policy has been inconsistently interpreted and enforced, resulting in numerous reports of TSA officials harassing lactating individuals and destructing breastmilk and expensive breastfeeding equipment.“In several reported cases, individuals were forced to dispose of breast milk, cooling accessories, or both in order to board their flights, others were harassed and humiliated, had expensive breast pumps destroyed, and even forced to undress,” wrote the lawmakers. “We need to understand why TSA’s policies are not being implemented properly, ensure that policies are clear and women can travel safely without fear of harassment, and provide parents access to remedies for mistreatment.”In a letter sent today, the Senators asked for clarification on the 3-1-1 exemption policy and requested an outline of the TSA’s efforts to increase awareness about the agency’s established screening processes and procedures, investigate reports of mishandled screening processes, and provide training and resources to help ensure that agents will consistently enforce these policies. The lawmakers also highlighted the potential dangers of delayed pumping for individuals who are breastfeeding, and the dangers to infants if freshly pumped breastmilk is not stored properly.“Delayed pumping leads to painful swelling of the breasts that can become engorged, which can lead to plugged milk ducts,” the lawmakers continue. “This can lead to mastitis, a bacterial breast infection and even a breast abscess, which often requires hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics.”The letter requests that the TSA provides a response to their questions by July 6, 2022.The letter, led by Senators Hirono and Duckworth, has also been signed by Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), and Alex Padilla (D-CA).The full text of the letter is available here and below.The Honorable David PekoskeAdministratorTransportation Security Administration6595 Springfield Center DriveSpringfield, VA 20598-6005 Dear Administrator Pekoske:We write in response to multiple reports of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officials improperly implementing the agency’s 3-1-1 Liquids Rule Exemption travel policy for lactating individuals, putting infants and their mothers at risk. In several reported cases, individuals were forced to dispose of breast milk, cooling accessories, or both in order to board their flights, others were harassed and humiliated, had expensive breast pumps destroyed, and even forced to undress.Under TSA’s 3-1-1 Liquids Rule Exemption travelers are explicitly permitted to bring formula and breast milk in quantities greater than 3.4 ounces in carry-on baggage on board an aircraft. Under this exemption, travelers may also carry on ice packs, freezer packs, frozen gel packs and other accessories required to prevent formula and breast milk from spoiling. However, the policy has been interpreted and enforced inconsistently by TSA officials.Numerous media reports have detailed this inconsistent and improper implementation and highlighted the challenges and harassment many women and parents are subject to. For example, one woman was traveling with a cooler of pumped breast milk in her carry-on and TSA called the bomb squad to inspect her milk. After 45 minutes, a full-pat down inspection, and complete disassembly of her breast pump she missed her flight and discovered that the pump was totally inoperable. In another case, TSA agents confiscated a mother’s freezer packs, refused to discuss the policy, and instructed her to repeatedly collect ice from a coffee shop for hours to keep her breast milk cool while waiting to board her flight.3 Another passenger was informed—contrary to TSA’s stated policy—that she could not travel with the ice packs unless it was accompanied by breast milk and directed her to a public restroom to pump into the bottles before she was allowed through. It is clear there are serious and persistent issues around the implementation of the 3-1-1 Liquids Rule Exemption travel policy among TSA security officials.Depending on the age of their child, typically a breastfeeding parent needs to express milk every two to four hours to protect against health concerns and maintain milk supply. Given the total duration of air travel—from going to the airport, getting through security, and actually flying—a breastfeeding parent will most likely need to pump at least once. Delayed pumping leads to painful swelling of the breasts that can become engorged, which can lead to plugged milk ducts. This can lead to mastitis, a bacterial breast infection and even a breast abscess, which often requires hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics.7 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), freshly expressed or pumped milk can be stored at room temperature for up to 4 hours before the milk is considered dangerous to an infant and can lead to vomiting, fever, and diarrhea—meaning access to ice packs is a necessary and critical part of the process.We need to understand why TSA’s policies are not being implemented properly, ensure that policies are clear and women can travel safely without fear of harassment, and provide parents access to remedies for mistreatment. In light of these concerns, [we] ask that you please provide responses to the following:We respectfully request TSA respond no later than July 6, 2022. Thank you for your attention to this important issue.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-wyden-jacobs-introduce-bill-to-protect-reproductive-health-data,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ron Wyden (D-OR), Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, and Representative Sara Jacobs (D-CA), today introduced the My Body, My Data Act, legislation to protect personal reproductive health data by minimizing the information collected and retained, and preventing that information from being disclosed or misused. With the right-wing majority on the Supreme Court poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, the bill would create a new national standard, enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), to protect reproductive health data from sources like fertility tracking apps.“Extreme Republicans across the country aren’t only trying to take away women’s constitutional rights, they want to actually put people in jail for providing or seeking reproductive care,” said Senator Hirono. “This legislation will take steps to protect women’s privacy and ensure that individuals cannot collect data from websites or apps and use it against them.” In light of the leaked draft decision of the Supreme Court’s plans to overturn Roe v. Wade, advocates and scholars have raised serious concerns about data collected by apps and websites being used to target or arrest people if abortion is criminalized. This includes location data, search histories, and reproductive health data collected by menstruation, ovulation, and pregnancy tracking apps each month. With at least 26 states likely or certain to ban abortions if Roe is overturned, this legislation is necessary to help protect individuals from being prosecuted for seeking or helping others seek abortion care.Currently, few protections exist to prevent personal reproductive health data, or information about people seeking reproductive health services, from being collected, retained, or disclosed to third parties.

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-joins-32-colleagues-in-push-to-fight-food-insecurity,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) joined 32 of her Senate colleagues, in a letter led by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), to extend child nutrition waivers ahead of their expiration and enact a robust set of child nutrition priorities in any upcoming legislative vehicles. As school summer break is already underway in many states, it is vital that Congress extends and expands these programs as low-income families are facing a steep benefits cliff when the waivers expire on June 30, 2022.In the letter, the senators call to extend child nutrition waivers, create a nationwide Summer EBT program, and expand community eligibility (CEP), a flexible meal service option for school districts in low-income areas. These provisions are critical to fighting child hunger and food insecurity.“The pandemic has highlighted the importance of the child nutrition programs and the role they play in keeping hunger at bay for millions of children across the country. As schools close for summer across the country, families will soon lose access to free school meals and be faced with the prospect of increased food insecurity, weight gain, and learning disruptions,” said the senators. “As Congress develops legislation to support families impacted by high food costs, we must help ease the burden of these challenges and ensure that these child nutrition programs can fully meet children’s nutritional needs while they are at school, afterschool and summer programs, and childcare.”Earlier this year, Senator Hirono cosponsored legislation to extend U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) school and summer meal flexibilities to September 30, 2023. She also led the Hawaii delegation in urging the USDA to extend pandemic-related child nutrition waivers to prevent thousands of children and families from being forced into food insecurity. In April, Senator Hirono met Hawaii Department of Education officials to discuss the need to extend flexibilities that have allowed schools to continue feeding students throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.This letter is also signed by Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Angus King (I-ME), Tina Smith (D-MN), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Jack Reed (D-RI), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Mark Warner (D-VA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Ed Markey (D-MA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Gary Peters (D-MI), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Jeffrey Merkley (D-OR), and Chris Murphy (D-CT).This letter is endorsed by Food Research & Action Center, YMCA of the USA, Afterschool Alliance, Boys & Girls Club of America, Feeding America, School Nutrition Association, American Heart Association, Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, First Focus Campaign for Children, MomsRising, Center for Science in the Public Interest, National Parent Teacher Association, National Farm to School Network, School Superintendents Association, Save the Children, National Education Association, National Center for Health Research, Healthy Food America, Food Corps, Community Food Advocates, National CACFP Association, Society of Behavioral Medicine, Center for Food Equity & Economic Development, California Association of Food Banks, Healthy Schools Campaign, Voices for Georgia’s Children, and Georgia Statewide Afterschool Network.The full text of the letter is available here and below.Dear Leader Schumer, Speaker Pelosi, Leader McConnell, and Leader McCarthy,The pandemic has highlighted the importance of the child nutrition programs, and the role they play in keeping hunger at bay for millions of children across the country. As schools closed across the country, families faced the same challenges they face every summer when they lose access to free school meals: increased food insecurity, weight gain, and learning disruptions.As the Senate develops legislation to support families being impacted by high food costs and provide pandemic relief, we ask that it include the following three things in any upcoming packages to help ensure that the child nutrition programs are able to support recovery from the impact of the pandemic. School children have to have access to the nutrition they need to grow and thrive while they are at school and during the summer. These provisions will also set the stage for a much stronger Child Nutrition Reauthorization that can take additional steps to ensure that the child nutrition programs are able to fully meet children’s nutritional needs while they are at school, afterschool and summer programs, and in childcare.We look forward to working with you to include these provisions in the upcoming legislative vehicles being developed by Congress.###"

The provisions Hirono secured deliver robust investment in Hawaii, strengthen the military’s national security presence in the Pacific, and promote environmental sustainability. Additionally, Senator Hirono secured provisions authorizing the closure of the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility on Oahu and $1 billion in funding for the closure.“As the center of operations in the Pacific region, Hawaii plays a critical role in our national security, so I’m glad this year’s NDAA includes important provisions to support Hawaii’s role in protecting and defending our country,” said Senator Hirono. “I fought to include provisions to authorize and provide $1 billion in funding for the permanent defueling and closure of Red Hill, while ensuring proper environmental remediation. From advancing critical military construction projects in Hawaii to providing servicemembers with the tools to plan their futures, this year’s NDAA will enable our military to better address the threats of today and plan for the threats of tomorrow. I’d like to thank Chairman Reed and our colleagues for a productive and successful markup of this bill, and I look forward to helping pass it through the full Senate.”As a member of the Armed Services Committee and Chair of the Seapower Subcommittee, Senator Hirono secured several critical provisions for Hawaii and our nation in the FY23 NDAA, including language to:Red HillDelivering for HawaiiStrengthening Our Ability to Protect the Pacific RegionPrioritizing SustainabilityAdditionally, Senator Hirono secured a provision directing the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to assess DoD’s compliance with Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination, at schools run by the DoD Education Activity (DODEA).Committee approval is the first step in the process to establish defense funding levels and set policies for the DoD. The bill will next be debated and voted on by the full Senate, and the U.S. House of Representatives will debate and advance its own separate bill.  Once both the Senate and House pass their versions of the NDAA, they must be reconciled by a bicameral conference committee, and then approved by each chamber before a final version is sent to the President to be signed into law.Video of Sen. Hirono speaking about the NDAA’s provisions to authorize the closure of Red Hill is available here ###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-statement-on-senate-passage-of-legislation-to-expand-va-health-care-for-hawaii-veterans,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, voted to pass the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, comprehensive, bipartisan legislation to expand VA health care for veterans with health conditions related to burn pit and Agent Orange exposure. As a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, Senator Hirono helped negotiate the bipartisan bill. Upon Senate passage of the bill, Senator Hirono released the following statement:“Over decades of conflict, millions of American servicemembers have been exposed to burn pits and other toxic materials. These men and women risked their lives in service to our nation, and we have a duty to ensure they get care for conditions caused by these toxic exposures. For months, my colleagues and I on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee worked to craft a bill that meets our duty to these veterans, and I’m glad that we are closer than ever to seeing it signed into law,” said Senator Hirono. “This moment would not have been possible without all of the veterans and their loved ones who have shared their stories and advocated for these long-overdue changes. I thank them for their service and bravery, and I look forward to this bill being signed into law on their behalf. I’ll continue working to help make sure every veteran in Hawaii and across our country has access to high-quality care through the VA.”The legislation is named for Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson, who deployed to Kosovo and Iraq with the Ohio National Guard, and died in 2020 from toxic exposure as a result of his military service. Specifically, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022 will:The bill must now be passed by the House before going to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law. A previous version of the bill passed the House with bipartisan support earlier this year.A member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, Senator Hirono is committed to supporting our nation’s veterans. Last week, President Biden signed into law her bill to name a new VA health clinic under construction on Oahu after the late Senator Daniel K. Akaka. In March, she helped pass in the Senate bipartisan legislation to expand access to breast cancer screening and care for veterans. Hirono also introduced the Veterans and Family Information Act which required the VA to make information more accessible for non-English language speakers, enabling veterans and their families to better understand the benefits, programs, and resources available to them. She also introduced the Every Veteran Counts Act directing the VA to establish and regularly update a database of veterans’ demographic data.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/video-hirono-highlights-progress-on-red-hill-closure-efforts-to-support-servicemembers-in-ndaa-subcommittee-markups,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, delivered remarks in two subcommittee markups for the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) reiterating her support for the closure of the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility on Oahu, and highlighting the need to support servicemembers. Specifically, she highlighted efforts to combat military sexual harassment, protect servicemembers’ access to abortion, and provide fertility preservation services to servicemembers.Senator Hirono delivered remarks in the Readiness Subcommittee markup on the progress being made toward beginning the defueling and permanent closure of the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility.“Red Hill has played an important role in our nation’s defense for decades—it’s a World War II facility, a massive facility,” said Senator Hirono. “But it is clear that it is no longer the most strategic option for fuel storage in the pacific, and its ongoing operation poses a very real threat to the health and safety of communities in Hawaii. Earlier this year, Secretary Austin announced the Defense Department’s decision to permanently defuel and close Red Hill, a decision I strongly support, not to mention the people of Hawaii support. I’m proud that, with this NDAA, and the work of this Committee, we are authorizing that closure and giving DOD additional authorities to protect the health and safety of Hawaii families, while continuing to defend our state and our nation.”In the Personnel Subcommittee markup, Senator Hirono discussed her efforts to support servicemembers, stating, “I want to express my dismay with attempts by members of this Committee to use this NDAA to make it even harder for our female servicemembers to access abortion care. The Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade and eliminate the constitutional right to an abortion. This would be devastating for women across the country, including female servicemembers, who already face barriers to accessing abortions. This committee is responsible for considering the real-life impact that state laws banning abortion could have on servicemembers stationed in states that ban abortion.”Following the Subcommittee markups, the full Armed Services Committee will markup the NDAA, which sets Defense Department policy and funding levels for the coming year.Video of Senator Hirono’s entire Readiness statement can be found here and her Personnel statement can be found here. Transcripts of both are below. Senator Mazie Hirono Readiness Subcommittee RemarksThank you very much. I’d like to submit a statement on the work on this Committee. Over the last year, we have seen the Navy contaminate the drinking water of thousands of families, impacting also so many businesses, on Oahu due to leaks at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility under the Navy’s control.For months, nearly 4,000 families were forced out of their homes, living in hotels, living with family and friends, for months. And as I mentioned, businesses on and around base, were forced to close due to the water contamination. I’ve met and talked with many of the impacted people.The Navy’s initial handling of this crisis led to executive orders, lawsuits, and questioning of the Navy’s commitment to the health and safety of Hawaii’s people.Red Hill has played an important role in our nation’s defense for decades—it’s a World War II facility, a massive facility. But it is clear that it is no longer the most strategic option for fuel storage in the pacific, and its ongoing operation poses a very real threat to the health and safety of communities in Hawaii.Earlier this year, Secretary Austin announced the Defense Department’s decision to permanently defuel and close Red Hill, a decision I strongly support, not to mention the people of Hawaii support.And in March, the President released his Fiscal Year 2023 budget, which includes $1 billion in funding for the safe closure of Red Hill.I’m proud that, with this NDAA, and the work of this Committee, we are authorizing that closure and giving DOD additional authorities to protect the health and safety of Hawaii families, while continuing to defend our state and our nation.I thank you Mr. Chairman, and of course I thank Chairman Reed for his partnership for the decision that was made which is a really big deal because the discussion about what to do regarding Red Hill was not going to come to any kind of a decision until a time frame much, much later than today. In fact, I think 2045. So this is a decision that we are very grateful for. So I thank everyone, thank you and your committee members for helping us through this really important process.  Senator Mazie Hirono Personnel Subcommittee RemarksMadam Chair, our servicemembers are the foundation of our armed forces and we have a responsibility to support and protect them.Tragically, far too many servicemembers, particularly women, experience sexual assault and harassment while serving this country. No one protecting this country should have to worry about protecting themselves from violence and harassment from within the ranks.Last year’s NDAA took important steps by making historic changes to the way the military prosecutes allegations of sexual assault. It moved prosecution of sexual assault cases out of the chain of command and under a newly created Special Trial Counsel. The range of behaviors that results in military sexual trauma continues, so there is still more work to be done.I’ve introduced legislation to build on the progress we’ve made regarding sexual assault by placing sexual harassment under the special trial counsel as well, and ensuring independent professionals are investigating allegations of sexual harassment.But ensuring our servicemembers are safe, respected, and supported in our military requires a more holistic approach. Which is why I’m offering amendments to provide fertility preservation—or cryopreservation—services to help our servicemembers plan for their futures.One of the top reasons servicemembers – especially women – choose to leave our military is because of the difficulties involved in starting a family while serving. But if women had the option to freeze their eggs, it would allow them to continue their career in the military, while also protecting their ability to have children in the future.  And it would give servicemembers—and their partners—the peace of mind ahead of combat deployments, all the while, enabling our military to better retain servicemembers. This is not something new—the British Armed Forces already offer fertility preservation benefits. I’ve introduced an amendment to direct the DoD to assess servicemembers’ interest in access to fertility preservation, and the cost of offering fertility preservation to military personnel, and another to establish a pilot program under TRICARE to offer fertility preservation to active duty servicemembers who are interested. Servicemembers shouldn’t have to decide between continuing their career in the military and starting a family—and these amendments will help make that a reality.There’s a lot more that needs to be done to ensure our servicemembers are fully supported—but another health issue I’d like to mention is improving our coverage of autism treatment services. We secured a provision in last year’s NDAA to improve the collection and analysis of data on participants in the DoD’s Autism Care Demonstration. I look forward to seeing this improved data in the coming year so that we can better ensure all military families can access the care they need.And lastly, I want to express my dismay with attempts by members of this Committee to use this NDAA to make it even harder for our female servicemembers to access abortion care. The Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade and eliminate the constitutional right to an abortion. This would be devastating for women across the country, including female servicemembers, who already face barriers to accessing abortions.This committee is responsible for considering the real-life impact that state laws banning abortion could have on servicemembers stationed in states that ban abortion.These impacts are no longer hypothetical, and raise serious questions, including: Will the possibility of being stationed in a state that restricts abortion access drive servicemembers out of the military, or will servicemembers be prosecuted for seeking a safe abortion for themselves or their loved ones? Will victims of military sexual assault be forced to give birth?Servicemembers have the right to control their own bodies, no matter where they are stationed. It is this Committee’s responsibility to protect that right, which is why I joined Sen. Gillibrand in introducing the MARCH Act. Our bill would allow military medical treatment facilities to provide abortion services, regardless of the circumstances, in order to address post-Roe impacts.It’s more important to protect servicemembers bodily autonomy than to perpetuate a right-wing political ideology.###"

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-make-registering-to-vote-easier-for-all-americans,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined nine of her colleagues in introducing legislation to make registering to vote easier for all Americans. The Register America to Vote Act, led by Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), would require every state to create a system to register all eligible citizens to vote when they turn 18, and ensure all eligible voters are covered by automatic registration through motor vehicle agencies.“The freedom to vote is fundamental to our democracy. This bill helps ensure every eligible American has the opportunity to exercise that freedom by making it easier to register to vote,” said Senator Hirono. “With states across the country enacting voter suppression laws and other efforts to limit the right to vote, it’s critical that we do everything in our power to protect voting rights. The Register America to Vote Act will build on the progress states like Hawaii have already made in enacting automatic voter registration, helping to secure the right of all Americans to have a say in our democracy.”Automatic voter registration is a proven policy, with 22 states – including Hawaii – and the District of Columbia having already authorized or implemented automatic voter registration systems. Last June, Hawaii enacted a law establishing automatic voter registration – it requires a voter registration application as part of the application for an identification card or driver’s license. The Register America to Vote Act would provide more focused assistance to improve Hawaii’s registration system and database security. Hawaii could also be eligible for grants to build up its automatic voter registration efforts.The Register America to Vote Act would: Senator Hirono has been a long-time champion of voting rights legislation and protections. At the start of the pandemic, she introduced the Natural Disaster and Emergency Ballot Act of 2020, which ensured that Americans would be able to vote, even in a public health emergency, by expanding early in-person voting and absentee vote-by-mail to all states. In March 2020, she also called on the Senate to pass the For the People Act, which would have expanded voting access for Americans.Senator Hirono also cosponsored the Native American Voting Rights Act of 2021, which protected the right to vote and ensure equal access to the electoral process for American Indians, Alaska Natives, and voters living on Tribal lands. She is also a cosponsor and strong advocate of the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, and last December, she delivered remarks on the Senate floor urging her colleagues to pass voting rights legislation.In addition to Senators Hirono and Klobuchar, the legislation was also sponsored by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR).###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/president-signs-bill-establishing-commission-to-study-creation-of-national-museum-of-asian-pacific-american-history-and-culture,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, President Joseph R. Biden signed into law legislation brought to the Senate floor by Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), to establish a commission to study the creation of a National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and Culture. Amid a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, the creation of such a museum would help promote understanding about Asian Pacific Islander American (APIA) communities and their many contributions to American history and culture. The bill previously passed in the House, where it was introduced by Representative Grace Meng (D-NY), and passed in the Senate unanimously in May.“Despite many noteworthy contributions in various spaces, Asian and Pacific Islander American individuals and communities have largely been excluded or erased from American history for years,” said Senator Hirono. “We are often pejoratively depicted as foreigners, instead of people who have lived in and positively contributed to this country for generations—narratives which have fueled xenophobia and prejudice, contributing to decades of racist laws and discrimination. Establishing a National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and Culture would help combat these harmful narratives by helping us to better understand each other, and our shared history as Americans. I am glad that President Biden has signed this historic legislation into law and I’ll continue working to make sure our communities’ stories are told.”“Throughout our history, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders have literally shaped the history and the contours of this country,” said President Biden. “Museums of this magnitude and consequence are going to inspire and educate. More than anything else, it's going to help people see themselves in the story of America - the story that has made us a better America.”The bill establishes an eight-person commission, appointed equally by House and Senate Majority and Minority leadership, comprised of individuals with deep expertise in the research, study, and promotion of Asian Pacific American history, museum administration, and other relevant fields. The commission would be responsible for submitting a report with recommendations to the President and Congress on the potential creation of a museum. Congress would then need to act on those recommendations to establish the museum.Congress has previously established other similar museums. In 2003, Congress passed a law to create the National Museum of African American History and Culture. In 2020, Congress passed legislation to create a National Museum of the American Latino.Senator Hirono has long advocated on behalf of APIA communities in Hawaii, the U.S., and Pacific Island nations and territories. To address the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes and violence during the heart of the pandemic, Senator Hirono introduced the COVID-19 Hates Crimes Act—bipartisan, bicameral legislation that was signed into law by President Biden on May 20, 2021. For the last several years, Senator Hirono has led the Senate resolution recognizing May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. Last month, she also introduced the Teaching Asian Pacific American History Act – bicameral legislation that would promote the teaching of Asian Pacific American history for high school students and teachers who enroll in the U.S. Department of Education’s American History and Civics Academies programs.###"
http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-and-warren-lead-colleagues-in-legislation-to-electrify-military-vehicle-fleet-and-cut-emissions,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, joined Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in introducing the Military Vehicle Fleet Electrification Act, which would transition the nontactical fleet of the Department of Defense (DoD) to electric or other zero-emission vehicles. The legislation would require at least 75% of all non-tactical vehicles, such as cars, vans, and light-duty trucks, purchased or leased by DoD or procured or leased by the General Services Agency (GSA) for DoD, to be electric or zero-emission vehicles while applying Buy American and other standards to create good American jobs.“Transitioning the Defense Department’s non-combat vehicle fleet to electric and other zero-emissions vehicles is a critical step in reducing our government’s carbon emissions,” said Senator Hirono. “This legislation will help combat climate change while helping to ensure our military has the advantages of a modern fleet of vehicles that reduces the military’s dependence on oil. I’m grateful for the partnership of Senator Warren, Rep. Garamendi, and our colleagues, and I look forward to working to secure this important provision in this year’s National Defense Authorization Act.”DoD currently has more than 174,00 nontactical vehicles across service branches – the second-largest share of the federal vehicle fleet after the U.S. Postal Service – and is the largest institutional consumer of petroleum in the world. In December 2021, the Biden administration's Federal Sustainability Plan found that 56 percent of the federal government’s total greenhouse gas emissions come from DoD.The Military Vehicle Fleet Electrification Act: In addition to Senators Hirono and Warren, this legislation is cosponsored by Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Angus King (I-VT). U.S. Representative John Garamendi (D-CA), Chair of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness, introduced the legislation in the House of Representatives. The Military Vehicle Fleet Electrification Act is supported by Securing America’s Future Energy (SAFE) and SAFE’s Commanding Heights Initiative, National Electrical Contractors Association, Natural Resources Defense Council; National Mining Association; International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; E2 (Environmental Entrepreneurs). The full text of the bill is available here.

http://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-calls-for-federal-investment-in-affordable-accessible-child-care,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) delivered remarks in support of child care investments during a press conference with parents, child care advocates, and other members of Congress. Senator Hirono emphasized the importance of making high-quality child care both affordable and accessible, and also highlighted the disproportionate impact that the lack of child care has on women.“I’m really glad to stand here with my colleagues from both the House and the Senate to say that we need legislation to enable all of this,” said Senator Hirono in her remarks. “Businesses large and small are talking about how much they need employees, and yet they don’t seem to be able to connect the dots that a large part of why they can’t meet those needs is because we don’t provide affordable, accessible child care.”Senator Hirono has been a strong and consistent advocate for early childhood programs during her time in Congress.Last year, she and Senators Patty Murray (D-WA) and Bob Casey (D-PA) reintroduced the Child Care for Working Families Act, which would ensure working and middle class families have access to high-quality, affordable child care. She also helped pass the American Rescue Plan Act, which included $39 billion for child care programs in the United States—including nearly $130 million to support Hawaii child care programs.More recently, she met with Hawaii parents and child care providers to discuss the shortage of quality, affordable child care in the state.A transcript of Senator Hirono’s remarks is below and video can be found here.Aloha, everybody. So, I heard the word ‘stress’ used a number of times today. You know, businesses large and small are stressed because they can’t find workers at a time when we have some of the lowest unemployment rates in – I don’t even know – decades. We have child care providers who are stressed because they want to provide a service that they love – they love children. I’ve talked with child care providers in Hawaii and they’ve lost employees too, so they’re stressed. And parents are stressed because they can’t find accessible, affordable child care.There is an answer, folks, and I’m really glad to stand here with my colleagues from both the House and the Senate to say that we need legislation to enable all of this to be happening in our country. We are one of the few countries – developed nations – that does not provide this kind of support to our families. And you notice that a lot these burdens fall on women? Yeah. So, I’m really glad that there are so many women here and enlightenment to come together to say we need to do this because businesses large and small are talking about how much they need employees, and yet they don’t seem to be able to connect the dots that a large part of why they can’t meet those needs is because we don’t provide affordable, accessible child care. And that’s what we’re here to do, so mahalo everybody, we shall persevere.###"
