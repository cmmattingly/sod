https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/in-pilsen-duckworth-sba-administrator-guzman-representative-garcia-emphasize-importance-of-supporting-small-businesses-," [CHICAGO, IL] — In honor of Hispanic Heritage Month and in support of Illinois’s Latino business community, U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship, visited the National Museum of Mexican Art in Chicago’s Pilsen neighborhood and held a roundtable with small business owners to emphasize her commitment to supporting entrepreneurs. Duckworth, along with U.S. Small Business Administrator Isabella Guzman and U.S. Representative Jesús Chuy García (D-IL-4) discussed their efforts to empower underrepresented entrepreneurs in the face of COVID-19 and how several Small Business Administration’s (SBA) federal pandemic relief programs have helped and can continue doing so. Photos of the event are available here.“Small businesses are more than just places to visit and shop, they are part of the glue that holds communities together and for every small business that we work to keep open, that’s at least one job saved, and that’s a community keeping an important piece of economic development and culture,” said Duckworth. “As we support small businesses, I’ll keep working to level the playing field for entrepreneurs of color, women and Veterans while working to strengthen local economies marked by social and economic disadvantage. I’m so glad to be in Pilsen today and see how resilient so many Latino owned businesses have been and I know my work in supporting Illinois’s entrepreneurs is not done.”“Latinos are starting and growing small businesses at the highest rates, and their hard work and resilience has helped them to persevere, adapt, and thrive thanks to support from the SBA and critical local partners and resources,” said Guzman. “I was honored to join Senator Duckworth today to celebrate their successes during Hispanic Heritage Month and meet directly with Chicago small business owners and their advocates to hear how the federal government and the SBA can help them continue to overcome challenges to build their enterprises, create jobs, and fuel our economy. President Biden has put equity at the heart of everything we do and SBA is advancing access to resources and affordable capital for all small business owners. With landmark new legislation like the Infrastructure Bill and the Inflation Reduction Act, we need all our great entrepreneurs and innovators to build a future economy, and we’ll continue to work with Senator Duckworth and Congress to make sure they get the support they need to grow and succeed.”“Small businesses are the soul of our neighborhoods and make-up the backbone of our economy. On 26th street, just a few blocks from my home, we have the second largest tax-grossing retail corridor in Chicago. On the northwest side, Paseo Boricua continues to see new and old businesses open and thrive,” said García. “Although many of these small businesses were hit hard by the pandemic, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is now building on the support provided in the American Rescue Plan to aid with their recovery. I look forward to working with Administrator Guzman to ensure these resources get to small, minority-owned businesses and that information is made available in Spanish and other languages.”Duckworth, Guzman and García were joined by SBA Region V Administrator Geri Aglipay, SBA Illinois District Director Bo Steiner, SBA Illinois Deputy District Director Mark Ferguson, National Museum of Mexican Art President and Founder Carlos Tortolero, National Museum of Mexican Art Director of Operations Alex Alvarez, Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Jaime di Paulo, Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Director of Policy Adrian Rodriguez, Franco Hauling President July Franco, Economic Strategies Development Corporation President Alex Esparza, Economic Strategies Development Corporation Community Outreach official Salvador Cerna, Pilsen Cellular Owner Aldo Rodriguez, Little Village Chamber of Commerce Executive Board Member Eve Rodriguez Montoya and The Resurrection Project CEO Raul Raymondo.Duckworth has been a consistent advocate for underrepresented entrepreneurs and for providing critical relief to businesses during the pandemic. This May, Duckworth held a virtual meeting with SBA Region V Administrator Geri Aglipay to discuss how they’re working to help eliminate hurdles for Black, Latino, Asian American, women and other underrepresented Illinoisans looking to form and grow their small businesses. A week before that meeting, the Senator spoke out after Senate Republicans blocked the passage of the Small Business COVID Relief Act, legislation which would have provided critical relief to restaurants, live event venues and other small businesses.Last summer, Duckworth called for more assistance for minority owned-businesses as they recovered from the economic impacts of COVID-19. In a letter to SBA Administrator Guzman, Duckworth asked Guzman to use any and all available authorities to assist the more than 2,900 women-, minority- and Veteran-owned small businesses that were denied Restaurant Revitalization Fund assistance that Congress intended for them to receive.Duckworth is also a co-sponsor of U.S. Senator and Small Business Committee Chair Ben Cardin (D-MD)’s Continuing Emergency Support for Restaurants Act, as well as Senator Kyrsten Sinema’s (D-AZ) Restaurant Revitalization Fund Replenishment Act. Duckworth was also a co-sponsor of the RESTAURANTS Act, provisions of which were included in the American Rescue Plan and her bipartisan Interagency Committee on Women’s Business Enterprise Act, which would reauthorize the Interagency Committee for Women’s Business Enterprise, has passed the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.-30-"
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-meets-with-doctors-and-survivors-of-highland-park-massacre-advocating-to-get-weapons-of-war-off-our-streets," [WASHINGTON, DC] – U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) today met with a group of Highland Park doctors who are both her constituents and members of March Fourth, a gun safety advocacy non-profit, to discuss the need to end the sale of weapons of war at the federal level. Some of these doctors were also survivors of the Highland Park Fourth of July Parade Massacre. Duckworth is both a cosponsor and advocate of the Assault Weapons Ban of 2021. Photos from today’s meeting are available here.“Today, I met with both doctors and survivors of the Highland Park Massacre and, once again, I heard the same call—the same plea—I’ve heard from so many other constituents and survivors of mass shootings across our nation: we need to get weapons of war off our streets,” said Duckworth. “For Highland Park, for Uvalde, for Buffalo, for Chicago and for every other community terrorized by senseless gun violence, we need to suspend the filibuster and act to end the sale of new weapons of war so we can help stop another day of patriotism, another math class or another trip to the grocery store from turning into a living nightmare. Enough was enough a long time ago.”Duckworth is a fierce advocate for getting weapons of war off our streets. Following the Highland Park Fourth of July Parade Massacre, Duckworth joined mothers from the Highland Park area, as well as survivors of Highland Park and other mass shootings like Uvalde and Parkland, at a rally on Capitol Hill to call on Congress to do more to address our nation’s senseless gun violence epidemic. That same day, Duckworth met with residents and heard their personal experiences from the shooting while they discussed additional gun safety reforms that need to be enacted to help keep our communities safe, such as ending the sale of weapons of war. Two days later, Duckworth made an impassioned call for these gun safety reforms on the Senate floor. The week after that, Duckworth also delivered opening remarks to a U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing focused on protecting our communities from mass shootings where she emphasized that our nation’s gun violence epidemic is now the leading cause of death for young Americans and implored her colleagues to support additional commonsense gun safety reforms.Duckworth supported the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which President Biden signed into law to help crack down on straw purchasing, expands background checks for buyers under 21 years of age, takes steps to close the “boyfriend loophole,” supports state red flag laws, and offers billions in funding for counseling, mental health, and trauma support for victims of gun violence. While the bipartisan legislation was a starting point for gun reform, Duckworth continues to call for additional reform, such as ending the sale of weapons of war.-30-"
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/bipartisan-duckworth-moran-resolution-to-recognize-september-2022-as-national-student-parent-month-passes-senate," [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – Today, U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Jerry Moran (R-KS) introduced and passed by voice vote a bipartisan resolution recognizing September 2022 as National Student Parent Month. The resolution highlights the contributions and achievements of the nearly 4 million Americans with children who attend postsecondary educational institutions.“By passing this bipartisan resolution to recognize September 2022 as National Student Parent Month, the Senate is sending an important message to the millions of Americans who are both raising children and trying to balance college coursework that we have their backs—especially those who face unique challenges, like single parents, military families or first-generation college students,” said Duckworth. “I’m proud to lead this resolution alongside Senator Moran, and we will continue supporting student parents as they work to provide a better future for their families.”“Being a parent while juggling homework and classes requires tenacity and endurance,” said Moran. “This is especially true for many of our military-connected students who are parents and are seeking a degree or professional certification while on active duty, transitioning back to civilian life, or while a spouse is deployed.”Full text of the resolution is available here.“Higher Learning Advocates is thrilled that the Senate has passed S. Res. TK, the Student Parent Resolution, designating this September the second annual National Student Parent Month,” said Julie Peller, Executive Director of Higher Learning Advocates, which has endorsed the resolution. “Almost 4,000,000 students in college today are parents, with 51% of them being students of color and 43% being single mothers. Despite the many responsibilities they juggle, student parents excel academically despite the many systemic barriers that stand in their way. I’d like to thank Senators Duckworth and Moran for reintroducing this important resolution that allows us to both celebrate parenting students’ achievements while also recognizing that higher education policy change would allow even more student parents to succeed.”Duckworth has been a strong advocate for women and families throughout her service in the House and Senate. Last August, Duckworth reintroduced her Child Care Access Means Parents in Schools (CCAMPIS) Reauthorization Act, which would help increase access to on-campus child care for low-income student parents and ensure the U.S. Department of Education is meeting the needs of our student parent populations by permanently reauthorizing and fully funding the CCAMPIS program—the only federal program dedicated to supporting the needs of student parents and on-campus child care services. Earlier this year, Duckworth secured a $10 million increase in CCAMPIS funding for a total of $65 million included in the Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22) Omnibus signed into law by President Biden in March.-30-"
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-durbin-join-bipartisan-push-for-increased-action-from-pentagon-to-address-pfas-exposure-at-military-installations," [WASHINGTON, DC] – U.S Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), combat Veteran and member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, and U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) joined U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Mike Rounds (R-SD) in sending a bipartisan letter to U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Secretary Lloyd Austin urging increased funding for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) testing and remediation. Additionally, the Senators urged Secretary Austin to improve PFAS-related planning to make use of the higher funding levels Congress is willing to appropriate to address the pervasive issue.In their letter, the Senators wrote: “As you know, PFAS chemicals have emerged as widespread contaminants to the drinking water sources of military bases across the country largely due to their presence in aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) used by the military. Members of the military, veterans and civilians who have served at military installations and/or live in the surrounding communities found to have been contaminated with PFAS face health risks related to exposure to PFAS chemicals, as these materials are found in AFFF, in personal protective equipment used by firefighters and in standard consumer products.” The Senators outlined the findings of the recent National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report that calls for expanded access to PFAS testing for Americans with a history of exposure to the chemicals and points to health risks such as high cholesterol, decreased fetal and infant growth and increased risks of kidney cancer for those exposed to PFAS. The Senators then continued to detail the robust amount of federal dollars provided by Congress to DoD to accelerate PFAS testing remediation and Congress’ continued willingness to provide additional resources to address the challenges the Department faces due to PFAS exposure. In conclusion, the Senators urged the Administration to put greater emphasis on addressing these pollutants: “Our service members, military families, veterans and defense communities deserve the Department’s full attention to appropriately address the scope and severity of PFAS contamination. We ask you to honor that responsibility and take the steps necessary to prioritize this hazard impacting our communities.” Along with Duckworth, Durbin, Shaheen and Rounds, the letter is co-signed by U.S. Senators Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Mike Braun (R-IN), Angus King (I-ME), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Gary Peters (D-MI), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Patty Murray (D-WA), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Jon Ossoff (D-GA), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Brian Schatz (D-HI), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and Ed Markey (D-MA).  A full copy of the letter is available here and below: Dear Secretary Austin:We write with continued concern about the Department of Defense’s (DoD) efforts to address contamination from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Nearly 700 military installations nationwide have known or suspected PFAS contamination, exposing service members and their families, and civilian communities near DoD installations to these toxic chemicals[1]. Given Congress’ continued commitment to provide funding to address PFAS contamination, we respectfully request that the Department similarly prioritize planning and programming for PFAS testing and remediation. As you know, PFAS chemicals have emerged as widespread contaminants to the drinking water sources of military bases across the country largely due to their presence in aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) used by the military. Members of the military, veterans and civilians who have served at military installations and/or live in the surrounding communities found to have been contaminated with PFAS face health risks related to exposure to PFAS chemicals, as these materials are found in AFFF, in personal protective equipment used by firefighters and in standard consumer products. The prevalence of PFAS allows for multiple pathways for exposure. The recently released National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report calls for expanded access to PFAS testing for Americans with a history of exposure to the chemicals and points to health risks such as high cholesterol, decreased fetal and infant growth and increased risks of kidney cancer for those exposed to PFAS[2]. These health concerns pose a significant hazard to the safety of our communities, and individuals either previously or currently exposed to toxic PFAS chemicals, underscoring the urgency of reducing exposure.Over the past six years, Congress has increased funding by $1 billion for the Department to accelerate PFAS testing and remediation, more than doubling the amount requested in the annual budget request during that time frame. As evidenced by the historic $517 million authorization for PFAS-related activities included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022, Congress has indicated a willingness to provide even greater funding to address these challenges. We are, however, concerned that DoD has failed to adequately prepare for additional funding being made available. It is our understanding that one of the major obstacles in the way of Congress putting more resources toward this problem is a lack of planning by the Department on how to execute a higher funding level. Simply put, DoD is not sufficiently prioritizing PFAS testing, remediation and disposal as part of its annual budget process, nor is the Department adequately developing the appropriate plans to utilize even higher funding levels as provided by Congress.DoD has a responsibility to place greater emphasis on addressing these pollutants impacting service members, military families and defense communities. Therefore, we strongly urge the Department to match Congress’ urgency for addressing testing and remediation by developing requirements-based plans, policies, and programs and appropriately increasing DoD’s annual budget requests for PFAS-related activities, including for PFAS destruction. Further, we expect that, as a part of this analysis, the Department will address past planning and programming deficiencies that DoD has claimed limits their ability to execute higher levels of funding, and we request that DoD provide a plan to Congress no later than upon the release of the President’s Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2024 on how the Department is prepared to execute increased funding levels for PFAS-related activities. Finally, we support DoD’s cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency on PFAS, including collaboration on research and testing efforts, and encourage the Department to continue investing in joint efforts to address PFAS.Our service members, military families, veterans and defense communities deserve the Department’s full attention to appropriately address the scope and severity of PFAS contamination. We ask you to honor that responsibility and take the steps necessary to prioritize this hazard impacting our communities.Sincerely,-30- "
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-hirono-daines-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-better-protect-new-parents-traveling-with-breast-milk," [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) introduced bipartisan legislation to make it easier for parents to safely travel with breast milk. The Bottles and Breastfeeding Equipment Screening (BABES) Enhancement Act, co-led by U.S. Senators Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) and Steve Daines (R-MT), would require the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to clarify and regularly update guidance on handling breast milk, baby formula and other related nutrition products in consultation with leading maternal health groups. U.S. Representative Katie Porter (D-CA-45) introduced an identical companion bill in the House, which is co-sponsored by U.S. Representatives Maria Salazar (R-FL-27) and Eric Swalwell (D-CA-15).“Too often, I hear stories of new moms being mistreated and denied access to their breast milk and the breastfeeding equipment that they need to pump and feed their babies,” said Senator Duckworth. “To make things worse, many of these incidents with TSA employees are flat-out inconsistent with the screening policies that TSA already has in place and it has to stop. That’s why I’m proud to introduce this legislation alongside Congresswoman Porter to make sure that TSA does all it can to keep its employees up to speed on their own policies and update these policies accordingly. It’s the least we can do to better ensure all new parents are provided with the respect and dignity they deserve while traveling.”“Too often TSA screening checkpoints put infants and their mothers at risk,” said Senator Hirono. “We have heard far too many stories about mothers being harassed, humiliated, and even put in danger simply for traveling with milk and supplies they need to keep their babies fed. By requiring TSA to clarify and regularly update its guidance on handling breast milk and baby formula, the Bottles and Breastfeeding Equipment Screening Enhancement Act will help ensure parents and their young children can travel safely and with peace of mind.”“We need to be doing everything we can to support mothers in every environment – that includes TSA screening checkpoints,” said Senator Daines. “Nursing mothers deserve clarity and compassion when it comes to traveling with breast milk and baby formula and I’m glad to work with my colleagues on this bipartisan bill to support Montana moms.” “With three kids of our own, my wife and I know the stress of traveling with young children,” said Congressman Swalwell. “I’m proud to support this bipartisan, bicameral legislation so that we can make it easier for families to travel with the supplies and food they need.”This legislation comes a few months after Emily Calandrelli, host of popular Netflix show Emily’s Wonder Lab and a constituent of Porter’s, was recently delayed at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) while carrying supplies she needed to safely pump milk for her 10-week-old son. Calandrelli was ultimately forced to check her items despite existing TSA guidelines that permitted her to carry them on. Calandrelli shared her story online and was flooded with hundreds of messages from other mothers who had similar experiences while traveling, including Duckworth.The Bottles and Breastfeeding Equipment Screening Enhancement Act would help keep kids and their parents safe and healthy. Mishandled breast milk can become contaminated, which puts children at risk. Moreover, parents who lactate typically need to breastfeed or pump once every few hours. Failure to do so can result in a painful infection called mastitis. The legislation would better protect families by requiring TSA to: This legislation would also direct an independent government watchdog to conduct an audit of compliance with TSA screening policies for passengers traveling with breast milk and other infant nutrition products, providing lawmakers with information related to violations of policies like those experienced by Calandrelli.This legislation is endorsed by March of Dimes, the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.A copy of the bill text can be found here.Duckworth has been a strong advocate in ensuring new moms receive the dignity and respect they deserve while traveling. In June, Duckworth pressed TSA Administrator David Pekoske for improved treatment of new mothers and Americans with disabilities from employees of the TSA. Duckworth and Hirono also called on TSA to address inconsistent implementation of the 3-1-1 Liquids Rule Exemption travel policy for breastmilk and formula at airport security checkpoints as well as ensure new moms and their infants can travel safely without fear of harassment.Duckworth has also championed several policies that help make air travel easier for new moms and Americans with disabilities, including her Friendly Airports for Mothers (FAM) Improvement Act, bipartisan legislation ensuring that small airports across the country support new moms and promote breastfeeding-friendly environments, was signed into law in 2020. The legislation builds on Duckworth’s success in enacting a law that ensures all large and medium airports provide a clean, private space where moms can breastfeed or pump. Recently, O’Hare and Midway Airports both installed free-standing lactation pods for new mothers as a result of Duckworth’s FAM Improvement Act.As a result of legislation that was passed by Duckworth, the Department of Transportation implemented a new rule requiring air carriers to disclose for the first time how many checked bags, wheelchairs and motorized scooters they damage or mishandle each month.-30-"
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-and-durbin-relieved-by-release-of-american-hostage-in-afghanistan-mark-frerichs," [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) issued the following statements after the family of Mark Frerichs, an Illinoisan held hostage for more than two and a half years after being abducted in Afghanistan in 2020, announced that Mark has been freed from Taliban custody:“It’s a profound relief that Mark Frerichs, a Navy Veteran who served our nation honorably, is now safely back in American hands after being kidnapped in Afghanistan more than two and a half years ago,” said Duckworth. “I’m thrilled that his family, who have long been Mark’s champions, will get to reunite with him. I applaud President Biden, who I spoke with personally about the need to get Mark home, for taking the steps necessary to prove that we do not leave Americans behind.”“I am deeply heartened by Mark’s long overdue release and the relief it will bring to him and his family. The tragic and cruel use of him as a hostage has finally come to an end. I want to thank President Biden and his team for their tireless effort to secure Mark’s release and regular engagement with us and his family along the way,” said Durbin.After Frerichs was abducted by the Taliban, Haqqani network or their affiliates in Afghanistan, Duckworth and Durbin have repeatedly called on both the Trump and Biden administrations to prioritize his safe return. Duckworth even spoke directly with President Biden in the Oval Office about Frerichs captivity and the need to secure his safe return. During a SASC hearing this past May, Duckworth discussed her concern for the safe return of Frerichs and secured a commitment from Mr. David F. Helvey, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs, to pursue opportunities to advocate for Frerichs’ safe return. In July, Duckworth spoke with Secretary Blinken about the importance of securing Mark Frerich’s safe release. During a recent Senate Appropriations Committee hearing, Durbin urged Secretary Blinken to do everything in his power to bring home Frerichs.-30-"
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-blasts-republican-proposal-to-ban-abortions-nationwide," [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) joined U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and her colleagues for a press conference condemning the new Republican proposal to establish a nationwide abortion ban. Video of the Senator’s remarks can be found here.Key quotes:This proposal makes obvious that Republicans never really wanted to leave women's rights to the states like they have long told the American people.And while Democrats spent this summer helping working families keep more of their hard-earned money, Republicans spent theirs trying to strip away millions of Americans’ rights and effectively making 50% of America second-class citizens who do not have the right to decide what happens to their own bodies.I'm going to keep doing everything I can in my power to prevent this nationwide ban on basic healthcare—a ban that explicitly goes against what the vast majority of Americans want—from happening.Duckworth’s full remarks as delivered are below:Hi, everyone.You know, if I listen hard enough, and maybe you can as well, I can almost hear the echoes of many, many of my Republican colleagues claiming—insisting—that if the Supreme Court overturns Roe, they would still never, never push for a nationwide abortion ban. You could almost hear it.Well, if you still believe them, then I have a bridge to sell you—and I'm not even from New York—because you must not be paying attention.You have to see that the legislation that folks like Senator Graham and Senator Rubio are almost gleefully pushing forward makes a lie of those previous statements.This proposal makes obvious that Republicans never really wanted to leave women's rights to the states like they have long told the American people.And while Democrats spent this summer helping working families keep more of their hard-earned money, Republicans spent theirs trying to strip away millions of Americans’ rights and effectively making 50% of America second-class citizens who do not have the right to decide what happens to their own bodies.And frankly, I refuse to let my daughters grew up in a world with fewer rights than I had.And it's not just me, I spent the summer talking to folks all across Illinois.And let me just remind you, Illinois is six blue counties and 96 red ones.And all across Illinois, time and again, I talked to mothers, and I said, “Let me explain to you what this abortion ban does.”And let me tell you what Illinois is facing with people coming from as far away as Texas in order to come to Illinois to get the healthcare that they deserve—that they need.Let me tell you what it means for your daughters who choose to go to school in one of these southern states: they're not going to have access to their own reproductive healthcare decision-making.And so, it is those women as well who have said, “You know what, I've never voted on abortion before. It's been something that I support, and something I'm concerned about, but I'm voting on abortion this time.”And these are women on both sides of the aisle. In fact, it is often those independent women who have been very supportive of the right to choice, but have never voted on it. Let me tell you, like in Kansas, they’re voting on it now.I refuse to let my constituents walk into their OB appointments and have to be haunted by the voice of Marco Rubio telling them what they can and cannot do with their bodies.I refuse to force any woman to have to live her life fearful that Lindsey Graham effectively has more control over her medical decisions than she or her doctors.So, I'm going to promise you all here today, and I will say it until I no longer have a voice. I'm going to keep doing everything I can in my power to prevent this nationwide ban on basic healthcare—a ban that explicitly goes against what the vast majority of Americans want—from happening.Our country deserves better than that.And you know, my girls need to grow up in a country where their decision making is just as valued and just as trusted as everyone else. And these abortion bans tell them that they are second class citizens and I refuse to let that happen.Thank you.-30-"
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-durbin-announce-3-million-for-illinois-state-board-of-education," [WASHINGTON, D.C.]— U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) today announced $3,000,000 in Competitive Grants for State Assessments for the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE). This funding will allow ISBE to create innovative assessments for Spanish language arts students in grades 9 and 10, as well as significantly expand educator professional learning and parent/student engagement activities.“This infusion of federal support for Spanish-speaking students will contribute to more inclusivity in our state’s education system,” said Duckworth. “With these resources, the Illinois State Board of Education will be better equipped to meet the needs of so many high schoolers and their families, while helping more of Illinois’s young people succeed in school and beyond.”“Today’s students are tomorrow’s future – it is critical that our assessments are equitable and allow students to show their knowledge,"" said Durbin. “This investment will allow educators to meet the needs of more students and engage families, and I look forward to seeing the positive outcome from these inclusive assessments.”English-learner (EL) students are the country’s fastest growing students demographic, but the least likely to graduate. ISBE’s implementation of these high-quality assessments will provide valuable information for educators, students, and to help close the gaps in student opportunities and improve outcomes for EL students. Along with developing the new assessments for students in grades 9 and 10, ISBE will engage up to 150 educators across the state in intensive, year-long learning activities to help them better understand the new assessments and strategies to improve the success of Spanish-dominant high school students.-30-"
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-republicans-already-trying-to-ban-abortion-nationwide," [WASHINGTON, DC] – U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) today issued the following statement after U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) introduced legislation to establish a nationwide abortion ban:“If you still don’t believe Republicans want to ban all abortions nationwide, you’re not paying attention. After a decades-long campaign to overturn Roe v. Wade, this proposal lays bare, in black and white, that Republicans never really wanted to ‘leave women’s rights to the states’ like they have long told the American people.“While Democrats are successfully bringing down inflation, reducing our deficit and helping working families keep more money in their pockets, Republicans are focused on stripping away millions of Americans’ rights, banning abortions nationwide and blocking additional commonsense gun safety reforms that would help keep Americans safe.“I refuse to let my daughters grow up in a world with fewer rights than I had. I will continue to do everything in my power to prevent this nationwide ban on basic healthcare that explicitly goes against what the vast majority of Americans want.”Duckworth has made protecting and expanding access to essential reproductive healthcare a top priority. Last week, she joined U.S. Senators Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Patty Murray (D-WA) to condemn Republican attacks on the Biden Administration’s landmark decision to allow the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to provide abortion care to Veterans and their eligible dependents to protect the health and life of the woman and in cases of rape or incest. In August, she helped introduced the Reproductive Healthcare Accessibility Act to help ensure women with disabilities—who face discrimination and extra barriers when seeking care—can access reproductive services and get the informed care they need to have control over their own reproductive lives. In July, she helped introduced the Right to Contraception Act, legislation that would codify the fundamental and constitutional right to contraception, just days after writing to President Biden and Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra, urging them to immediately declare national and public health emergencies over Americans’ access to reproductive care.In May, she visited Hope Clinic in Granite City, IL, and met with Director Erin King and staff to share her support for ensuring Americans everywhere can access safe and necessary healthcare. Weeks later, she helped introduce a resolution opposing the criminalization of the full range of reproductive and sexual healthcare, including abortion, gender-affirming care and contraceptive care. The resolution also disapproves of the criminalization of pregnancy outcomes. Also in May, she voted for the Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA), legislation that would help protect women’s constitutional right to choose, which was ultimately blocked by Senate Republicans. In a speech on the Senate floor she shared her support of Americans’ reproductive rights and urged her colleagues to pass the WHPA. Additionally, Duckworth is the lead sponsor of the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Healthcare (EACH) Act, which would end the Hyde Amendment and lift unjust abortion coverage restrictions for those who depend on Medicaid and other government-sponsored plans.-30-"

This support, which comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), will help contribute to increased rail speed and flexibility to reduce delays, more capacity and faster, more reliable travel times—all while creating jobs, making our rails safer and easing supply chain delays that can cause prices to skyrocket for everyday essentials.“For nearly two decades, CREATE projects have improved the way passengers and goods move over rail, making Chicago’s railroad network safer, more efficient and better able to accommodate increased freight and passenger traffic,” Duckworth said. “While improving our infrastructure is vital, this project will do so much more—it will help reduce costs of goods, give time back to travelers due to more efficient and quicker trains and reduce traffic congestion, as well as create more good-paying, local jobs.”“This project – funded through the federal INFRA grant program – is great news for communities throughout the region,” said Durbin. “Rehabilitating and updating this critical railroad track will improve safety, reduce rail and vehicle congestion, and create good paying jobs, and I’ll continue supporting this federal funding program.”CREATE’s Ogden Junction project, which spans from the Western Avenue Rail corridor from Kedzie to 16th street, is expected to receive $70,000,000 to rehabilitate, replace, remove and upgrade nearly two miles of railroad track, signaling and viaduct structures, as well as build 10,000 feet of new track. As a result of the project’s completion, thousands of hours of Metra delays are expected to avoided, freight train conductors will expect fewer conflicts and faster speeds due to more visible and electronic signals and several local jobs will be supported and created.-30-"

https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-hirono-colleagues-applaud-landmark-abortion-access-measure-for-veterans-amid-republican-attacks," [WASHINGTON, DC] – Today, U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Patty Murray (D-WA) condemned Republican attacks on the Biden Administration’s landmark decision last week to allow the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to provide abortion care to Veterans and their eligible dependents to protect the health and life of the woman and in cases of rape or incest. The action comes after, Duckworth joined Hirono and more of their Democratic colleagues in urging the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to immediately begin providing abortion services for Veterans and eligible dependents following the far-right Supreme Court’s disastrous Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade.“I applaud Secretary McDonough’s leadership to help make sure that our Veterans have full access to the healthcare they need—including abortions. This decision could both save lives and enhance military recruitment and readiness,” said Duckworth. “Our Veterans—who often have higher rates of chronic health conditions—have sacrificed the unimaginable for our nation and the last thing they should worry about is that our country will abandon them, risk their health and deny their fundamental rights. Just as we owe our Veterans the right to pursue having a family however they choose, we owe the heroes who risked everything overseas access to medically necessary care back at home—and for some Veterans, that includes abortions—and I’ll keep working to make sure this right is protected for all Americans.”“Following the Supreme Court’s disastrous ruling overturning the right to an abortion, nearly half of female veterans in this country live in states that are certain or likely to ban abortion, which is why we led our colleagues in calling on the VA to provide abortion services to the veterans it serves. We’re glad to see the VA quickly heeding our calls to begin offering abortion services in instances of rape, incest, and the life of a mother. This decision is an important step—one that will save lives,” said Hirono. “But instead of applauding the VA, Republicans are falsely claiming that this ruling is ‘contrary to long-standing, settled law.’ They are using fear and confusion to sow chaos and deprive women of their fundamental rights, instead of standing up for the veterans who have served our country. It’s shameful—and we’ll keep fighting back every day.”Because of the Dobbs decision, over 800,000—or half of women Veterans in this country—live in states that are certain or likely to ban abortions. Prior to last week’s announcement, VA was prohibited from providing any abortion care or abortion counseling. Despite the landmark step forward to protect women’s health, Republicans have stated they will seek to block the VA’s efforts to provide abortion care in medical emergencies or case of rape or incest. Republicans in Congress have made clear they are “working to put a stop to” the policy announced by the Biden Administration and Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall has even vowed to enforce his state’s abortion ban against VA doctors providing care in accordance with the new rule.The lawmakers were joined by Allison Jaslow, an Iraq War Veteran and co-founder of Operation Liberty, a Veteran-led, non-partisan effort to protect the reproductive freedom of U.S. servicemembers and Veterans after the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe.-30-"

https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/senate-unanimously-passes-duckworth-peters-bipartisan-bill-to-reduce-the-spread-of-toxic-forever-chemicals-at-commercial-airports," [WASHINGTON, DC] – U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Gary Peters (MI) announced that bipartisan legislation to reduce the spread of toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination at commercial airports passed the U.S. Senate unanimously this week. The Preventing PFAS Runoff at Airports Act would deploy more existing Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) funding for commercial airports to purchase devices necessary to test their firefighting equipment without discharging toxic PFAS chemicals. This legislation would encourage commercial airports to purchase the relatively low-cost devices—also referred to as an input-based testing system—to help limit and prevent exposure to PFAS, which are known as “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down. It would also direct the FAA to identify options for reimbursing airports elsewhere that already acquired the devices without federal funding. “We’ve known for decades that some PFAS chemicals pose a dangerous risk to public health,” said Duckworth. “Despite this knowledge, we’ve continued to use these harmful foams to put out fires—especially at airports—and continued to allowed them to seep into our ground, our water and ultimately to our neighbors and loved ones. We need to do more to reduce the spread of toxic PFAS contamination using common-sense solutions that are already available, which is why I’m proud this important bill passed the Senate and hope it can quickly become law.”“There are commonsense, fiscally responsible steps we can take to further mitigate PFAS contamination,” said Peters. “I’m pleased my bipartisan Preventing PFAS Runoff at Airports Act passed the Senate, because it would incentivize commercial airports nationwide to use existing federal funds to buy testing equipment that prevents the spread of PFAS contamination into the surrounding environment. The bill would also make this equipment more affordable, while protecting our airports, first responders, families, and the Great Lakes – and I’ll push to get it signed into law.”Along with Duckworth and Peters, U.S. Senators Jerry Moran (R-KS), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) also helped introduce this legislation. “Commercial airports should have the necessary equipment to test their firefighting equipment in a manner that does not expose firefighters or the surrounding communities to toxic PFAS foams,” said Moran. “Passing this legislation in the Senate is the first step to promote the health and wellness of firefighters and aviation employees at commercial airports, as well as protect the communities that surround them.”“The FAA requires regular testing of firefighting equipment, which may put undue burdens on regional, commercial airports, and lead to the discharge of harmful chemicals like PFAS,” said Capito. “Specifically, the Preventing PFAS Runoff at Airports Act would benefit several airports in West Virginia – like Yeager, Greenbrier, and Mid-Ohio Valley – and improve overall safety of their operations. I’m pleased my colleagues joined our effort to advance this legislation in the Senate, recognizing the importance of testing airport rescue and firefighting equipment without dispersing dangerous PFAS chemicals into the environment.”“As we work to ensure the safety of all travelers and airport workers, reducing the spread of toxic substances must be a priority,” said Klobuchar. “This bill will make a real difference by aiding airports in obtaining the equipment needed to help prevent toxic substance contamination. Now that it has passed the Senate, I look forward to it being signed into law.”“PFAS contaminations around airports is a serious problem with a very easy solution. With simple testing solutions that are already funded under the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Airport Improvement Program, we can protect the environment without creating more burdensome regulations on small airports around Wyoming,” said Lummis. “I am thrilled this important legislation passed the Senate, and I hope the House will pass it quickly. Thank you Senator Peters for your work on this legislation.”Duckworth’s bipartisan Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act DWWIA) was signed into law as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and it will enable communities to repair and modernize failing wastewater systems, better protect families from forever chemicals like PFAS and deliver environmental justice to communities in every corner of the state that have been ignored for too long—all while creating good-paying, local jobs. Along with DWWIA’s significant increases to State Revolving Funds used to build and update water and wastewater infrastructure, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal also includes $15 billion to replace lead service lines and $10 billion for the treatment of PFAS nationwide."

Photos from the visit are available here.“Every time I hear from an Illinoisan who is facing the unbearable decision of either paying for their lifesaving prescription drugs or paying for rent, the same frustrating question comes to mind: How are we still allowing Big Pharma to have such a stranglehold on our country?” said Duckworth. “So it’s important seniors and Black and Brown Chicagoans know that Senate Democrats—without a single Republican vote—passed historic changes that will lower prescription drug costs for millions across the country. I’m particularly proud that we’re taking on Big Pharma by empowering Medicare to negotiate directly for the price of prescription drugs—lowering and capping costs for seniors across our state and helping make sure that those who need lifesaving drugs are able to afford them.”The Senator was also joined by University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs Dr. Robert Barish, Illinois Pharmacists Association (IPhA) Executive Director Garth Reynolds, IPhA Region 2 Director Emily Wetherholt, Illinois Primary Health Care State Director of State Policy Amber Kirchhoff, UI Health Mile Square Director of Behavioral Health & Research Dr. Nicole Gastala, Ambulatory Care Pharmacies Senior Associate Director and UIC College of Pharmacy Clinical Asst. Professor Sandra Durley, UIC College of Pharmacy Student Representative Megan Murtagh, Howard Brown President and CEO David Ernesto Munar and AARP Illinois State Director Philippe Largent during the roundtable.Signed into law only three weeks ago by President Biden, the Inflation Reduction Act will cap out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $35/month for Medicare beneficiaries, which applies to some of the more than one million Illinoisans that have diabetes. The IRA also requires drug companies to offer a rebate when the companies increase the price of their medications higher than the rate of inflation. In Illinois, 59,000 Medicare seniors pay more than $2,000/year on prescription drugs and the IRA would cap all Medicare seniors’ annual prescription drug prices at $2,000 per year (approximately $170 per month). The IRA will also ensure that Medicare seniors have access to free—and potentially life-saving—vaccines.-30-"

https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-leads-colleagues-in-calling-for-a-federal-review-on-how-ai-impacts-employment-opportunities-for-americans-with-disabilities," [WASHINGTON, DC] – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) wrote to U.S. Chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Lina Khan, U.S. Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Charlotte Burrows and U.S. Secretary of the Department of Labor (DoL) Martin Walsh to call for a thorough review of how artificial intelligence (AI), algorithms and algorithmic bias might play a role in discriminating against people with disabilities when it comes to employment opportunities and hiring practices. Joining Duckworth on this letter are U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Ed Markey (D-MA).“We write to respectfully request that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor (DoL) undergo a thorough review of artificial intelligence (AI), algorithms and algorithmic bias, including but not limited to hiring and worker productivity practices conducted by both employers and employment agencies that involve AI, as well as how such practices may discriminate against people with disabilities,” the Senators wrote in the letter.The Senators concluded: “We urge you to ensure disability is a fundamental component of any algorithmic bias review conducted, and that the FTC, EEOC and DoL, including the Office of Disability Employment Policy, work closely together, and with us, to advance and enforce policies that advance the employment and economic well-being of Americans with disabilities.”A full copy of the letter is available here and below:Dear Chair Khan, Chair Burrows and Secretary Walsh:We write to respectfully request that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor (DoL) undergo a thorough review of artificial intelligence (AI), algorithms and algorithmic bias, including but not limited to hiring and worker productivity practices conducted by both employers and employment agencies that involve AI, as well as how such practices may discriminate against people with disabilities. It is essential that the administration establish a full public record on these issues and is prepared to reach full employment and equity for Americans with disabilities, as required under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, people with disabilities are much less likely to be employed and more likely to be underemployed than people without disabilities. In 2021, 19.1 percent of people with disabilities were employed, compared to 63.7 percent of people without a disability. Algorithmic bias, which often plays a role in exacerbating these disparities, results from unrepresentative or incomplete training data sets, flawed or inaccurate information or data that reflects historical inequities and existing prejudices, as well as dependence on algorithms that may not adequately measure a candidate’s fit with a job. If left unaddressed, this bias often leads to decisions that collectively and disparately affect certain populations. Both the intended and unintended consequences of algorithms and algorithmic bias are important to identify and resolve.The data on the risks that algorithms, particularly those that rely on AI, pose to replicating and even amplifying human biases are well-cited, and the evidence continues to grow. However, to date, much of the work examining bias in AI hiring systems has focused on race and gender, finding that AI bias generally harms women, people of color, gender minorities and those at the intersections of these identities. Disability has been largely omitted from the AI bias conversation, even though disabled people are affected by these issues in differing ways across axes of identity. According to the Center for Democracy and Technology, “AI-powered hiring tools often fail to include people with disabilities when generating their training data” – as a result, algorithms which are modeled based on a company’s previous hires do not reflect their potential.EEOC Chair Burrows has stated, “As many as 83% of employers, and as many as 90% among Fortune 500 companies, are using some form of automated tools to screen or rank candidates for hiring.” Even if algorithms account for disabilities, they do not account for the diversity of experiences that individuals with disabilities bring to the table. We must address these harmful AI-based assessments due to algorithmic bias against disability rooted in institutional and systemic ableism and assumptions about employability.We applaud EEOC Chair Burrows for the agency-wide initiative that the EEOC launched in 2021 designed to ensure that the use of AI in hiring decisions complies with the civil rights laws that the EEOC enforces and also for the recent joint release of a Q&A document from EEOC and the Department of Justice on the impact of AI and the ADA. The guidance is an important step, and we urge the administration to take immediate steps to make sure this guidance is followed.Your leadership and expertise at the intersection of technological advancement and civil rights is crucial to ensuring that the harmful effects of algorithmic bias are mitigated through regulation, oversight and review. We are glad that the FTC, EEOC and DoL are taking steps to increase transparency and create accountability with regards to algorithmic-based decision-making, particularly when people’s rights are at risk. To better understand the administration’s framework and plan for addressing these important issues, we respectfully request a briefing from FTC, EEOC and DoL to receive an update on your work and to discuss your answers to the following questions:We also respectfully request an answer from Chair Khan to the following question:We urge you to ensure disability is a fundamental component of any algorithmic bias review conducted, and that the FTC, EEOC and DoL, including the Office of Disability Employment Policy, work closely together, and with us, to advance and enforce policies that advance the employment and economic well-being of Americans with disabilities.

https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-connolly-send-letter-urging-opm-to-cover-infertility-diagnosis-and-treatment," [WASHINGTON, DC] – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and U.S. Representative Gerry Connolly (D-VA-11), Chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Government Operations Subcommittee, sent a letter to Director Kiran Ahuja in support of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) stated interest in expanding federal medical coverage to include infertility diagnosis and treatment, which includes accessing assistive reproductive technology (ART), such as in vitro fertilization (IVF).“The choice to build a family is a fundamental right for all Americans. People should not have to take on substantial medical debt to grow a family. Yet, despite the prevalence of infertility and diversity of family structures, the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) program – our Nation’s largest employer-sponsored group health insurance program – currently only offers limited infertility treatment, and it is often prohibitively expensive,” the members wrote.  “We strongly support the coverage of ART services in federal health care benefits and urge OPM to build on its efforts to ensure Federal employees can afford fertility treatments by requiring every FEHB program carrier to provide ART treatment coverage going forward,” the members added.Along with Duckworth and Connolly, the letter was co-signed by U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) as well as U.S. Representatives Nydia Velázquez (D-NY-07), Susan Wild (D-PA-07), Donald Payne (D-NJ-10), Troy Carter (D-LA-02), Karen Bass (D-CA-37), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Mike Doyle (D-PA-18), Stephen Lynch (D-MA-08), David Trone (D-MD-06), Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO-05), Jamie Raskin (D-MD-8), Derek Kilmer (D-WA-06), Jennifer Wexton (D-VA-10), Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA-06), Colin Allred (D-TX-32), John Larson (D-CT-01), Judy Chu (D-CA-27) and David Cicilline (D-RI-01).A full copy of the letter is available here and below:Dear Director Ahuja:We write to express our support for the U.S. Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) stated interest in expanding Federal medical coverage to include infertility diagnosis and treatment, which includes accessing assistive reproductive technology (ART), such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). It is in our national interest for the Federal Government to recruit and retain the most effective Federal workforce, and to do so, we must ensure federal health benefits cover the needs of working families. Providing medical coverage for ART services is critical to ensure Federal agencies can compete with the private sector for top talent and promote optimal health outcomes among their employees.A survey commissioned by RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association found that one in every eight couples face challenges while conceiving, and that does not even include the many LGBTQ+ couples who may wish to utilize ART to start and grow families. The survey findings indicate that employees without infertility treatment coverage often express dissatisfaction with such employer-sponsored coverage. Moreover, in certain cases, this deficient health insurance coverage is a causal factor in individuals seeking new employment from organizations that do provide family-friendly coverage of infertility services, such as comprehensive access to ART.The choice to build a family is a fundamental right for all Americans. People should not have to take on substantial medical debt to grow a family. Yet, despite the prevalence of infertility and diversity of family structures, the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) program – our Nation’s largest employer-sponsored group health insurance program – currently only offers limited infertility treatment, and it is often prohibitively expensive. We agree with your program call letter that, “more could be done to assist with the financial burden of ART treatment for those who may require it.” If negotiations for the 2023 cycle have completed, we urge you to ensure coverage of ART remains an FEHB benefit going forward.The benefits of modernizing insurance coverage for employees seeking fertility treatment are not limited to retention. Evidence also indicates that coverage for such medical services also alleviates certain health conditions associated with fertility challenges, including depression, stress, and anxiety. In addition, employees may feel more valued by their employers, recommend the company to others based on such satisfaction, and boost productivity. Currently, 20 states require that state-regulated commercial plans cover infertility treatments. These productivity benefits help explain why many states and the private sector are leading in expanding availability of coverage for medical services addressing infertility.Federal employees provide essential, often underappreciated, work that is necessary to keep our government functioning, and they should be provided access to affordable family planning services. OPM’s proposed modernization of the FEHB Program to urge insurance plans cover comprehensive ART services will ensure that our best civil servants will stay in public service and create and build their families. It will also empower the United States Government to lead by example and demonstrate the importance and benefits of family-friendly workplaces.Providing all Federal Government employees with access to ART treatment, irrespective of an infertility diagnosis, would make family building more affordable and ensure the Federal Government remains a competitive employer. We strongly support the coverage of ART services in federal health care benefits and urge OPM to build on its efforts to ensure Federal employees can afford fertility treatments by requiring every FEHB program carrier to provide ART treatment coverage going forward.Sincerely,-30-"

Duckworth also shared her commitment to help drive down gas prices, support our farmers, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, strengthen our energy security and drive rural economic opportunity in Illinois. Duckworth and Secretary Vilsack then spoke to members of the media about their efforts to increase availability of American-grown biofuels, create rural jobs and decrease gas prices at a second stop in Le Roy. Photos from the visit are available here.“I was glad to be at One Earth Energy with Secretary Vilsack today to discuss the importance of the farmer to fuel pump pipeline— and how the Inflation Reduction Act will help increase production of homegrown biofuels and lower gas prices,” said Duckworth. “At a time when Big Oil has been profiting off the backs of hardworking Americans and our nation is facing a climate crisis, the U.S. biofuel sector is as vital as they’ve ever been. From working on the Inflation Reduction Act which includes historic support for renewable energy to working to secure the integrity of the Renewable Fuel Standard, I’m proud of my work to support the biofuels sector because it supports our farmers and our working families”“I’m glad to have had the opportunity to join Senator Duckworth and stakeholders at One Earth Energy this morning to highlight the role America’s producers play in securing America’s energy independence, as well as the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and giving Americans cleaner, more affordable options at the pump,” said Secretary Vilsack. “This commitment is demonstrated in the transformational Inflation Reduction Act, which, among other critical investments, includes additional funding to expand the availability of higher-blend fuels across the country. This is a win for American farmers, the rural economy and hardworking Americans who pay the price here at home when we depend on volatile fuel sources overseas.”Signed into law one week ago by President Biden, the Inflation Reduction Act will provide $500 million to expand the number of service stations that offer low-carbon ethanol and biodiesel, made from Illinois corn and soybeans. These climate-smart investments in Midwestern-grown fuels will also reduce our reliance on Middle Eastern oil, which strengthens our national security and helps reduce costs at the pump for consumers. In June, Duckworth applauded the Biden Administration’s announcement that it will publish the ethanol blending mandates for 2020, 2021 and 2022 at levels that more closely resemble American consumption levels and help farmers and biofuel producers prepare for the future.While Big Oil has been taking advantage of hardworking families, Duckworth has been diligent in working to save Americans money at the pump while continuing to be a long-time supporter of ethanol. Last month, she helped introduce the bipartisan and bicameral Next Generation Fuels Act to leverage higher-octane fuels to help improve engine efficiency and performance. Allowing the sale of fuels with greater octane levels would increase the amount of ethanol that can be utilized in the fuel supply, in turn lowering prices at the pump for consumers. In March, Duckworth also helped introduce the Home Front Energy Independence Act, which would make E15 available year round, establish an E15 and Biodiesel Tax Credit, direct EPA to finalize their E15 labeling rule and provide for biofuel infrastructure and compatibility with retailers. In a recent Senate hearing, EPA Administrator Michael Regan confirmed that this legislation would help bring down gas prices at the pump for working families. Also in March, Duckworth introduced her Gas Price Gouging Prevention Act to help prevent the oil industry from engaging in gasoline price gouging during periods of crisis, in an effort to protect working Americans from unnecessary price increases. -30-"

Duckworth also spoke to the officials about her bipartisan Public Safety Officer Support Act that President Biden signed into law last week. Photos of today’s roundtable are available here.“It takes a special person to get up every day determined to keep our streets safe and protect our little ones from danger,” said Duckworth. “With the spikes in violent crime we’ve seen in communities from Highland Park to Uvalde—not just in places like Chicago as some people want you to think—this is everyone’s problem because it happens everywhere. We need to better support our officers and communities, which is why I believe the solution starts with more funding and more resources, not fewer—and making sure those resources are better used. I’m proud that my PSOSA bill to support our law enforcement officers as well as their families is now law and proud of my work to keep communities across our state safe, and I’ll keep working to do just that.”Joining Duckworth at today’s roundtable were Illinois State Senator Kris Tharp (SD-56), Illinois State Police Deputy Director for Criminal Investigations Lt.

Also joining Duckworth, Fox and Shore were: Chris Belt, 57th District State Senator; Latoya Greenwood, 114th District State Representative; Jay Hoffman, 113th District State Representative; Mark Kern, St. Clair County Board Chairman; Curtis McCall Sr., Mayor of Cahokia Heights; Joe Ahlvin, Senior Operations Manager; of IL American Water and members of the community. Photos of today’s tour and roundtable are available here.“For too long, communities like Cahokia Heights have unfairly borne the brunt of environmental injustice, which is why I’m committed to making sure they have the resources to fix their faulty, dangerous and aging water infrastructure that’s been neglected for decades,” said Duckworth. “I’m proud to have written the water and wastewater provisions of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that are already helping communities around the country like Cahokia Heights and provisions in the Water Resources Development Act of 2022 to expand the Corps’ authority to work with this community and others like it. I’ll keep working with the leaders at EPA, IEPA and all relevant agencies to ensure that we make necessary improvements so every resident has access to safe, reliable water and can live without worrying that their neighborhoods will overflow with dangerous raw sewage whenever there is a heavy rain.”“No family should have to worry about raw sewage entering their home. Historically underserved communities have born a burden of inadequate or poorly functioning wastewater infrastructure for too long,” said EPA Assistant Administrator for Water Radhika Fox. “It’s important for local, state and federal government to come together to assist communities with accessing solutions to these kinds of water challenges. President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law presents an historic opportunity to assist communities like Cahokia Heights with water infrastructure needs.” Senator Duckworth, along with U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), secured more than $7 million in the Senate’s draft Fiscal Year 2023 Appropriations bills which, if it becomes law, would support three separate projects aimed at helping the residents of Cahokia Heights address their community’s issues. These projects include $3.5 million through the Army Corps of Engineers for a new sewer, $2 million for the City of Cahokia Heights to rehabilitate the current sewer system and $1.7 million for Centreville Citizens for Change to address the contaminated indoor air and drinking water in many residential homes caused by frequent flooding.“The Biden-Harris Administration has made communities that have been historically marginalized and overburdened by pollution a top priority,” said EPA Region 5 Administrator Debra Shore. “No single agency will be able to solve these problems. To do right by the residents of Cahokia Heights, we must harness all of the resources available and work together - and that’s exactly what we are doing.”“We are encouraged by the continued cooperation from local, state, and federal partners working to address the chronic issues that have plagued the area of Cahokia Heights for far too long,” said Illinois EPA Director John J. Kim. “Although there is no quick fix to the years of failed infrastructure this area has experienced, Illinois EPA will continue to address these conditions through our ongoing efforts to provide assistance, which include financial assistance, inspections, technical support, and working closely with residents and local officials to ensure their concerns are heard as all partners work towards a remedy. The projects to be implemented over the next several years through financial and technical support from the Illinois EPA will bring real relief to this community and benefit all residents.”Duckworth, Chair of the EPW Subcommittee on Fisheries, Water & Wildlife, secured her entire bipartisan Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act (DWWIA) in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in order to ensure Illinois’s and the nation’s crumbling water infrastructure will finally receive the significant improvements they need. As Subcommittee Chair, Duckworth has also worked to secure increased authorizations for several counties, including St. Clair, for more water infrastructure projects in Illinois under the Amry Corps of Engineers and programs to increase the Army Corps’ projects in environmental justice communities in the Senate passed Water Resources Development Act of 2022 (WRDA).As chair and co-founder of the U.S. Senate Environmental Justice Caucus, Duckworth has been a strong advocate for bringing environmental justice to Cahokia Heights, calling on EPA to conduct enhanced monitoring and enforcement of the area and working to provide federal funding to repair the failing water system. Duckworth has frequently met with residents to discuss the persistent inland flooding and environmental justice issues the community faces.-30-"

Photos from the visit are available here.“Every time I hear from an Illinoisan who is facing the unbearable decision of either paying for their lifesaving prescription drugs or paying for rent, the same frustrating question comes to mind: How are we still allowing Big Pharma to have such a stranglehold on our country?” said Duckworth. “So it’s important working families in Central Illinois know that Senate Democrats—without a single Republican vote—passed historic changes that will lower prescription drug costs for millions across the country. I’m particularly proud that we’re taking on Big Pharma by empowering Medicare to negotiate directly for the price of prescription drugs—lowering and capping costs for seniors across our state and helping make sure that those who need lifesaving drugs are able to afford them.”Signed into law on Tuesday by President Biden, the Inflation Reduction Act will cap out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $35/month for Medicare beneficiaries, which applies to some of the more than one million Illinoisans that have diabetes. The IRA also requires drug companies to offer a rebate when the companies increase the price of their medications higher than the rate of inflation. In Illinois, 59,000 Medicare seniors pay more than $2,000/year on prescription drugs and the IRA would cap all Medicare seniors’ annual prescription drug prices at $2,000 per year (approximately $170 per month).

During the visit, Duckworth also emphasized Marquis Energy’s new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) facility and other decarbonization projects. Photos from the visit are available here.“I was glad to be at Marquis Energy with Deputy Secretary Turk today and see firsthand the work Marquis is doing to expand Sustainable Aviation Fuel production while keeping carbon emissions low—these are the kind of projects that the Inflation Reduction Act will help kickstart,” said Duckworth. “At a time when Big Oil has been profiting off the backs of hardworking Americans and our nation is facing a climate crisis, the Renewable Fuels Standard and the U.S. biofuel sector are as vital as they’ve ever been. From working on the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes historic support for renewable energy and will help bring down costs for working families, to reminding folks that supporting biofuels means supporting our farmers, I’ll keep working to make sure this sector gets the necessary support from Washington.”“I grew up about an hour from Hennepin, so it was terrific to come back home and see such innovation and progress,” said Turk. “Thank you to Senator Duckworth for the invitation and all of the good she does including with the Inflation Reduction Act. Not only are we decarbonizing and leading the world in decarbonizing, we’re also increasing employment and helping communities see bright futures for decades and generations.”Signed into law on Tuesday by President Biden, the Inflation Reduction Act will provide $500 million to expand the number of service stations that offer low-carbon ethanol and biodiesel, made from Illinois corn and soybeans and also has incentives to make these low-carbon biofuels even lower-carbon than today. These climate-smart investments in Midwestern-grown fuels will also reduce our reliance on Middle Eastern oil.

I’ll continue to call for federal support for the Station, and I look forward to its continued presence as a key transportation and commercial hub.”“Chicago Union Station has been a central transportation hub in the Midwest since its original construction in 1925. But the station must meet the needs of Metra and Amtrak passengers in the 21st century,” said Durbin. “With this federal funding, we can take the next step in Chicago Union Station’s revitalization. As the nation’s fourth busiest Amtrak station, Chicago Union Station is worthy of this federal support and Illinoisans and travelers will benefit from this investment for years to come.”""Public transportation is quite literally what keeps our city moving,” said Lightfoot.

The Public Safety Officer Support Act passed the Senate earlier this month and the House companion passed the U.S. House of Representatives in May. “With this important legislation now the law of the land, we’re finally taking meaningful action to honor and support surviving family members of police officers, firefighters and emergency responders that tragically died by suicide after experiencing work-related trauma or exposure to traumatic events while serving their communities,” said Duckworth. “I’m so proud to have worked with Senator Cornyn and advocates to get this done so these families can receive the support their loved ones earned through a life of service—just as surviving family members already are eligible for when a public safety officer dies from heart disease or COVID in the line of duty, or as the United States Military does in designating nearly every servicemember suicide a line of duty death.”“This will ensure public safety officers experiencing PTSD and families coping with the tragic loss of a loved one to suicide can get the support they deserve,” said Cornyn. “I applaud my colleagues for passing this important legislation, and I’m grateful to see it signed into law.” The Public Safety Officers’ Benefits (PSOB) program provides financial support to the families of firefighters, police officers, chaplains and emergency medical technicians who die in the line of duty or who have been permanently disabled as a result of a physical injury. Duckworth and Cornyn’s Public Safety Officer Support Act, which they introduced in February, improves the PSOB program to reflect the reality that law enforcement officers, firefighters and emergency responders face a heightened risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorders that may lead to trauma-induced suicides, and that surviving family members of public safety officers that end their lives also face an elevated risk of self-harm as a result of a loved one’ loss being compounded by severe financial harm and significant emotional distress.The Public Safety Officer Support Act will:The Public Safety Officer Support Act has been endorsed by a wide range of leading law enforcement and mental health agencies and organizations: U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ); National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG); National District Attorneys Association; Fraternal Order of Police (FOP); National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO); Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA); Sergeants Benevolent Association; National Sheriffs Association; Major County Sheriffs of America; National Border Patrol Council; United States Capitol Police Labor Committee; Blue H.E.L.P.; The Wounded Blue; National Narcotics Officers Associations’ Coalition; National Prison Council; International Association of Police Chiefs (IACP); AFSCME; International Union of Police Associations; American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP); American Psychological Association (APA); National Association for Children’s Behavioral Health; International Society for Psychiatric Nurses; Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute; Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, SMART Recovery; Kennedy Forum; Inseparable; National Council for Mental Wellbeing; National Association for Rural Mental Health; American Mental Health Counselors Association; National Association of Social Workers; Postpartum Support International; National Association of State and Mental Health Program Directors; American Association for Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work; Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies.-30-"

With Roe now overturned and Illinois continuing to serve as a beacon for thousands of Americans traveling for abortions, Duckworth and the group also spoke about the now-intensified need to protect the privacy, emotional wellbeing and physical safety of Chicago’s expected influx of patients. The Senator and the group continued by discussing the clinic’s commitment to equitable healthcare in the predominately working and Black and Brown Austin community. Photos from the meeting are available here.“I was glad to be at the Planned Parenthood in Austin today meeting with providers and staff,” said Duckworth. “Their work making sure people, particularly Black and Brown women, have access to reproductive and prenatal care has been critically important for years—but with the Supreme Court overturning Roe and states like Wisconsin and Missouri making abortions inaccessible, the importance of this clinic, and its work, will only continue to grow. I’m proud that Illinois has some of the strongest protections for reproductive health in the country and places like this clinic are here to help people from all across the Midwest, but that’s not enough. I won’t stop working to enshrine Roe v. Wade into law and ensure reproductive freedoms are protected for all—regardless of skin color, zip code or income.”“It is an honor to host Senator Duckworth at the Planned Parenthood of Illinois (PPIL) health center in the Austin neighborhood,” said Planned Parenthood of Illinois President and CEO Jennifer Welch. “We offered a firsthand look at how we provide individuals with vital and local care during this reproductive healthcare crisis. Since Roe v. Wade was overturned in June, PPIL has served a historic increase in out-of-state patients who are forced to travel from farther distances and from more states than ever before. It's crucial we continue to meet this demand while still providing essential reproductive health care like family planning, cancer screenings and STI services. We thank Senator Duckworth for her work to keep Illinois a safe haven for health care in the Midwest, and we look forward to further expanding Illinois’ ability to serve our patients no matter where they live or are forced to travel from.”Duckworth has made protecting and expanding access to essential reproductive healthcare a top priority. Last week, she introduced the Reproductive Healthcare Accessibility Act to help ensure women with disabilities—who face discrimination and extra barriers when seeking care—can access reproductive services and get the informed care they need to have control over their own reproductive lives. In July, she introduced the Right to Contraception Act, legislation that would codify the fundamental and constitutional right to contraception, just days after writing to President Biden and Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra, urging them to immediately declare national and public health emergencies over Americans’ access to reproductive care.In May, she visited Hope Clinic in Granite City, IL and met with Director Erin King and staff to share her support for ensuring Americans everywhere can access safe and necessary healthcare. Weeks later, she helped introduce a resolution opposing the criminalization of the full range of reproductive and sexual healthcare, including abortion, gender-affirming care and contraceptive care. The resolution also disapproves of the criminalization of pregnancy outcomes. Also in May, she voted for the Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA), legislation that would help protect women’s constitutional right to choose, which was ultimately blocked by Senate Republicans. In a speech on the Senate floor she shared her support of Americans’ reproductive rights and urged her colleagues to pass the WHPA.

https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-murray-introduce-bill-to-help-women-with-disabilities-access-reproductive-healthcare," [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), introduced the Reproductive Healthcare Accessibility Act to help ensure women with disabilities—who face discrimination and extra barriers when seeking care—can access reproductive services and get the informed care they need to have control over their own reproductive lives.“For too long, Americans with disabilities have faced persistent barriers to healthcare services, equipment and providers—and with right-wing efforts underway to go even further to undermine these rights in the wake of the overturning of Roe—many are rightfully worried about having an even harder time accessing the reproductive care they need,” said Duckworth. “Today, I’m proud to join Senator Murray and colleagues in introducing the Reproductive Healthcare Accessibility Act to help ensure those in the disability community—all 61 million of us—are not left behind in getting the care we need, when we need it.”“Every single American deserves to have control over their own body, life, and future—and that, of course, includes Americans with disabilities. But people with disabilities have long faced discrimination and truly unacceptable roadblocks to getting the reproductive care they need—and Republicans’ nonstop attacks on our rights have made matters so much worse,” said Murray. “Our legislation will help ensure people with disabilities can access reproductive care that meets their needs.”While women with disabilities have long faced discrimination and barriers to having full access to healthcare, the Dobbs decision has made it much more difficult for women with disabilities to get the informed reproductive healthcare they need. Right now, the roughly one in four adults with a disability are less likely to receive contraception counseling and timely prenatal care, are at greater risks for adverse pregnancy outcomes and all too often lack access to accessible healthcare facilities and face a dearth of providers trained on the unique and diverse needs of people with disabilities.The Reproductive Healthcare Accessibility Act would eliminate barriers to sexual and reproductive healthcare for people with disabilities by:The legislation is endorsed by National Disability Rights Network; National Association of Councils on Developmental Disabilities; Dr. Jamila Taylor, Director of Health Care Reform and Senior Fellow at The Century Foundation; Kimberly Knackstedt, Ph.D., Co-Director of the Disability Economic Justice Collaborative and Senior Fellow at The Century Foundation; URGE: Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity; Johns Hopkins School of Nursing; Johns Hopkins Disability Health Research Center; Physicians for Reproductive Health; Catholics for Choice; National Partnership for Women and Families; Power to Decide; Docs With Disabilities Initiative; NARAL Pro-Choice America; National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice; Center for American Progress; Planned Parenthood Federation of America; Advocates for Youth; Center for Reproductive Rights and National Council of Jewish Women.Along with Duckworth and Murray, this legislation is also cosponsored by U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Jack Reed (D-RI), Tina Smith (D-MN), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Mazie K.

Including Sweden and Finland in our NATO alliance would mean stronger military defenses and diplomatic capabilities against Putin and other emerging threats as well as send a clear, resounding message that the free world remains united in support of Ukraine and against Putin’s cruelty. I hope President Biden moves to swiftly ratify the Washington Treaty to ensure Sweden and Finland’s quick accession to NATO, and I look forward to welcoming them into our alliance.”This past May, Duckworth joined her colleagues in sending a letter to President Biden urging him to expedite Sweden and Finland’s applications for NATO membership in the Executive Branch as the group of Senators works to swiftly consider and approve this application in the Senate.Duckworth has been a strong supporter of Ukraine against Russia’s invasion. She joined U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Jack Reed (D-RI), Mark Warner (D-VA), Jon Tester (D-MT) and six of her colleagues in introducing the Digital Asset Sanctions Compliance Enhancement Act to ensure that Vladimir Putin and Russian elites can’t use digital assets to undermine the international community’s economic sanctions against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.Duckworth also urged the Biden Administration to accelerate the sale of M1A2 SEPv3 tanks to Poland. The letter also asked the Biden Administration to engage with additional NATO allies to determine if the Russian Federation’s brutal act of war requires the U.S to develop and execute any additional sales to strengthen the military capabilities of other NATO members.

Today’s action in the Senate comes after Republicans obstructed and blocked passage of the bill last week—despite having voted for the measure less than a month ago—delaying implementation of this legislation that will provide care for Veterans who need it.“After bravely serving our nation, too many Veterans come home to discover years later that their service has left them with respiratory and neurological issues due to burn pits or other toxic exposure, making them more vulnerable to serious illnesses. It’s our duty to make sure Veterans can get the care they need when they return home with serious health conditions. While it’s shameful that Senate Republicans chose political games and blocked this legislation last week, I’m proud the Senate finally passed this important bipartisan legislation and is sending it where it belongs: President Biden’s desk for signature. I look forward to seeing this legislation signed into law to expand healthcare for Veterans and improve resources at the VA for those who served and sacrificed so much for us.”Specifically, the SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act would:Duckworth successfully secured a provision in last year’s NDAA that prohibits the use of burn pits unless explicitly waived by the U.S. Secretary of Defense for extraordinary reasons. In 2020, Duckworth joined her colleagues to help introduce the bipartisan Pandemic Care for Burn Pits Exposure Act would require the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to ask servicemembers and Veterans who have tested positive for a virus designated by the federal government as a pandemic, including COVID-19, if they were previously exposed to burn pits, so they can properly address their medical needs and ensure they receive proper care. -30-"
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/bipartisan-duckworth-cornyn-public-safety-officer-support-act-passes-senate," [WASHINGTON, DC] – Bipartisan legislation authored by U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and John Cornyn (R-TX) that honors the public service of police officers, firefighters and emergency responders by supporting the families of public safety officers who are lost to trauma-linked suicides passed the Senate today and heads to the President’s desk to be signed into law.“Today, the Senate took an important action to recognize that our nation must honor and support surviving family members of police officers, firefighters and emergency responders that tragically died by suicide after experiencing work-related trauma or exposure to traumatic events while serving their communities,” said Duckworth. “Our bipartisan Public Safety Officer Support Act will help ensure surviving family members of public safety officers that died by suicide are eligible to receive support their loved ones earned through a life of service—just as surviving family members already are eligible for when a public safety officer dies from heart disease or COVID in the line of duty, or as the United States Military does in designating nearly every servicemember suicide a line of duty death.”“Law enforcement and first responders shoulder heavy burdens each and every day as they work to keep us safe,” said Cornyn. “I’m grateful to my Senate colleagues for passing this legislation to ensure emergency workers experiencing PTSD and families who lose a loved one to suicide can get the support they deserve.”“State and local law enforcement officers are our nation’s first responders,” said Bill Johnson, Executive Director, National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO). “They respond to our country’s greatest tragedies as well as violent and abhorrent crimes that unfortunately occur with some frequency in our neighborhoods. They have seen and experienced horrors that they cannot forget, yet they still put their lives on the line every day to protect and serve our communities.  NAPO is proud to support the Public Safety Officer Support Act and its passage today brings us one step closer to officially recognizing PTSD as a line of duty injury under the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits Program and ensuring the families of officers who tragically take their own lives due to line of duty trauma receive much-needed assistance. We thank Senators Duckworth and Cornyn for championing this important bill.”“Long-term exposure to mental stress and traumatic events over the course of service can inflict ‘invisible injuries’ on the men and women in law enforcement, injuries that may be left untreated and have a fatal outcome,” said Patrick Yoes, National President of the Fraternal Order of Police. “These disorders can be just as disabling as a physical injury and an officer who suffers from this or a similar disorder that may result in suicide is just as service-connected as any other line-of-duty death.  This bill shows compassion and support for our officers and their families and that it provides another step towards building support for officers facing mental wellness crises.”“The ‘Public Safety Officer Support Act’ recognizes the toll that frequent exposures to on-the-job trauma and traumatic events can have on the brave men and women of law enforcement, and that the cumulative psychological stress and strain of these exposures can all too often be overwhelming,” said President Vincent Vallelong of the NYPD Sergeants Benevolent Association. “We are extremely grateful for the leadership and persistent efforts of Sens. Duckworth and Cornyn on this important legislation and look forward to the President swiftly signing the measure into law.”“Law enforcement face severe stressors in service to the public that are far beyond what the average American experiences,” said Larry Cosme, President, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association. These stressors often lead to mental health issues which, if untreated, can lead to long-term disability and even death. As law enforcement face increasing rates of suicide and stress disorders, the Public Safety Officer Support Act appropriately recognizes the need for our federal health benefits system to support officers struggling with mental health issues. This legislation is needed now more than ever. We applaud Senators Duckworth and Cornyn for championing this legislation through the Senate and demonstrating their commitment to advancing the health and safety of law enforcement.”“AFSP commends Sen. Tammy Duckworth, Sen. John Cornyn, Rep. David Trone, and Rep. Guy Reschenthaler for championing the Public Safety Officer Support Act through Congress,” said Laurel Stine, J.D., M.A., Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. “First responders place their lives on the line every day to protect the public, and while physical injuries sustained in the line of duty are generally recognized, mental trauma is too often not. This legislation corrects this injustice and acknowledges the daily sacrifices of first responders by addressing the stigma of suicide and mental health, and by providing support to officers and the families of officers who die by suicide or who become permanently disabled as a result of trauma encountered while on duty.”The Public Safety Officers’ Benefits (PSOB) program provides financial support to the families of firefighters, police officers, chaplains and emergency medical technicians who die in the line of duty or who have been permanently disabled as a result of a physical injury. Duckworth and Cornyn’s Public Safety Officer Support Act, which they introduced in February, improves the PSOB program to reflect the reality that law enforcement officers, firefighters and emergency responders face a heightened risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorders that may lead to trauma-induced suicides, and that surviving family members of public safety officers that end their lives also face an elevated risk of self-harm as a result of a loved one’ loss being compounded by severe financial harm and significant emotional distress.The Public Safety Officer Support Act would:The Public Safety Officer Support Act has been endorsed by a wide range of leading law enforcement and mental health agencies and organizations: U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ); National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG); National District Attorneys Association; Fraternal Order of Police (FOP); National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO); Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA); Sergeants Benevolent Association; National Sheriffs Association; Major County Sheriffs of America; National Border Patrol Council; United States Capitol Police Labor Committee; Blue H.E.L.P.; The Wounded Blue; National Narcotics Officers Associations’ Coalition; National Prison Council; International Association of Police Chiefs (IACP); AFSCME; International Union of Police Associations; American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP); American Psychological Association (APA); National Association for Children’s Behavioral Health; International Society for Psychiatric Nurses; Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute; Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, SMART Recovery; Kennedy Forum; Inseparable; National Council for Mental Wellbeing; National Association for Rural Mental Health; American Mental Health Counselors Association; National Association of Social Workers; Postpartum Support International; National Association of State and Mental Health Program Directors; American Association for Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work; Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies.In May, Duckworth and Cornyn applauded both the U.S. Senate Committee on Judiciary for passing their bipartisan bill and the House companion passing the U.S. House of Representatives.-30-"

Today, thousands of Soldiers are deployed to the European continent in support of Ukraine and deterring expansion of Russian aggression. These missions validate the importance of prepositioned stocks and the complexity of contested logistics. Operations in Ukraine demonstrate the criticality of competent combined arms operations for a ground force and the power of joint and coalition operations for a nation.”“Soldier-centered practices such as Soldier Touch Point in the prototyping phase and ‘try before you buy’ partnerships with industry improve functionality and Soldier acceptability and make more rapid fielding possible, and I applaud the Army’s progress in this area,” Duckworth continued. “The Army continues to make bold steps in its effort to modernize, but hard decisions lie ahead.

Shame on them.“By failing to advance the Women’s Health Protection Act, Senate Republicans are putting millions of women, especially low-income women and women of color, at risk of losing access to the healthcare they need when they need it.“The situation is particularly dire right now because we’re seeing the potential for a small group far-right Justices to strip away protected constitutional rights that millions of American families, including my own, have relied on for almost 50 years—and that 70% of Americans believe should be legal.“I refuse to let my daughters grow up in a world with fewer rights than I had, and I won’t stop working to codify Roe v. Wade into law and ensure reproductive freedoms are protected for all women—regardless of their skin color, income or zip code.”Duckworth has made protecting and expanding access to essential women’s healthcare a top priority. She spoke out on the Senate floor in support of Americans’ reproductive rights and issued a statement after the leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court showed that a small group of far-right Justices could overturn Roe v.

Wade has impacted her journey to motherhood, as well as highlighted why overturning the precedent could have devastating effects for our nation. Duckworth’s floor speech, which comes after reports that a majority of the Supreme Court support an initial opinion that would effectively overturn Roe v. Wade, is another example of Duckworth’s strong and consistent support of women’s constitutional right to choose. Video of the Senator’s speech is available here.Key quotes:“When Roe was decided in 1973, it changed the lives of so many women. It saved the lives of 14-year-olds who were the victims of rape or incest, who otherwise would have had to turn to back alleys and backrooms. It changed the lives of women who desperately wanted to be moms—but who found out that their pregnancies weren’t viable... that they'd have to go through the pain and suffering and trauma of a full term, only to stillborn at the end of nine months. And, personally, for me, it gave me my chance to be a mom.”“Yet last week, we learned that the Supreme Court could be just weeks away from overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey… a decision that, if made final, would strip away reproductive rights for millions of women… forcing them to potentially live through the horrors and indignities that their grandmothers bore if they need reproductive care.”“…We can do more. We have to do more. We must. Congress itself has the power. We have the ability to vote tomorrow to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would codify Roe v. Wade, once and for all. Because let me be clear: Women seeking care should not be ashamed. The people who should feel shame are those forcing these women to live through unnecessary pain and suffering…And I’ll be damned if I let my daughters grow up in a country that gives them fewer rights than their mom had.”Duckworth’s full remarks as delivered below:My older daughter, Abigail, is seven.She's generous, silly, and so, so smart. She calls herself a “maker-kid” and dreams of being an engineer or an army nurse—but definitely not a helicopter pilot.My younger daughter, Maile, just turned four.Her laugh is contagious, and early on during the pandemic when I was mostly working from home she proved she was truly her mother's daughter by starting to pull pranks…Including grabbing my phone and, oopsies, hanging up on whoever was on the other line when I was trying to conduct a meeting or review some legislation instead of playing with her.But Abigail and Maile might not be here today if it weren't for the basic reproductive rights Americans have relied on for nearly 50 years.When Roe was decided in 1973, it changed the lives of so many women.It saved the lives of 14-year-olds who were the victims of rape or incest, who otherwise would have had to turn to back alleys and backrooms.It changed the lives of women who desperately wanted to be moms—but who found out that their pregnancies weren’t viable... that they'd have to go through the pain and suffering and trauma of a full term, only to stillborn at the end of nine months.And, personally, for me, it gave me my chance to be a mom.For I never would’ve had my creative, silly, drive-me-crazy-yet-love-them-infinitely two daughters if Roe hadn't paved the way for women to make their own healthcare decisions, as I was only able to get pregnant through IVF—a fertility process that Roe lays the foundation for.Because of IVF, I get to experience all the joys of motherhood.Because of reproductive rights, my husband and I aren’t just “Tammy and Bryan.” We’re “mommy and daddy.”Because of Roe, and the rights and laws it protects, we are a family.Yet last week, we learned that the Supreme Court could be just weeks away from overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey… a decision that, if made final, would strip away reproductive rights for millions of women… forcing them to potentially live through the horrors and indignities that their grandmothers bore if they need reproductive care.And this would just be the start. For while the anti-choice movement has been working for years—decades—to get to this moment, overturning Roe is not their end-goal.They want a national ban on abortion, something the Republican Senate Leader said was a possibility just last week.They want to undermine access to contraception.In some states, legislation has already been introduced that would make IVF a crime.In Oklahoma, one woman was even convicted of manslaughter for having a miscarriage—a miscarriage.Criminalized.For having a miscarriage.I’ve had a miscarriage, and there are no words to describe what mothers feel in that moment. For me, I was overcome with the rawest, most painful emotion I’d ever experienced.In that moment, losing my baby felt more searing than anything I’d ever felt,Yet if the GOP has their way, women may now have to live in fear that that worst moment of their lives may also send them to prison.And if extremists get what they’re seeking, doctors who perform procedures such as dilation and cutterage to help grieving families who’ve lost a pregnancy might be at risk of going to jail, too…Doctors like the one who, after my own miscarriage, conducted the D&C to clear out my uterus that allowed me to immediately continue my dream of having my desperately-wished-for second child… my beautiful rainbow baby… Maile.So let’s be honest.What’s happening is not about protecting life.If the anti-choice movement truly wanted to protect life, they’d stop trying to strip away Americans’ healthcare.They would be putting all of their efforts into addressing the growing maternal mortality crisis that has taken a tragic number of Black mothers’ lives.They would be pushing for desperately needed policies that support parents like affordable childcare and paid parental leave.If Republicans actually cared about being “pro-life,” they’d do something… anything… to stand up to the NRA.So no. This isn’t about saving lives. This isn’t about looking out for families.It’s about getting a slap on the back from their base and exerting even more control over women’s bodies.It’s about deepening divides between the haves and the have-nots.It’s about making it even harder to undo centuries of harm unleashed by systemic racism and economic injustice… systems under which women of color have suffered the most.Look, I know that a lot of us are tired from the seemingly endless fight to protect our most basic human rights.But we can do more. We have to do more. We must.Congress itself has the power. We have the ability to vote tomorrow to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would codify Roe v. Wade, once and for all.Because let me be clear: Women seeking care should not be ashamed.The people who should feel shame are those forcing these women to live through unnecessary pain and suffering.The people who should feel shame are those who claim to be pro-life, yet would let a mother die in childbirth for an unviable pregnancy… who refuse to expand Medicaid… who believe guns should be easy to get but basic healthcare impossible to find.These are the people who should be ashamed.These are the people who have no shame.And I’ll be damned if I let my daughters grow up in a country that gives them fewer rights than their mom had.So here I am today, fighting for a tomorrow that doesn’t look like our yesterday.Because in that yesterday, those of us with uteruses were treated as second-class citizens.And I didn’t learn to fly Black Hawk helicopters… go to war for our nation… nearly lose my life fighting for the rights enshrined in our constitution… only to come back home and have those same rights stripped away from the next generation of girls who simply want to be able to follow their own dreams, like I did mine.To me, it comes down to this. Women should be allowed to make their healthcare decisions without Mitch McConnell’s voice or Brett Kavanaugh’s face haunting them at their OBGYN appointments.So shame on those who want to take us back to the pre-Roe back alleys.Shame on those who don’t dare regulate guns, but want to regulate our uteruses.I will fight with everything I've got to keep us out of those back alleys…Because it is the least that the women who came before us and fought for these rights deserve...And it is the least that our own daughters need.So enough with the hypocrisy...Enough with the misogyny…Enough some men in hallowed halls in D.C. arguing that they know better than women in Illinois or Arizona or Missouri.We can—and we must—do better.That means proving that we care about women every day of the year, not just on one Sunday in May.That means codifying Roe now.Let’s vote.-30-"
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-introduces-bill-to-protect-wildlife-and-water-sources-from-toxic-lead-poisoning," [WASHINGTON, DC] – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Fisheries, Water and Wildlife, introduced legislation to help protect innocent animals from toxic lead poisoning by limiting the use of lead bullets on federal lands managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). The Lead Endangers Animals Daily (LEAD) Act of 2022 would direct the Department of the Interior (DOI) to issue a final regulation prohibiting the use of lead ammunition on USFWS lands and directs DOI to establish and update annually a list of non-lead ammunition.“There is no safe level of lead in our environment—not for humans or our wildlife,” Duckworth said. “As we continue our ongoing work to remove lead pipes and reduce the risk of lead poisoning in our communities, I’m proud to introduce this legislation to help us protect water sources and innocent animals from lead poisoning too.”Along with Duckworth, U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) is also an original cosponsor of this legislation.Studies show that lead ammunition kills as many as 130 species of wildlife per year, including our country’s national bird—the bald eagle. In fact, 46 percent of bald eagles have dangerous levels of lead in their bodies. When animals are killed with lead bullets, the lead contaminates the carcass. This leads to lead poisoning in predators that eat these contaminated carcasses, water sources and animals who live in these water sources like fish.The copy of the bill text can be found here.Duckworth has been a vocal advocate of lead pipe removal in Illinois and across the nation in order to end lead contamination in drinking water. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law fully authorizes Duckworth’s bipartisan Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act (DWWIA), which is helping rebuild our nation’s crumbling and dangerous water infrastructure, removing and replacing lead service lines as well as cleaning up our drinking water and wastewater systems in communities across the country. As a result of her leadership, Illinois—which contains the most known lead service lines of any state in the nation—is able to dramatically accelerate projects to remove dangerous lead pipes and protect countless children against permanent, irreversible brain damage from drinking lead-contaminated water. As co-founder of the Senate’s first-ever Environmental Justice Caucus, Duckworth understands that this issue disproportionally effects communities of color and low-income communities and will continue to work hard to end lead contamination across the nation.-30-"
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-hosts-national-security-council-discussion-with-chicago-ukrainian-community," [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) hosted a discussion to bring together members of Chicago’s Ukrainian community with officials from the U.S. National Security Council to help provide residents with updates from the Biden Administration on its efforts in Ukraine. On her National Security Council call, Duckworth invited representatives from the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America-Illinois Division, St. Joseph Ukrainian Catholic Church, Ukrainian Medical Association of North America, Ukrainian National Museum of Chicago, Kyiv – Sister Cities Chicago, Consulate General of Ukraine, Chicago and Razom. The Chicago Metropolitan Area is home to the second-largest population of Ukrainian-Americans in the United States.“Our country and the world remain in awe of the bravery of the Ukrainian people who are so effectively defending their homeland and their freedom and are continuing to repel Putin’s forces against overwhelming odds,” Duckworth said. “Here in Chicago, I know how difficult the past few months have been for our Ukrainian community, and I was glad to be able to bring so many together to receive critical updates from the Biden Administration’s National Security Council. I am dedicated to supporting Ukraine and making sure we do whatever we can to support Ukrainians and their families right now in the face of these unjustified and unjustifiable attacks.”As a member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), Duckworth has been a strong supporter of Ukraine against Russia’s escalating invasion. Earlier this year Duckworth met with Ukrainian community leaders in Chicago and virtually to express her support and share resources on how her office can help.Thanks to the generosity of Americans and the leadership of President Biden, the United States has delivered for Ukraine. Over the course of the last two months, Congress appropriated and the President allocated roughly $14 billion in funding for security, humanitarian and economic support that has allowed the United States to respond to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine at a scope, scale, and speed that has never been seen before, making us by far the largest supporter of Ukraine.U.S. assistance has made a significant difference on the battlefield, helping the brave citizens of Ukraine and to continue to deplete the Russian military. These funds have also helped the U.S. to reinforce the Eastern flank of NATO, maintain the unity of the alliance in the face of Russian efforts to divide us and impose severe consequences on Russia and its enablers.The U.S. also continues to support the Ukrainian people, including by providing humanitarian and economic assistance.  In addition, the United States will also welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians through Uniting for Ukraine, a new streamlined process to provide Ukrainian citizens who have fled Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression opportunities to come to the United States.-30-"

The least we can do is recognize and give appreciation for their unrelenting, hard work of teaching the next generation and helping form tomorrow’s leaders.” “Our educators devote their lives to not only teaching our children their ABCs but also shaping the next generation of leaders. Despite facing additional challenges in the classroom during the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers remain connected to their students and dedicated to finding creative ways to instruct. This week, we remind ourselves of the great impact our teachers have had on each of us and thank them for showing up every day to serve their communities,” said Durbin.In addition to Duckworth, Durbin, Brown and Collins, the resolution is co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-CA), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Angus King (I-ME), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Jack Reed (D-RI), Tina Smith (D-MN), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), Tom Carper (D-DE), Gary Peters (D-MI), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Bob Casey (D-PA).“Teachers have always answered the call to serve, going above and beyond to ensure our students have a foundation of skills and tools that will last a lifetime,” said Brown. “Throughout the past two years, teachers and educators have found unique ways to support and stay connected with their students. We must continue to honor the work of our education staff through policy that supports teachers in their efforts to develop the next generation of leaders.”“As a Senator, I have visited more than 200 schools throughout Maine,” said Collins. “In communities large or small, urban or rural, the school is the town’s pride and joy. It is the dedicated and caring educators who make it so. This resolution honors the indefatigable efforts of our teachers and expresses our gratitude for all that they do to prepare our children for success.”A copy of the resolution can be read here.-30-"

https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/bipartisan-bill-introduced-by-duckworth-portman-and-blumenthal-to-protect-infants-from-deadly-crib-bumpers-passes-congress-and-president-biden-expected-to-sign-ban-into-law," [WASHINGTON, D.C.] — Bipartisan legislation introduced by U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Rob Portman (R-OH) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) to protect infant lives by banning the sale of padded crib bumpers—which have been proven to pose an unnecessary, deadly risk to sleeping infants—passed Congress last evening and is now headed to the White House to be signed into law by President Joe Biden. The Safe Cribs Act, which was included in the legislation also banning dangerous inclined sleeper products, would make it unlawful nationwide to manufacture and import crib bumpers, which remain widely sold by retailers despite current recommendations advising parents to keep cribs bare to prevent sudden infant death syndrome. The Senators’ legislation would direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to enforce a ban on padded crib bumpers nationwide.“The fact that deadly crib bumpers can still be found on shelves across the country is extremely confusing to new parents who don’t believe stores would be selling them if they were truly dangerous to babies,” said Duckworth. “We should be doing everything we can to help new parents and prevent needless deaths like these, which is why I’m glad our bipartisan bill to end the sale of deadly padded crib bumpers finally passed Congress and is now headed to President Biden’s desk.”“The use of padded crib bumpers poses an unnecessary threat to the health and safety of infants everywhere, there is no reason the sale of these items should continue,” said Portman. “I am pleased that this legislation is finally heading to the president’s desk. I urge him to sign it into law quickly so that we may immediately begin protecting infants from the unnecessary and unacceptable risk of these products.”“I applaud the Congress for passing this important measure to ensure deadly and dangerous crib bumpers are pulled off store shelves,” said Blumenthal. “New parents can still unwittingly purchase this perilous padding for their children’s cribs despite dozens of babies suffocating. I look forward to the President signing into law this bipartisan effort I was glad to back with Senators Duckworth and Portman to prevent more needless tragedies.”Duckworth, Portman and Blumenthal introduced this legislation in April of 2021 and it passed the U.S. Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation (CST) Committee) by voice vote later that same month. In March, the Senate passed the bill. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safe Sleep for Babies Act, which contained identical language to the Safe Cribs Act banning crib bumpers, in June 2021.   The legislation has been endorsed by American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), Kids in Danger, Consumer Federation of American and Breathable Baby. A 2020 survey conducted by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that many parents falsely believe crib bumpers are safe, mistakenly assume that crib bumpers would have been removed from the market if unsafe and by nearly a five to one margin, expressed support for the view that if crib bumpers were linked to infant deaths, these products should not be sold.  Duckworth has been a leading proponent of policies supporting working women and families in the Senate. After introducing legislation to help families with diaper needs in February of this year, Duckworth helped secure provisions in the American Rescue Plan (ARP) to support low-income families with diapers and diapering supplies. Duckworth’s Friendly Airports for Mothers Improvement Act was also signed into law last November, which means that airports all across the country are now required to support nursing mothers by providing accessible, clean and convenient lactation rooms for travelers. Duckworth also introduced a bipartisan bill in May of last year that would have ensured more new parents quickly received the additional $500 per child in Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act stimulus payments without having to wait until 2021.In 2011, the City of Chicago became the first city to ban the sale of crib bumpers. Maryland and Ohio also banned the sale of these products in 2013 and 2017 respectively, with minor exceptions.-30-"

Wade:“If this draft opinion becomes reality, a small group far-right Justices would be stripping away protected constitutional rights that millions of American families—including my own—have relied on for 50 years and that 70% of Americans believe should be legal. The institution, and the Justices who claimed Roe was ‘settled law,’ will struggle to survive the stench of this decision.“In a nation with a growing maternal mortality crisis and often inaccessible healthcare, without affordable childcare or universal paid leave, forcing births on millions of people—even when the mother’s life could be at risk—is particularly cruel. Before finalizing their decision in this case, I hope these Justices recognize that you cannot ban abortions, you can only criminalize safe abortions—and that their decision in this case could have far-reaching consequences on many, many other rights.“I will keep working to convince my colleagues in the Senate that we must act to codify Roe v. Wade into law so that every American has equal access to basic, necessary healthcare—regardless of which state they live in, the color of their skin or the size of their income.”Duckworth has made protecting and expanding access to essential women’s healthcare a top priority and helped introduce the bicameral Women’s Health Protection Act that would guarantee equal access to abortion everywhere. She was outraged when Republicans blocked this critical legislation earlier this year. Additionally, Duckworth is the lead sponsor of the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Healthcare (EACH) Act, which would end the Hyde Amendment and lift unjust abortion coverage restrictions for those who depend on Medicaid and other government-sponsored plans.-30-"

During the meeting, the Senators and the group discussed electric and electric vehicle infrastructure investments made possible through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, as well as the importance of transitioning our energy dependence to renewable sources while bringing affordable options—and good-paying energy jobs—to Americans.“Renewable energy has the potential to encourage job growth, protect our environment and secure Illinois’s leadership in the energy sector for years to come,” said Duckworth. “I was glad to meet with Illinois Electric Cooperatives today and share how the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and other policies I’ve worked on are helpful to the public-power industry and prioritize environmental protections, working families and the public health of communities across the state.”“It’s no secret that renewable energy is the future of this sector. Illinois is certainly poised to become a leader in this shift toward renewable energy,” said Durbin. “During my meeting with the Illinois Electric Cooperatives today, I reiterated my commitment to supporting energy sources – like electric co-ops – that are transitioning to carbon-free energy and working to leave a healthy planet for our kids and grandkids.

Whether in the dark days after 9/11 or the decades America reckoned with the legacy of internment, Norm Mineta’s leadership and persistence helped our nation emerge from many of our worst moments stronger and more unified.

https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-and-durbin-join-hirono-and-senate-colleagues-in-supporting-biden-administration-proposal-to-reverse-harmful-trump-immigration-rule," [WASHINGTON, DC] – U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) joined U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) and 10 of their Senate colleagues in submitting comments in support of the Biden Administration’s proposal to better support immigrants by updating the “public charge” regulation. The Biden Administration’s proposed regulation would replace the public charge rule enacted by the Trump Administration in 2019. The 2019 rule made it significantly more difficult for many immigrants to become lawful permanent residents, by allowing immigration officials to deny immigrants green cards based on their income or the wholly legal action of using of public benefits like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Medicaid. In a letter sent to Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Ur Mendoza Jaddou, Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Senators also called on the Administration to take three additional steps to better support immigrants seeking permanent status in this country.“In 2019, the Department of Homeland Security under the Trump Administration proposed a new definition and implementation of the public charge rule, which was used to advance an anti-immigrant agenda and intimidate immigrant communities,” wrote the lawmakers. “While the 2019 public charge regulation took effect just as the COVID-19 pandemic escalated, the rule undermined the United States’ overall pandemic response by deterring immigrant families from participating in public health measures and community support programs, thereby amplifying COVID-19’s disparate impact on the health and well-being of families of color.  The updates in the current proposed rule are essential to prevent a recurrence of such devastating events, both in the current pandemic, as well as in future national emergencies.”Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), an individual seeking permanent residency in the United States can be inadmissible if they are a determined to be a “public charge.” The INA does not define public charge and prior to the Trump Administration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) only looked at whether an immigrant received cash assistance and government-funded institutionalized care to determine whether they were likely to become dependent on public assistance in the future.In 2019, the Trump Administration deviated from longstanding agency practice and lowered the threshold for becoming a public charge, making it more difficult for many immigrants, including many with U.S. citizen children, to become lawful permanent residents. The Trump rule considered assistance from many more programs, including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), housing and transportation benefits, most medical care and more. The Biden Administration’s updated regulation would roll back the Trump-era standards and exclude benefits related to public emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic.“Finalizing a responsible public charge policy is critical to ensuring that our country has a humane immigration system,” the lawmakers continued. “We urge you to speedily approve this rule to minimize the ongoing chilling effect of public charge on our constituents and families. As you work to finalize the rule, we also urge DHS to coordinate with other federal agencies to ensure a consistent and accurate dissemination of information to affected agencies and families.”In addition to expressing their support for the overall proposed regulation, the Senators provided three additional key recommendations to help ensure the updated rule does not further contribute to chilling or discriminatory effects on immigrants and their families. The Senators stated that the rule should,Since the proposal of the Trump-era rule, Duckworth has been vocal in opposing it, while continuing the call for humane and compassionate treatment of immigrant families at home in Illinois and throughout our nation. In October 2018, Duckworth and Durbin joined a group of their Senate colleagues in urging the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to withdraw the proposed rule. Before the rule went into effect, Duckworth and Durbin helped introduce the Protect American Values Act – legislation that would prohibit the Trump administration from using federal funding to implement the public charge rule.In addition to U.S. Senators Duckworth, Durbin and Hirono, the letter is also signed by Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Patty Murray (D-WA), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Ron Wyden (D-OR).Full text of the letter can be found here and below.Dear Secretary Mayorkas and Director Jaddou,We write to comment on the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS’s) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on implementing Section 212(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, published on February 24, 2022. As Members of the United States Senate, we applaud the important steps this proposal takes to update the “public charge” law and urge you to make further commonsense changes to ensure fairness and simplify its application.The proposed regulation restores and improves upon the public charge field guidance that was issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service in 1999. This guidance was the first attempt to define public charge and provide standards for determining inadmissibility on such grounds, standards which remained in place for nearly 20 years. Consistent with the Immigration and Naturalization Act, case law, and agency practice, the guidance helped ensure that immigrant families, including many with U.S. citizen children, were not deterred from accessing critical resources.In 2019, the Department of Homeland Security under the Trump Administration proposed a new definition and implementation of the public charge rule, which was used to advance an anti-immigrant agenda and intimidate immigrant communities. While the 2019 public charge regulation took effect just as the COVID-19 pandemic escalated, the rule undermined the United States’ overall pandemic response by deterring immigrant families from participating in public health measures and community support programs, thereby amplifying COVID-19’s disparate impact on the health and well-being of families of color.[1] The updates in the current proposed rule are essential to prevent a recurrence of such devastating events, both in the current pandemic, as well as in future national emergencies.President Biden’s Executive Order on Restoring Faith in Our Legal Immigration Systems and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans states that the Federal Government should eliminate “sources of fear and other barriers that prevent immigrants from accessing government services available to them.”[2] This proposed rule represents a clear step in that direction by replacing the harmful 2019 public charge rule with a new policy based on two decades of practice that also creates clarity for immigrant families, strengthens our immigration system, and ensures consistency in application of the law. Overall, we agree with DHS’s proposed improvements in this proposed regulation that build upon the original 1999 field guidance. The proposals in the NPRM are consistent with the will of Congress and will result in a clearer, more administrable public charge policy, including:We appreciate that this NPRM recognizes that the use of health care, nutrition and housing assistance should not be a barrier to obtaining permanent residence status in our country. Congress has put these tools in place to help families thrive when they fall on hard times, purposely setting eligibility rules for them, and this rule aligns with those intentions.  In addition to supporting the overall proposed regulation, we have provided key recommendations below to ensure the final rule does not further contribute to chilling or discriminatory effects on immigrants and their families.The proposed rule should exclude institutionalization at government expense altogether from the definition of public charge. Including Medicaid coverage for long term institutional care causes confusion and contributes to individuals and families not enrolling in our nation’s most essential health coverage program.  By definition, long term institutionalization is used by individuals who are elderly or who have a disability–making this provision discriminatory. The proposed rule should exclude State, Tribal, territorial, and local benefits. A number of states and localities have enacted, or are considering, inclusive initiatives to support their residents. These programs are an exercise of state powers and we do not want to undermine state and local efforts to strengthen their communities.  Moreover, including non-federal benefits would unnecessarily complicate any public charge determination. Limiting consideration to federal benefits will result in a single, uniform, federal standard for all immigrants across the country.Finally, given Congress’ decision to require an affidavit of support from certain immigrants, and consistent with longstanding practice and policy, we recommend that DHS clarify that an affidavit of support is generally sufficient to overcome this ground of inadmissibility. In the absence of significant public charge concerns, an individual who signs an affidavit of support is legally responsible for providing the named immigrant with financial resources should it become necessary.Finalizing a responsible public charge policy is critical to ensuring that our country has a humane immigration system. We urge you to speedily approve this rule to minimize the ongoing chilling effect of public charge on our constituents and families. As you work to finalize the rule, we also urge DHS to coordinate with other federal agencies to ensure a consistent and accurate dissemination of information to affected agencies and families. Sincerely,-30-[1] Bernstein, Hamutal. “Immigrant Families Continued Avoiding the Safety Net during the COVID-19 Crisis.” Urban Institute, February 2021, https://www.urban.org/research/publication/immigrant-families-continued-avoiding-safety-net-during-covid-19-crisis.[2] President Joseph R.

Duckworth is a strong supporter of replenishing the Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF) and is a co-sponsor of the Continuing Emergency Support for Restaurants Act.“No one should be surprised that among the restaurants that managed to survive the deadly pandemic, far too many are struggling to achieve the same scale and capacity they had pre-pandemic, which is why passing legislation to replenish the RRF is critical,” Duckworth said. “Supporting neighborhood restaurants should be a bipartisan effort – and it’s deeply disappointing that despite broad support throughout the Democratic Caucus – we still lack 60 votes to get it done. I’ll keep working with organizations like the Illinois Restaurant Association to help ensure our Illinois restaurants have the support they deserve.”Duckworth today met with IRA President and CEO Sam Toia, Lettuce Entertain You Executive Vice President Jay Stieber, Third Coast Hospitality CEO Sam Sanchez, Vaughan Hospitality Owner Kevin Vaughan, Manny’s Deli Owner Dan Raskin and other Illinois restaurant leaders.As a member of the U.S. Senate Small Business Committee, Duckworth has been a strong supporter of providing restaurants with critical relief throughout the pandemic. Duckworth is a co-sponsor of U.S. Senator and Small Business Committee Chair Ben Cardin (D-MD)’s Continuing Emergency Support for Restaurants Act, as well as the Restaurant Revitalization Fund Replenishment Act. Duckworth was also a co-sponsor of the RESTAURANTS Act, provisions of which were included in the American Rescue Plan.-30-"
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-secures-support-from-coast-guard-commandant-nominee-for-her-efforts-to-prevent-military-hunger-," [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), member of the U.S. Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, met with Admiral Linda Fagan to discuss her nomination to become Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard. During their conversation, Senator Duckworth secured Admiral Fagan’s support for her efforts to update the law to ensure the U.S. Department of Agriculture excludes Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) when calculating a U.S. Coast Guard active duty member’s eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), just as the Internal Revenue Service excludes BAH when calculating a member of the U.S. Coast Guard’s earned income to determine eligibility for the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit.“It was great to meet with Admiral Linda Fagan and I was pleased that she shares my view that if even one Coast Guard family goes hungry, that is one too many. I look forward to working with Admiral Fagan to update the law to require the Department of Agriculture to exclude BAH when determining a Coast Guard member’s eligibility for SNAP. As someone whose family relied on nutrition programs after my father lost his job, and who served in the uniform for most of my adult life, I’m proud to be championing this legislative effort and I’m glad to have Admiral Fagan’s support. If confirmed by the Senate, I believe Admiral Fagan will serve as an excellent Commandant of the Coast Guard.”Senator Duckworth led the bipartisan effort in the Senate to get the U.S. Department of Agriculture to exclude BAH when calculating the income of a member of a uniformed service to determine eligibility for federal nutrition programs. Duckworth also authored the bipartisan Military Family Nutrition Access Act, which would ensure that BAH is excluded when determining a member of a uniformed service’s eligibility for SNAP to ensure that military families struggling to put food on the table receive the support they’ve earned serving our country.Duckworth is a combat Veteran who served in the Reserve Forces for 23 years.

https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-re-introduces-legislation-to-expand-voting-rights-and-improve-civic-participation," [WASHINGTON D.C.]— Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), alongside 12 democratic Senators, re-introduced the Pre-Registration of Voters Everywhere (PROVE) Act to expand voter registration efforts nationwide and increase American citizens’ participation in the democratic process. The PROVE Act would allow for U.S. citizens aged 16 and 17 to pre-register to be added to voter rolls when they turn 18. Additionally, the PROVE Act also provides $25 million in grants, over two years, for states to distribute to schools and localities to develop curriculums aiming to encourage civic engagement.“The right to vote is a founding tenet of our democracy, and the strength of our democracy depends upon the participation of the American people,” said Senator Duckworth. “Unfortunately, many Americans are facing unnecessary barriers when it comes to casting their vote, and voter turnout continues to lag behind that of many other developed nations. We should constantly be looking for ways to bring new voters into the fold and make voting easier—not harder. I’m proud to re-introduce the PROVE Act to help get young Americans registered to vote as soon as they’re eligible, which could help boost voter participation.” Across the country, more than 20 states—including Illinois—already allow young Americans to pre-register to vote before they turn 18. The PROVE Act would eliminate the state-by-state discrepancies and uniformly enable 16- and 17-year-old citizens to pre-register to vote and automatically be added to voter rolls when they turn 18. This legislation would increase the civic participation among young Americans and help address the 20 percent gap in voter registration between 18–24-year-olds and the national average of all ages.Duckworth previously re-introduced the PROVE Act in 2019. This year, the cosponsors of the PROVE Act include U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D-CO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Bob Casey (D-PA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Ed Markey (D-MA), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Tina Smith (D-MN), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Ron Wyden (D-OR). In the U.S. House of Representatives, U.S. Representative Don Beyer (D-VA-08) introduced the companion legislation.The PROVE Act is endorsed by Common Cause, Rock the Vote, FairVote and Head Count.“We have a civic duty to ensure that all young Americans can exercise their freedom to vote, especially as some states are making it more difficult for certain Americans to vote. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented substantial challenges to young voters, many of whom already face significant barriers to having their voices heard and votes counted under normal circumstances,” said Common Cause president Karen Hobert Flynn. “Common Cause was instrumental in helping to pass the 26th Amendment to the Constitution to lower the voting age to 18, and we commend Senator Duckworth for her leadership in introducing the common-sense PROVE Act to allow pre-registration of 16- and 17-year-olds to help amplify the voices of young voters.”“Rock the Vote fully endorses the PROVE Act as a critical step to create a more representative and healthy democracy,” said Carolyn DeWitt, President of Rock the Vote. “Pre-registration is a nonpartisan, common sense policy that has been successfully adopted in states across the country and has proven to help close the voter participation gap. As new voters, young people face disproportionate barriers to voting, resulting in a generation that is continually underrepresented. We, as a country, do little to prepare young people to engage in the civic process, resulting in major disparities in participation. The PROVE Act will help make strides in increasing young voter turnout.""""Now more than ever, we need to nurture citizens who are active participants in our democracy,"" said Rob Richie, President and CEO of FairVote. ""Voter pre-registration is a good-government, common-sense reform that gets more young people on the voter rolls and engaged in the important work of self-governance. FairVote has supported and tracked pre-registration for nearly 20 years, and the verdict is in: it works. Pre-registration has delivered on its promises in Republican-run states like Florida and Louisiana and in Democratic-run states like Maryland and Delaware, and it's time to make it a national norm."" Full text of the bill is available here.-30-"

As funding is disseminated for various infrastructure projects, U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Bob Casey (D-PA), Ed Markey (D-MA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) are urging U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to ensure that these investments make travel accessible for older adults and people with disabilities. The Senators sent a letter to Secretary Buttigieg emphasizing that all new start construction projects must be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)—the landmark civil rights law prohibiting discrimination against people with disabilities in all areas of public life—and the Rehabilitation Act, which prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in programs conducted by federal agencies or receiving federal funding.“As DOT prepares to distribute $1 trillion to communities to make our infrastructure more efficient, greener and safer, we can also ensure that facilities and transportation systems are built and renovated to serve everyone, including the 61 million Americans with disabilities. The significant investments in IIJA present an ideal opportunity to make our transit systems, which have historically excluded older adults and people with disabilities, compliant with the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act,” wrote the Senators.The Senators also noted the opportunity and need to increase hiring, promotion and retention of people with disabilities in the infrastructure workforce. They wrote, “We also ask every employer issued IIJA funds commit to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs’ goal of employing at least 7 percent of their workforce with people who have disabilities and that every contract, grant and cooperative agreement include a provision that recipients shall consult with local disability stakeholders to ensure projects result in accessible facilities.”In addition to $617 million for Pennsylvania public transportation projects from the infrastructure law, Pennsylvania communities will be able to compete for a $1.75 billion grant program to improve accessibility at rail stations thanks to Senator Casey’s?All Station Accessibility Program (ASAP) Act, a version of which was incorporated into the infrastructure law. Senator Casey has also introduced legislation to make public transportation more accessible for?college students.Read the letter to Secretary Buttigieg here.April 22, 2022The Honorable Pete Buttigieg SecretaryU.S. Department of Transportation 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE Washington, D.C. 20590Dear Secretary Buttigieg:Thank you for your ongoing work to implement the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and for the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) efforts to revitalize U.S. infrastructure. The IIJA will build on this Administration’s efforts to modernize existing transportation systems, while also creating sustainable systems that will serve our Nation for decades. As the DOT continues to implement the law’s investments, we ask you to ensure that any infrastructure investments work to make travel accessible for everyone, especially older adults and people with disabilities, by assuring that all new start construction projects are compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act. We also ask every employer issued IIJA funds commit to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs’ goal of employing at least 7 percent of their workforce with people who have disabilities and that every contract, grant and cooperative agreement include a provision that recipients shall consult with local disability stakeholders to ensure projects result in accessible facilities.As DOT prepares to distribute $1 trillion to communities to make our infrastructure more efficient, greener and safer, we can also ensure that facilities and transportation systems are built and renovated to serve everyone, including the 61 million Americans with disabilities. The significant investments in IIJA present an ideal opportunity to make our transit systems, which have historically excluded older adults and people with disabilities, compliant with the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. New roadways and sidewalks can be constructed in ways that are safe for older adults, who make up 20 percent of all pedestrian deaths. New transit stations and airports can be constructed and retrofitted in compliance with the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. While the IIJA committed some dedicated funding for accessibility through programs such as the All Stations Accessibility Program, the broader spirit of inclusive construction should be incorporated into the Department’s implementation procedures.This historic investment in the country’s infrastructure is also a historic opportunity to make our physical infrastructure accessible to people with disabilities and to increase the hiring, promotion and retention of people with disabilities in the infrastructure workforce. As notices of funding opportunities, contracts and grants related to IIJA are being prepared and disseminated, we ask:The work of rebuilding our roads, bridges, rails and airports as well as expanding green technology is long overdue. We applaud the Administration’s undertaking of this momentous task. The inclusion of older adults and people with disabilities in the planning and implementation of this once-in-a-generation investment will ensure that all Americans benefit from this investment. Thank you for your attention to our requests. Please respond by May 16th.-30-"
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/in-chicago-duckworth-leads-field-hearing-on-her-bipartisan-laws-impact-on-removing-lead-from-drinking-water," [CHICAGO, IL] – U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Chair of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Fisheries, Water and Wildlife, today led a subcommittee field hearing in Chicago on the implementation of her Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act (DWWIA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is helping support the replacement of lead service lines throughout Illinois and across the country. As the state with the most known lead service lines in the nation, Illinois and the City of Chicago face unique challenges in executing full lead service line replacement. While Chicago has launched a voluntary lead service line replacement program and Illinois law now requires full lead line replacement, federal support will be critical in increasing, expediting and improving the roll out of these plans. Video from today’s hearing is available here and photos are available here.“There has been a historic lack of investment in our nation’s water infrastructure … DWWIA and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are going to change this,” Duckworth said in her opening statement. “Lead pipes are a health crisis in this country. According to the CDC, there is no known safe level of lead for children. Despite lead service lines being banned nearly 35 years ago, as of 2019, roughly half a million children under the age of 6 in this country still had elevated levels of lead in their blood. We cannot continue to put our children at risk of permanent brain and kidney damage. We must figure out how to replace these pipes in an equitable and efficient manner. We must facilitate collaboration between states, municipalities and the federal government to finally make lead-free drinking water a reality for all communities.”Duckworth’s DWWIA and the federal funding provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will be able to dramatically accelerate projects to remove dangerous lead pipes and protect countless children against permanent, irreversible brain damage from drinking lead-contaminated water. Full funding for DWWIA was included in President Biden’s FY23 budget, which was announced last month. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s entire drinking water and wastewater authorization division is Duckworth’s bipartisan DWWIA, and the law includes advance appropriations to fund DWWIA programs and additional lead service line replacement initiatives over the next five years to help rebuild our nation’s crumbling and dangerous water infrastructure.With the provisions in DWWIA, increased funding through the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund is provided, as well as increased access to grant funding for disadvantaged communities. Before its inclusion in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, last year Duckworth successfully shepherded passage of DWWIA in the Senate by a vote of 89 to 2. Duckworth is also the co-founder of the U.S. Senate Environmental Justice Caucus.Today’s hearing witnesses included Illinois Environmental Protection Agency Director John Kim, City of Chicago Water Management Commissioner Andrea Cheng, Metropolitan Planning Council Policy Manager Dr. Justin Williams and Elevate Water Programs Strategist Anthena Gore. These witnesses highlighted how states and municipalities can implement this law and help get lead out of drinking water for residents and to discuss the work that Chicago and Illinois have already begun.-30-"

Duckworth delivered remarks during this morning’s event and was joined by U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Illinois National Guard Adjutant General Richard Neely and Defense Innovation Unit leadership. Photos from the event are available here.“Thanks to the efforts of DIU, we’re bringing more non-traditional companies into the DoD pipeline, ensuring our military can innovate and adopt more commercial technology to strengthen our national security,” said Duckworth. “Making sure our troops have access to cutting edge technology isn’t just a nice thing to have – it’s a necessity for national competitiveness and military readiness. It saves money, it saves time and, most importantly, it can help save lives. I’m proud I’ve been a longtime supporter of DIU’s mission, I’m especially proud that today’s office opening is tapping into the talent we all know is thriving right here in Chicago.”In the Senate Armed Services Committee, Duckworth has worked to support the advanced technology being developed by our world-leading research universities and small businesses in Illinois, our national laboratories like Argonne and Fermi and important entities that help connect the work of industry and the DoD—like the DIU and MxD, which is a digital manufacturing innovation and cybersecurity center, through the yearly National Defense Authorization Act. -30-"

With this announcement, the Council will purchase and renovate a new space to continue and expand community service offerings, such as low-income home energy assistance, counseling and prevention services for domestic violence and sexual assault, a food pantry, a clothing center, emergency and transitional housing assistance and housing rehabilitation. This support comes through the USDA Rural Development’s Community Facilities Direct Loans and Guaranteed Loans program and will benefit over 165,000 Illinoisans.“Making sure Illinoisans in every corner of our state have access to community programs that can help keep their families safe, warm and healthy is something I’ll always strive to support and work toward,” Duckworth said. “I’m proud to join Senator Durbin in announcing this infusion of federal support through the Biden Administration to help support Western Illinoisans.”“This federal investment will allow the Western Illinois Regional Council and Community Action Agency to help more families in need, whether they are struggling to afford housing or facing food insecurity,” Durbin said. “Senator Duckworth and I will continue working to ensure that Western Illinois has access to these critical federal funds, especially as our state continues to recover from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.”The Western Illinois Regional Council and Community Action Agency in Macomb is expected to receive a $1,476,000 loan from USDA Rural Development.-30-"

The Get the Lead out of Assisted Housing Act would help protect families from lead exposure by requiring the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to inspect for lead service lines, create a grant program to address lead contamination and allow a cross-check for lead in water when remediating a home for lead found in paint.“It’s unacceptable that in one of the wealthiest nations in the world, families living in federally assisted housing remain at risk of suffering permanent brain damage as a result of drinking water contaminated with lead,” Duckworth said. “With my Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act fully authorized in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we’re already taking historic strides to get the lead out of our drinking water in communities across the country and help make sure everyone has access to clean water. Today’s bipartisan legislation would build on this progress and help ensure no family is overlooked.”“Families shouldn’t have to face the threat of lead contamination in their drinking water or in their homes,” Young said. “That’s why we are reintroducing our bipartisan Get Lead Out of Assisted Housing Act to require HUD to identify and address lead contamination at the source. This must happen to protect the health of Hoosier families and communities across the country.” “There is no safe level of lead, and the Flint water crisis taught us that we cannot take the safety of our drinking water for granted,” Kildee said. “Families in Michigan and across the country should be able to trust that they are safe from lead in their drinking water at home. Our legislation takes an important step toward making that a reality by requiring water testing in federally assisted housing. Protecting families from lead in their homes is not a partisan issue, and I am proud to work with Republicans and Democrats to keep Michigan families safe from lead.”Along with Duckworth, Young and Kildee, this legislation is also co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI).The Get the Lead out of Assisted Housing Act would help protect families from lead exposure by:The copy of the bill text can be found here.Duckworth has been a strong supporter of improving our nation’s water infrastructure, especially in historically disadvantaged communities.

I hope we can make this change permanent so that this fuel can continue being a cheaper, cleaner alternative that helps us reduce reliance on foreign oil while bringing down gas prices for working families across the country. By investing in homegrown biofuels like E15, not only will families be able to keep more money in their pockets, but it will also strengthen our nation and drive economic opportunity and job creation throughout the Midwest.”Duckworth has been a leading advocate for policies that would lower the cost of gas and support working families. Last month, Duckworth helped introduce the Home Front Energy Independence Act, which would make E15 available year round, establish an E15 and Biodiesel Tax Credit, direct EPA to finalize their E15 labeling rule and provide for biofuel infrastructure and compatibility with retailers. In a Senate hearing last week, EPA Administrator Michael Regan confirmed that this legislation would help bring down gas prices at the pump for working families.Additionally, Duckworth also helped lead a bipartisan push to prioritize the year round sale of E15 fuel and utilize American agriculture as a less costly energy solution. Last month, Duckworth also introduced legislation to help prevent the oil industry from engaging in gasoline price gouging during periods of crisis, helping protect Americans from unnecessary price increases.-30-"

The Brycen Gray and Ben Price COVID-19 Cognitive Research Act would authorize the National Science Foundation to award grants on a competitive basis to support interdisciplinary research on the disruption of cognitive processes associated with both short-term and long-term COVID–19 infections among adults, children and adolescents. This bipartisan legislation comes after the tragic loss of Illinois native Ben Price and Ohio native Brycen Gray last year, both of whom had no history of mental illness, but took their own lives after suffering from COVID-19. U.S. Representative Anthony Gonzalez (R-OH-16) sponsored bipartisan companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.“Ben Price and Brycen Gray are just two of the many Americans across our nation who have tragically lost their lives to neurological illnesses that may have been triggered by COVID-19—even though they had no history of mental illness prior to becoming infected by this deadly virus,” said Senator Duckworth. “There is so much more we must do to better understand COVID-19 and its impacts on people’s lives at a fundamental level. I’m proud to introduce the Brycen Gray and Ben Price COVID-19 Cognitive Research Act with Senators Cassidy and Brown to help expand research into this issue, honor those we’ve lost and work to prevent future tragedies.”“The pandemic showed us the need to prioritize mental health and support those suffering,” said Dr. Cassidy. “Our bill increases research into COVID’s short- and long-term impacts on mental health and effects on the brain.”“As a result of the pandemic, people have experienced isolation, fear, disruption to routines, and in too many cases, the death of a caregiver or a loved one – as was the case for the family of Brycen Gray, who tragically lost his life to suicide a year ago. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have had on mental health have been stark – but we still have a lot of work to do before we can understand the full scope of long-term, neurological disorders that stem from the virus,” said Senator Brown. “This legislation is an important first step toward understanding, treating, and ultimately preventing those long-term side effects that harm our physical health and our mental health.”“The heartbreaking losses of Brycen Gray and Ben Price have shone an unforgiving light on how little we know about COVID-19’s direct impact on mental health,” said Rep. Gonzalez said. “While we’ve made great strides in further understanding COVID-19 and its complexities, significant research gaps remain as to how and why this virus can hit the brain and trigger serious cognitive impairments. Our bill effectively closes the research gaps and lays the groundwork for preventing and treating these impairments in the future. I am proud to honor the legacies of Brycen and Ben and work alongside Sen. Duckworth, Sen. Brown, and Sen. Cassidy in advancing this important legislation.”“The importance of this bill cannot be overlooked,” said Jennifer Price, widow of Ben Price. “The neurological impact of Covid is great and has impacted and devastated many families like mine. Had I known about Covid Psychosis and the neurological impact that Covid had on the brain my husband would be here today. Knowledge is power but without action it’s useless. We need action to help save more lives!”The copy of the bill text can be found here.Duckworth is dedicated to advancing legislation that would support the millions of Americans who live with the devastating impacts of COVID-19. Yesterday, Duckworth introduced the Targeting Resources for Equitable Access to Treatment for Long COVID (TREAT Long COVID) Act along with U.S. Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Tim Kaine (D-VA) as well as U.S. Representatives Ayanna Pressley (D-MA-07), Don Beyer (D-VA-08) and Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) to increase access to medical care and treatment for communities and individuals suffering from long COVID. In March, Duckworth helped introduce the Comprehensive Access to Resources and Education (CARE) for Long COVID Act along with Kaine and Markey to improve research on post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), more commonly referred to as long COVID, as well as provide resources for those experiencing it.-30-"

The resolution recognizes that women are often the targets of deliberate violence during conflicts, which is evident through Russia’s deliberate attacks on maternity wards and the use of rape as a weapon of war. This resolution calls on all countries to provide aid to refugees and support women in Ukraine who are keeping families and children safe, delivering supplies and weapons, administering medical care, fighting as part of the armed forces and more.“Women across Ukraine are on the frontlines defending their homeland, their families and their freedom, and the international community can and should do more to support them,” said Duckworth. “The only thing Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked and inexcusable escalation of this violent invasion is succeeding in is uniting the free world against Russia’s autocratic regime in support of Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty, its people and its right to self-governance. I’m proud to help introduce this bipartisan resolution alongside my colleagues to recognize the brave women of Ukraine’s sacrifices and dedication during Putin’s war of choice.”“Women are on the frontlines helping to hold Ukraine together amid Russia’s unconscionable and unprovoked war. Spearheaded by women in the Senate and across bipartisan lines, this resolution sends a powerful message that we stand with Ukrainian women who are leading the on-the-ground response – from defending territory as fighters to delivering life-saving medical care to administering humanitarian aid and crossing borders to ensure the safety of children and the elderly,” said Shaheen. “The U.S. and international community must continue to address the unique needs of women amid this war and humanitarian crisis, while advocating for women’s participation in conflict resolution talks. This bipartisan resolution reaffirms U.S. support for the women of Ukraine who are putting their lives on the line every day to defend Ukraine’s freedom against the tyranny and brutality of Russia.”The bipartisan resolution is also cosponsored by U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Susan Collins (R-ME), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Tina Smith (D-MN), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Patty Murray (D-WA), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA).Text of the resolution is available here.As a member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), Duckworth has been a strong supporter of Ukraine against Russia’s invasion. Last month, she joined U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Jack Reed (D-RI), Mark Warner (D-VA), Jon Tester (D-MT) and six of her colleagues in introducing the Digital Asset Sanctions Compliance Enhancement Act to ensure that Vladimir Putin and Russian elites can’t use digital assets to undermine the international community’s economic sanctions against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.Earlier in March, Duckworth urged the Biden Administration to accelerate the sale of M1A2 SEPv3 tanks to Poland. The letter also asked the Biden Administration to engage with additional NATO allies to determine if the Russian Federation’s brutal act of war requires the U.S to develop and execute any additional sales to strengthen the military capabilities of other NATO members. She also called on the Biden Administration to grant Temporary Protected Status to Ukrainians in the U.S. following the Russian military invasion.-30-"
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-colleagues-unveil-legislation-to-expand-access-to-treatment-for-those-struggling-with-long-covid," [WASHINGTON, DC] – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), along with U.S. Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Ed Markey (D-MA) as well as U.S. Representatives Ayanna Pressley (D-MA-07), Don Beyer (D-VA-08) and Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), introduced the Targeting Resources for Equitable Access to Treatment for Long COVID (TREAT Long COVID) Act to increase access to medical care and treatment for communities and individuals struggling with long COVID. This first-of-its-kind legislation would fund the expansion of long COVID clinics and empower healthcare providers—including community health centers and local public health departments—to treat long COVID patients in their own communities.“Even if COVID-19 disappeared tomorrow, millions of Americans who contracted this disease—including people of color who continue to bear the brunt of this pandemic—would continue to suffer from long COVID, with symptoms ranging from heart palpitations to brain fog,” said Senator Duckworth. “A holistic approach to treatment is absolutely necessary, particularly for those communities who face the harshest barriers to obtaining healthcare. That’s one of the reasons why, as Democrats continue our work to make sure people have access to tests, vaccines and therapeutics, I’m proud to introduce the TREAT Long COVID Act with Senators Markey and Kaine and Representatives Pressley, Beyer and Rochester. It would help all those living with long COVID gain better access to medical care and treatment options in their communities so we can help save lives and make sure no one is left behind on the road to recovery.”According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people with long COVID may experience a combination of symptoms, ranging from extreme fatigue and cognitive dysfunction or “brain fog,” to muscle pain and gastrointestinal issues, to difficulty breathing, insomnia and heart palpitations. Although there is no official count of people suffering from long COVID, a conservative estimate of only ten percent of documented COVID-19 survivors could mean nearly 8 million people are impacted across the United States. Currently, there is no federal program focused on expanding treatment options for this unique and growing population. The absence of specialized support contributes to patients experiencing greater physical and mental anguish, disruption in employment and education, and reduced quality of life.The TREAT Long COVID Act would expand treatment for long COVID nationwide by:“After talking to Virginians who are living with long COVID and meeting with medical providers across the Commonwealth, it’s clear we must do more to support health facilities that provide needed services for people dealing with the long-term impacts of the virus,” said Senator Kaine. “I’m proud to support the TREAT Long COVID Act to ensure clinics that help people with long COVID have access to critical funding and resources to continue their vital work.”“As we’ve learned, COVID-19 presents itself differently in different patients - some are asymptomatic, and others have serious and even fatal complications. This wide range of health impacts from COVID-19 is also true for patients dealing with Long COVID,” said Senator Markey. “There is no one-size-fits all approach to Long COVID treatment, which is why we must expand access to comprehensive, individualized care. The TREAT Long COVID Act provides funding for multidisciplinary Long COVID clinics, helping ensure patients are at the center of our approach to this illness that impacts so many.”“A just and equitable pandemic recovery must include the millions of people living with Long COVID, a community whose voices and suffering have been ignored for far too long. This pandemic has had prolonged health impacts on our most vulnerable individuals and families—particularly in Black, brown, and historically marginalized communities—and it is long past time we provide accessible treatment for our long haulers who have been living with the physical and mental anguish without adequate care,” said Rep. Pressley. “By helping folks with Long COVID get critical treatment right in their communities, the TREAT Long COVID Act will help save lives and support our long-term recovery from this pandemic. People struggling with Long COVID deserve accessible and affordable medical care and treatment now, and Congress must pass our bill without delay.”""Millions of Americans suffer from Long Covid, and in many cases the symptoms of this disease are more harmful than the initial infection,” said Rep. Beyer. “Our bill would provide crucial funding to support the creation and expansion of Long Covid clinics to provide affected Americans with treatment and care. There is a staggering amount of need for these services, which still are not receiving the level of attention and response from policymakers that they deserve. Our bill would complement recent actions announced by the Biden-Harris Administration to meet that need and help the large and growing number of Americans living with this illness.”“We know that the impacts of COVID can linger long after Americans return to testing negative. Recovery from COVID-19 is posing a new set of challenges for both patients and health care providers,” said Rep. Rochester. “Millions of individuals continue to experience long COVID, and they don’t know where to get help. That’s why I’m proud to join with Reps. Pressley & Beyer to introduce the TREAT Long COVID Act to connect people struggling with long COVID with healthcare services in their own communities.”The copy of the bill text can be found here.The TREAT Long COVID Act is endorsed by the COVID-19 Longhauler Advocacy Project, Body Politic, Patient-Led Research Collaborative, Utah COVID-19 Long Haulers, Access Living, National Health Council, American Physical Therapy Association, Massachusetts ME/CFS & FM Association, American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mbadika, Solve M.E., American Association on Health and Disability and Lakeshore Foundation.Duckworth is dedicated to advancing legislation that would support the millions of Americans who live with the devastating impacts of COVID-19.

https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-durbin-announce-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-infusion-to-create-jobs-improve-illinoiss-transit-systems," [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) today announced how Illinois communities of all sizes will benefit from transit support through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that will enable transit agencies across the state to create good-paying local jobs, modernize and expand services in Illinois by purchasing new buses and railcars, address repair backlogs and transition to new technologies to address the climate crisis. This announcement is a result of U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Transit Administration (FTA) apportioning a total of $853,671,564 apportioned for Illinois in Fiscal Year 2022 grant and formula funding, an increase of 58 percent from before the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was signed.“The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is finally putting our nation on a path to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, improve our transit systems and take critical steps toward tackling the climate crisis while also helping working Americans across the country save time and find good-paying jobs,” Duckworth said. “I’m proud that Illinoisans are already seeing the benefits of this deal Senator Durbin and I helped negotiate and pass, which will help working families all across our state have better, safer and more accessible public transportation.”“This historic infusion of federal infrastructure funding will benefit every corner of our state, in communities both large and small,” Durbin said. “By expanding and improving public transit, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will reduce pollution, create jobs, and better connect Illinoisans. That’s why Senator Duckworth and I worked to pass this legislation and will continue our strong support of Illinois’ transit systems.”Supported by Duckworth and Durbin and signed into law last year, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is already helping improve the lives of working Americans by making drinking water safer, reducing traffic congestion, allowing infrastructure projects to implement local hiring initiatives and protecting roadside responders, among many other benefits for workers. The law will help Illinois and Illinois communities improve roads, bridges, highways, public transit, airports and more throughout the state to allow for more good-paying jobs, better accessibility and needed investments. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will also help ensure Americans with disabilities can access rail transit, giving them more independence and access to employment by establishing a discretionary grant program for legacy rail fixed guideway public transportation systems, thanks to provisions based off of Duckworth’s All Stations Accessibility Program (ASAP) Act.-30-"

Late last month, Duckworth met with Judge Jackson and photos from that meeting are available here and b-roll footage is available here.“Judge Jackson made history today as one of the most qualified and impressive individuals ever confirmed to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. Her extensive background and wealth of experience, including her time as a federal public defender, will help inform her work and provide her an important perspective that has been ignored for far too long in this country.“With impressive grace and resilience in the face of profound and offensive mischaracterizations of her record over the last few weeks, she proved she has exactly the kind of temperament our nation deserves.“I wish her well as she ascends to the highest court in the nation, on a strong bipartisan vote, and am proud of what she's already accomplished.”-30-"
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/epa-administrator-duckworth-sponsored-bill-would-help-bring-down-gas-prices-for-working-families," [WASHINGTON, DC] – At today’s U.S. Senate Environment & Public Works Committee hearing examining the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) FY2023 budget request, EPA Administrator Michael Regan confirmed that legislation cosponsored by U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) to make E15 fuels available year-round would help bring down gas prices at the pump for working families. Video of Duckworth and Regan’s conversation at today’s hearing is available here.“I do believe E15 can provide a less expensive option based on the data we’ve seen,” Administrator Regan replied to a question from Duckworth. “I also can say that we are evaluating what options we might have at EPA to look at utilizing E15 at a level that would be helpful to the American people and to help alleviate some of the pain that we’ve seen since Russia launched its war against Ukraine.”During the Senator’s conversation with Administrator Regan this morning, Duckworth also asked whether her bipartisan Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act (DWWIA), which became law as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in November, will help disadvantaged and underserved communities address their water infrastructure crises. One of these communities, Cahokia Heights in Illinois, has for years been plagued by dilapidated wastewater infrastructure that causes raw sewage to seep into residents’ yards whenever there’s a heavy rain, yet prior to DWWIA becoming law, there were almost no viable EPA grant opportunities available to help the community alleviate these issues.“A unique aspect of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is… the opportunity for communities who have never had a seat at the table to actually compete for these resources because they are forgivable loans or they don’t require significant matches,” replied Administrator Regan. “What we’re doing to increase their competitiveness is providing unprecedented for technical assistance so that many of these disadvantaged communities can put forward competitive proposals to finally receive the resources that they need. So what I would say is we’re grateful for the construct of [Duckworth’s DWWIA law included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law]… We want to deploy technical assistance for communities like Cahokia Heights or some of the other cities across the country.”Duckworth’s bipartisan DWWIA would also help rebuild our nation’s crumbling and dangerous water infrastructure by providing additional resources to get lead out of our nation’s drinking water. As a result of her leadership, Illinois—which contains the most known lead service lines of any state in the nation—will be able to dramatically accelerate projects to remove dangerous lead pipes and protect countless children against permanent, irreversible brain damage from drinking lead-contaminated water.-30-"
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-leads-hearing-on-her-bipartisan-laws-impact-on-removing-lead-from-drinking-water-improving-wastewater-infrastructure," [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Chair of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Fisheries, Water and Wildlife, today led a hearing on the implementation of her Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act (DWWIA), highlighting the critical importance of water infrastructure improvements for communities in Illinois and across the country. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes Duckworth’s entire DWWIA, which would help rebuild our nation’s crumbling and dangerous water infrastructure. Witnesses for today’s hearing included Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka, who highlighted how the city replaced its lead service lines and shared how other municipalities can implement these changes with assistance from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Video from today’s hearing is available here and photos are available here.“While this bill is an incredible effort toward clean water for all, our jobs are not done,” Duckworth said. “Now we must do the work to ensure that these programmatic changes are carried out and that these critical funds get to the communities that need it the most. There has been a historic lack of investment in water infrastructure but especially for disadvantaged, small, rural and tribal communities that each have individual challenges when it comes to water infrastructure. Our lack of attention to these communities is not acceptable. We must break down barriers for funding to ensure every American has access to clean water, no matter their zip code, the color of their skin or the size of their wallet.”Duckworth also highlighted how communities like Cahokia Heights in Illinois inspired and informed DWWIA and its inclusion in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Provisions from the law are specifically designed to help small and historically disadvantaged communities access the federal support they need.“In Illinois, the community of Cahokia Heights has been experiencing horrifying sewer overflow issues for years and is in urgent need of repairs, including replacing sewer pipes, pumps and lift stations and drainage systems,” Duckworth said. “But communities like this will likely never qualify for traditional loans or be able to provide a large cost-share and there are almost no other options for them. How are struggling communities ever expected to prosper economically if they do not even have functioning drinking water and wastewater infrastructure?”Along with Baraka, Duckworth and the Subcommittee heard from National Association of Clean Water Agencies Board Member Joshua Schimmel, Earth and Water Law Partner Susan Bodine and Wyoming Association of Rural Water Systems Executive Director Mark Pepper.Duckworth’s DWWIA will help Illinois—which contains the most known lead service lines of any state in the nation—be able to dramatically accelerate projects to remove dangerous lead pipes and protect countless children against permanent, irreversible brain damage from drinking lead-contaminated water. Full funding for DWWIA was included in President Biden’s FY23 budget, which was announced last month. Before its inclusion in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, last year Duckworth successfully shepherded passage of DWWIA in the Senate by a vote of 89 to 2. Duckworth is also the co-founder of the U.S. Senate Environmental Justice Caucus."
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-tillis-and-underwood-lead-bipartisan-call-to-fema-for-updated-guidance-for-nursing-moms-amid-disasters," [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and U.S. Representative Lauren Underwood (D-IL-14) along with U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Jon Ossoff (D-GA) and U.S. Representative John Katko (R-NY-24) are calling on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to ensure individuals who breastfeed have the support and access to lactation equipment they need after natural disasters. In a letter to FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, the Members are requesting FEMA update its Individual Assistance Program Policy Guide (IAPPG) for calendar year 2023 to include clear guidance on supporting access to lactation equipment to ensure all parents and infants are supported in a time of crisis.“U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommends infants be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life and continue breastfeeding, as part of a comprehensive diet with solid foods, until the age of one,” the Members wrote. “Despite these benefits, roadblocks remain and continue to deter lactating parents from acquiring the support and supplies necessary to sustain their child with an adequate supply of breast milk after disasters. Without clear and accessible information from FEMA, families can be left struggling to access replacement lactation supplies and services.”While FEMA specifically cites infant formula as eligible for assistance in its guidance materials, neither the IAPPG nor FEMA’s website provides any explicit information on how nursing families can receive financial assistance for securing a new breast pump or other necessary equipment. A lack of clear guidelines can cause confusion for disaster coordinators, survivors and volunteers on the ground in the midst of crisis.This call builds upon the Delivering Essentials to Mothers Amid Natural Disasters (DEMAND) Act, legislation the Members introduced earlier this year.Full text of the letter is available here and below.Dear Administrator Criswell,We write to request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) include clear guidance on supporting access to lactation equipment and breastfeeding support services as part of its efforts to update the Individual Assistance Program and Policy Guide (IAPPG) for calendar year 2023.When families are impacted by disaster, a lost or damaged breast pump can leave parents scrambling to feed their babies. In addition, if a lactating individual cannot pump, they may be predisposed to develop mastitis, infection and abscess, which can require hospitalization and antibiotics.In staff-level conversations, FEMA officials advised that impacted individuals may be able to secure assistance for lactation equipment through the Other Needs Assistance program. Yet, disaster survivors face inconsistent or incomplete information on how to access critical support they may be eligible for to replace their breast pumps and other necessary lactation supplies.While FEMA specifically cites infant formula as eligible for assistance in its guidance materials, neither the IAPPG nor FEMA’s website provides any explicit information on how nursing families can receive financial assistance for securing a new breast pump or other necessary equipment. As anecdotal reports indicate, the lack of clear guidelines can cause confusion for disaster coordinators, survivors and volunteers on the ground in the midst of crisis.The importance of breastfeeding and its impact on the healthy development of our next generation cannot be overstated. Breastfeeding is a key strategy to improve our Nation’s public health and has many known health benefits for both the lactating parent and child. As such, the U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommends infants be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life and continue breastfeeding, as part of a comprehensive diet with solid foods, until the age of one.Despite these benefits, roadblocks remain and continue to deter lactating parents from acquiring the support and supplies necessary to sustain their child with an adequate supply of breast milk after disasters. Without clear and accessible information from FEMA, families can be left struggling to access replacement lactation supplies and services.In times of disaster and crisis, families and children deserve access to comprehensive and clear guidance for Federal assistance. That is why we have introduced the bipartisan and bicameral Delivering Essentials to Mothers Amid Natural Disasters (DEMAND) Act, which codifies breastfeeding support into FEMA’s existing Individual Assistance programs. Living through a natural disaster or public health crisis can on its own cause serious stress and trauma—wondering how to feed your child should not be an additional worry.We must ensure that our disaster relief efforts provide comprehensive support to all parents and infants. Therefore, we request that, as part of its effort to update the IAPPG, FEMA produce new public-facing materials to educate nursing parents on their options and how to navigate financial assistance from the agency for breast pumps and other necessary equipment. This should include updated materials and training on any new guidance related to nursing support for disaster relief coordinators, public health workers and other personnel leading FEMA’s on-the-ground response.Additionally, we request that FEMA develop targeted informational resources for relevant disaster response partners detailing how impacted individuals can access financial support for nursing equipment, such as State emergency management agencies and non-profit organizational partners. As it develops these resources, we find that it may be wise for FEMA to also discuss with its State and local partners how power outages may impact an individuals’ ability and/or medical need to use breastfeeding equipment and store breast milk once expressed. If FEMA needs additional resources or support to develop these materials, please do not hesitate to let us know.Thank you for your immediate attention to this request. We look forward to working with you to ensure that all parents who choose to breastfeed have access to FEMA support.-30-"

But it is also about raising awareness of the discrimination and violence they still face today. While we have made significant progress over the years—thanks to the bravery of many transgender leaders—the work for full equality, acceptance, and civil rights protections continues,” said Schatz.Along with Duckworth and Schatz, the resolution is co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Ed Markey (D-MA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Mazie K.

I hope Congress also uses this moment to pass my bill to finally make gas price gouging a federal crime and the bill I’m cosponsoring to produce less expensive fuel choices like E15 for American families year-round to further help ease the increase in prices caused by Russia’s war of choice while decreasing our dependence on foreign oil.”Earlier this month, Duckworth introduced legislation to help prevent the oil industry from engaging in gasoline price gouging during periods of crisis, helping protect Americans from unnecessary price increases.-30-"

While most forms of debt can be discharged through the bankruptcy process, student loan debt is currently treated as non-dischargeable except in extremely rare cases of “undue hardship.” The term “undue hardship” has been interpreted by courts to establish high hurdles for borrowers to meet—a challenge made even more difficult by federal agency policies that encourage aggressive challenges in bankruptcy court when student borrowers bring undue hardship claims.In today’s letter, the Senators called on Secretary Cardona to follow through on his public statement that the Department of Education would change the Department’s approach to “undue hardship” claims to make it a more attainable option for discharging student debt in bankruptcy. The Senators also called on the Department of Education to promptly release a long-awaited update to guidance it issued in 2015 on handling undue hardship claims, and asked if the Justice Department has issued guidance to its attorneys to carry out the Department of Education’s directive to pause active bankruptcy litigation while the policy changes are implemented.“While a bipartisan effort is underway in Congress to reform the bankruptcy code’s treatment of student loans, changes to administrative policies related to undue hardship are also necessary and long overdue… Will ED promptly issue an update to its 2015 guidance on undue hardship adversary proceedings to make it simpler and fairer for borrowers who have demonstrated legitimate hardships to receive a discharge?” the Senators pressed.The Senators also questioned DOJ on what steps had been taken to inform student borrowers currently in the midst of bankruptcy proceedings that they could pause their litigation so as to benefit from policy changes the Department of Education implements around “undue hardship.”“Secretary Cardona also revealed that ED has asked DOJ to pause any active bankruptcy litigation if the student borrower wishes, in order to ‘ensure that every borrower can benefit from these changes.’   Has DOJ issued guidance to its attorneys handling active bankruptcy cases consistent with ED’s request that stays be available to borrowers?  What public outreach has ED or DOJ done to ensure that borrowers and their legal representatives are aware of the option for a stay?” the Senators asked.“We look forward to working with ED and DOJ to promptly implement the goals articulated by Secretary Cardona and to help bring clarity, fairness, and cost-effectiveness to the federal government’s approach on undue hardship claims,” the Senators concluded.In addition to Duckworth, Durbin, Schumer, and Murray, U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Sherrod

King (I-ME), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) signed the letter.Full text of the letter is available here and below:March 31, 2022Dear Secretary Cardona and Attorney General Garland:            We write to request an update on efforts by the Department of Education (ED) and Department of Justice (DOJ) to change how the agencies handle undue hardship claims by student borrowers in bankruptcy proceedings. Over the past several decades, Congress and the courts have together nearly eliminated bankruptcy as a viable path towards financial recovery for most Americans struggling with student loan debt.  The undue hardship exception (11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8)) currently serves as the only option in the bankruptcy code for discharge of student loans, and that exception has been narrowly construed by most courts.  The federal government’s aggressive litigation challenges against students who pursue undue hardship claims further exacerbates this situation. Last month, in In re Wolfson, ED withdrew its appeal of a bankruptcy court decision to discharge nearly $100,000 of student loan debt held by an individual with a serious disability.[1]  We are pleased that ED changed course in the Wolfson case and decided not to spend taxpayer dollars attempting to force this individual to continue shouldering crushing debt.  Unfortunately, this case has been an exception to the standard practice.  All too often, ED and DOJ oppose undue hardship discharges in adversarial bankruptcy proceedings, requiring debtors to effectively demonstrate a certainty of hopelessness before they can obtain relief.[2]  Clearing this statutorily unnecessary high bar is challenging enough for individuals who are represented by experienced attorneys.  It is virtually impossible for those without representation.While a bipartisan effort is underway in Congress to reform the bankruptcy code’s treatment of student loans, changes to administrative policies related to undue hardship are also necessary and long overdue.  We appreciate the public acknowledgement of this problem by members of this Administration, and we were encouraged specifically to see Secretary Cardona’s March 9 announcement that ED is “working to change [its] policies so that bankruptcy is an option for those struggling with student debt.”[3]  As ED works to make those policy changes, we ask you to answer the following questions:We look forward to working with ED and DOJ to promptly implement the goals articulated by Secretary Cardona and to help bring clarity, fairness, and cost-effectiveness to the federal government’s approach on undue hardship claims.  Thank you for your attention to this matter, and we look forward to your prompt response.  Thank you.Sincerely,-30-"
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-speaks-with-illinois-corn-growers-highlights-benefits-of-bipartisan-infrastructure-law," [WASHINGTON, DC] – U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) today met with Illinois Corn Growers Association members and leadership to discuss how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law can support our nation’s corn growers and rural communities in Illinois. During the video call, Duckworth also discussed with the group how protecting our state’s waterways and incentivizing agricultural production for renewable fuels can help grow Illinois’s agriculture industry.“America has always depended on our nation’s farmers and ranchers to grow the food and fuel we need, and I’m proud that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is such a significant boost for them,” Duckworth said. “The work of Illinois’s corn farmers is so important to the strength of our state and our nation, and I look forward to continuing my efforts to support farmers throughout the state to help make sure they have the resources and information they need.”The Duckworth-championed Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help support Illinois’s agriculture sector by providing major support to the state’s waterway infrastructure. In January, Duckworth helped announce that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) allocated $829.1 million in funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for the Navigation and Ecosystem Sustainability Program (NESP) on the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS). This ecosystem restoration and navigation improvement project will update two Lock & Dams and build another which will make it easier for farmers with agricultural products to navigate the waterwayDuckworth is also an advocate for American biofuels and helped introduce the Home Front Energy Independence Act earlier this month. The bill would incentivize and expand the use and production of biofuel that’s grown in America, while making a less expensive fuel option available to the nation’s farmers and families.-30-"
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-capito-introduce-bipartisan-resolution-designating-march-as-national-endometriosis-awareness-month," [WASHINGTON, DC] – U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) today introduced a resolution recognizing the significance of endometriosis as an unmet chronic disease for women and designating March 2022 as National Endometriosis Awareness Month. This resolution would also encourage the U.S. Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Defense and Veterans Affairs to provide information on endometriosis to women, patients and providers and to improve screening tools and treatment options.“Even though one out of every ten women of reproductive age in America suffers from endometriosis—which can be extremely painful and lead to infertility—too often this disease doesn’t receive adequate attention and funding,” Duckworth said. “I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan resolution with Senator Capito to raise awareness for this debilitating disease and recognize the resilient women affected by it.”“It’s important for women living with endometriosis to talk about and seek treatment for their condition,” Capito said. “With this resolution, I’m proud to join Senator Duckworth in bringing more awareness and attention to endometriosis on behalf of the millions of women affected by it.”Endometriosis is one of the most common gynecological diseases, affecting 6.5 million Americans. Women can suffer up to a decade before being properly diagnosed.The resolution is also co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Cory Booker (D-NJ). The resolution is supported by American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; Endometriosis Foundation; Society for Women’s Health Research and Women First Research Coalition.Duckworth has made protecting and expanding access to essential women’s healthcare a top priority as a Senator. Last year, President Biden signed Duckworth’s bipartisan Protecting Moms Who Served Act into law to help address the maternal mortality crisis among women Veterans by improving care at VA facilities and shedding light on the scope of this crisis, particularly among women of color. Duckworth also worked with U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) to secure a provision in the American Rescue Plan that gives states a five-year option to extend healthcare coverage for new moms on Medicaid from 60 days after pregnancy to a full year. The provision was based off of legislation that Duckworth, Durbin and U.S. Representative Robin Kelly (D-IL-02) re-introduced last year that seeks to reduce America’s rising maternal and infant mortality rate. Additionally, Duckworth introduced the Support Through Loss Act last year to raise awareness about pregnancy loss and establish new paid leave benefits for workers experiencing painful challenges while seeking to grow their family.-30-"

During this morning’s meeting, Duckworth and the group discussed the importance of Americans supporting Ukraine and Ukrainian Americans, as well as her legislative efforts to help empower Ukrainians as they fight for their survival. Along with Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, Illinois Division officials, Duckworth was joined in the meeting by the Consul General of Ukraine in Chicago Serhiy Koledov and representatives from several local community organizations. Photos from today’s event are available here.“I’m thankful for this opportunity to meet with so many leaders of the vibrant and resilient Ukrainian-American community in Illinois,” Duckworth said. “Our country and the world remain in awe of the bravery of the Ukrainian people who are so effectively defending their homeland and their freedom and are continuing to repel Putin’s forces against overwhelming odds. I am dedicated to supporting Ukraine and ensuring we continue leading the free world in isolating and punishing Russia for starting this war and ensuring we supply Ukraine with the resources and weapons they need to be able to beat back Putin’s violent invasion.”As a member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), Duckworth has been a strong supporter of Ukraine against Russia’s invasion. Last week, she joined U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Jack Reed (D-RI), Mark Warner (D-VA), Jon Tester (D-MT) and six of her colleagues in introducing the Digital Asset Sanctions Compliance Enhancement Act to ensure that Vladimir Putin and Russian elites can’t use digital assets to undermine the international community’s economic sanctions against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.Earlier this month, Duckworth urged the Biden Administration to accelerate the sale of M1A2 SEPv3 tanks to Poland. The letter also asked the Biden Administration to engage with additional NATO allies to determine if the Russian Federation’s brutal act of war requires the U.S to develop and execute any additional sales to strengthen the military capabilities of other NATO members. She also called on the Biden Administration to grant Temporary Protected Status to Ukrainians in the U.S. following the Russian military invasion and brought Adjutant General of Illinois and Commander of the Illinois National Guard Major General Rich Neely as her virtual guest to the State of the Union Address, who is responsible for the critical role the ILNG plays in helping train troops in places like Ukraine and Poland.-30-"

Duckworth met with Village of Burr Ridge officials including Mayor Gary Grasso, , Village Trustee Pro Tem and Stormwater Committee Chair Guy Franzese, Trustee Anita Mital, Village Administrator Evan Walter and others to learn more about a planned culvert repair project to improve drainage to avert flooding along Elm Street and Elm Elementary School. Photos from today’s meeting are available here.“With the American Rescue Plan—thanks to Democrats and President Biden—we were able to provide necessary resources for our hardest-hit small businesses, help our schools safely re-open and boost support for local municipalities in every corner of our state,” said Duckworth. “And while not a single Republican voted for this bill, every American is benefitting from it as its impacts are felt in so many aspects of our daily lives, like here in Burr Ridge where residents will see much-needed relief from stormwater flooding. I was proud to support the American Rescue Plan one year ago, and I’m going to keep working for policies that help our small businesses, support our working families, and allow our economy to thrive.”“The need for sustainable infrastructure improvements is greater than ever. With the financial support for these projects provided through the American Rescue Plan Act, meeting this need is now within reach for communities like Burr Ridge,” said Walter. “When federal, state, county and local levels of government work together and produce successes like the Elm Street Culvert project, we can create the necessary change today for a better tomorrow for all of us. We are grateful for Senator Duckworth’s vision regarding sustainable infrastructure and support for communities such as Burr Ridge.”Duckworth proudly supported the American Rescue Plan, which was signed into law by President Biden last March. The ARP put money into the pockets of working families and continues to support hard-hit small businesses, help schools stay open safely, provide local municipalities with necessary resources and improve testing and vaccine distribution programs.-30-"

This legislation, which Duckworth introduced with U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Mike Braun (R-IN), would establish a new commemorative work in Washington, D.C., to honor the contributions of the estimated 18 million women who helped keep our nation’s economy and society running during World War II. Duckworth served in the Reserve Forces for 23 years and is Chair of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) Airland Subcommittee.In part, Duckworth wrote in a letter to Chairman of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Joe Manchin (D-WV) today: “These women—many of whom had no expectation of working outside the home—answered the call during a global crisis to work as pilots, engineers, taxi drivers, letter carriers, code breakers, manufacturers and more. It is time that we recognize the decisive roles that they played during World War II and give honor to their service where it is long overdue.”In conclusion, Duckworth wrote: “Chairman Manchin, as Women’s History Month draws to a close, I urge you and your colleagues on the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to swiftly move S. 1814 through committee consideration.”The Women Who Worked on the Home Front World War II Memorial Act would also recognize the important role these women played in expanding economic opportunity for future generations of women. Between 1941 and 1945, the female portion of the U.S. workforce increased from 27 percent to nearly 37 percent. U.S. Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC-01) sponsored bipartisan companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. Full text of the letter is available here and below: Dear Chairman Manchin: I write this Women’s History Month to draw your attention to a fitting bill referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources: S.1814, the Women Who Worked on the Home Front World War II Memorial Act, which I re-introduced on May 25, 2021. This bipartisan bill is cosponsored by Senators Blackburn (R-TN), Braun (R-IN) and Feinstein (D-CA) and would authorize the Women Who Worked on the Home Front Foundation to establish a new commemorative work here in Washington, D.C., to honor the nearly 18 million women who supported our country’s economy and society through their contributions to war efforts during World War II. Companion legislation was passed by the House of Representatives on December 8, 2021, with a decisive final vote tally of 425-1.  These women—many of whom had no expectation of working outside the home—answered the call during a global crisis to work as pilots, engineers, taxi drivers, letter carriers, code breakers, manufacturers and more. It is time that we recognize the decisive roles that they played during World War II and give honor to their service where it is long overdue. We should also acknowledge the groundbreaking path laid by these women for generations to follow, as this marked a pivotal point in history for women in the workforce.  Chairman Manchin, as Women’s History Month draws to a close, I urge you and your colleagues on the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to swiftly move S. 1814 through committee consideration. It would be a great honor to women across our country to see this bill advance. There is not a more appropriate time than now to codify the authorization to create a commemorative work in honor of these brave women. Let our 117th Congress be the first to make permanent and visible the legacy of their strength and resilience.

https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-durbin-highlight-support-for-water-infrastructure-improvements-in-underserved-suburban-communities," [CHICAGO, IL] – U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) today met with Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRD) and local officials to highlight the recent federal support for MWRD’s Forging Resilient Communities Project. Duckworth and Durbin were joined by MWRD President Kari K. Steele, MWRD Executive Director Brian Perkovich and Harvey Mayor Christopher Clark to discuss this project, which will receive funding secured by Duckworth and Durbin through the Congressionally Directed Spending (CDS) process and included in the Fiscal Year 2022 omnibus appropriations bill, which was signed into law earlier this month. Photos from today’s event are available here.“Chronic flooding and contamination issues from sewer overflow have plagued towns like Stone Park, Harvey, Riverdale and Dolton for far too long,” Duckworth said. But thanks to forward thinking from MWRD and our support at the federal level, we’re able to help create a future where sewage flooding, contamination and water pollution aren’t the norm. I was proud to support this MWRD-led project to help improve water infrastructure with Senator Durbin, and I’m pleased we were able to secure it in this year’s omnibus package. I look forward to seeing these repairs and upgrades completed and seeing the impact this critical federal support has on our communities that need it most.”“Senator Duckworth and I were able to secure the $1.5 million in much-needed federal funding through the return of Congressionally Directed Spending, or earmarks, to appropriations bills,” Durbin said. “With the help of this earmark, MWRD is establishing a new program focused on increasing flood resiliency in historically underserved communities in our region. Rain in these communities too often leads to flooded homes and environmental contamination from sewer system overflows. The federal funding we announced today will help these communities finally solve these issues by assessing the condition of their aging sewer systems, finding problem areas, and fixing them.”“We thank Senator Duckworth and Senator Durbin for their valuable leadership and collaboration in securing $1.5 million in funding that will support four historically underserved communities challenged by infiltration and inflow into sanitary sewer systems,” said Steele. “This project exemplifies how federal funding can be leveraged to provide multiple benefits and combines many of our initiatives in managing stormwater, treating wastewater and protecting the quality of our area waterways, while also protecting vulnerable communities deserving of our help.”MWRD’s Forging Resilient Communities project will help reducing flooding of homes and contamination of the environment from sanitary sewer overflows in four disproportionately impacted municipalities: Stone Park, Harvey, Riverdale and Dolton. This will include a condition assessment of the most at-risk portion of each community sanitary sewer system, rehabilitation work to address the infiltration and overflow sources detected and planting trees in strategic locations to help reduce the impact of storm water runoff on the sewer system and environment. Duckworth and Durbin supported this project through CDS project, successfully securing $1.5 million in the FY2022 omnibus.As the Chair of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Subcommittee on Fisheries, Water and Wildlife, Duckworth has been a strong supporter of improving our nation’s water infrastructure, especially in historically disadvantaged communities. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes Duckworth’s entire Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act (DWWIA), which would help rebuild our nation’s crumbling and dangerous water infrastructure. As a result of her leadership, Illinois—which contains the most known lead service lines of any state in the nation—will be able to dramatically accelerate projects to remove dangerous lead pipes and protect countless children against permanent, irreversible brain damage from drinking lead-contaminated water.

The legislation would also establish a working group consisting of representatives from EPA regional offices, air agencies, environmental justice networks, data science, and public health science to develop templates for integrated monitoring systems. In addition, it would direct the EPA and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct an inventory of the locations and operation statuses of air monitors, existing data infrastructure, high-priority areas for monitoring deployment in environmental justice communities, and workforce needs to improve air quality management across scales.“Communities of color and working families face public health challenges like exposure to air pollutants at alarming rates while too many in power look the other way,” Duckworth said. “I’m glad to join my colleagues on the Technology Assessment for Air Quality Management Act to help ensure that every American is able to breathe safer air regardless of their zip code, the size of their wallet or the color of their skin.”“Our communities deserve clean air and a serious, coordinated effort to address the air pollution negatively impacting their environment. This is an issue of public health,” said Durbin. “As technologies are produced to better monitor and resolve air pollutants, we should institute this infrastructure in communities of need. I’m proud to support the Technology Assessment for Quality Management Act to offer new, more advanced tools to improve our state’s air quality.”A copy of the bill text can be found HERE."

The Bear Poaching Elimination Act would help keep these animals safe by making it harder for animal abusers to profit from their brutality,” said Kennedy.In Asia, thousands of bears suffer in small cages so abusers can extract their bile for use in cosmetics and medicine. In the U.S., poachers kill American bears to harvest their viscera.

The request comes after an EF-3 tornado struck an Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, Illinois, resulting in devastating destruction and the death of six people inside the building.In their letter, the lawmakers spoke in support of a recently-opened Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) investigation into the warehouse collapse and further called on Amazon to prioritize the health and safety of its workforce.“Unfortunately, severe weather events like the December 10th tornadoes may only increase as climate change makes the world’s weather patterns more volatile and destructive.  Determining the causes of this tragedy will be critical to developing improved safety standards as we confront this reality and work to prevent future loss of life.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration announced it has opened an investigation into the collapse of the warehouse in Edwardsville.  We believe this is a welcome and necessary action,” wrote the lawmakers.“We also urge you to develop and implement a stronger emergency action plan at Amazon warehouses.  This may include actions to ensure employees are receiving emergency information as quickly and accurately as possible; clear evacuation and shelter-in-place procedures and training to ensure employees understand those procedures; and an accurate accounting of how many employees, including independent contractors, are present at Amazon facilities at any given time,” the lawmakers continued.Full text of the letter is available here and below:December 22, 2021Dear Mr. Jassy:            We are writing regarding the EF-3 tornado that caused the collapse of an Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, IL, on December 10, 2021.  While we are thankful that 45 employees were rescued from the collapsed building, we were devastated to learn that the tornado resulted in six fatalities and left one person in critical condition.  In the wake of this tragedy, we urge Amazon to evaluate further steps that can be taken to keep employees and independent contractors safe.             There have been concerning reports that some workers in Edwardsville and at other Amazon facilities have not participated in emergency drills or were not aware of Amazon’s safety procedures in the event of a tornado.  Additionally, reports indicate that not all workers in the facility sheltered in the designated ‘safe space’ on the north side of the warehouse, despite a tornado warning being issued 11 minutes before the tornado carrying 155 mile per hour winds struck the facility.We’re grateful that fire and rescue crews from at least 20 nearby communities responded quickly after the warehouse in Edwardsville was destroyed.  However, their heroic efforts were made more difficult because emergency crews reportedly did not know exactly how many workers were in the facility, which may have been due to Amazon’s use of independent contractors.            Unfortunately, severe weather events like the December 10th tornadoes may only increase as climate change makes the world’s weather patterns more volatile and destructive.  Determining the causes of this tragedy will be critical to developing improved safety standards as we confront this reality and work to prevent future loss of life.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration announced it has opened an investigation into the collapse of the warehouse in Edwardsville.  We believe this is a welcome and necessary action. We also urge you to develop and implement a stronger emergency action plan at Amazon warehouses.  This may include actions to ensure employees are receiving emergency information as quickly and accurately as possible; clear evacuation and shelter-in-place procedures and training to ensure employees understand those procedures; and an accurate accounting of how many employees, including independent contractors, are present at Amazon facilities at any given time.             We continue to mourn for those in Illinois and nearby states whose lives were lost and homes were destroyed as a result of this severe weather.  Amazon must prioritize the health and safety of its workforce in Illinois and around the country.  Thank you for your attention to this important matter.Sincerely,"

And as the continuing efforts to evacuate Americans and at-risk Afghans has shifted to the U.S. Department of State, DoD has shifted its role in the resettlement effort to providing housing, medical care and an initial home base for Afghan evacuees who are making their first point of contact in the U.S. at our military installations.Now that these Afghan evacuees are safely arrived in the U.S., we must make sure we welcome them into our country by swiftly seeing to their immediate needs. Your Department continues to play a critical role in our whole of government response by providing critical care and lodging for these Afghans who are freshly arrived in the U.S. after enormous upheaval to their lives in Afghanistan, and I am eager to work to guarantee that folks are processed efficiently and safely.Concerningly, I have heard anecdotal reports of strain to the system at some of these DoD locations that are now tasked with providing initial care, including issues accessing medical and dental care and sufficient access to culturally sensitive resources. Many members of the local community, including Veterans and even communities states away, stand ready and willing to donate their time, resources and expertise to help lighten the load and make sure these Afghans have what they need to start fresh in the United States.Therefore, I request that you provide my staff with a briefing on the conditions across the DoD locations currently housing Afghan evacuees, to include further details on installations’ capacity to provide medical and dental care, culturally sensitive resources and effectively distribute additional supplies to all these Afghans. I also invite you to communicate to me any additional measures of support that Congress may be able to provide, whether through funding, provision of other resources or making connections with community members who stand ready to provide any help they can.Thank you for your continued dedication to this matter and for your willingness to work with me so that we can do what is necessary to welcome these Afghan evacuees and provide them the care and resources they need.Sincerely,Tammy DuckworthUnited States Senator-30-"
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-joins-booker-eight-democratic-colleagues-in-calling-on-us-department-of-education-to-suspend-wage-garnishment-of-student-loan-borrowers," [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) joined U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) and eight of their U.S. Senate Democratic colleagues in urging the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) to suspend administrative wage garnishment of student loan borrowers. The letter comes nearly a month before student loan and interest payments are set to resume on January 31, 2022.“Currently, over 9 million borrowers are in default on more than $180 billion in federal student loan debt,” wrote the lawmakers to USDOE Secretary Miguel Cardona. “A disproportionate number of these borrowers are people of color, first-generation college students, veterans, parents, people with disabilities, and students who will not complete college. Even before the devastating COVID-19 pandemic, these borrowers in default were subject to aggressive collection measures, some of which only the federal government can utilize to collect on student loans.”The lawmakers continued by highlighting that the USDOE’s “current intention to resume these collection efforts in a couple of months, as cash-strapped borrowers struggle to recover from a still-ongoing pandemic, will likely result in significant financial harm.” As such, they asked the Department “to automatically remove eligible borrowers from default status” and “to suspend administrative wage garnishment and other forced collections until of the end of the COVID-19 national public health emergency.”Furthermore, the lawmakers urged the USDOE “to conduct an analysis of the disparate effects of these practices on Black, Latino and Indigenous people with student debt as part of any comprehensive review of the student loan debt collection system.”The lawmakers concluded that reforming the harmful wage garnishment process “would play a critical role in our nation’s recovery efforts and would protect the most financially vulnerable student loan borrowers.” Along with Duckworth and Booker, the letter was co-signed by U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Bob Casey (D-PA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Rev. Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Ron Wyden (D-OR). Full text of the letter can be found here and below. December 20, 2021The Honorable Miguel CardonaSecretary of EducationU.S. Department of Education400 Maryland Avenue, S.W.Washington, D.C. 20202 Dear Secretary Cardona:We write today to urge the Department of Education (“the Department”) to suspend administrative wage garnishment of student loan borrowers in default to the maximum extent permitted by law.This October, we were pleased to learn that the Department is considering plans to ease some of the burdens that federal student loan debt collection practices place on the most financially vulnerable and economically distressed borrowers in default.1 We also welcome recent reports that the Department has taken steps to terminate its contracts with the private sector collections agencies responsible for aggressively implementing those practices against struggling borrowers at their lowest points.2 While the Department’s efforts to pause garnishment of wages during the COVID-19 pandemic are welcome developments, we are deeply concerned that the delayed implementation of this moratorium paired with the imminent resumption of student loan and interest payments on January 31, 2022, will result in longterm financial harm to borrowers who cannot afford further financial setbacks.3Currently, over 9 million borrowers are in default on more than $180 billion in federal student loan debt.4 A disproportionate number of these borrowers are people of color, first-generation college students, veterans, parents, people with disabilities, and students who will not complete college.5 Even before the devastating COVID-19 pandemic, these borrowers in default were subject to aggressive collection measures, some of which only the federal government can utilize to collect on student loans. 6 In addition to having to pay exorbitant fees, borrowers in default could expect to see their wages, tax refunds, and even Social Security checks confiscated.7 Low-income families that had their Child Tax Credit (CTC) and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) refund checks seized by the federal government were often left in worse situations with limited access to jobs and housing, and fewer resources to cover basic necessities.8During the early months of the pandemic, hundreds of thousands of student loan borrowers who were wrongfully subject to wage garnishment when the Administration failed to fully comply with the CARES Act (P.L 116-136), which paused debt collection on all federally-held student loans, filed lawsuits against Secretary DeVos and won. 9 As a result, over the course of 2020 and 2021, the Department returned hundreds of millions of dollars in unlawfully seized wages to borrowers.10 Although the Department has since come in to compliance with the debt collection freeze, the Department’s initial inability to stop wage garnishment exposed the deep and risky inadequacies of the current debt collection system, which uses a slow and antiquated paper-based system that relies on employers to respond to written requests from the government to terminate wage garnishments.11 Further, the Department still lacks accurate contact information for tens of thousands of borrowers previously subject to wage garnishment.12 Prematurely resuming federal debt collection efforts against these borrowers in 2022 would be disastrous. The Department’s current intention to resume these collection efforts in a couple of months, as cash-strapped borrowers struggle to recover from a still-ongoing pandemic, will likely result in significant financial harm. 13,14As the Biden Administration works to address issues in student lending, we ask the Department to automatically remove eligible borrowers from default status, as many of us have previously called for. 15 Furthermore, we ask that you continue to suspend administrative wage garnishment and other forced collections until of the end of the COVID-19 national public health emergency. Additionally, in order to help protect the millions of vulnerable borrowers who simply cannot afford to begin repayment of America’s massive student loan debt burden, we urge the Department to conduct an analysis of the disparate effects of these practices on Black, Latino and Indigenous people with student debt as part of any comprehensive review of the student loan debt collection system. Upon conclusion of the review, we ask for the Department to establish new safeguards for borrowers that ensure that the Secretary will:? Pay the borrower back what they paid, with interest, if an individual’s wages are improperly garnished;? Verify that all information necessary to implement wage garnishment is accurate with respect to each individual employee subject to garnishment; and? Forgive debts from borrowers who have been in default for years and develop a permanent policy that incorporates the Department’s settlement and compromise authority into their collection practices.Reforming this harmful process would play a critical role in our nation’s recovery efforts and would protect the most financially vulnerable student loan borrowers. We appreciate your prompt attention to our urgent request. Sincerely, -30-"
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-durbin-announce-4-million-for-americas-central-port-in-granite-city," [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) today announced $4.1 million in federal funding to America's Central Port in Granite City, Illinois, one of the largest freight hubs in the Midwest. The funding, awarded by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration, will support improvements to a berth and cargo transfer location at the port’s Granite City Harbor facility.“Support for America’s Central Port means moving our state’s economy in the right direction and improving port infrastructure in the Metro East,” Duckworth said. “This project will enhance regional freight movement and increase freight resiliency, which is critically needed. I’m proud to join Senator Durbin in this announcement, and we’ll keep working together to improve infrastructure in every corner of our state.”“America’s Central Port is integral to the Metro East economy and our nation’s freight transportation network,” Durbin said. “This federal funding will help reduce congestion along the Mississippi River and promote the economic competitiveness of the region. Senator Duckworth and I are proud to support this improvement project and will continue advocating for further investments in our state’s infrastructure.”"
https://www.duckworth.senate.gov//news/press-releases/duckworth-durbin-bipartisan-infrastructure-deals-transportation-provisions-already-delivering-for-illinois," [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) today announced that just weeks after the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal was signed into law, Illinois will be able to make significant improvements to roads and bridges, improving safety and reducing commute times, all while creating good-paying local jobs. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) announced that Illinois will have access to increased resources through its Federal-aid Highway Program to make needed improvements to highway infrastructure, highway safety, congestion mitigation, carbon reduction and more to help working Illinoisans. FHWA will apportion a total of $1,883,531,823 to Illinois for Fiscal Year 2022.“The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal is finally putting our nation on a path to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, fix our roads and bridges and take critical steps towards tackling the climate crisis while also helping working Americans across the country save time and find good-paying jobs,” Duckworth said. “I’m proud that Illinoisans are already beginning to see the benefits of this deal Senator Durbin and I helped negotiate and support, which will help working families all across our state have better, safer and less congested roads and bridges.”“Now that President Biden has signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act into law, the real work rebuilding, expanding, and modernizing our state’s infrastructure can begin,” Durbin said. “Senator Duckworth and I are proud to have worked to pass this legislation, which is providing once-in-a-generation investments in our roads and bridges, public transit, passenger rail, and much more. Illinoisans from Chicago to Cairo will see the tangible impacts of this bill and the jobs it will create.”Last month President Biden signed the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal into law that included several provisions led by Duckworth to help improve the lives of working Americans by making drinking water safer, reducing traffic congestion, allowing infrastructure projects to implement local hiring initiatives, protecting roadside responders and improving transit accessibility, among many other benefits for workers. The law will help Illinois and Illinois communities improve roads, bridges, highways, public transit, airports and more throughout the state to allow for more good-paying jobs, better accessibility and needed investments.-30-"

In their letter, the lawmakers request that the Corps include $1.5 million in the upcoming IIJA Work Plan to complete the General Reevaluation Report needed to expand the project and mitigate the significant impacts of climate change on the Chicago Shoreline.“Over the past two decades, the Army Corps of Engineers has worked closely with the City of Chicago and the Chicago Park District to reconstruct approximately nine miles of Lake Michigan shoreline, protecting critical infrastructure from coastal storm damage.  While the authorized project is nearly complete and is providing substantial benefits, Lake Michigan has experienced record high lake levels over the past several years, and several remaining areas of shoreline have experienced significant erosion, storm damage, and flooding as a result of damaging waves and surge.  The City of Chicago has taken substantial emergency action to reduce additional damage to failed shore protection revetments and potential threats to life safety.  However, the extent of the damage has underscored the critical need for a more comprehensive and long-term solution,” wrote the lawmakers.“Given the extent of coastal damage from recent record lake levels, it is urgent that the Army Corps of Engineers move forward with this reevaluation study to identify long-term solutions needed to protect critical infrastructure along the shoreline.  In order to do so, we request that $1.5 million be included in the upcoming IIJA Army Corps Work Plan to complete a GRR of the Chicago Shoreline Coastal Storm Damage Reduction Project,” the lawmakers continued.Full text of the letter is available here and below:December 20, 2021Dear Assistant Secretary Connor:As you work to allocate the significant increase in Corps funding provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), we urge you to prioritize funding for the Chicago Shoreline Storm Damage Reduction Project by including $1.5 million in the upcoming IIJA Work Plan in order to complete the General Reevaluation Report (GRR) needed to expand the project and mitigate the significant impacts of climate change on the Chicago Shoreline. Over the past two

need for a more comprehensive and long-term solution.Since 2015, the City of Chicago has requested the Army Corps of Engineers complete a GRR to study the authorized project and the conclusions of the original feasibility report in order to assess federal interest in providing additional coastal protection along the shoreline.  The study aims to reevaluate the currently authorized project to include several areas that have recently experienced significant coastal damage, including Juneway Terrace Beach and Park to Osterman Beach, Montrose Beach and Pier, North Avenue to Oak Street Beach, 67th Street at South Shore Drive which includes the La Rabida Children’s Hospital, 71st to 75th Street, and Rainbow Beach, which includes the South Water Purification Plant.Given the extent of coastal damage from recent record lake levels, it is urgent that the Army Corps of Engineers move forward with this reevaluation study to identify long-term solutions needed to protect critical infrastructure along the shoreline.  In order to do so, we request that $1.5 million be included in the upcoming IIJA Army Corps Work Plan to complete a GRR of the Chicago Shoreline Coastal Storm Damage Reduction Project.  The City of Chicago and the Chicago Park District have both already indicated their shared commitment to cost sharing the study, as required by law.Both houses of the United States Congress have expressed their support for advancing the Shoreline Project GRR, most recently in the FY21 Omnibus Appropriations Act and the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2020 that were passed in December 2020.  It is clear that there is a broad acknowledgement that additional efforts to address these serious shoreline issues are necessary.  Additionally, the Biden Administration has indicated its support for this study as evidenced by its inclusion in the President’s FY22 Budget Request.Thank you for your consideration, and we look forward to working closely with you on the execution of this desperately needed study, and continuing our long and productive partnership to address the shoreline.Sincerely,-30-"
