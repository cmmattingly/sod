https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-reintroduces-legislation-to-give-every-american-lifesaving-n95-masks/,"WASHNGTON, Jan. 12 – As the world enters the third year of the coronavirus pandemic, with Omicron surging and cases skyrocketing, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Wednesday, with more than 50 of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate and House, reintroduced lifesaving legislation to manufacture and distribute highly-protective N95 masks to every person in America.Under Sanders’ Masks for All Act – first introduced in 2020 and developed in consultation with health experts including Andy Slavitt, former COVID-19 advisor to President Biden and the former Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services under President Obama – every person in the U.S. would receive a free package of three N95 respirator masks. This includes individuals who are experiencing homelessness or living in group settings such as prisons, shelters, college dorms, and assisted living facilities, as well as all workers in health settings, from administrative and janitorial, to food service, doctors, and nurses.Fifteen senators co-sponsored Sanders’ Masks for All Act including, Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Ed Markey (Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). Reps. Ro Khanna (CA-17), Lori Trahan (MA-03), and Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12) are co-leading the legislation in the House, with more than 30 additional cosponsors.“As we face the rapidly spreading omicron variant, we should remember that not all face masks are created equal,” said Sen. Sanders. “Congress must demand the mass production and distribution of N95 masks, one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of the Covid virus. It is an absolute scandal that in the richest country in the history of the world, high-quality masks are not more readily available to frontline workers, health care workers, and all Americans. We are proposing that we do what our public health experts and scientists say we must do: provide all of our people with high-quality, N95 masks without cost, which could prevent death and suffering and save huge amounts of health care dollars.”“This is a crisis and our response must meet the moment. If we can afford a $778 billion defense budget, we can afford to send N95 masks to every American to keep people safe as Omicron cases spike,” said Rep. Khanna. “The science is clear: while surgical and high-quality reusable face masks have been effective for preventing the spread of past COVID-19 variants, N95 masks provide maximum protection against the Omicron variant and are necessary at this stage of the pandemic. We can save tens of thousands of lives by simply making the equipment people need free and easily accessible. If we’re asking folks to wear a mask, it’s on us to provide one.”“Masks save lives. As we face highly contagious coronavirus variants, it’s absolutely critical that every American has access to high-quality, protective N95 and KN95 masks to keep themselves and their loved ones safe,” said Congresswoman Trahan. “I’m proud to join my colleagues in pushing for this critical, commonsense legislation to ensure all Americans have the best opportunity possible to protect their health.”“We’re facing the most contagious COVID variant yet and everyone needs access to the best protection available,” said Rep. Watson Coleman. “Along with vaccines and testing, N95 masks are one of the best tools we have for curbing the spread of the virus. The Masks for All Act will ensure that all Americans, regardless of income level, have the resources to keep themselves, their families, and their neighbors safe.” This legislation would require the federal government to use all available authorities, including the Defense Production Act, to eliminate shortages of N95 respirator masks and distribute them to the public as soon as possible. The proposal would use the United States Postal Service for distribution and set up pick-up sites at convenient community locations that are already providing essential services, such as Post Offices, pharmacies, schools, public transportation stations, and COVID-19 testing sites. It would also end the U.S. reliance on China and other countries for this essential lifesaving equipment.According to recent reports, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is considering updating its mask guidance to recommend N95 or KN95 masks. When the CDC initially issued mask guidance in 2020, N95 masks were reportedly not recommended for the general public out of concern for shortages for health care workers. Health officials now say there is not a N95 shortage. However, counterfeit masks and general access remain an issue, for the public and in hospitals and health care facilities around the country.Studies have shown that the widespread use of face masks could prevent tens of thousands of COVID-19 deaths, while other studies indicate universal mask wearing could save the U.S. economy $1 trillion. Today, the benefits of widespread N95 use would be even greater. According to recent data, an N95 respirator mask provides the individual wearer with at least 2.5 hours of protection against an unmasked person infected with the Omicron variant, compared to just 20 minutes of protection if they are wearing a cloth mask or 30 minutes if they are wearing a surgical mask.To date, the coronavirus pandemic has infected over 60 million Americans and killed more than 835,000, and just this week the U.S. reported a record-breaking 1.35 million new coronavirus infections in one day – the highest daily total in the world.In addition to Reps. Watson Coleman, Khanna, and Trahan, more than 30 members of Congress sponsored the legislation in the House, including: Jamaal Bowman (NY-16), Cori Bush (MO-01), André Carson (IN-07), Troy A. Carter (LA-02), David Cicilline (RI-01), Yvette Clarke (NY-09), Jim Cooper (TN-05), Jim Costa (CA-16), Danny K.

https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-and-padilla-lead-letter-with-colleagues-to-billionaire-bob-rich-in-support-of-striking-bakery-workers-in-california/,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 – Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) Tuesday, along with their colleagues Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), sent a letter to Bob Rich Jr., Chairman and majority owner of the Rich Products Corporation, to express support for the 100 or so bakery workers on strike against the appropriately named Rich Products Corporation at the Jon Donaire Desserts production plant in Santa Fe Springs, California. On strike for better wages and working conditions since November 3, 2021, about 75% of the employees are Latina women who are often forced into mandatory overtime with little to no notice and sometimes work up to 16 hours a day.The senators urged Chairman Rich to bargain in good faith with the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers, and Grain Millers (BCTGM) union and agree to a fair contract for the striking workers as soon as possible.“Rich Products is not a poor company. It is not going broke,” the senators wrote to Rich. “Last year, your company made over $4 billion in revenue. During the pandemic, you became over $2 billion richer and now have an estimated net worth of more than $7.5 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. We do not believe that it is too much to ask that you treat your workers with the respect and dignity they have earned and deserve.” The striking workers make cakes for Baskin Robbins, Safeway and Cold Stone Creamery, helping to bring in the $4 billion the company made in revenue last year. During the pandemic, Bob Rich, the majority owner of Rich Products, increased his wealth by more than $2 billion. While the workers he employs barely make more than California’s minimum wage, Rich currently has a net worth of more than $7.5 billion. Yet, despite his billions in wealth, the “best and final offer” Rich has put on the table for his workers is a substantial increase in health care premiums and an insulting $1-an-hour wage increase that would not keep pace with inflation. “Mr. Rich: Your employees have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic, keeping production lines moving at breakneck speeds and fueling company profits,” the senators wrote. “We urge you to bargain in good faith with the union and agree to a fair contract as soon as possible.”The bakery strike comes amidst a wave of worker protests across industries and states, including at least 185 strikes at 255 locations in 2021. Sanders recently rallied in support of striking Kellogg’s workers in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, and Tennessee; led letters of support for striking steelworkers in West Virginia, Kellogg’s workers and more than 30,000 Kaiser health care workers; and stood in solidarity with workers at John Deere, Starbucks, McDonald’s, Frito-Lay, Teamsters Hunts Point Market workers, GSOCUAW graduate workers at NYU, Churchill Downs, and more.

https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-statement-on-medicare-limiting-coverage-for-alzheimers-drug/,"WASHINGTON, Jan 11 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Tuesday issued the following statement after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed a rule that would cover Aduhelm, the outrageously expensive Alzheimer’s treatment, and similar drugs in development only for people enrolled in qualifying clinical trials:“Biogen’s outrageous original price for Aduhelm, $56,000 per year, is the poster child for how dysfunctional our drug pricing system has become and it is the perfect example of why Medicare should be negotiating drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry. If the administration takes no action, Medicare recipients will continue to see their biggest premium increase in history, all because of Biogen’s greed. That cannot be allowed to happen.“Beyond the incredibly high price, Aduhelm has not been proven to be effective by the scientific community. It was rejected for coverage by the Veterans Health Administration and at least a half a dozen private health insurance companies in the United States, while 10 out of the 11 experts on the Food and Drug Administration’s advisory council voted against approval of the treatment.“Today’s action by CMS is an important step forward, especially following Secretary Becerra’s move yesterday to direct Medicare to reconsider a premium rate hike caused in part by the outrageous price of Aduhelm. I urge the administration to immediately lower Medicare premiums by at least $11.50 a month and to provide a refund to 57 million senior citizens for the premium increases that have already gone into effect this month. I would also urge the President to reinstate and expand the reasonable pricing clause that requires drug makers who have benefitted from taxpayer funded research to charge reasonable prices for drugs and treatments. Americans should not have to pay an outrageous price for a drug that their tax dollars helped develop.”In early December of 2021, Sen. Sanders sent a letter to President Biden urging his administration to delay an increase in Medicare premiums coming in 2022 following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval of Aduhelm. Sanders first spoke out about Biogen’s outrageous greed when the original $56,000 price tag for the treatment was released in July of last year.U.S. Senate332 Dirksen Building, Washington, D.C. 20510Phone: 202-224-5141Fax: 202-228-07761 Church St.3rd Floor,Burlington, VT 05401Toll-free: 800-339-9834Phone: 802-862-0697Fax: 802-860-6370 First Name *

https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-colleagues-urge-biden-administration-to-protect-consumers-against-high-heating-and-energy-prices-this-winter/,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), along with colleagues in both the Senate and House of Representatives, Wednesday sent a a bicameral letter to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Chairman Richard Glick urging the agency to use its authority to protect consumers from unfairly high energy costs.“We write to express our concern in regard to the effect that anticipated increases in heating and energy costs will have on our constituents this winter,” wrote the lawmakers. “As the entity tasked with the regulatory mission of ensuring consumers can access reliable energy at a reasonable cost, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has a significant role to play in promoting energy justice and protecting United States residents from unfairly high energy costs. Under its statutory authority, FERC has the power to influence retail rates for natural gas and electricity, including by preventing market manipulation in wholesale natural gas and electricity markets and enforcing gas spot market transparency. We urge the Commission to use its existing regulatory authority to ensure that households’ energy bills are not driven up by manipulation, obfuscation, or other malfeasance from regulated entities, and to work collaboratively with other agencies to address energy debt.”“For too long, the federal government has allowed too many utility companies to put profit above the public,” continued the lawmakers. “We have a responsibility to ensure that everyone has access to safe living conditions, and we cannot let corporate greed or a quest for profit get in the way of fundamental human rights. With high winter energy costs, the ongoing threat of the pandemic, and racial and economic justice issues surrounding energy debt, we urge FERC to use its existing statutory authority to better protect consumers from energy market manipulation.”Members of Congress who joined the letter include Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and Representatives Alma Adams (NC-12), Cori Bush (MO-01), André Carson (IN-07), David N.

https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-and-colleagues-push-to-solve-the-nursing-crisis-in-vermont/,"Burlington, Vt., Jan. 3 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Governor Phil Scott, and Senate President Pro Tempore Becca Balint – on behalf of both herself and House Speaker Jill Krowinski – came together Monday to discuss Vermont’s nursing workforce crisis. Estimates suggest that Vermont needs to add approximately 9,000 nurses to the state’s workforce in the next seven years. However, Vermont’s nursing schools are currently only able to graduate between 500 and 600 nurses each year – less than half of the number needed to keep up with retirements and those leaving the workforce.“Nurses are the backbone of our health care system in Vermont and across the country,” said Sen. Sanders. “Simply stated, we will not have the quality healthcare we need unless we have an adequate number of nurses who are well trained and well compensated. I have absolute confidence that this is a problem that can be solved. I look forward to working with the governor, the legislature and the congressional delegation to make certain that we do that.”“I want to thank Senator Sanders and his staff for all their work with my team over the last several months, focusing on this important issue. Growing our workforce, particularly in the health care sector, must be a top priority for all elected officials in Vermont,” said Governor Scott. “The Budget Adjustment I’ve proposed includes nearly $18 million for training, recruitment and retention for Home and Community Based Service human service providers. And, for the broader health care community, this week, I’ll also propose an additional investment of $15 million for retention bonuses, grants to support employers in training and retaining new nurse graduates, and funding to assist with recruiting and relocation international nurses. I look forward to working with Senator Sanders and  state legislative leaders in the coming months to make needed progress.”“We need to do this for all Vermonters in all communities because when we need medical care we want there to be a nurse to help us.  We know that many nurses across Vermont are already feeling overwhelmed. They’re working long hours to cover holes in schedules caused by staffing shortages. This isn’t fair and it’s not sustainable. The legislature will continue to work together with the administration and our federal delegation to meet this critical need.” said Senate President Pro Tempore Balint and House Speaker Krowinski.Last month, Sanders announced record funding to bolster health care workforces in rural and underserved communities in Vermont through loan repayments and scholarship programs. In September of last year, Sanders announced that Vermont’s 11 federally qualified health centers received over $6.9 million in funding to support major health care construction and renovation projects, including COVID-19 testing, treatment, and vaccination infrastructure projects. More information on these programs – including how to apply – can be found here. Senator Sanders’ full statement is available here.U.S. Senate332 Dirksen Building, Washington, D.C. 20510Phone: 202-224-5141Fax: 202-228-07761 Church St.3rd Floor,Burlington, VT 05401Toll-free: 800-339-9834Phone: 802-862-0697Fax: 802-860-6370 First Name *

https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-calls-on-warren-buffett-to-stand-with-striking-steelworkers-at-west-virginia-company-owned-by-berkshire-hathaway/,"BURLINGTON, Vt., Dec. 30 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) this week sent a letter to Warren Buffett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Berkshire Hathaway, asking him to intervene in support of 450 steelworkers in West Virginia on strike for a fair contract, wages, and health care at a company owned by the billionaire investor. On strike for nearly 100 days, the workers at Special Metals in Huntington, West Virginia – a subsidiary of Precision Castparts which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway – produce critically important materials essential to space crafts and airplanes, including military jet engines and commercial aircrafts, as well as submarines and deep-sea oil rigs – making Special Metals’ Huntington facility the largest nickel alloy plant in the world.“Today, I am personally requesting that you intervene in the negotiations between Steelworkers Local 40 and Precision Castparts to make sure that the workers are treated with dignity and respect and receive a fair contract that rewards the hard work and sacrifices they have made,” Sanders wrote to Buffett. “At a time when this company and Berkshire Hathaway are both doing very well, there is no reason why workers employed by you should be worrying about whether they will be able to feed their children or have health care. There is no reason why the standard of living of these hard working Americans should decline. I know that you and Berkshire Hathaway can do better than that.”Buffett responded Wednesday to Sanders, saying in his own missive, “I’m passing along your letter to the CEO of Precision Castparts but making no recommendation to him as to any action. He is responsible for his business.” Special Metals offered a 5-year contract that institutes a very significant cut in real pay when accounting for current inflation. Adding insult to injury, the company has also tried to make major cuts to accrued vacation time and employee health care, almost quadrupling the cost of health care for these workers by increasing the current monthly premium from $275 up to approximately $1,000.Sanders reminded Buffett that the cuts in employee pay and health care are happening despite his own company doing incredibly well, noting that Buffett himself is worth $108 billion and Berkshire Hathaway is currently sitting on over $150 billion in cash. Buffett has famously pointed out that through tax loopholes he pays less in tax than his secretary. The steelworkers strike comes amidst a wave of worker protests across industries and states, including at least 185 strikes at 255 locations in 2021. Sanders recently rallied in support of striking Kellogg’s workers in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, and Tennessee, led letters of support for Kellogg’s workers and more than 30,000 Kaiser health care workers, and stood in solidarity with workers at John Deere, Starbucks, McDonald’s, Frito-Lay, Teamsters Hunts Point Market workers, GSOCUAW graduate workers at NYU, Churchill Downs, and more.Read Sanders’ full letter here.Read Buffett’s response here. U.S. Senate332 Dirksen Building, Washington, D.C. 20510Phone: 202-224-5141Fax: 202-228-07761 Church St.3rd Floor,Burlington, VT 05401Toll-free: 800-339-9834Phone: 802-862-0697Fax: 802-860-6370 First Name *

https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-leahy-welch-send-letter-to-dejoy-on-mail-delays-and-issues-at-white-river-junction-facility/,"Burlington Vt., Dec. 23 – Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) on Thursday sent a letter to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy demanding action to address the postal issues across Vermont, including the immediate installation of a functioning cancellation machine at the White River Junction mail processing facility.“We write with great concern about the Postal Service’s continued failure to meet its own standards of service,” Sanders, Leahy and Welch wrote. “In October 2020, we wrote to you asking for the immediate delivery of critical equipment needed at the White River Junction Processing and Distribution Center in White River Junction, Vermont. Over a year later, this issue remains unresolved. An increasing number of Vermonters have also been reporting significant issues with daily mail delivery and parcels being prioritized over First Class mail.”The White River Junction U.S. Postal Service facility is one of two facilities that sort mail in Vermont. In July 2020, one of White River Junction’s two functioning AFCS 100 series machines – which had been due to be replaced already for several years – was finally removed in preparation for the arrival of a new AFCS 200 series. However, the replacement machine never came, leaving the facility with only one mail processor for months which, when it broke down, forced postal workers to sort mail by hand and significantly slowed deliveries.In October of 2020, the Vermont delegation sent a letter to Postmaster General DeJoy demanding the immediate delivery and installation of the new AFCS 200 cancellation machine at the White River Junction mail processing facility.After months of delay and a missed January 2021 deadline, the facility was sent a machine on October 15, 2021 – ten months after it was due and a different machine than was originally promised. After nearly a year of waiting, the newly delivered machine remains completely unusable, having been stripped for parts prior to arrival – a fact that was not identified until its installation in White River Junction because it was also not tested prior to shipment, as is required.Now, for over a year, DeJoy and his staff have failed to deliver on their promise of a functioning mail processor and continue to be unhelpful as the Vermont delegation has worked to resolve these issues, as well as other concerns about timely mail delivery from Vermonters across the state. Nearly every day the delegation hears from a Vermonter who is reliant upon an increasingly unreliable mail system for delivery not only of checks and bill payments, but lifesaving medications.“During this holiday season – as well as each and every day – we are grateful for the tireless efforts of our dedicated postal employees, Sanders, Leahy and Welch wrote. “They are working remarkably hard under extraordinary circumstances and deserve to know that you, their Postmaster General, support their efforts and will provide them with the equipment they need to do their job.”You can read the 2021 letter here.You can read the 2020 letter here.U.S. Senate332 Dirksen Building, Washington, D.C. 20510Phone: 202-224-5141Fax: 202-228-07761 Church St.3rd Floor,Burlington, VT 05401Toll-free: 800-339-9834Phone: 802-862-0697Fax: 802-860-6370 First Name *

https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-asks-president-biden-to-demand-the-immediate-resignation-of-trumps-handpicked-postmaster-general-louis-dejoy/,"BURLINGTON, Vt., Dec. 23 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Thursday issued the following statement asking President Biden to demand the immediate resignation of Louis DeJoy as Postmaster General of the United States Postal Service: “Given the serious crisis and total failure of leadership at the United States Postal Service, I am urging President Biden to demand the immediate resignation of Louis DeJoy as Postmaster General.“By any objective measure, Louis DeJoy, a top campaign contributor of Donald Trump, has been, by far and away, the worst Postmaster General in the modern history of America.“Since Mr. DeJoy was handpicked by President Trump to serve as Postmaster General in May of 2020, the quality of the Postal Service has been severely undermined. Tragically, the situation has only gotten worse since Mr. DeJoy began implementing his disastrous 10-year plan to substantially slow down mail delivery, cut back on post office hours, shut down mail processing plants, and dismantle mail sorting machines.“During the busy holiday season, this could not come at a worse time. Not only are millions of people in Vermont and throughout the country not getting their Christmas presents delivered on time, senior citizens have experienced massive delays in receiving the lifesaving prescription drugs they desperately need and working families have been forced to pay late fees because it is taking much longer than normal for the Postal Service to mail their bills. “The President made the correct decision to begin mailing 500 million at-home COVID tests for any American who requests one. But, given the deterioration of the postal service under Mr. DeJoy, how can anyone have confidence that these life-saving tests will be delivered to the American people in a timely and efficient manner? I think the obvious answer to that question is they cannot.“Further, it has been well documented that Mr. DeJoy has over a dozen major conflicts of interest due to his financial interests in several companies that have ties to the Postal Service.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Sunday issued the following statement after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) announced he would not support the Build Back Better Act:“If Sen. Joe Manchin wants to vote against the Build Back Better Act, he should have the opportunity to do so with a floor vote as soon as the Senate returns. He should have to explain to West Virginians and the American people why he doesn’t have the courage to stand up to powerful special interests and lower prescription drug costs; expand Medicare to cover dental, hearing and eyeglasses; continue the $300 per child direct monthly payment which has cut childhood poverty by over 40%; and address the devastating impacts of climate change. He should also have to explain why he is not prepared to demand that millionaires and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes.“I also find it amusing that Sen. Manchin indicates his worry about the deficit after voting just this week for a military budget of $778 billion, four times greater than Build Back Better over ten years and $25 billion more than the president requested.”U.S. Senate332 Dirksen Building, Washington, D.C. 20510Phone: 202-224-5141Fax: 202-228-07761 Church St.3rd Floor,Burlington, VT 05401Toll-free: 800-339-9834Phone: 802-862-0697Fax: 802-860-6370 First Name *

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will hold a statewide virtual town hall meeting with Vermont students this Monday, March 15 at 7:30pm.The virtual event, Coping During COVID: How Students are Handling the Challenges of the COVID-19 Pandemic, will focus on how students have experienced the social, emotional, and mental health challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.Sanders said, “I want to hear directly from Vermont’s young people. This past year has been terrible for so many of us, and there’s no doubt that our students are struggling. They may not be able to go to school, they’re dealing with remote and hybrid learning. They can’t see their friends, and of course, some lost loved ones to this terrible virus. We cannot ignore their pain and we also owe it to them to listen to their ideas for how we move forward. I want to hear directly from these students and together discuss what can be done to boldly address their needs.”A panel of Vermont high school students will join Sanders for a discussion, followed by a question and answer session with the student attendees. Students will have an opportunity to speak about the issues that matter most to them, and ask questions about Sanders’ plans to help young people.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Friday issued the following statement after the Senate failed to advance an increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour over a five year period:“At a time when millions of people are working for starvation wages, when the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour has not been raised by Congress since 2007, when the President of the United States and the House of Representatives support it, it is absolutely imperative that the Senate approve an increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour. If any Senator believes this is the last time they will cast a vote on whether or not to give a raise to 32 million Americans, they are sorely mistaken.

https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/sanders-holds-virtual-roundtable-discussion-with-state-of-the-union-essay-contest-finalists/,"BURLINGTON, Vt., March 2 – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) held a virtual roundtable discussion on Monday evening with the winners and finalists of his eleventh annual State of the Union essay contest. The contest gives Vermont high school students an opportunity to describe a pressing issue they would prioritize as president of the United States. Each year, Sanders hosts a discussion with the finalists at the Vermont State House. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this year’s event was held virtually. The students and their families joined Sanders on the video call with Sanders participating from his Senate office in Washington, D.C.Sanders, who serves on the Senate education committee told the students, “You should all be very proud. You wrote wonderful essays on some of the most important issues we face as a nation. I look forward to this lively discussion every year, so I’m very glad we were able to gather virtually.”This year, 319 students from 42 Vermont high schools submitted essays on racial justice, gun safety, climate change, mental health care, immigration, the rising cost of college, and more. A panel of six Vermont teachers served as volunteer judges, scoring the essays and selecting the eight finalists and three winners. After Sanders’ introductory remarks, each finalist presented their essay topic, which included possible solutions to the issue they identified. Sanders then opened the discussion portion of the event, asking the students their thoughts on what must be done to reinvigorate American democracy. Several finalists wrote their essays about the state of our democracy, and many students spoke up about the threat of extremism, the role the internet and corporate media play in shaping one’s views, the Electoral College, and voter suppression. Sanders and the finalists also discussed gun safety legislation, systemic racism and police accountability, sexual health education, supporting our veterans, and youth mental health. “This past year has been a terrible year. We have lost half a million people to the pandemic, our economy has suffered, many have lost their jobs, and many young people’s lives have been disrupted. The statistics are very clear — mental illness has skyrocketed over the last year.” said Sanders. Knowing the importance of addressing these issues directly with students, Sanders is hosting a virtual statewide student town meeting on March 15 focused on mental health. Sanders encouraged the essay finalists to attend and spread the word about this event to further discuss the challenges they have experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sanders then posed a question to the finalists: “What are you and your friends feeling and what might we be able to do to improve a difficult situation?” The finalists acknowledged that it has been very difficult to stay in touch with friends and to learn in a hybrid model, mixing remote and in-person learning environments. While the mental health impacts on students have been extremely challenging, many expressed that  – perhaps because of these challenges –  mental health is discussed much more amongst young people now than ever before. Stephie Siki, a senior from Winooski High School, said, “This has been a horrible year. But I do think it has brought issues forward that have been ignored in the past, like mental health and systemic racism. This year has challenged us to face our reality.” Ling Bushey, a senior from Bellows Free Academy, said, “My friends have been struggling a lot with their mental health. Talking about it during this pandemic has normalized it a little bit more since we’re all feeling the same thing.” Ella Partlow, a junior from Missisquoi Valley Union High School, who wrote her essay on youth mental health, said, “We have to increase funding for mental health services and make it more accessible for young people.”After discussing the finalists’ essay topics, Sanders provided an update on what he’s fighting for in Washington. He spoke of his role as Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and the $1.9 trillion relief package currently being negotiated in Congress. The finalists also had an opportunity to ask Sanders specific questions about his legislative plans and his thoughts on current events. Sanders ended the event by thanking the students for their participation and encouraging them to continue engaging in the political process, saying, “I want to thank you very much for your excellent essays and your thoughtful participation in this discussion. Please when you leave this event, get the word out to your friends and classmates – what happens in Washington, in Montpelier, at the local level is very important, and we need to have young people involved.” Sanders entered the finalists’ essays into the Congressional Record, which is the official archive of the U.S. Congress. Additionally, Senator Sanders has invited the finalists to be interviewed about their essay topic for inclusion in official videos and social media produced by his Senate office.  To read the finalists’ essays, click here.U.S. Senate332 Dirksen Building, Washington, D.C. 20510Phone: 202-224-5141Fax: 202-228-07761 Church St.3rd Floor,Burlington, VT 05401Toll-free: 800-339-9834Phone: 802-862-0697Fax: 802-860-6370 First Name *

https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-announces-15-minimum-wage-amendment-to-reconciliation-bill-calls-for-senate-democrats-to-ignore-parliamentarian/,"WASHINGTON, March 1 – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Monday issued the following statement that he will introduce an amendment to include an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 in the final reconciliation bill:“This week, as part of the reconciliation bill, I will be offering an amendment to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. At a time when millions of workers are earning starvation wages, when the minimum wage has not been raised by Congress since 2007 and stands at a pathetic $7.25 an hour, it is time to raise the minimum wage to a living wage.“Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed by the decision of the parliamentarian who ruled that the minimum wage provision was inconsistent with the Byrd Rule and the reconciliation process. But even more importantly, I regard it as absurd that the parliamentarian, a Senate staffer elected by no one, can prevent a wage increase for 32 million workers.“My own personal view is that the Senate should ignore the parliamentarian’s advice, which is wrong in a number of respects. I am not sure, however, that my view at this point is the majority view in the Democratic Caucus.“Obviously, as soon as we can, we must end the filibuster that currently exists in the U.S. Senate. Given the enormous crises facing working families today, we cannot allow a minority of the Senate to obstruct what the vast majority of the American people want and need.” U.S. Senate332 Dirksen Building, Washington, D.C. 20510Phone: 202-224-5141Fax: 202-228-07761 Church St.3rd Floor,Burlington, VT 05401Toll-free: 800-339-9834Phone: 802-862-0697Fax: 802-860-6370 First Name *

https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/gao-medicare-part-d-pays-twice-as-much-for-same-drugs-as-va/,"WASHINGTON, January 14 — The federal government pays twice as much for the same prescription drugs when reimbursing private-sector middlemen in Medicare Part D as it does when buying the drugs directly through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) single-payer drug plan, according to a report released today by the Government Accountability Office (GAO).The report, “Department of Veterans Affairs Paid About Half as Much as Medicare Part D for Selected Drugs in 2017,” commissioned by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), found that in 2017, on average, the VA paid 54 percent less per unit for a sample of 399 brand name and generic prescription drugs in 2017 than Medicare Part D.Of the 399 drugs, 233 were at least 50 percent cheaper when purchased by the VA rather than Medicare Part D, and 106 were at least 75 percent cheaper. Moreover, according to GAO, VA generally uses less-expensive alternatives. For generic drugs, VA paid, on average, 48 percent less than did Medicare for the same drugs. For brand name drugs, VA paid 49 percent less.“There is absolutely no reason, other than greed, for Medicare to pay twice as much for the same exact prescription drugs as the VA.  If the VA can negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies to substantially reduce the price of prescription drugs we must empower Medicare to do so as well,” said Sanders. “We can no longer allow the pharmaceutical industry to rip-off the more than 40 million people who receive prescription drug coverage through Medicare Part D and fleece U.S. taxpayers. It is time for Congress to require Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices and take on the greed pharmaceutical industry.”In 2017, Medicare Part D covered 42.5 million individuals and had an estimated $93.9 billion in expenditures, while the much-smaller VA provided prescription drug coverage for approximately 9 million enrolled veterans and spent about $4.8 billion for prescription drugs in outpatient care.The report identified several reasons for the large price disparity. Among them:–     VA is a single health system with a unified list of covered drugs, whereas Medicare beneficiaries are covered by many different Part D plans, each of which separately negotiates with manufacturers. In December 2017, the largest plan had approximately 5.6 million enrollees, while most were much smaller; meanwhile, VA’s single, unified plan represented 9 million individuals. This led GAO to conclude, “VA’s large purchasing volume may strengthen its bargaining position when negotiating.”–    VA has access to statutory discounts on its drug purchases, which are not available to Part D plans. These include additional discounts if drug prices rise faster than general inflation, as is often the case. In contrast, the law establishing Medicare Part D explicitly prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services from negotiating drug prices on behalf of Part D plans.In the last Congress, Sen. Sanders sponsored S.99, the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Act, which directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices on behalf of Medicare Part D plans.Read the report here.U.S. Senate332 Dirksen Building, Washington, D.C. 20510Phone: 202-224-5141Fax: 202-228-07761 Church St.3rd Floor,Burlington, VT 05401Toll-free: 800-339-9834Phone: 802-862-0697Fax: 802-860-6370 First Name *

https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/sanders-republican-attempts-to-overturn-election-pathetic/,"BURLINGTON, January 2 — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) issued the following statement regarding Republican attempts to overturn the results of the November elections:“The outcome of the 2020 election is not in doubt. Let’s be clear: Joe Biden resoundingly won the popular vote by more than 7 million votes, and he won an Electoral College margin that Trump called a ‘landslide’ in 2016. On January 6, the House and Senate will ratify the results of the Electoral College, as has been done for 231 years.“From the beginning of his campaign for president, Donald Trump has shown a profound disrespect for the institutions of democracy. It is pathetic that 13 of my colleagues in the Senate and 140 members of the House of Representatives are now demonstrating a similar disdain for the American people by engaging in a dead-end, unconstitutional effort to overturn the will of voters. “Every state, including those with Republican Governors, Secretaries of State and legislatures have certified the results of this election.“In the two months since the election, more than 80 judges, including some who were appointed by the President, have rejected Donald Trump and his allies’ attempts to overturn the election. There are no cases pending that will have any impact on the results. There have been numerous recounts, audits and verifications, including in the most closely contested states. Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security even called this ‘the most secure election in American history.’“What all of this comes down to is that Donald Trump and right wing extremists are refusing to accept the will of the people and the fact that Trump lost the election.  In their contempt for democracy, they are using lies and conspiracy theories about ‘voter fraud’ in an attempt to overturn the election results. “It will not work. Joe Biden will be President at noon on January 20.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) seeking up-or-down votes on two bills providing $2,000 in direct economic relief to working-class families today, including Majority Leader McConnell’s own proposal, Sanders issued the following statement:“Over the past four days I have asked, time and time again, for the Republican leadership to allow the Senate to vote on legislation that passed the House to provide a $2,000 direct payment to working class adults and their kids. This is legislation that Trump supports, Biden supports, and over two-thirds of the U.S. House supported — including 44 Republicans. In fact, a recent poll suggests that 78% of the American people support that approach. Unfortunately, Mitch McConnell and the Republican leadership have refused to allow the Senate to vote on this bill, even when accompanied by a vote on the bill which they themselves proposed.“At a time when so many Americans are facing economic desperation, it is tragic that the Republican leadership has turned their backs on the working families of this country. When the Biden Administration assumes office, the Senate must immediately take up and pass bold legislation which deals with the economic pain that so many Americans are experiencing.”Watch today’s floor remarks by Sanders here.U.S. Senate332 Dirksen Building, Washington, D.C. 20510Phone: 202-224-5141Fax: 202-228-07761 Church St.3rd Floor,Burlington, VT 05401Toll-free: 800-339-9834Phone: 802-862-0697Fax: 802-860-6370 First Name *

https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/sanders-responds-to-cbo-report-on-15-minimum-wage/,"BURLINGTON, February 8 – Today, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) issued the following response to a Congressional Budget Office study on the budgetary impacts of the Raise the Wage Act, introduced by Sanders last month along with 37 Senate co-sponsors:“Let’s be clear.  We are never going to get 10 Republicans to increase the minimum wage through ‘regular order.’ The only way to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour now is to pass it with 51 votes through budget reconciliation.“I find it hard to understand how the CBO concluded that raising the minimum wage would increase the deficit by $54 billion. Two years ago, CBO concluded that a $15 minimum wage would increase the deficit by less than $1 million over ten years. Further, several major studies done by the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics and the Economic Policy Institute both found that raising the minimum wage would amount to a significant reduction in the deficit. “The good news, however, is that from a Byrd Rule perspective, the CBO has demonstrated that increasing the minimum wage would have a direct and substantial impact on the federal budget. What that means is that we can clearly raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour under the rules of reconciliation.“I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and the Senate to end the crisis of starvation wages in America and raise the minimum wage to a living wage of at least $15 an hour.”U.S. Senate332 Dirksen Building, Washington, D.C. 20510Phone: 202-224-5141Fax: 202-228-07761 Church St.3rd Floor,Burlington, VT 05401Toll-free: 800-339-9834Phone: 802-862-0697Fax: 802-860-6370 First Name *

https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/sanders-applauds-white-house-announcement-to-end-u-s-support-for-yemen-war/,"WASHINGTON, February 4 — Today, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) welcomed the White House announcement that President Biden would end U.S. participation in the nearly six-year-old Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen:“For many years, activists in Yemen and around the world have worked to bring an end to the devastating Saudi-led war in Yemen, which has led to the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.” said Sanders. “In 2018, I helped lead an effort to pass the first War Powers Resolution in history, calling for the United States to end its unauthorized participation in that war. Today’s announcement by President Biden that the United States will end support for offensive operations in the Yemen war, and his naming of a Special Envoy to help resolve this conflict and bring aid and reconstruction to Yemen, are important steps, and a tribute to the work of so many activists over the years.“Just as importantly, by honoring the bipartisan War Powers Resolution that the previous president vetoed, President Biden has shown a commitment to restoring authority over war where the framers of the U.S. Constitution placed it: with the Congress.”Sanders is the author of Senate Joint Resolution 7, a bipartisan bill introduced with Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), to end unauthorized military involvement in the war in Yemen, which passed both the House and Senate in 2019.U.S. Senate332 Dirksen Building, Washington, D.C. 20510Phone: 202-224-5141Fax: 202-228-07761 Church St.3rd Floor,Burlington, VT 05401Toll-free: 800-339-9834Phone: 802-862-0697Fax: 802-860-6370 First Name *

https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/sanders-top-democrats-introduce-bill-raising-minimum-wage-to-15/,"WASHINGTON, January 26 – In a press conference today, incoming Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) joined incoming Senate HELP Committee Chair Patty Murray (D-Wash.), House Committee on Education and Labor Chairman Bobby Scott (D-Va.), Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), and Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.) to announce the introduction of legislation raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2025.The Raise the Wage Act of 2021 would increase the federal minimum wage to $15 in five steps over the next four years. Beginning in 2026, the federal minimum wage would be indexed to median wage growth. According to an independent analysis conducted by the Economic Policy Institute, the Raise the Wage Act would increase wages for nearly 32 million Americans, including roughly a third of all Black workers and a quarter of all Latino workers.“Let’s be clear. The $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage is a starvation wage. No person in America can make it on $8, $10, or $12 an hour. In the United States of America a job must lift workers out of poverty, not keep them in it. We must raise the minimum wage to a living wage—at least $15 an hour. And when we do that, not only will we be lifting millions of Americans out of poverty, we will be providing a raise to over 33 million workers,” said Senator Sanders. “We can no longer tolerate millions of workers not being able to afford to feed their families or pay the rent. The time for talk is over. No more excuses. It is time for Congress to act to raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour.”“Throughout this pandemic, Democrats and Republicans alike have joined together in rightly calling our frontline workers ‘heroes.’ But despite their tireless work and the risk of COVID exposure, too many of these workers are paid wages so low, they can’t afford to pay for even their most basic needs. And because of systemic inequities and discrimination, workers of color, and in particular, women of color, are much more likely to be paid poverty-level wages,” said Senator Murray, Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. “Democrats are asking for $15 an hour, because no one working 40 hours a week, should be making $15,000 a year. If we’re committed to an economy that works for everyone, we need one fair, livable wage for everyone—and that includes workers with disabilities, tipped workers and youth workers. We won’t accept carve-outs and we won’t accept leaving anyone behind.”“Americans working 40 hours a week should be able to put food on the table and a roof over their families’ heads, but with the minimum wage stuck at $7.25, far too many are working hard and still in poverty,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. “Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour is one step Congress should take right now, particularly with the COVID-19 crisis stretching families’ resources further than ever. I am happy to move forward with this group to make it happen and give the American people a raise.”“This pandemic has pushed millions more Americans into poverty and we need to ensure that every working American is able to support themselves and their families,” said Senator Gillibrand. “Passing the Raise the Wage Act is more critical now than ever. Finally delivering a $15 minimum wage will benefit workers by lifting their families out of poverty and it will strengthen our economic recovery. We must keep fighting until all hardworking Americans can access basic economic security and a fair shot in our economy.” “My colleagues and I have introduced this legislation raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour because Georgia’s working families are struggling to pay the bills, and they deserve a livable wage for an honest day’s work,” Senator Ossoff said.“The coronavirus pandemic and economic crises have pulled back the veil on the unconscionable economic disparities that working women, low-income families and other vulnerable communities have faced for decades,” said Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “By re-introducing the Chair Bobby Scott’s Raise the Wage Act, which passed on a bipartisan basis in the previous Congress, the Democratic Congress is taking another strong and long-needed step to honor the dignity, dedication and contributions of millions of hard-working Americans.  This legislation is a key part of Democrats’ commitment to not only recover from these crises, but to Build Back Better – and to do so in a way that advances justice, prosperity and equality for all Americans.”“Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the $7.25 federal minimum wage was economically and morally indefensible. Now, the pandemic is highlighting the gross imbalance between the value of our workers and the wages they are paid.  Many of the essential workers who have braved a public health crisis to keep our economy moving are still not being paid enough to provide for themselves or their families. The Raise the Wage Act is a critical step toward lifting hardworking people out of poverty, addressing inequality, and ensuring that all Americans can share in the economic recovery.,” said Chairman Bobby Scott, Committee on Education and Labor.“As a longtime organizer for working people who helped draft the resolution that made Seattle the first major city to enact a $15 minimum wage, I know that raising the wage is good for workers, families, businesses and the economy,” said Congresswoman Jayapal. “Now that we have a Democratic White House and a Democratic Senate, it is time for the People’s House to once again stand up for workers, fight for families and pass the Raise the Wage Act so we finally have a $15 minimum wage all across America.”“Last Congress, I was proud to help lead the historic effort in the House to give Americans a raise. Floridians then followed suit and voted to increase our state minimum wage and put more money in the pockets of hard-working families,” said Congresswoman Murphy. “This bill is a reasonable step to boost our economy and ensure everyone who works hard in this great country can provide for themselves and their loved ones.”“Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour will change my life and let me tell my kids I can give them a better life than mine,” said Kansas City McDonald’s worker Fran Marion. “I’m so proud to join with leaders in Congress today as they reintroduce the Raise the Wage Act, which will give tens of millions of working families like mine the raise we so desperately need. Essential workers have been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic and we can’t wait for help any longer.”“Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2025 will be a boost to the economy, and a boost to our sales. Raising wages is good business. Paying people fairly leads to greater staff retention, which reduces the cost of hiring and training new people to replace employees who leave. And fair pay leads to better quality, better ideas and better customer service,” said Mike Draper, owner of Raygun LLC, an Iowa-based clothing and home goods company and member of Business for a Fair Minimum Wage.Sanders’ Senate companion is being cosponsored by 37 Members: Chair Murray (D-Wash.), Leader Schumer (D-N.Y.), Sens.

Now is the time to raise the minimum wage to a living wage – at least $15 an hour.  A job in the United States of America should lift you out of poverty, not keep you in it.“And when we increase that minimum wage to $15 an hour we will be giving over 32 million Americans a much needed raise. “In fact, if the legislation we are introducing today becomes law, the average low-wage worker in America would receive an extra $3,300 – each and every year.“And let’s be clear.  The overwhelming majority of Americans support raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.  This is not a radical idea.  This is what the American people want.“Since 1998, every time a state has had an initiative on the ballot to raise the minimum wage it has won – no matter if that state was red, blue or purple. “In November 61% of the people in Florida – a state Joe Biden lost by 3 points – voted to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.“Eight states and over 40 cities have adopted laws to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.“During the last session of Congress, the House did the right thing under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Scott – and I applaud them for their efforts – and passed legislation to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour – and I have no doubt that they will do it again this year.“Now, this issue rests in the Senate.  It is my strong hope that a number of my Republican colleagues will come to their senses and understand that raising the minimum wage is not just a Democratic issue.“No matter whether you are a Republican, a Democrat or an Independent – all of us understand that no one in America can make it on $8, $10 or $12 an hour.  We have got to raise that minimum wage to $15 an hour.“But let me also say this.  If we cannot get enough Republicans to vote for this legislation under regular order, we cannot take no for an answer.“We must understand that the issue of starvation wages is a national emergency.“We must raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour through budget reconciliation by a simple majority vote in the Senate.“And, as the incoming Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, that is exactly what I am fighting to do.“This is not a new concept.  If the Republicans could use reconciliation to pass trillions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthy and large corporations, if the Republicans could use reconciliation to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, if the Republicans could use reconciliation to try to repeal the Affordable Care Act and throw up to 32 million Americans off of the healthcare they have, we can and must use reconciliation to protect the needs of working families. “We must use reconciliation to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour.“Now is not the time for excuses. Now is not the time for more talk.  Now is the time for action.  Now is the time to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.”U.S. Senate332 Dirksen Building, Washington, D.C. 20510Phone: 202-224-5141Fax: 202-228-07761 Church St.3rd Floor,Burlington, VT 05401Toll-free: 800-339-9834Phone: 802-862-0697Fax: 802-860-6370 First Name *

https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-statement-on-air-strikes-in-syria/,"BURLINGTON, February 26 – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Friday issued the following statement after U.S. forces carried out an air strike on a site in Syria:“I am very concerned that last night’s strike by U.S. forces in Syria puts our country on the path of continuing the Forever War instead of ending it. This is the same path we’ve been on for almost two decades. For far too long administrations of both parties have interpreted their authorities in an extremely expansive way to continue military interventions across the Middle East region and elsewhere. This must end.“In 2019, Congress passed the first War Powers Resolution in history to end U.S. participation in the war in Yemen. Congress passed another such resolution in 2020 to prevent Trump from starting a war with Iran. These were important and historic steps by the Congress to reassert Constitutional authority over the use of force, and we must continue to build on those efforts. While the President has a responsibility to defend the people of the United States, our Constitution is clear that it is the Congress, not the President, who has the authority to declare war.”U.S. Senate332 Dirksen Building, Washington, D.C. 20510Phone: 202-224-5141Fax: 202-228-07761 Church St.3rd Floor,Burlington, VT 05401Toll-free: 800-339-9834Phone: 802-862-0697Fax: 802-860-6370 First Name *

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will hold a statewide virtual town meeting with Vermont students on March 15 at 7:30pm.Sanders will be joined by a panel of Vermonters to discuss the experiences of young people and get their thoughts on the challenges they have experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the panel discussion, there will be a question and answer session with student attendees. The students will have an opportunity to speak about the issues that matter most to them and hear from Sanders about his legislative plans to help students and their families in the Senate.“When we talk about the destructiveness of the COVID-19 pandemic, we must not forget what it has done to the mental health of our young people,” Sanders said. “They can’t go to school, or see their friends, and, of course, so many lost loved ones to this terrible virus. Their very real pain cannot be ignored. We must respond vigorously by reaching out to them and taking bold action to address their needs.”The information on how to register for the town hall will be made available on Sen.

https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-statement-on-parliamentarians-advice/,"WASHINGTON, February 25 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Thursday issued the following statement after the Senate Parliamentarian advised that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour does not comply with the Byrd Rule: “I strongly disagree with tonight’s decision by the Senate Parliamentarian. The CBO made it absolutely clear that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour had a substantial budgetary impact and should be allowed under reconciliation. It is hard for me to understand how drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was considered to be consistent with the Byrd Rule, while increasing the minimum wage is not.“60 percent of the American people want to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The House of Representatives has voted to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The President of the United States wants to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. I’m confident that we have a majority in the United States Senate including the Vice President that would vote to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour as part of President Biden’s American Rescue Plan. Yet because of the archaic and undemocratic rules of the Senate we are unable to move forward to end starvation wages in this country and raise the income of 32 million struggling Americans. That fight continues.  “In the coming days, I will be working with my colleagues in the Senate to move forward with an amendment to take tax deductions away from large, profitable corporations that don’t pay workers at least $15 an hour and to provide small businesses with the incentives they need to raise wages. That amendment must be included in this reconciliation bill.”U.S. Senate332 Dirksen Building, Washington, D.C. 20510Phone: 202-224-5141Fax: 202-228-07761 Church St.3rd Floor,Burlington, VT 05401Toll-free: 800-339-9834Phone: 802-862-0697Fax: 802-860-6370 First Name *

https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/sanders-announces-winners-of-11th-annual-state-of-the-union-essay-contest/,"BURLINGTON, Vt., Feb. 23 – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Tuesday announced the winners of his eleventh annual State of the Union essay contest, which gives Vermont high school students an opportunity to describe pressing issues they would prioritize as president of the United States. Over the past 11 years, nearly 5,000 students throughout Vermont, representing almost every high school in the state, have written essays about critically important issues, including racial justice, gun safety, immigration, climate change, mental health care, the rising cost of college, and more. This year, 319 students from 42 Vermont high schools submitted essays. A panel of six Vermont teachers served as volunteer judges, scoring the essays and selecting the 8 finalists and three winners.  William Taggard, the first place winner from Brattleboro Union High School, and Simon Rosenbaum, the third place winner from Vermont Commons School, both wrote essays about the state of our democracy. Taggard focused his on essay on changing our presidential election process. “Our democracy has been under unprecedented pressure in recent months, culminating in the insurrection in our nation’s capital. Fortunately, democracy and truth have prevailed. However, our current system leaves ample room for improvement: namely the Electoral College. We need to review the merits of the Electoral College and determine how best to protect our democratic process,” wrote Taggard.Rosenbaum wrote about the need to strengthen our democratic institutions. “This past year terrified me. It was not just the carnage and isolation of the pandemic. I was afraid because the America I love and believe in felt like it was on the brink of collapse,” Rosenbaum wrote. “To preserve the union and our nation, we must eliminate the possibility for a President to wield unitary executive authority. Diminishing the power of the Executive Branch will mitigate the damage that an unfit executive could cause. The most pressing issue that we as Americans face today is the preservation of our democracy,” concluded Rosenbaum. Emilia De Jounge from Burr and Burton Academy, whose essay focused on gun violence, is the second place winner in the competition. “The right to bear arms is in our Constitution, yet that does not negate the need for sound and rational policies around the sales of firearms. Currently, nearly 400 million guns are privately owned in the US, more than the country’s population, with sharp increases in recent years. Gun violence needs to be recognized and addressed as a top priority public health issue,” De Jounge wrote.“During a year that has been immensely challenging for teachers, students, and families, I could not be more proud that students from all across Vermont took the time to participate in this year’s essay contest,” said Sanders, who serves on the Senate education committee. “The subjects these young people wrote about are not the stuff of history books, they are issues they are living through themselves, including an unprecedented health and economic crisis, a renewed fight for racial justice, and threats to our democracy. These struggles will be with us for a long time, and it is more important than ever to listen to the perspectives and ideas of our young people.” Sanders will enter the finalists’ essays into the Congressional Record — the official archive of the U.S. Congress. Additionally, Senator Sanders has invited the finalists to join him for a roundtable discussion, which will be held virtually this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on Monday, March 1 at 7:30pm. Knowing the importance of amplifying students’ voices and perspectives, Sanders has also invited the 11 finalists to be interviewed about their essay topic for inclusion in official videos and social media produced by his Senate office. Videos featuring last year’s finalists can be viewed here, here, and here.“Each year this contest is an important reminder of the immense amount of work before us. It is also encouraging to know that so many young people are thinking about the issues, standing up for what they believe, and making their voices heard,” said Sanders. The contest is timed to coincide with the president’s annual address to a joint session of Congress. The date for this year’s address has not yet been announced. The winners of this year’s essay contest are:First Place: William Taggard (Brattleboro Union High School, Junior)Second Place: Emilia De Jounge (Burr and Burton Academy, Sophomore)Third Place: Simon Rosenbaum (Vermont Commons School, Junior)Finalists (in alphabetical order):Emily Borrazzo (South Burlington High School, Sophomore)Ling Bushey (Bellows Free Academy, Fairfax, Senior)Fatima Khan (Essex High School, Junior)Eh Ka Luu (Winooski High School, Senior)Kada Orlow (Burlington High School, Freshman)Ella Partlow (Missisquoi Valley Union High School, Junior)Alexander Shriver (Brattleboro Union High School, Senior)Stephie Siki (Winooski High School, Senior)To read the essays of the winners and finalists, click here.U.S. Senate332 Dirksen Building, Washington, D.C. 20510Phone: 202-224-5141Fax: 202-228-07761 Church St.3rd Floor,Burlington, VT 05401Toll-free: 800-339-9834Phone: 802-862-0697Fax: 802-860-6370 First Name *

https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/sanders-commissioned-cbo-report-finds-medicare-part-d-pays-nearly-three-times-more-than-medicaid-for-prescription-drugs/,"WASHINGTON, February 18 – The Medicare Part D program pays far more than any other federal health program for prescription drugs, according to a report released today by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The report, “A Comparison of Brand-Name Drug Prices Among Selected Federal Programs,” commissioned by Senate Budget Committee Chair, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), found that on average Medicare Part D pays nearly three times more for brand-name drugs purchased at retail pharmacies than Medicaid.“There is no rational reason why Medicare pays nearly three times more than Medicaid and about twice as much as the VA for the same exact medicine,” said Sanders. “Negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies will substantially reduce the price of prescription drugs, and it is a national embarrassment that the Secretary of Health and Human Services is prohibited from doing that on behalf of the more than 40 million Americans who get their prescription drug coverage from Medicare Part D. It is time for Congress to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and require Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices.”The CBO study found that, for a sample of 176 top-selling brand name drugs, the average net price for a 30-day supply of medicine was $118 in Medicaid, compared to $343 in Medicare Part D. For a subset of specialty drugs, which typically treat chronic, complex, or rare conditions, the average price was $1,889 in Medicaid, compared to $4,293 in Medicare Part D.The study also noted that Medicare Part D pays roughly 25 percent more than the Department of Defense’s TRICARE program for the same drugs in retail settings; when compared to the prices the agencies pay to directly purchase brand-name drugs, Medicare Part D pays nearly twice as much as TRICARE and the Department of Veterans Affairs.These findings complement a recent Government Accountability Office report commissioned by Sen. Sanders which found that Medicare paid twice as much as the VA for a sample of brand name and generic drugs in 2017, on average.In the last Congress, Senator Sanders sponsored the Prescription Drug Price Relief Act (S. 102), which would cut prescription drug prices in half by pegging prices in the United States to median drug prices in five major countries: Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Japan.Read the report here.U.S. Senate332 Dirksen Building, Washington, D.C. 20510Phone: 202-224-5141Fax: 202-228-07761 Church St.3rd Floor,Burlington, VT 05401Toll-free: 800-339-9834Phone: 802-862-0697Fax: 802-860-6370 First Name *
