of Letter (PDF)Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.) joined Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), and
Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in sending a letter to Senate Appropriations
Committee leadership urging them to provide additional humanitarian assistance
funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Emergency Food and
Shelter Program (EFSP) in the upcoming Continuing Resolution.As some state governors continue to engage in political stunts with the
lives of asylum seekers arriving at the border, EFSP funds will ensure that
non-governmental organizations, states, and local communities are able to
provide adequate support services, including food, shelter, transportation, and
access to basic health care. Without additional EFSP funding, NGOs and
communities that have been providing critical services for years may be forced
to scale back or cease operations.“As you consider the FY 2023 Continuing Resolution, we urge you to include
the White House’s anomaly request for the Emergency Food and Shelter Program
(EFSP). Additionally, we request that you consider providing additional funding
for this account based on the increased needs of the grantees providing
humanitarian assistance and critical services for asylum seekers,” wrote
the lawmakers. “Congress has an opportunity to reaffirm its commitment
to protecting migrants and the right to seek refuge by extending funding for
EFSP. Furthermore, Congress must ensure that communities have the tools
necessary to treat migrants fairly and humanely as they flee violence and
instability.”In addition to Senators Warren, Padilla, Durbin, and Markey, the letter is
also signed by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Kyrsten Sinema
(D-Ariz.), and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.).Senator Warren has long led efforts to protect the rights of migrants and
asylum seekers, including the following steps:

merger is just the latest threat to consumers in this long string of mergers.”Text
of Letter (pdf)Washington, D.C.— United States Senator Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.) sent a letter to Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, urging
the Department of Transportation (DOT) to use its full statutory authority to
address consolidation in the airline industry and expressing serious concerns
about the proposed merger between JetBlue and Spirit Airlines. In the letter,
Senator Warren points out that DOT has significant and historically
underutilized authorities to protect competition in air travel and highlights
how the JetBlue-Spirit deal is likely to reduce competition and harm the public
interest. “I write to ask the DOT to use its full statutory authority to address
consolidation in the airline industry and to express my serious concerns about
the proposed merger between JetBlue and Spirit Airlines announced in July. DOT
has significant and historically underutilized authorities to protect
competition in the domestic air travel market to ensure any route transfers are
‘consistent with the public interest,’ and I urge you to consider utilizing
these authorities as you continue your commendable consumer-protection
efforts,” wrote Senator Warren. Airline industry competitiveness is in free fall, and consumers are feeling
the consequences. Today, the four largest airlines—American, Southwest, Delta,
and United—control 80% of the domestic market, more than at any point in the
modern history of commercial aviation. This dominance has been achieved through
a series of airline mega-mergers that have reduced service quality and
increased fares, and has contributed to the increase in delays, cancellations,
and involuntary rebookings that airline passengers experience today. Consumer
complaints to DOT have increased more than 300 percent from pre-pandemic levels,
and air fares have outpaced inflation.Title 49 explicitly grants DOT the authority to block any transfer of a
route-operating certificate if such a transfer would not be “consistent with
the public interest.” Moreover, in determining whether a transfer is consistent
with the public interest, DOT is required to consider whether any transfer
“prevent(s)...anticompetitive practices” and “avoid(s) unreasonable industry
concentration, excessive market domination, monopoly powers, and other
conditions that would tend to allow at least one air carrier or foreign air
carrier unreasonably to increase prices, reduce services, or exclude
competition in air transportation.” By interpreting its authority more narrowly
than the statute supports, DOT has, in the past, significantly hindered its
ability to promote open competition in the airline industry.Moving forward, the Senator urges DOT to use its full statutory authority to
(i) issue rules with bright-line standards for when transfers harm the public
interest or airline competition and (ii) disapprove any transfers that harm the
public interest or airline competition, effectively blocking anticompetitive
airline mergers. These actions would allow DOT to ensure that M&A activity
in the airline industry is not stifling competition.In July 2022, Senator Warren and Senator Padilla sent a letter
to DOT, urging DOT to fully utilize its statutory authority to protect
consumers in the airline industry and hold airlines accountable for delayed and
canceled flights. In March 2022, Senator Warren led her colleagues in a letter
to Jonathan Kanter, Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division in
the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and DOT, expressing concerns about
Frontier Airlines’ proposed acquisition of Spirit Airlines. Senator Warren has
been urging the Biden administration to closely scrutinize potential
anti-competitive mergers in diverse industries. In the past year, Senator
Warren has sent letters about the proposed mergers of Sanderson-Wayne,
WarnerMedia-Discovery,
and Amazon-MGM. ###

of Hearing Exchange (YouTube)Washington, D.C. – At a hearing of the Senate Armed
Services Committee today, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) questioned
General Anthony Cotton, nominee for STRATCOM commander, on the importance of
civilian control in nuclear weapons policy and whether it is appropriate for
the military to publicly lobby against the president, the commander in chief.
Senator Warren also asked the general about how he would handle so-called
“unfunded priorities” that become wish lists to boost the Pentagon’s
budget. Transcript: Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing
to Consider the Nomination of General Anthony Cotton to be STRATCOM commander
U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services
Thursday, September 15, 2022Senator Elizabeth Warren: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and
congratulations again on your nomination, General Cotton. So if confirmed, you’ll
head U.S. Strategic Command, which will place you in charge of our nuclear
weapons. I’d like to continue the conversation we had in my office about the
importance of civilian control. Last week eight former secretaries of defense
and five former chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff released an open letter
calling for a recommitment to principles of civilian control, which they called
and I want to quote them here, “the bedrock foundation of American democracy”
unquote. The letter repeatedly emphasizes that policy decisions are ultimately
up to the president, civilian political appointees, and Congress.  So General Cotton, can you start us out this morning by saying a word about
your views on whether policy decisions – including ones about nuclear programs
– should be made by civilians, rather than generals?General Anthony Cotton, Nominee to be Commander of United States
Strategic Command (STRATCOM): Policy is made by civilians ma’am. Senator Warren: And you are committed to that firmly?General Anthony Cotton: And I am committed to that firmly.Senator Warren: You know, I appreciate your emphasizing
this point. It’s the president’s job to determine the nuclear policy of the
United States. But sometimes people who are in the role that you’ve been nominated
for seem to get confused on that. For example, your predecessor Admiral Richard
stated publicly that he thought the Biden administration should adopt the Trump
administration’s nuclear policy. And then he and his office actively lobbied
Congress against cuts to the nuclear spending programs contained in the Biden
administration’s budget – the budget the President put forth and the Secretary
of Defense came to this committee to defend.So General Cotton, if confirmed, do you think it would be appropriate for
you or your office to publicly lobby against the positions of the president and
the Secretary of Defense?General Cotton: No ma’am. And you remember we had this
conversation – the caveat that we agreed to was, you know, I would always,
especially for this committee, be allowed to offer my best military
advice. Senator Warren: And your best military advice, but policy
is done by the generals?General Cotton: Policy is not made by generals. Senator Warren: Alright, thank you. We’re counting on you to
give your best military advice to the president, to the secretary, or Congress
whenever you’re called on to do so. But it’s wildly inappropriate to try to box
in the commander in chief on nuclear policy or to try to undermine his budget.Now, one of the big ways that military leaders lobby for more spending –
even when it directly contradicts the president’s priorities – is through
so-called “unfunded priorities” lists. These are wish lists are required by
law, but have grown to be tens of billions of dollars and are being used by the
services and the commands to game the budget process. I don’t think they ought
to exist at all. General Cotton, do you agree that your command’s top priorities should
actually be reflected in the budget you submit, rather than in an extras list?General Cotton: Senator, I think our requirements lists
that we present should be included and coverage down and if our budget is
short, as the commander, my job is to ensure that I can execute my mission with
the dollars that I’ve been given.Senator Warren: Alright so I want to make sure I understand
you because you’re saying your priorities should be in the budget and extras
should be just that. Extras, not your priorities. Is that right?General Cotton: As a MAJCOM Commander today, my priorities
are in my budget. Senator Warren: Good! I like to hear that. It’s no secret
that both President Biden and I want to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in
our national security strategy. Spending $634 billion just on nuclear weapons
over the next 10 years is unaffordable. But I think even my colleagues who
disagree with me on nuclear policy would agree we should be asking DoD to write
budgets that reflect their actual priorities and that’s what it is that I am
driving for here and want to make sure that we do. I look forward to working
with you, General. Thank you Mr. Chairman.

of Hearing Exchange (YouTube)Washington, D.C. – At a hearing of the Senate Banking,
Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
called out giant fossil fuel companies and their trade association, the
American Petroleum Institute, for lobbying to weaken the Securities and
Exchange Commission’s (SEC) proposed climate risk disclosure rule, which would
require companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuel industry groups are lobbying to drop Scope 3 disclosures from
the final climate risk disclosure rule, which would require companies to
disclose upstream emissions from the production of the things they buy and
downstream emissions from what they sell. Scope 3 emissions comprise nearly 90%
of fossil fuel companies’ emissions. Not requiring Scope 3 emissions disclosures
would enable companies to hide the vast majority of their exposure to climate
risk from regulators and investors.Senator Warren called on SEC Chair Gary Gensler to protect investors and
stand up to fossil fuel lobbying by issuing a strong climate risk disclosure
rule quickly. Senator Warren has led the push for the SEC to issue a strong climate risk
disclosure rule: Transcript: Oversight of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission
U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs
Thursday, September 15, 2022Senator Elizabeth Warren: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In
March, the SEC proposed a climate risk disclosure rule that takes a big step
toward increasing the efficiency of the economy and financial markets by requiring
companies to inform investors about the climate-related risks that affect their
businesses. Now, as part of this rule, the SEC proposes that companies disclose their
greenhouse gas emissions and companies' emissions are classified into three
different categories called Scopes. So, Chair Gensler, just so we can set a baseline here, let's run through an
example. Let's say I'm Exxon.My Scope 1 emissions would be from things like my company's vehicles and
methane leaks that occur at the wellhead of the wells that I own.Scope 2 emissions would be those from electricity I purchase, for example,
in order to power my operations. Scope 3 would cover upstream emissions from the production of what I buy,
like the chemicals I use to refine my oil into gasoline or diesel fuel, and the
downstream emissions from what I sell, like the refined gas or the diesel my
customers buy at the pump. Do I basically have that right, Chair Gensler? Gary Gensler, Chair, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission:  Yes.Senator Warren: Good. So you need all three Scopes, because
otherwise a company could just stop doing the filthiest part of their business
and hire some smaller non-reporting company to do the same filthy work, and
then report themselves as greener. So Chair Gensler, for a fossil fuel company like Exxon, what percentage of
their total emissions are Scope 3 emissions?Chair Gensler: I suspect you might know better than I,
I  haven't looked, but it's often over half. It could well be in some
companies. I don't know Exxon, some companies it's as much as 90%.Senator Warren: Well, you're close on that last number.
According to an S&P Global analysis, about 88% of the emissions of these
fossil fuel companies like Exxon are Scope 3 emissions. So in other words, oil
and gas companies have Scope 3 emissions that on average, as you say, it's
about 90% of their total emissions. Now, the rule the SEC proposed in March already gives companies, in my view,
way too much wiggle room in disclosing Scope 3 emissions. But evidently, that
wiggle room is not enough benefit for Exxon. They and their trade association,
the American Petroleum Institute, have been fiercely lobbying the SEC to drop
Scope 3 disclosures entirely from the final rule. So Exxon wants to change the SEC proposal so the company would have to tell
about emissions when their own work trucks were on the road, but not about
emissions from all the other trucks that are fueled by Exxon diesel when they
are on the road. Or to say it another way, companies like Exxon don't want to
have to tell investors or the public about nearly 90% of their emissions.And if Exxon and the American Petroleum Institute get their way, investors
would remain in the dark about how companies would be affected down the line,
when policymakers get serious about tackling climate change, and, for example,
put significant restrictions on trucks that are powered by fossil fuels. So Chairman Gensler, if a company discloses only 12% of their total
emissions to investors, do you think that investors have all of the information
that they need in order to evaluate whether or not that company is well
positioned to succeed in a greener economy with much stricter regulations on
emissions?Chair Gensler: So I look at it this way, that many
companies today are already making commitments about all three of these Scopes.
More or making commitments about Scopes 1 and 2, but many are also making
commitments. And our proposal was, if you're making a public commitment about
how you're managing it, you ought to measure it, because how do you manage
that, what you don't measure? And then we also said if it was material, using a Supreme Court test of
materiality that you would have to measure it, but we did get a lot of comments
on this as you're right.Senator Warren: So I understand this. But the question I'm
asking you is actually much narrower. It's a straightforward investor question.
If climate emissions are going to become more important in valuing businesses as
the regulatory environment changes, if you only have to disclose 12% of your
emissions, does an investor have the information they need to make a good
investment decision?Chair Gensler: So again, I'll quote from our comment file.
If we look at the top 3 or 400, investor letters that we got that manage tens
of trillions of dollars of assets, most, I don't remember the percent, most are
supportive to have all three Scopes art of this disclosure. So that's straight
from the investors rather than from me.Senator Warren: Actually, and I think that's exactly the
right point, because for months now, the big banks, the pension funds, and the
investment management companies have been asking for this Scope 3 information
because it is crucial to making good investment decisions. I appreciate that you are working to protect investors and not some
particular industry because that is the job of the SEC and we are counting on
you to do that. Thank you.

http://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-on-senate-floor-warren-stops-republican-attempt-to-block-student-loan-cancellation-for-working-people,"Washington, D.C. – In case you missed it,
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) objected to the Republican Party’s
shameful attempt to keep working Americans buried under mountains of student
debt. Senator Warren celebrates President Biden’s decision to cancel up to
$20,000 of federal student debt for as many as 43 million Americans with
incomes under $125,000 as a historic step to deliver life-changing relief to
working families and help rebuild the middle class.Watch Senator Warren’s full remarks HERE:Mr. President, reserving the right to object. This is a shameful attempt by
Republicans to keep working Americans buried under mountains of student
debt. President Biden’s decision to cancel up to $20,000 of federal student debt
for as many as 43 million Americans with incomes under $125,000 a year is an
historic step to deliver life-changing relief to working families and to help
rebuild the middle class. Senator Scott’s bill is just one of Republicans’ desperate efforts to block
cancellation for millions of Americans. Now, Republicans are happy to pass out
tax breaks and regulatory loopholes for billionaires and giant corporations,
but they are fighting tooth and nail to keep working families from getting a
penny of relief.  Evidently Senator Scott believes that $2 trillion in Republican tax cuts
that were not paid for is fine so long as those tax cuts are aimed mostly at
millionaires, billionaires, and giant corporations. But a program that costs a
fraction as much and for which 90% of its benefits go to people earning less
than $75,000 a year is now somehow a moral outrage.  Today he claims to worry about those taxpayers who he says will shoulder
student loan cancellation, but where was Senator Scott (or then Governor Scott)
when Donald Trump and the Congressional Republicans handed out $2 trillion in
tax breaks to billionaires and giant corporations—not a penny of which were
paid for?  Where was he then?  Well, he endorsed the Trump Administration’s
plan to cut taxes for corporations and he celebrated those tax breaks for the
richest among us. He wasn’t worried about how taxpayers would pay that off, not
a word about the fairness for all the people who would bear that burden—so long
as the benefits went to the rich and the powerful.  Senator Scott has basically laid it all out there for America to see, and
that difference—helping billionaires or helping working families— and that
difference pretty much sums up Republican and Democratic differences across the
board.  If we’re cutting a break for the rich and the powerful,
Republicans in Congress are on board.  If we’re trying to help out working
people, Congressional Republicans take to their fainting couches and claim to
be soooo worried about the national debt.Student loan cancellation is very popular in America, including with a
majority of people who have no student loan debt. And that’s because there is
scarcely a working person anywhere in America today that does not know someone
who has been choking on student debt.But Republicans, evidently the Republicans in Congress, live in bubbles that
prevent them from meeting any of the millions of people out there who busted
their tails, who worked multiple jobs, who made their payments and who still
watched their debt loads continue to climb.So let me just set the record straight here. I want to repeat an earlier point: nearly 90% of relief dollars from
President Biden’s cancellation will go to Americans earning less than $75,000 a
year.  And none—none—of the help goes to people making more than $125,000
a year.Now actually, those numbers shouldn’t be shocking: think about who owes
student debt. Senator Scott talks about Harvard multiple times in his speech.
But it’s not wealthy people who go to Ivy League schools who end up with the
student loan debt. It’s middle- and working-class Americans who were born into
families who couldn’t afford to pay out of pocket.In fact, 99.7% of borrowers did not attend an Ivy League school. At the
University of Florida – this would happen to be, what, three tenths of one
percent of people who went to Ivy League schools borrowed money. By comparison
– I just looked it up while the Senator was speaking – at the University of
Florida, 15% have to borrow in order to make it through to graduation. At
Florida State, 26% – that's one in every four people at Florida State has to
take out money in order to be in college. And at Florida A&M, the numbers
are even higher – 68%, more than two-thirds of the people who are in school,
have to take out money in order to make it through college. And this is true
across the country. At state schools, about half of all students have to borrow
to make it through. At Historically Black colleges and Universities, the number
is about 90%.So let’s be really clear about who exactly Congressional Republicans are
trying to take relief away from. It’s not Ivy League doctors and lawyers. Who
are the people that Senate Republicans say aren’t worthy of the kind of help
that billionaires and giant corporations could get in their big tax
package?  Who do Senate Republicans think should be squeezed harder? 
Who do Senate Republicans say should simply be left behind?Well, Senate Republicans want to leave behind the 42% of borrowers who do
not even have a four-year college diploma. These are folks who took out money,
loans in order to become a nurse’s aide, to become a mechanic, to go to beauty
school, to get their commercial driver’s license to drive a truck. And too
often, the wages that they were promised never materialized. Senate Republicans
say let them struggle, leave them behind. So who gets the most help under President Biden’s debt cancellation? Senator
Scott said, this is all about doctors and lawyers. Let's take a look at that.
The share of student loan borrowers who earned a cosmetology certificate is
about double the share of borrowers who got professional degrees in law and
medicine combined. Senate Republicans say let those cosmetology certificate
holders struggle. Leave them behind.Similarly, there are more student loan borrowers who took out debt to earn a
certificate for driving trucks and working on the railroad than those who did
so to become dentists and optometrists. Senate Republicans say let those truck
drivers and railroad workers struggle. Leave them behind.And it’s not just people who have two-year degrees or certificates who get
help under President Biden’s cancellation. It’s people who don’t have any
degree at all. These are people who did everything our country asked them to do
by graduating from high school and advancing their education. But life
happened, they got pregnant, or had to take care of a sick family member, and they
had to leave before finishing their degree. Senate Republicans say let them
struggle. Leave them behind.Who gets help? It’s women, who hold nearly 2/3 of all outstanding student
loan debt. Black women, in particular, shoulder a disproportionate amount of
the student debt burden. Black women who hold more debt than any other group.
Senate Republicans say let them struggle. Leave them behind.Who gets help? It’s Black Americans, who borrow more money to go to college,
borrow more money in college, and have a harder time paying it off after
college. They are the ones who will see their debt eliminated under President
Biden’s cancellation plan.  Senate Republicans say let them struggle.
Leave them behind.Who gets help? It’s the 50% of Latino borrowers with debt who will see their
student loan debt completely eliminated. Senate Republicans say let them
struggle. Leave them behind.Who gets help? It’s the millions of people who couldn’t save for retirement,
or buy their first home, or start a family because of student debt. 
Senate Republicans say let them struggle. Leave them behind.We’re living in a moment when the President of the United States has reached
out, literally, to tens of millions of families, and said, I’m putting
government on your side.But the Congressional Republicans are determined to make this country work
even better for the rich and the powerful — and that’s why they’re trying to
pass the bill that Senator Scott has advanced. These Republicans are all for
giving handouts to giant corporations and billionaires, but the minute – the
minute – that our country creates a little breathing room for the millions of
hard-working people whose biggest sin is they tried to get an education and
they grew up in a family that just couldn’t afford to pay for it, those Senate
Republicans are right here on the Senate floor trying to undo it.So I want to take a minute and look at the bigger picture, to see how we got
here. We have a student debt crisis because our government stopped investing in
higher education and began shifting the cost of college onto working families.I went to a great public university that cost $50 a semester — a price I
could pay on a part-time waitressing job. I got to become a teacher and a law school professor, a United States senator
because higher education opened a million doors for a kid like me. But that
opportunity no longer exists in America.  Today college costs thousands, even tens of thousands of dollars. And instead of investing taxpayer dollars to bring down those costs, the
state governments reduced their financial support and the federal government
told everyone to borrow the money they needed to cover the rising costs of
going to school.And that has left millions of people drowning in student loan debt.What’s worse? Families have had to navigate a broken student loan system
riddled with bad actors who were trying to take advantage of and profit off
keeping them in debt. During the Trump years, Betsy DeVos, the Secretary of
Education, threw in with the for-profit schools, and when students who had been
cheated asked for some help, she turned her back.  I have long pushed for more accountability and more oversight to bring down
the cost of college and to make higher education and training programs more
accessible. I have a plan for that—in fact, I have more than one plan for that
and I welcome any Republican to join me in helping make any of these options
reality.But cancellation is the first step to fixing a broken student loan system
and to delivering relief to families that have been trapped in it for too long.One final point: the President’s plan to cancel student debt will make a
huge difference for tens of millions of Americans in their day-to-day
lives.  But it will do so much more.  Debt cancellation is about
strengthening our whole economy.  Better educated workers make us a wealthier nation and one with more
opportunity, not just for those at the top, but more opportunity for
everyone. Just consider one example: Following World War II, a grateful nation said to
returning GIs that taxpayers would pick up the cost of college and technical
training.  More than 2 million veterans went to college or graduate school, and nearly
6 million used this opportunity to pursue vocational training to become
construction workers, electricians, mechanics, and other careers. Together
these men—and they nearly all were men—built America’s middle
class.  Taxpayer investments in post-high school education meant that millions of
people were better educated and they helped fuel an economic boom that lasted
for decades and lifted this entire nation.  And it was a bargain: every
dollar that was spent on educating our veterans generated seven dollars to taxpayers—and
that’s not even accounting for the significant boost to productivity from a
more educated population.  Just think about that. A seven-to-one payoff
for investing in higher education.And President Biden saw something he could do to help tens of millions of
Americans struggling under the weight of student debt and invest in the future
of our economy.  So he did it. Debt cancellation was the right thing to do. And that’s why the majority of
Americans – with or without loans – support cancellation.I’m celebrating because cancellation will provide life-changing relief for
working families across this country. And that’s why I object to the Senate
Republicans’ shameless attempt to deny them this relief they need.Thank you, Mr. President.

Products and the Impacts to Workers”
U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs
Tuesday, September 13, 2022Senator Elizabeth Warren: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So last month, President Biden made the historic decision to cancel up to
$20,000 in student loan debt. This is going to deliver life-changing relief for
as many as 43 million middle-class, working class Americans. It’s going to be
nurses, truck drivers, nail technicians, and millions of people who weren’t
able finish their degrees. So while families breathe a sigh of relief, corporations that made billions
off a broken student loan system are now busily laying new traps in a
shameless, last-ditch effort to try to line their pockets.Navient, one of the world’s largest and worst loan servicers, is now leading
the way. According to reports, immediately after the cancellation was
announced, Navient sent multiple emails to borrowers encouraging them to
refinance their federal loans under Navient’s private lender, NaviRefi, with
the promise of lower interest rates. Now Ms. Gittleman, your organization has a long history of protecting
consumers from student debt scams, so I want to ask you. Let’s say a borrower
decides to take Navient up on their offer and refinances their federal loans
with a NaviRefi tomorrow. What would this mean for cancellation under President
Biden’s plan?Ms. Rachel Gittleman, Financial Services Outreach Manager, Consumer
Federation of America: Thank you Senator Warren for the question. If
they refinance with NaviRefi, then they will essentially be replacing their
federal student loans with a private student loan. Because only federal student
loans are eligible for cancellation, that means they may no longer be eligible
for that cancellation. That’s a huge loss for borrowers eligible for
cancellation, but Navient only mentioned this in the fine print at the bottom
of those emails. Senator Warren: So they could be forfeiting $10,000 to
$20,000 worth of debt cancellations. In other words, right after the President
announced student loan cancellation, Navient sent out millions of notices to
people who could be eligible, encouraging them to refinance so they would NOT
be eligible for debt cancellation.  Now, we don’t know at this point exactly which borrowers Navient sent these
emails to, although I’ve sent a letter asking for more information from
Naivent. But it appears that instead of sending borrowers information to help
them get the cancellation that they may be entitled to, Navient pushed
borrowers toward loans that could, at best, complicate their ability to get
cancellation.Ms. Gittleman, does Navient make more or less money if its borrowers get
their loans canceled? Ms. Gittleman: The future of Navient’s lending business
depends on its ability to take the most credit worthy people with federal
student loans and refinance them into private loans. Every borrower who was
debt-free as a result of President Biden’s action is one fewer prospective
customer for Navient. More broadly, the better the deal the federal government
offers borrowers with federal student loans, the less opportunity Navient has to
sell people its private loans. Senator Warren: So I just want to underscore what you just
said. Every borrower who is debt-free is one less borrower for Navient to
profit from. I think that was a fair summary. Is that right? So no wonder
Navient is trying to steer borrowers away from cancellation. Look, this is
outrageous behavior, and it’s why I sent letters to Navient and to other loan
servicers yesterday asking them what steps they’re taking to ensure that
consumers receive timely and accurate information about their loans and their
eligibility for cancellation.By the way, this is not the first time that Navient has been caught trying
to take advantage of borrowers.  Between 2009 and 2019, there were at
least ten incidents where Navient, or its corporate predecessor Sallie Mae, was
accused of or fined by federal and state regulators for actions that ripped off
borrowers – including steering borrowers to repayment options that actually
made it harder for them to pay back their loans, failing to report borrower
complaints, and harming disabled veterans’ credit reports.Policymakers need to keep a close eye on servicers to ensure that borrowers
are protected as they await debt cancellation, and I’m going to continue
fighting to make sure that happens.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

http://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-alongside-president-joe-biden-senator-warren-celebrates-federal-funding-awarded-to-boston-logan-airport,"Boston, MA -- Today, during an event with President Joe
Biden, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) delivered remarks celebrating
the $62 million dollar Airport Terminal Program awarded to Boston Logan Airport
for their Terminal E modernization improvements and terminal roadways. The
funding is a result of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.Full remarks below as prepared for delivery.
September 12, 2022 U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren: I’m here today with President Biden and our federal, state and local
partners to celebrate an historic investment for Boston Logan Airport. For most travelers from abroad, the Logan terminal is their first entry
point into the United States. It’s also their first impression of this country,
this Commonwealth and this city. Logan has served the airport and its
passengers well for years, but after a while, everyone needs an
upgrade.  Logan’s E Terminal was built in 1974 to serve 1.4 million passengers but saw
a whopping 5 million passengers in 2019. This $62 million in federal funding from the Infrastructure Law is part of a
bold plan to modernize the airport to not only enhance the passenger
experience, but also to help transform one of the busiest airports in the world
to one that is also environmentally cleaner and more sustainable.Funding from this grant will increase energy efficiency in Terminal E,
assist Massport in meeting its Gold LEED certification goal, and save money in
day to day operations. Critics have long said that we can either spur economic development or
address the climate crisis. But this project shows we can do both.This grant will fund 154 full time jobs during construction—good union
jobs.  That is only right:  if taxpayers are spending their money to invest in
America’s infrastructure, they have a right to know that those dollars are
supporting work that is of the highest quality from well-trained
professionals—and that means from union-certified specialists.  Taxpayers also have a right to know that their money helps support good jobs
that strengthen this economy and lift workers up instead of tearing them
down.  Unions built America’s middle class and union jobs will rebuild it.This grant will also help increase the airport's capacity, which means more
tourism for the entire Commonwealth.  And that means more people going to
our restaurants in cities and towns throughout Massachusetts—more visitors to
MassMOCA, more Europeans discovering the Berkshires, more tourists visiting each
of our beautiful ocean-front communities.  It also means more business
travel and more business for the companies that were hit so hard during COVID
and that are still recovering from the pandemic. And the best news is that there is more federal help on the way. 
Massachusetts will receive billions of dollars in additional funding for our
highways, roads, transit and bridges. Boston is the site of today’s
celebration, but it is critical that we work with the new state government to
improve infrastructure in every part of this state.    The Democrats in Congress recently passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which
is the boldest environmental bill of our lifetime.  We could not get a
single Republican vote, but we went ahead with a plan that will cut emissions
by 40%--a 40% cut in less than eight years.  It will also create 9 million
new jobs.  And it is paid for with my 15% minimum tax on billionaire
corporations!  But that isn’t all we should be celebrating.  Congress passed the CHIPS
and SCIENCE Act which will nearly double funding for the National Science
Foundation and other critical research work.  That investment will drive
innovation for decades to come.  And while we’re talking about investing in our future, I want to mention
something that Congresswoman Pressley and I have been working on with the
President for a long time – we’ve finally taken a big step to help people with
their student loan debt.This is all thanks to President Biden and to those of us on this stage who
try hard to work together and who share a vision for an America in which
opportunity is not reserved just for the richest among us, but is an American
that builds opportunity for all our people.

unconscionable: just weeks after President Biden announced his plans to provide
student loan relief for millions of borrowers, Navient is attempting to place
them into refinanced loans that are ineligible for relief.”Text of
Letters (PDF)Washington D.C. – U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
and Representative Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) sent a letter to the nine federal
student loan servicers to inquire about the steps they are taking to ensure
that borrowers are receiving accurate and timely information about President
Biden’s cancellation of up to $20,000 of student loan debt, and other upcoming
changes to the student loan system. They also sent a separate letter to Navient
Corporation (Navient) in response to reports that Navient is attempting to scam
borrowers out of student debt relief by encouraging them to refinance their
loans under Navient’s private lender, NaviRefi.  “As borrowers await further guidance from the Department of Education about
President Biden’s historic decision to cancel up to $20,000 in student debt for
as many as 43 million borrowers, we are profoundly troubled by reports that
Navient is providing grossly misleading guidance to borrowers that could make
them ineligible for loan forgiveness under the President’s plan,” said
the lawmakers.“Following President Biden's life-changing action to cancel student debt for
millions of Americans, Navient appears to be misleading and misinforming
student borrowers on their options – potentially keeping borrowers indebted
with private loans while federal relief is in sight,” said Senator
Elizabeth Warren. “Alongside Congresswoman Pressley, I’m working to
ensure federal borrowers receive accurate information regarding student debt
cancellation and will continue oversight throughout the implementation of this
policy.”“We’re putting the servicers on notice,” said Representative Ayanna
Pressley. “It’s imperative that servicers provide borrowers with
accurate and up-to-date information on their student loans. Thanks to President
Biden's plan to cancel student debt, millions are now eligible for meaningful
student loan debt cancellation and we need to ensure it is administered
efficiently and felt by as many people as possible. Senator Warren and I want
answers.”Following President Biden’s historic decision to cancel student loans for 43
million Americans, student loan servicers will be critical partners in ensuring
that borrowers receive this life-changing relief, both leading up to and during
the implementation of these reforms. Sen. Warren has a long track record of
conducting oversight of federal student loan servicers, revealing that
servicers like Naveint have a track record of communicating incorrect and
misleading information to borrowers. Even prior to the president’s
announcement, two servicers mistakenly notified some borrowers that their
payments were due in September. Navient sent multiple emails to borrowers following the cancellation
announcement offering refinancing options that would result in borrowers losing
eligibility for  the benefits offered by the President’s plan.“Servicers must ensure that they are appropriately staffed to handle the
increased volume of borrowers calling to get information about the
administration’s recent announcements, that they are providing accurate
information to borrowers, that they have strong systems in place to ensure
balances and payments are adjusted accurately, and that borrowers are notified
about these changes on a timely basis,” said the lawmakers.Senator Warren and Representative Pressley are asking the loan servicers to
provide clear answers to ensure that these companies are prepared to help
borrowers and properly manage their loans as the administration works to
implement student debt cancellation and reform the repayment system.Senator Warren is one of the nation’s leading voices for student loan
borrowers and has a long track record of conducting oversight of federal
student loan servicers:

of Letter (PDF) Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), members of the Senate Banking Committee, Sherrod
Brown, Chair of the Senate Banking Committee, and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.),
Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) sent a letter to Meta CEO Mark
Zuckerberg, requesting information about the company’s efforts to combat
cryptocurrency scams and hold bad actors accountable for cryptocurrency fraud
on its platforms. “Data from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) shows that scams involving
cryptocurrency are becoming increasingly prevalent on social media. From
January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022, 49% of fraud reports to the FTC
involving cryptocurrency specified that the scam originated on social media,” wrote
the senators. “Alarmingly, these scams cost consumers a staggering
total of $417 million and take many forms, from ‘investment scams’ where
consumers are promised huge returns and have their investments stolen, to
‘romance scams’ where fraudsters create fake profiles to build a relationship
with their targets before scamming them.”The senators also point out how Meta’s sites are particularly popular
hunting grounds for scammers looking to defraud consumers. Of those who have
reported being scammed out of cryptocurrency on a social media website, 32%
identified the scam as having originated on Instagram, 26% on Facebook, and 9%
on WhatsApp.“Meta has previously acknowledged the potential for crypto scammers to
operate on its platforms. In fact, in January 2018, Facebook banned crypto ads,
claiming that ‘there are many companies who are advertising binary options,
ICOs and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith.’ At
the time, you claimed this policy was meant to ‘make it harder for scammers to
profit from a presence on Facebook,’” added the senators.
“This ban clearly shows that you understand the risks posed by this type of
content to users. You later partially reversed the ban on crypto ads, and more
recently expanded the list of regulatory licenses accepted in order to
advertise cryptocurrency on Facebook and Instagram. A higher level of scrutiny
is needed for this type of content.” Senator Warren is an outspoken advocate for reining in cryptocurrency to
protect consumers and the environment:

unlawfully charge patients for necessary medications and ancillary services

joined Senator Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Chris Van Hollen
(D-Md.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Edward J. Markey
(D-Mass.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) in a letter to AHIP, the trade association
representing health insurance companies, expressing concern about unlawfully
charging individuals for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medication and related
care.The Senators' letter follows a Wednesday court ruling that further threatens
affordable access to PrEP. As the legal process moves forward, the Senators
pressed the health insurance industry to abide by current law to provide
medication and ancillary services without charge.“It has been brought to our attention that enrollees in your members’ health
plans continue to be charged for necessary medications and ancillary
services—including provider consultations and laboratory services—contrary to
law and additional federal guidance issued by the Departments of Labor, Health
and Human Services, and Treasury,” wrote the Senators. “We
write to express our deep concern with these erroneous and unlawful charges, and
to request additional information on steps that AHIP is taking to ensure that
its members adhere to federal law and ensure the PrEP drugs and the full scope
of PrEP ancillary services are offered without charge to enrollees.”A 2019 ruling by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) gave PrEP
an “A” rating as prevention intervention for people at risk of Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and under the Public Health Service Act insurance
coverage is required for services or interventions.  The Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued guidance in July 2021 that
further clarified the USPSTF ruling. Noting that “plans and issuers must cover
PrEP consistent with the USPSTF recommendation without cost sharing,” the
ruling goes on to clarify that PrEP is not just the medication, but also all of
its necessary related services including testing, screening, and provider
visits. Despite this ruling and subsequent clarification, individuals are still
being wrongly charged out-of-pocket expenses relating to their PrEP care.“In light of this clear guidance from CMS, we are alarmed by continual
reports that patients are routinely billed, either for payment-in-full or for
cost-sharing practices, related to medically-appropriate medications and essential
services,” they continued. “These costs can be daunting. HIV
advocates and clinical workers across the county have reported that many
patients are unaware that they do not have to pay out-of-pocket for PrEP and
ancillary services, assuming that many of these costs are simply necessary for
being on PrEP medication.”The Senators’ letter highlights the inequities in PrEP uptake across
communities at higher risk for HIV—including Black and Hispanic communities and
transgender women—due to limited access to financial resources needed to cover
costs of PrEP and associated medical visits and laboratory tests, among other
factors.In light of these concerns, the lawmakers ask clarifying questions and
request a response from AHIP within 30 days.### "

science research — and must do more
September 7, 2022
By Elizabeth WarrenBasic scientific research opens doors to understanding our world from the
smallest nanoparticles to the largest faraway universes. New discoveries can
improve lives and help us confront the extraordinary challenges we face.
Research is also an engine of innovation and economic development. Basic
scientific research quite literally lays the foundation for our future. Those
of us who live in the Commonwealth can take pride in how Massachusetts leads
the way in carrying out this critical work.   It should be no surprise that since I came to the Senate, I’ve pushed hard
to increase federal support for science. Now it has happened.  On August 25, President Biden signed into law the CHIPS and Science Act,
which authorizes an additional $81 billion in National Science Foundation (NSF)
funding over the next five years, nearly doubling their budget. The law also pours
tens of billions more into research and development across other government
agencies. This funding will support Massachusetts researchers working in
groundbreaking new areas, and will help translate
their basic research into immediate applications. This support is a strong
step in the right direction.  For decades, Massachusetts has been a national leader in transforming
federal dollars into cutting-edge research. Last year alone, researchers in the
Commonwealth were awarded nearly $565 million in competitive NSF grants, surpassing
every other state except California.Since I took office in 2013, NSF has awarded funding to nearly 8,000
Massachusetts projects. Meanwhile, the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
which supports basic research in the biomedical field, has granted funding for
another roughly 50,000 projects in Massachusetts.These dollars go to researchers and scientists at Massachusetts colleges and
universities, laboratories, and hospitals to support cutting-edge research on
everything from building better robots to stopping viruses in their tracks. So
far this year, Massachusetts researchers have used federal research dollars to
develop a sticker that provides continuous
ultrasound imaging, create superior
semiconductors, and hone techniques for improving artificial
intelligence.  And each accomplishment in a laboratory or in the field
echoes throughout the economy. Experts estimate that every dollar of NIH
funding invested in scientific research generates more than twice as much in
economic returns.  Early in my academic career, I received an NSF grant for my bankruptcy
research. I learned first-hand the importance of such funding for developing a
new area of inquiry and accelerating research. Now, when I read about the plans
of other researchers, I am awed by their vision and the hope for the future
that their work represents. That’s why, ever since I’ve been in the Senate,
I’ve prioritized increasing these federal investments.During my first year in office, I called for doubling
the NSF budget and providing more
year-to-year certainty in funding. In 2016, I introduced the National
Biomedical Research Act to invest $100 billion in the NIH and the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) to fund research for disease prevention, diagnosis,
and treatment over the next 10 years.  I also championed a proposal to fund massive new investments in clean energy
research by establishing a National
Institutes for Clean Energy, modeled after the NIH, at the Department of
Energy. And I’ve pressed for a greater investment to increase racial and gender
diversity in the scientific workforce and changes to address the many
inequities in who gets federal research grants. I’ve also tried to build
bipartisan support for scientific research by, for example, enlisting former
Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich to come back to Congress in 2015
to join me to urge Congress to increase our research budgets. During the nearly 10 years that I’ve been in the Senate, we’ve secured some
important victories. Annual budget increases that I’ve pushed for have
increased NSF funding by over 28 percent since 2013. In 2017, I led
a successful effort to lock an additional $100 million in NIH funding in a
bipartisan spending deal. Today, NIH funding is nearly $17 billion higher than
when I took office. The Inflation Reduction Act, which the President signed
into law last month, will nearly double support for research in the years to
come. With the passage of the CHIPS bill, we will finally achieve the NSF funding
goal I laid out when I took office. Fully funded, the legislation Congress
passed last month will go a long way toward providing our nation’s top scientists
with the funding certainty they need to undertake cutting-edge research.CHIPS also contains critical reforms to address racial disparities in the
funding of federal research and to diversify STEM participation, including
through the appointment of an NSF chief diversity officer.  But the news is not all good. Despite its critical importance and powerful
economic impact, our nation has underinvested in basic research for so long
that our base rate has fallen to appalling levels. Even with these new funding
increases, federal investment in research remains only a tiny fraction of our
GDP—far below where it stood decades earlier. In the 1990s, the US was 4th in
the world in terms of R&D spending as a percentage of GDP. Today it has
fallen to 9th
place, behind advanced economies like South Korea, Japan, and Germany. Racial and gender inequities in which researchers receive federal support
for their work continue, with many talented people and important projects
squeezed out of the system. And in recent years Republicans have shown a
disturbing willingness to launch politically-motivated
attacks on scientific research. Amid the celebrations over increased support for the sciences, the years of
neglect cannot be ignored.  Now is the perfect time for Massachusetts
scientists and researchers (and senators) to make the case for continuing to
increase the federal investments that will spur more innovation and power our
economy into the future.

overturn Roe v. Wade, roughly half of women veterans in the U.S. live in states
that have or are likely to ban abortionIn July, Warren and Hirono led
colleagues to call on VA to begin offering abortion servicesVideo
of Press Conference (Twitter)Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), and Tammy Duckworth
(D-Ill.) condemned Republican attacks on the Biden administration’s landmark
announcement last
week that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) will provide abortion
care to veterans and their eligible dependents to protect the health and life
of the mother and in cases of rape or incest. The action comes after Senators
Warren and Hirono led Senators Murray, Duckworth, and 21 Democratic colleagues
in urging
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to immediately begin providing abortion
services for veterans and eligible dependents following the far-right Supreme
Court’s disastrous Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization
decision overturning Roe v. Wade.Because of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision,
nearly 400,000 women veterans of reproductive age live in states that already
or are likely to ban abortions. Prior to last week’s announcement, VA
regulations prohibited providing abortion care or abortion counseling except
under very limited circumstances. Despite the landmark step forward to protect
women’s health, Republicans have already stated they will seek to block the
VA’s efforts to provide abortion care in medical emergencies or cases of rape
or incest. Republicans in Congress have made clear they are “working to put a
stop to” the policy announced by the Biden Administration, and Alabama Attorney
General Steve Marshall has even vowed to enforce his state’s abortion ban
against VA doctors providing care in accordance with the new rule.“As Republican politicians strip away abortion rights, I'm glad that the
Biden administration and the VA are taking powerfully important steps to
protect veterans’ rights to an abortion so women, not the government, can make
decisions about their own bodies,” said Senator Warren. “I'm
going to keep working with my colleagues to ensure the VA has the tools it
needs to protect abortion care for all veterans and beneficiaries.” “Following the Supreme Court’s disastrous ruling overturning the right to an
abortion, nearly half of female veterans in this country live in states that
are certain or likely to ban abortion, which is why we led our colleagues in
calling on the VA to provide abortion services to the veterans it serves. We’re
glad to see the VA quickly heeding our calls to begin offering abortion
services in instances of rape, incest, and the life of a mother. This decision
is an important step—one that will save lives,” said Senator Hirono. “But
instead of applauding the VA, Republicans are falsely claiming that this ruling
is ‘contrary to long-standing, settled law.’ They are using fear and confusion
to sow chaos and deprive women of their fundamental rights, instead of standing
up for the veterans who have served our country. It’s shameful—and we’ll keep
fighting back every day.”“Last week, when the Biden Administration announced that for the first time
ever VA will be able to provide abortion care to ensure none of our veterans or
their eligible dependents will have to face medical emergencies, or stay
pregnant after a rape or incest, I was excited to see meaningful progress to
protect the right to abortion,” said Senator Murray. “And I
was enraged to see yet another cruel, extreme reaction from anti-abortion
Republicans who quickly made clear they want to block this proposal and take
this care away from our veterans. It should be shocking to all of us that
Republicans would put their own political ideology ahead of the wellbeing of
our veterans—those who served our country in uniform and who put their lives on
the line to keep us safe.”“I applaud Secretary McDonough’s leadership to help make sure that our
Veterans have full access to the healthcare they need—including abortions. This
decision could both save lives and enhance military recruitment and readiness,”
said Senator Duckworth. “Our Veterans—who often have higher
rates of chronic health conditions—have sacrificed the unimaginable for our
nation and the last thing they should worry about is that our country will
abandon them, risk their health and deny their fundamental rights. Just as we
owe our Veterans the right to pursue having a family however they choose, we
owe the heroes who risked everything overseas access to medically necessary
care back at home—and for some Veterans, that includes abortions—and I’ll keep
working to make sure this right is protected for all Americans.”The lawmakers were joined by Allison Jaslow, an Iraq War veteran and
co-founder of Operation Liberty, a veteran-led, nonpartisan effort to protect
the reproductive freedom of U.S. servicemembers and veterans after the Supreme
Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade.“Thanks to action from the Administration, women veterans in states like
Texas, Oklahoma, and Alabama - whether they were a patient of the VA before now
or not- will now have somewhere to turn to get the reproductive health care
that they may need, have earned, and deserve,” said Jaslow. “It's
also heartening to see in the guidance that was issued last week, how much
trust the VA is putting in patients who are seeking care, and the physicians
they are getting that care from. This is a long-overdue policy change, but a
necessary one in this moment of crisis. Make no mistake, this decision will
save lives, and lawmakers who are vowing to fight to ensure that a total ban on
abortion remains at the VA are misguided at best, and at worst, attacking
veterans healthcare in an effort to advance a broader ideological agenda.
Either way, it's unacceptable.”""Veterans and their families have always faced unique barriers to
abortion access. But following the devastating Supreme Court decision
overturning Roe v. Wade, abortion care has become even more difficult for
veterans across the country to access,"" said Lindsay Church,
Executive Director of Minority Veterans of America. ""This reality
disproportionately harms racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ people, and
service members, veterans, and their families living in poverty. The Department
of Veterans Affairs has taken critical measures to lift restrictions that once
made it impossible to get access to abortion counseling and care through VA, in
order to provide services in the cases of rape, incest, and threats to the life
and health of the patient. While we support the Department's efforts to expand
care regardless of state law, VA can and must do more to protect a patient's
right to make decisions for their own bodies, no matter their circumstance.
Veterans fought for rights they are now being denied and it's on our
policymakers to protect these rights swiftly and without delay.""As reproductive health care is under attack from the Supreme Court and
right-wing state legislatures, Senator Warren has called on the government to
use every tool to protect reproductive care and freedom:

http://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senator-warren-and-representative-sherman-reintroduce-the-nationwide-right-to-unionize-act-call-for-passage-of-the-pro-act,"Bill Text (PDF)Washington, D.C. – Today, United States Senator Elizabeth
Warren (D-Mass.), and Representative Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) reintroduced the
Nationwide Right to Unionize Act, legislation that would support the right to
unionize by prohibiting states from banning union security agreements through
“right-to-work” laws. Twenty-seven states have enacted “right-to-work” laws that prevent unions
from collecting dues from non-union members who are covered under a
union-negotiated contract. These laws make it more difficult for workers to
form unions and fight for higher wages and better working conditions in the
states that adopt them, resulting in a 5% decrease in unionization rates and a decrease
in average wages for all full-time workers of 3.1%, according to a study by the
Economic Policy Institute, or about $11,000 a year, according to a report
released by Rep. Sherman’s office.  This bill was originally introduced in 2017 by Senator Warren as the Protecting
Workers and Improving Labor Standards Act and again in 2020. A similar
proposal is included in the Protecting
the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which the lawmakers support and would
protect American workers’ right to organize and negotiate for better wages and
working conditions.“Republicans and their corporate interest backers have imposed state laws
with only one goal: destroy unions and discourage workers from organizing for
higher wages, fair benefits, and safer working conditions,” said
Senator Elizabeth Warren. “At a time when labor unions are growing in
both size, popularity, and delivering real wins for workers, Democrats are
making clear that we stand in solidarity with workers everywhere, from
Starbucks baristas to Google cafeteria workers and everyone in between.” “So called ‘right-to-work’ laws are designed to make it difficult to
organize a union,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “This
impacts not only workers who want a union – but general wage levels throughout
the state. In an ill-conceived effort to attract business, one state after
another has adopted these anti-union laws in a race to the bottom. That is why
today I’m proud to partner with Senator Warren to reintroduce the National
Right to Unionize Act – legislation I’ve introduced in every session of
Congress since 2008.”This legislation is co-sponsored by Senators Duckworth (D-Ill.), Wyden
(D-Ore.), Luján (D-N.M.), Padilla (D-Calif.), Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Gillibrand
(D-N.Y.), Booker (D-N.J.), Markey (D-Mass.), Merkley (D-Ore.), Hassan (D-N.H.),
Sanders (I-Vt.), Smith (D-Minn.), Stabenow (D-Mich.), Cardin (D-Md.), Brown
(D-Ohio), Hirono (D-Hawai’i), Baldwin (D-Wis.), and Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and
Representatives Lynch (D-Mass.), Norton (D-DC), Garamendi (D-Calif.), Cárdenas
(D-Calif.), Swalwell (D-Calif.), Moulton (D-Mass.), Speier (D-Calif.), Raskin
(D-Md.), Brownley (D-Calif.), Kildee (D-Mich.), Nadler (D-N.Y.), and Jayapal
(D-Wash.).It has received support from the following advocacy and expert
organizations: The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), AFL-CIO,
Service Employees International Union (SEIU), International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, United Steelworkers, Transport Workers Union of America,
International Union of Operating Engineers, Communications Workers of America
Union, Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union, International Federation of
Professional and Technical Engineers, International Association of Machinists,
United Food & Commercial Workers Union, and Aerospace Workers, Economic Policy
Institute, Worker Power Coalition, and National Employment Law Project.“Senator Warren’s Nationwide Right To Unionize Act would finally start
prioritizing the interests of workers in our nation’s labor laws, which have
always been stacked in the favor of employers,” said Marc Perrone,
President of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.
“The brave, essential workers who make up the UFCW can attest to the fact that
the best way to improve a workplace has always been for workers to organize,
form a union, and fight for their rights together. Right now, thousands upon
thousands of Americans are doing exactly that, and, despite all the unfair
hurdles they must overcome, workers are successfully organizing in new
industries and new workplaces. Passing this bill and rolling back decades upon
decades of anti-worker legislation would be one of the single most important
steps we can possibly take to empower the American workers that keep this
country running.”“So called “right-to-work” laws
have their roots in some of the ugliest parts of our country’s history,” said
Rebecca Dixon, Executive Director, National Employment Law Project.
“Like so many other workplace laws, “right-to-work” is a policy that was
designed to make sure that white people did not have to join unions and join
their fates and interests to those of Black workers in the South. Today, these
laws operate exactly as intended, and drive down wages and conditions of work
in far too many states where large proportions of the working class are people
of color. NELP commends Senator Warren for introducing the Nationwide Right to
Unionize Act to put an end to this policy and to ensure that all workers,
regardless of the state in which they live, can join together with their co-workers
and build power to help determine their terms and conditions of work.” ""So-called ‘right-to-work’ laws have nothing to do with guaranteeing
anyone a job – these state laws are driven by anti-worker and anti-union forces
seeking to undermine the bargaining power, wages, and the rights of working
people,” said Matthew Biggs, President of the International Federation
of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE) and IFPTE Secretary-Treasurer
Gay Henson. “Our union applauds Senator Warren for reintroducing the
Nationwide Right to Unionize Act which restores a core labor standard across
the U.S. so that all workers have the right to come together, bargain
collectively, and build union power in labor unions that have resources to
represent all members."" “We are living through an incredible moment in history where more and more
workers are increasingly interested in bringing the power of a union to their
workplaces,” said CWA President Chris Shelton. “We have an
opportunity to transform the labor movement but only if we do what is required
of us in this moment and eliminate the barriers workers face to exercise their
power. It is way past time to eliminate the right to work for less laws that
corporations have used to systematically chip away at the power of labor unions
and the ability of workers to come together and collectively fight to better
their lives and the lives of their families. We are encouraged by the
leadership of Senator Warren and all the supporters of this legislation and
committed to see it through the finish line.” ""AFGE supports the Nationwide Right to Unionize Act,” said
AFGE. “AFGE strongly supports the right of all workers to unionize in
the workplace to ensure safety, health, and equity on the job.  AFGE
applauds Senator Warren for introducing this bill which will bring us one step
closer to granting union rights to all workers.""“Across the country, working people are demanding the freedom to band
together and claim a seat at the table – in fact, the latest Gallup Poll shows
a 71% approval rating for unions,” AFSCME President Lee Saunders.
“To unrig the system and make it easier to organize, we need to repeal
so-called ‘right-to-work’ laws, which are rooted in white supremacy and allow
employers to silence the voices of working people. We applaud Senator Warren
for pushing back with the Nationwide Right to Unionize Act, which would get
these unjust laws off the books and help level the playing field for
private-sector workers.” “A recent Gallup poll showed that 71% of Americans support workers' right to
unionize - and tens of millions of Americans would join a union today if they
had the chance,” Chip Shannon, Executive Director, Worker Power
Coalition. “Right now, a wave of organizing is sweeping the nation as
workers at stores like Starbucks, Amazon, Trader Joes and Apple are standing up
and demanding their rights to collectively bargain at the workplace. For far
too long, so-called Right to Work laws have restricted workers from fully
realizing their abilities to come together in union to fight for better pay,
benefits and working conditions. The Worker Power Coalition, which represents
24 million workers from more than 40 labor and social justice organizations is
committed to updating our labor laws to better protect workers. We enthusiastically
support the Nationwide Right to Unionize Act.”As an advocate for workers, Senator Warren is an original cosponsor of the Protecting
the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. She also recently denounced the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB) proposed rule to deny workplace rights to graduate
students employed by private universities, has also cosponsored
legislation to strengthen protections for employees under federal labor
law, and has supported graduate student unionization efforts at schools in
Massachusetts, including Harvard
University and Boston
College. In addition, she has fought
for the enforcement of ethics rules at the NLRB, and strongly opposed
efforts by the NLRB to narrow its joint employer standard in the Hy-Brand case,
which was vacated after the senator raised
concerns about a conflict of interest involving a board member.

report detailing DoD and State’s failures to determine how U.S. military
support to Saudi-led coalition has contributed to civilian harm in YemenText
of Letters (PDF)Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.),
a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and U.S. Senators Bernie
Sanders (I-Vt.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) sent letters to the Department of Defense
(DoD) and the Department of State (State), calling on the Departments to
thoroughly investigate how U.S. military support to the Saudi-led coalition
fighting in Yemen may have led to civilian harm and analyze to the
effectiveness of civilian harm reduction efforts by the Saudi and Emirati
governments. The senators’ letter follows a recent Government Accountability
Office (GAO) report
which found that DoD and State have failed to determine how military support
provided by the U.S. has contributed to civilian harm in Yemen. “The United States should not contribute in any way to the suffering of
millions of innocent Yemenis caught in a devastating Saudi-led war,”
said Senator Warren. “The U.S. government has a moral and legal
obligation to ensure its actions are not exacerbating a dire humanitarian
crisis, and there is strong bipartisan support for thorough investigations into
possible U.S. complicity to civilian harm in Yemen.”For more than eight years, Yemen has suffered a devastating civil war killing
more than 150,000 people and with alarming numbers of civilian casualties. The
Saudi-led coalition has recklessly launched strikes killing nearly 15,000
innocent civilians and U.S.-origin weapons have been reportedly
used in a number of these strikes, including a 2018 strike on a school bus
that killed 40 children. Between 2015 through 2020, the U.S. provided more than
$54.2 billion in defense articles and defense services to the Saudi and Emirati
governments, in addition to nearly $650 million in military training.The senators note that under the Arms Export Control Act, DoD and
State are required to investigate potential end-use violations of arms,
including harm to civilians. However, the GAO report found that DoD has “not
fully determined the extent to which U.S. military support has contributed to
civilian harm in Yemen,” including DoD failing to fully measure the “extent to
which its advising and training [of the Saudi and Emirati governments] have
facilitated civilian harm reduction in Yemen”; and that State has “not fully
determined the extent to which U.S. military support has contributed to
civilian harm in Yemen,” including State not investigating whether U.S.
equipment was being used for “unauthorized purposes or against anything other
than legitimate military targets,” despite having indications that it was doing
so.“As the United States begins to reckon with the harm it has caused to
civilians through its own military operations, it is imperative we do the same
with the weapons we produce and send to countries abroad. A failure to reckon
with the devastation the United States may be complicit to in Yemen would
represent a failure in the Biden administration’s stated prioritization of
human rights and our core democratic values,” wrote the senators. Senators Warren, Sanders, and Lee are calling on DoD to review if its
training and advising has led to a reduction in civilian harm, and if not, to
halt the provision of support until it can assess the impact of future aid.
They are calling State to review whether the Saudi and Emirati governments are
taking necessary precautions to prevent civilian harm in Yemen, and if not, to
halt all arms sales to either country until verification that they are taking
steps to protect civilians. The senators are also calling on DoD and State to
answer a set of questions about shortcomings identified by the GAO’s report by
October 7, 2022. Senator Warren has led the call for accountability for U.S. military
operations that harm innocent civilians and to end any U.S. complicity in the
devastating Yemeni civil war:

offer abortion services after the Supreme Court overturned Roe
v. WadeWashington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.) and Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) applauded the Department of Veterans
Affairs’ (VA) announcement that it will begin offering abortion services in
certain circumstances. In July, Senators Warren and Hirono led 23 of their
colleagues to call
on VA to immediately begin offering abortion services after the far-right
Supreme Court’s disastrous Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade.
Because of the Dobbs decision, over 800,000—or half of women veterans in this
country—live in states that are certain or likely to ban abortions.“As the far-right Supreme Court and right-wing legislators work to eliminate
the fundamental right to abortion, the federal government, including the VA,
must do more to protect abortion access. That’s why we led our colleagues in
calling on the VA to provide abortion care to the veterans it serves, millions
of whom now live in states where abortion access has been restricted.“We’re glad to see the VA quickly heeding our calls to begin offering
abortion services in instances of rape, incest, and the life of a mother. This
is an important first step. The VA must go further and provide these services
to all veterans, regardless of circumstances. It’s critical that women are
trusted and free to make decisions about their bodies,” said Senators
Warren and Hirono. Veterans and CHAMPVA beneficiaries can learn more about VA reproductive
health services here.In addition to Senators Warren and Hirono, the July 28th letter was also

(PDF)Washington D.C. – U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
and Representative Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.) sent letters to the CEOs of
MasterCard, American Express, and Visa urging them to support the creation of a
new merchant category code for gun and ammunition retailers and to request
information about their reported opposition to Amalgamated Bank’s application
for such a code. “Mass shooters have repeatedly financed deadly massacres using credit cards,
and Bank CEOs need to step up to save lives,” said Senator Warren. “Financial
institutions and payment networks, such as Visa, MasterCard, and American
Express can and should do everything they can to help law enforcement prevent
some mass shootings by identifying suspicious gun purchases through the
implementation of this new code.” “By creating a new MCC for gun and ammunition retailers, credit card
companies and financial institutions can better monitor suspicious activity,
like straw purchases, and, in turn, help save lives,” said
Representative Dean. “Our nation’s gun crisis requires all of us to
act, and I urge companies like MasterCard, American Express, and Visa to
support Amalgamated Bank’s request for this code.” “A new MCC code could make it easier for financial institutions to monitor
certain types of suspicious activities including straw purchases and unlawful
bulk purchases that could be used in the commission of domestic terrorist acts
or gun trafficking schemes,” wrote the lawmakers. “Such
coordination between financial institutions and law enforcement has been
instrumental in efforts across the federal government to identify and prevent
illicit activity.”The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) maintains a series
of merchant category codes (MCC), four-digit codes that classify merchants by
their purpose of business. The ISO sets forth criteria that the internal review
committee, which includes representatives from Mastercard, Visa, and American
Express, must use when evaluating applications for new MCCs.A 2021 application from Amalgamated Bank (AB) for a new MCC for gun and
ammunition retailers was denied, as was their following appeal. AB resubmitted
an application in June of 2022 and expects a decision in September when the
committee is set to reconvene. The lawmakers have requested responses from
Mastercard, American Express, and Visa no later than September 14, 2022.The letter is endorsed by: Amalgamated Bank, Guns Down America, Giffords Law
Center to Prevent Gun Violence, and Everytown for Gun Safety.“Everyone has a responsibility to do what they can to stop gun violence. As
a bank, it is our right and responsibility to report the use of the financial
system to fuel black market gun sales and sales associated with mass
shootings,” said Priscila Sims Brown, President and CEO of Amalgamated Bank.
“Issuing a merchant category code for gun sellers will allow us to do that, and
we are confident that our pending application will be successful if Visa,
MasterCard, and American Express follow their process for creating new codes.
We are grateful to Senator Warren and Representative Dean for joining our call
on industry to adopt this common sense approach to stopping gun violence.”""It is maddening that credit card companies have refused our call to
action when we know that a number of our nation's mass shootings involved
credit card purchases,"" said Igor Volsky, founder and executive
director of Guns Down America. ""I am grateful for the leadership
of Senator Warren and Congresswoman Dean and hope that their work will shine a
spotlight on part of the financial system that can and must do better when it
comes to preventing gun violence.""“By creating a dedicated code for gun and ammunition purchases we can make
it possible to detect and deter illegal gun trafficking, prevent mass
shootings, and save lives. We applaud Senator Warren, Representative Dean and
their colleagues for calling on major credit card companies to support the
creation of this tool and stop blocking progress. It’s time for them to have
the courage to act and prevent gun violence,” said Adam Skaggs, Chief
Counsel and Policy Director at Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.“Banks should report dangerous warning signs to law enforcement when
extremists are quickly building up massive stockpiles of guns, but that first
requires ensuring gun store transactions have a unique identifier,” said John
Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety. “We applaud Senator
Warren and Representative Dean for calling on credit card companies to support
the creation of this merchant code, so banks have the tools they need to help
law enforcement intervene before warning signs turn into tragedies.”This letter was also signed by Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Ed

introduction of the Gun Violence Prevention and Community Safety Act, which

legislation in one bold, comprehensive bill that works to end the epidemic of
gun violence in America. In April 2020, Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) joined
Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Chris

ethics, lobbying, and anti-corruption reforms in Congress, the Anti-Corruption

Rifle Association and other big-money groups on Congress and pass critical
reforms to protect Americans, including common-sense gun laws.

http://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/senator-warren-urges-the-department-of-justice-to-release-new-student-loan-bankruptcy-guidance,"Text
of Letter (PDF)Washington D.C. – U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
sent a letter to the Department of Justice (DOJ)  urging DOJ to issue and
implement updated student debt bankruptcy guidance without delay following the
Biden-Harris administration’s historic decision to cancel up to $20,000 in
student debt for up to 43 million borrowers and overhaul the student loan
system.In March of this year, Senator Warren joined
a similar letter led by Senators Durbin (D-Ill), Murray (D-Wash.), and Schumer
(D-N.Y.) to DOJ and the Department of Education (ED) requesting an update on
efforts to improve how the agencies handle undue hardship claims by student
borrowers in bankruptcy proceedings. The response from DOJ indicated that DOJ
and ED “are collaborating to develop guidance for implementing [the undue
hardship standard] in a more consistent and streamlined way.” Months have
passed since the initial request and borrowers are still waiting for this
updated guidance. “The administration’s bold action to provide debt relief and reform the
student loan system for current and future borrowers underscores the urgent
need for the Department of Justice (DOJ) to do its part to ensure that
borrowers who continue to struggle with student debt have a path toward
additional relief,” wrote Senator Warren.Senator Warren also reached out to DOJ in July of this year to request a
staff-level briefing on the delay in issuing the updated guidance, only to
receive a brief email with no details about the guidance’s status. In several
instances described in the letter, borrowers have struggled to receive relief
because of the failures of the existing bankruptcy guidance and consequent
actions by DOJ and ED. “Those who do pursue undue hardship claims face aggressive litigation
challenges by the federal government that fail to acknowledge borrowers’
challenges in navigating the student loan system,” wrote Senator
Warren.Senator Warren is demanding that DOJ prioritize updating the student
bankruptcy guidance and provide clear answers about the status of its plans to
address bankruptcy discharge claims no later than September 15, 2022.Senator Warren is one of the nation’s leading voices for student loan
borrowers:

(D-Mass.) released the following statement in response to the Federal Transit
Administration report on the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA): “The
Federal Transit Administration’s report underscores what we already know: the
MBTA’s current crises are the unprecedented consequences of systemic
negligence, underinvestment, and mismanagement of Greater Boston’s public
transit system. It is shameful for the first public transportation system in
our country to have reached this entirely preventable point, where deep service
cuts and wholesale shutdowns of subway lines are deemed necessary to get the T
back on track. It is unacceptable that the MBTA has forced riders to carry the
burden of the Baker Administration’s failures.“The
FTA’s investigation and the Orange and Green Line shutdowns demonstrate our
deep need for a transit system that is truly a public good and effectively
serves the needs of the residents of Massachusetts, especially the Black,
brown, disabled, low-income, and other marginalized communities who
disproportionately ride the T. Building a safer, more accessible, and more
reliable T will require partnership from federal, state, and municipal
government offices, as well as advocates and riders who know better than anyone
how public transit shapes our lives.“While
the FTA should remain an active player in helping fix the T, the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts must take seriously its role in conducting robust safety oversight
of the MBTA by using the tools the Department of Public Utilities already has
as an oversight agency and incorporating the key perspectives of local and
municipal leaders. In Congress, we will keep fighting for bold federal
investments to make the T safe, sustainable, accessible, reliable, and free. We
are proud to have secured over $580 million in federal funding for the MBTA
this year, in addition to billions of dollars in federal formula funding that
will come to the state over the next five years, and we will continue to ensure
that Massachusetts sees the immense benefits of the Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.”

to Firefighters Grants.“Firefighters in the Commonwealth and across the country put their lives on
the line every day in order to keep our families safe, and we need to make sure
they have our full support,"" said Senator Elizabeth Warren. ""Federal
grants like these will help keep our brave first responders safe and ensure
that our local fire departments have the training, equipment, and resources
they need to continue protecting our communities.""“Massachusetts firefighters are our frontline defense against climate
disasters,” said Senator Ed Markey. “This critical funding
will ensure that fire departments across our Commonwealth have the support they
need to acquire life-saving equipment, train the next generation of first
responders, and fight back against fires and accidents that too often put
Massachusetts families in harm’s way.”“Assistance to Firefighters Grants fund critically needed investments in
fire stations across our country,” said Congressman Richard E. Neal,
Chair of the House Committee on Ways and Means. “The awards in this
round will benefit North Adams, Wilbraham, and Ludlow as well as the
communities they serve with more funding for training and lifesaving equipment.
I continue to support these programs through FEMA because we all benefit from
their investment.”“Firefighters across the Commonwealth put themselves at risk every day to
protect us, and it’s our responsibility to ensure they have the resources they
need to do their job in the safest way possible,” said Chairman James P.
McGovern. “I’m grateful that this grant will help the Northborough
Fire Department make critical equipment updates that will have a lasting impact
on the safety of our community, and I will keep fighting in Congress to make
sure we support our firefighters in every way we can.”“This federal funding for firefighters continues to be a lifeline for our
communities,” said Congressman Bill Keating. “From new
equipment to additional training, it’s imperative ensure those who protect us
are protected themselves.”“I couldn’t be more thrilled to see the fire departments in Ayer and Stow
receive this critical federal investment,” said Congresswoman Lori
Trahan. “Not only will this funding support the brave firefighters who
work around the clock to keep their communities safe, but the new vehicle
extrication and training equipment will also help save lives. I’m proud of the
work we’ve done to increase federal investments that support our brave
firefighters, and I look forward to continuing our work with local departments
to make sure they get the funding they need.”“This grant will enable Newton’s Fire Department to recruit and train more
firefighters, as well as fund mental wellness support for our front-line
responders as they work to keep our city safe,” said Congressman Jake
Auchincloss.The grants will help provide various towns in Massachusetts with funding for
firefighter training, CPR devices, and firefighter extrication equipment. This
aid was awarded to towns across the Commonwealth as part of the FY2021 Assistance
to Firefighters Grants funding from FEMA.

http://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/joint-statement-from-senator-warren-and-leader-schumer-on-president-bidens-student-loan-debt-cancellation-announcement,"Washington D.C. – U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Senate Majority
Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) released the following joint statement today
after President Biden announced his plan to cancel student loan debt. The
announcement comes after nearly two years of Senators Warren and
Schumer and others calling
for broad student loan debt cancellation.“With the flick of a pen, President Biden has taken a giant step
forward in addressing the student debt crisis by cancelling significant amounts
of student debt for millions of borrowers. The positive impacts of this move
will be felt by families across the country, particularly in minority
communities, and is the single most effective action that the President can
take on his own to help working families and the economy.“This action, along with the pause on federal student loan
payments, interest, and collections will improve borrowers’ economic security,
allowing them to invest in their families, save for emergencies, and pay down
other debt. In addition, we are pleased to see the President’s proposed work
towards greatly simplifying and expanding access to student loan relief
programs, including the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, and look
forward to additional improvements to other programs like Income Driven
Repayment, which will also allow millions more student loan borrowers to better
access existing programs to reduce their student loan debts. “No president or Congress has done more to relieve the burden of
student debt and help millions of Americans make ends meet. Make no mistake,
the work – our work – will continue as we pursue every available path to
address the student debt crisis, help close the racial wealth gap for borrowers,
and keep our economy growing.”

http://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senator-warren-statement-on-president-biden-cancelling-student-debt,"Washington, D.C. – United States Senator Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.) released the following statement after President Biden cancelled
student loan debt:“Today is a day of joy and relief because President Biden
has canceled a big chunk of student debt for as many as 43 million Americans.
The President has taken a powerful step to help rebuild the middle class.
Americans making less than $125,000 a year will receive up to $20,000 in
student loan forgiveness, transforming the lives of working people all across
this country.”“Student loan debt has held millions of Americans back from starting a
family, buying a home, saving for retirement, or creating their own businesses.
With the President's action, millions of workers—educators; municipal
employees; auto workers; food and retail workers; flight attendants; medical
workers; care workers; and many more—will breathe a little easier knowing this
burden will be lifted. Cancelling student debt will provide financial relief to
the many Americans who have been paying back student debt for over 20 years and
to seniors who have seen their Social Security checks garnished because they
fell behind on their loan payments. Because Black Americans borrow more money
to go to school, borrow more money in school and have a harder time paying their
debt off after school, the President’s action will also help narrow the racial
wealth gap in the United States among borrowers.”“The bottom line is this: Millions of working people will have a chance to
build a more secure economic future because of President Biden’s decision to
cancel student debt.”“This victory happened because thousands of Americans organized and voted
for real action to improve people’s lives. I am grateful to these organizers
for their years of hard, persistent work. They show us that we can make
democracy work and that elections matter. The first bill I introduced in the
Senate was to make student loans cheaper so that fewer Americans would get
crushed by debt. I’ll continue working with the Biden administration to reform
our higher education system and create a stronger economy for all Americans.”

Brackeen.Congress enacted ICWA in 1978 to protect the best interests of American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) children and promote the stability and security of AI/AN families and Tribal nations. ICWA sets best-practice standards and requirements for child welfare and adoption proceedings to prevent the unwarranted removal of children who are citizens of a federally-recognized tribal nation or are eligible for citizenship in a federally-recognized tribal nation from their families and tribal communities.In 2019, Senator Warren joined more than 70 members of Congress in filing a bipartisan, bicameral brief supporting ICWA in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. But in an April 2021 decision, the Fifth Circuit upheld certain sections of ICWA and flagged constitutional concerns about others, prompting appeals on both sides. The U.S. Supreme Court granted petitions to review the Fifth Circuit’s decision from the U.S. Department of Justice, intervening tribal nations, the state of Texas, and individual plaintiffs in Haaland v. Brackeen. The Supreme Court will hear the case on November 9, 2022.Senator Warren supports ICWA and recognizes its importance to Indian Country. In 2018, she cosponsored a bipartisan resolution recognizing the 40th anniversary of ICWA. During her time in the Senate, Senator Warren has also worked to protect and advance tribal sovereignty, to emphasize the federal government’s trust and treaty responsibilities to tribal nations, and to affirm Washington’s government-to-government relationship with tribal nations. On September 30, 2021, she re-introduced the Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies in the United States Act to establish a formal commission to investigate, document, and acknowledge the federal government's Boarding School Policies, which forcibly removed children from their tribal lands and families to strip Native children of their identities, cultures, and beliefs. Last year, she also introduced the American Indian and Alaska Native Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act with Senator Murkowski to protect the health and well-being of AI/AN children, and provisions of the bill were included in the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act Reauthorization Act of 2021."
http://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-grassley-praise-fdas-finalized-over-the-counter-hearing-aid-rule,"Washington, D.C. – United States Senators Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) issued the following joint statement
after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) finalized a key rule allowing
hearing aids to be sold over-the-counter, an effort they have worked on since
2017:""Five years after our bipartisan Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act became
law, consumers with mild to moderate hearing loss will finally have access to
affordable over-the-counter hearing aids,” said Warren and Grassley.
“We’ve pressed the FDA to take action every step of the way – holding both
Republican and Democratic administrations accountable – and fought back against
entrenched special interests. We are thrilled that the FDA has finalized these
guidelines and that safe, effective, accessible and affordable hearing aids
will now be available over-the-counter for millions of Americans.”In 2017, Congress passed the FDA Reauthorization Act, which
included Warren and Grassley’s Over-the-Counter
Hearing Aid Act. Their bill requires the FDA to issue
regulations establishing over-the-counter hearing aids no later than three
years from the date of enactment. The FDA finally did so last fall, more than
four years after the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act was signed into
law. The public comment period closed on January 18, 2022.At the end of June, Warren and Grassley released a comprehensive report
showing how dominant hearing aid manufacturers were attempting to diminish the
effectiveness of over-the-counter hearing aids. They also called on the FDA
commissioner to adopt a final rule that promotes competition, reduces prices
and meets high standards of safety and effectiveness.The new guidelines officially go into effect 60 days following the FDA’s
official notice today.

of Letter (PDF)Washington D.C. – U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.),
Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)
sent a letter to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler in
support of the January 2022 proposed rule regarding 10b5-1 plans that would
increase transparency and curb corporate executives’ abuse of “safe harbor” to
trade their company’s stock. The SEC created the 10b5-1 “safe harbor” in 2000 to allow corporate
executives, who often have continuous access to material nonpublic information
about their companies, to sell their stock holdings without running afoul of
insider trading laws. However, initial trades set up by 10b5-1 plans often
appear to be based on material nonpublic information, and executives can and do
modify or cancel their plans in response to inside information to increase
their own profits.“While these plans were designed to prevent insider trading, evidence
indicates that corporate insiders have misused them to obtain huge windfalls
making questionable trades at the expense of ordinary investors.” wrote
the lawmakers, “We urge you to consider additional, strong rules that
would prevent these abusive practices and protect the integrity of our capital
markets, and that you implement them without delay.” A recent report in the Wall Street Journal identified “scores of
examples where company insiders adopted a plan when a quarter was nearly complete
and sold stock under the plan before that quarter’s results were announced,”
and found that “insiders who sold within 60 days reaped $500 million more in
profits than they would have if they sold three months later,” indicating that
the abuse of 10b5-1 plans is widespread and costly, further underscoring the
urgent need for stronger rules.“Corporate insiders cannot be allowed to continue to trade based on
insiders’ knowledge with impunity,” wrote the lawmakers. “The
SEC must act swiftly to ensure that Rule 10b5-1 is no longer “viewed as a ‘get
out-of-jail-free card.’” The lawmakers are also encouraging the SEC to consider strengthening
its proposed rule by: “If corporate insiders were willing to profit off of their own failed
responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, they will likely continue to exploit safe
harbor rules to line their own pockets.” concluded the lawmakers.
“The SEC should consider all options to prevent all such abuses and finally
level the playing field for ordinary investors.”Senator Warren has long championed efforts to close loopholes and ensure the
fairness of our capital markets::

of Letter (PDF)Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
and Representative Katie Porter (D-Calif.) sent a letter to Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan in support of the FTC’s proposal to protect
consumers from deceptive tactics by auto dealers and throughout the car-buying
experience. This follows up on Senator Warren’s earlier
letter to the FTC raising concerns about unchecked deceptive advertising
practices and consumer fraud by automobile dealerships. Deceptive practices and consumer fraud in the automobile industry have
jacked up car costs, even as increased prices for new and used cars continue to
be a major driver of inflation. Dealers employ high-pressure sales tactics,
hidden fees, confusing offers for their used cars, and pressure to accept
financing proposals that put consumers at risk of scams. Widespread deceptive
practices in the automobile industry include dealers’ refusal to honor online
or previously agreed-upon prices, surprise fees, and “add-on” products used to
deceive consumers into paying higher prices.“Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, car dealerships have continued raking in
massive profits by deceiving and defrauding their customers,” said
Senator Warren. “I’m glad that the FTC is proposing this rule change
to crack down on these practices and protect consumers. ""Car dealerships use every trick in the book to rip off
Americans,"" said Representative Porter. ""The FTC's
proposed crack down on dealers' shady business practices will lower prices for
families and bring much-needed transparency, accountability, and fairness to a
complex and opaque market.""In response to the rampant fraud in the automobile industry, the FTC has
proposed a rule to prohibit deceptive advertising practices and improve disclosures
in the automobile buying process in the following ways:“Given the impact of automobile dealerships’ practices on individual
consumers, inflation, and the larger economic recovery from the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we support the FTC’s proposed rule to
prohibit deceptive advertising practices and improve disclosures in the
automobile buying process.,” wrote the lawmakers. As a champion for American consumers and a secure and healthy economy,
Senator Warren has continued oversight of corporations for their role in
misleading and defrauding consumers as Americans face record-high, economy-wide
inflation:

of Letter (PDF)Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and
Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) sent a letter to Dr. Robert Califf, Commissioner of
Food and Drugs at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), asking FDA to
initiate a post market study of pulse oximeters and seeking information about
the agency’s clearance process for pulse oximeters to ensure they are effective
across racially diverse patients and consumers. This request follows up on a
previous letter
sent by Senators Warren, Booker, and Wyden in January of last year. Recent studies have shown that inaccurate results from pulse oximeters are
more likely when used to monitor people of color, particularly patients with
darker skin. The device’s inconsistency could have life threatening
consequences for patients, and this may have been exacerbated by the COVID-19
pandemic. One particular study found that patients of color received less
supplemental oxygen than their white counterparts due to pulse oximeters’
inaccurate measurements.“There are decades of research showing inaccurate results when pulse
oximeters are used to monitor people of color, particularly patients with
darker skin,” wrote the lawmakers. “Therefore, we are seeking
information from the FDA on your clearance of pulse oximeters and urge the FDA
to initiate a post market study for these devices to understand what
improvements to the technology will make the devices effective on the full
range of human skin pigmentation.”The lawmakers commended FDA’s new safety communication about pulse oximeter
accuracy and welcomed the recent news that FDA is planning to convene a public
meeting of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee later this year. However, FDA
has yet to respond to Senator Warren’s earlier letter, sent in January 2021,
which expressed the same concern about the medical risks  people of color
face due to the inaccuracy of pulse oximeters. In addition to a post market study, the lawmakers request that the FDA
respond fully to a series of  inquiries no later than August 26, 2022.This letter is the latest in a broad series of oversight inquiries into
concerns of bias in health and medical technology disproportionately impacting
communities of color:

IG’s credulous acceptance of explanations for clearly improper behavior render
the findings of the IG’s report simply not credible”Text
of Letter (PDF) | Text
of Fed Regional Banks Letters (PDF)Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell raising concerns about the
Federal Reserve’s  (Fed) Culture of Corruption, and the Fed Inspector
General’s inadequate investigation of the trading activities by senior
officials on the Fed Board of Governors. She renewed her requests for
information about the Fed’s trading scandal, including disclosure of all trades
made by Fed governors and presidents between January 1, 2020 and the
present.  Senator Warren also sent letters to each of the presidents of
the regional Federal Reserve Banks requesting this information.In September, 2021, the Fed became embroiled in scandal amid reports that
two Federal Reserve Bank Presidents – both of whom have since stepped aside –
had actively traded individual stocks and other financial assets while helping
set key Fed policies at the height of the pandemic. Last month, the Inspector
General (IG)  released an investigation finding that former Vice Chair
Clarida’s omitted disclosures and that trades involving Chair Powell’s accounts
were made during what should have been a “blackout period.” The IG found clear
evidence of improper trading activity by these officials, and yet it accepted
uncritically the claims that these improprieties were inadvertent. The
investigation, conducted by an IG that serves at Chair Powell’s discretion, was
entirely inadequate, underscoring the need for the Fed to provide full and
complete information about Fed officials’ trades during the pandemic to
Congress and the public. “Simply put, the Fed’s refusal to answer basic questions is preventing
Congress and the public from evaluating the full extent of Fed officials’
trading in individual stocks by Fed officials, the extent to which Fed
officials were warned of the risks from their trading, and whether the plans
you announced to change the Fed’s ethics practices are sufficient to prevent
future financial conflicts of interest,” wrote Senator Warren.In the letter, Senator Warren again calls for the Fed to provide the
following information:Senator Warren has long championed stronger ethics rules that prohibit all
government officials from holding or trading stock that may be influenced by
their agency, department, or actions. She previously sent letters to Chair
Powell on October
21, 2021, December
7, 2021, and January
10, 2022 requesting that the Fed publicly release additional information
about its trading scandal, but the Fed has failed to adequately respond. In
March of this year, she also submitted three questions for the record (QFR) to
Chair Powell following up on her previous requests. She submitted an additional
QFR in June of this year asking that Chair Powell comment on a report that the
Fed had not released updated financial disclosures for the former Reserve Bank
presidents whose trading activity triggered the ethics scandal.As the ethics scandals involving top level Fed officials unfolded in
September and October of 2021, Senator Warren called
out the culture of corruption at the Fed and raised deep concerns over
conflicts of interests that have undermined public confidence in the Federal
Reserve System. She previously called
on the SEC to investigate the extent of trading activity by high-level
Federal Reserve officials and possible ethics violations. She also urged
Regional Fed leaders to follow the robust and comprehensive ethics
guidelines in her Anti-Corruption
and Public Integrity Act.

of Letter (PDF)Washington D.C. – U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland
and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco urging the Department of Justice (DOJ)
to use its authority to ban corporations that commit misconduct from government
contracting. Agencies like the DOJ have a significant but underutilized authority, known
as suspension and debarment, which allows them to bar an individual or company
from contracting with the government for a certain period of time. Entities can
be debarred for a wide range of misconduct—even misconduct that falls outside a
company’s contracting activities with the government. According to the lawmakers, the DOJ has historically failed to use this
authority and therefore “allowed unscrupulous contractors to continue ripping
off the government.” The lawmakers highlighted three examples of companies that
engaged in massive fraud against the government but were not suspended or
debarred, putting taxpayers at risk.“We cannot allow these corporate entities to continue to engage in criminal
misconduct and get by with a mere slap on the wrist,” said Senator
Warren. “The Department of Justice can and should expand its use of
these suspension and debarment authorities to protect the use of government
resources and discourage recidivism by big business.” “No one is above the law. Corporate criminals must be held accountable, and
it’s critical that the Justice Department utilizes its authority to ensure that
no one can abuse public trust,” said Senator Luján. “Along
with Senator Warren, I’m calling on the Justice Department to use its debarment
power and put an end to corporations taking advantage of the government.”To further deter corporations from committing misconduct, the lawmakers
pushed the DOJ to expand its use of debarment in the following ways:The lawmakers commended the DOJ for prioritizing corporate crime under the
Biden Administration, but insisted that the DOJ should “use all the tools at
its disposal and expand its use of the suspension and debarment authority.”“The Department has a duty to go beyond just its prosecutorial activities to
protect the government and its citizens from bad actors with a history of
misconduct,” concluded the lawmakers. “Debarment is a powerful
and underutilized tool to do so.”Senator Warren has long advocated for greater accountability for corporate
criminals. In 2019, Senator Warren reintroduced the Ending Too
Big to Jail Act and introduced the Corporate
Executive Accountability Act, legislation that would make
executives of big corporations criminally liable if their companies commit
crimes, harm large numbers of people through civil violations, or commit a new
violation while under the supervision of the court or a regulator for a
previous violation.

of Letter (PDF)Washington D.C. – U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.),
Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)
sent a letter to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) requesting
that Acting Comptroller of the Currency, Michael Hsu, rescind the previously
issued cryptocurrency guidance and replace it with more comprehensive guidance,
in coordination with other prudential regulators. The lawmakers also asked for
details regarding the extent to which banks are currently engaging in
crypto-related activities. “In light of recent turmoil in the crypto market, we are concerned that the
OCC’s actions on crypto may have exposed the banking system to unnecessary
risk, and ask that you withdraw existing interpretive letters that have
permitted banks to engage in certain crypto-related activities,” wrote
the lawmakers. Under the previous acting comptroller, Brian Brooks, the OCC issued a number
of interpretive letters related to cryptocurrency which determined that banks
were authorized to engage in certain crypto-related activities, including:
providing cryptocurrency custody service for customers, holding deposits that
serve as reserves for certain stablecoins, and using independent node
verification networks (INVNs) and stablecoins for payment activities. Despite expressing concerns “that these initiatives were not done in full
coordination with all stakeholders” or as “part of a broader strategy related
to the regulatory perimeter,” Acting Comptroller Hsu affirmed those initiatives
in follow-up guidance issued under his leadership in November of last year, provided
that banks demonstrate their ability to engage in the permitted crypto-related
activities in a safe and sound manner.In the letter, the lawmakers argue that the guidance issued under Acting
Comptroller Hsu “failed to properly address the risks associated with
crypto-related banking activities and the shortcomings of the preceding
interpretive letters,” which they say granted banks essentially “unfettered
opportunity to engage in certain crypto activities and remain problematic.” The
lawmakers are calling for the OCC to rescind all previously issued
crypto-related guidance, replace the guidance with a comprehensive approach in
coordination with other prudential regulators, and provide answers on a series
of questions by August 23, 2022.In July 2022, Senator Warren sent
a letter with Senators Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Markey (D-Mass.) and Merkley
(D-Ore.) and Representatives Huffman (D-Calif.) and Tlaib (D-Mich.) to the
Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency highlighting findings
from their investigation into the environmental impacts of cryptomining and
requesting that the EPA and DOE work together to require cryptominers to report
their emissions and energy use. Earlier this year, the senator also sent
a letter with Senators Warner (D- Va.), Brown (D-Ohio), and Reed (D-R.I.) to
the Treasury Department regarding the potential use of cryptocurrency to evade
sanctions, which have become even more urgent amid the sanctions imposed on
Russia after their invasion of Ukraine. In July of last year, Senator Warren sent
a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler
requesting information about the agency's authority to regulate cryptocurrency
exchanges and protect consumers from risks posed by the highly volatile
cryptocurrency market.

Accounts of State Abortion Bans Resulting in Denial of Pregnancy Care, Reproductive
Care, and Non-Reproductive Health Care; Seeks Information from Five Leading
Health Care Organizations“There is no doubt that the
blame for such tragedies lays squarely at the feet of extremist Republican
state legislators who are willing to risk the lives and safety of women in
their pursuit of a rightwing, misogynistic, and out-of-touch agenda.”Text
of Letters (PDF)Washington, D.C. – In the wake of the Supreme Court’s
decision overturning Roe v. Wade, United States Senator Elizabeth
Warren (D-Mass.) opened an investigation into how state abortion bans enacted
by rightwing legislators have affected women’s access to urgent and critical
pregnancy care, reproductive care, and even non-reproductive health care.
Senator Warren’s investigation comes on the heels of reports from across the
country highlighting shocking stories from women in states that have enacted
radical abortion bans and criminalized health care. Senator Warren wrote to
five leading organizations representing physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and
other health care providers to gather more information: the American Medical
Association, Physicians for Reproductive Health, National Nurses United, the
American Pharmacists Association, and the American Hospital Association.“These initial reports are a harbinger of the threats faced by millions of
women under state-imposed abortion bans and by their providers who took an oath
to ‘do no harm.’ And as more states restrict abortion access, they will only
multiply,” wrote Senator Warren. In the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe,
rightwing legislatures across the country have enacted highly restrictive
abortion bans: at least ten states have banned abortion outright, four states
have prohibited abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, three states will
outlaw abortion in a matter of weeks, and five states have abortion bans in
place that are only temporarily blocked by judges. Despite over 75% of
Americans opposing such radical restrictions, virtually none of these bans have
exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.In the letters, Senator Warren highlights horrifying accounts from
Wisconsin, Texas, Missouri, and Ohio that show how the effects of abortion
restrictions have extended far beyond abortion care – women have been unable to
receive critical pregnancy care, reproductive care, and even non-reproductive health
care: Senator Warren is asking each health care organization to assist in her
investigation to better understand the effects of radical abortion bans on
health care access, including pregnancy care (such as care for miscarriages and
ectopic pregnancies), reproductive care (such as emergency contraception and
fertility services), and any other form of health care. She is requesting that
each organization respond to her questions about the effects of abortion bans
on patients and providers, the guidance provided by these organizations about
state-imposed abortion bans, and how the federal government can respond to these
bans by September 9, 2022. As access to abortion care and health care is under attack by the extremist
Supreme Court and Republican state legislatures, Senator Warren has called on

of Letter (PDF)Washington D.C. – U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
and Representative Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) sent a letter to Secretary of
Defense Lloyd Austin raising concerns that the Department of Defense (DOD) may
be misleading or misinforming civilians about debt they incur when they receive
emergency medical care at military health care facilities, and calling for
improved billing practices to protect patients.A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report,
requested by Senator Warren through an amendment to the National Defense
Authorization Act for fiscal year 2021 and released last month, uncovered
troubling revelations about MTFs, including indications that these facilities
are not adequately informing civilians about their options for medical debt
relief. “No American should struggle to access health care or be forced to take on
significant medical debt to get the care they need.” said Senator
Warren, “It is essential that the DOD promotes policies to ensure that
our nation's health care system provides high-quality, affordable health care
that does not lead to debt or bankruptcy or force families to choose between
medical care and other necessities.”“For years, I’ve worked to help San Antonio families who faced medical bills
after receiving trauma care at Brooke Army Medical Center,” said
Congressman Castro. “The GAO's report is damning evidence that this
problem goes far beyond San Antonio. It is unacceptable that the Department of
Defense is failing to use the flexibility granted under the amendment I passed
in 2020 to waive civilian medical bills. These outrageous billing practices
need to end. The House recently passed my amendment in the 2023 National
Defense Authorization Act to require the Secretary of Defense to waive
extraordinary fees for civilians and I urge the Senate to ensure that this
amendment is passed into law.”The GAO report found that 67% of the civilian emergency patients who
received treatment did not have insurance, leaving them highly vulnerable to
massive medical bills. Press and congressional reports of unusually aggressive
billing practices by MTFs include more than $28,000 to repair a fractured heel
bone, $1.7 million for life-saving treatment for a burn victim, and $210,008.07
plus interest for treatment to repair a ruptured bladder.The report also found that DOD military treatment facilities were misleading
and misinforming the public about their right to seek relief for this debt and
revealed that some outstanding debts are likely based on false or incomplete
information. Their review found at least 23 percent of patients had been
assigned the wrong billing category code. MTFs have tried to establish a
patchwork of systems to seek reimbursement through Medicare and Medicaid, but
have repeatedly encountered billing issues or had claims rejected. Under the 1996 Debt Collection Improvement Act, the Department of Defense,
Treasury, and the Department of Justice have the authority to “compromise” or
settle debts with individuals for less than the full amount owed. This
authority, however, is not being used to its full potential. Of the 26,696
civilian medical debt cases GAO reviewed, only 0.1 percent were reduced. GAO
also found DOD lacks the data necessary to accurately assess whether treatment
for civilians enhances medical readiness, has weak internal controls to
accurately track debts collected, and seemingly refuses to exercise these
waiver authorities. “These hospitals can be invaluable resources for their communities,” said
the lawmakers. “But as the GAO points out, increased financial risk to
civilians creates a barrier to further expanding services. MTFs can enhance
community relations by clearly communicating available debt relief options to
patients and the DOD can help thousands of Americans who have incurred medical
debt at these facilities by waiving that debt.”Senator Warren has long fought to make sure there is affordable access to
healthcare for all and that the government’s aggressive debt collection
practices don’t unfairly target patients:

http://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-on-senate-floor-warren-calls-for-crackdown-on-deceptive-and-misleading-practices-used-by-many-crisis-pregnancy-centers,"On Senate floor, Senators
Warren and Menendez (D-N.J.) engaged in debate with Senator Marshall (R-Kan.)
on the deceptive and misleading advertising that many crisis pregnancy centers
use dissuade patients from getting the reproductive care they need, including
abortion care.Watch Floor Speech HEREWashington, D.C. – In case you missed it, U.S. Senator
Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) delivered remarks on the Senate floor about the need
to crack down on the deceptive and misleading practices employed by many crisis
pregnancy centers. Senator Warren also spoke on the need to bring the Stop
Anti-Abortion Disinformation Act, which she introduced with
Senator Menendez (D-N.J.), up for a vote to direct the Federal Trade Commission
to prohibit deceptive or misleading advertising that many CPCs use to dissuade
patients from getting the reproductive care they need, including abortion care.
The legislation would  empower the Commission to enforce these rules and
collect penalties from organizations that violate the law.Watch Senator Warren’s full remarks HERE: Senator Elizabeth Warren: Mr. President, across this
country, Americans are facing aggressive attacks on their reproductive freedom.
An extremist Supreme Court and radical right-wing politicians have made clear
they see women as second class citizens and that government—government, not the
person who is pregnant, but government—should be making decisions about whether
or not to carry a pregnancy to term. In this extraordinary moment, we must do everything we can to ensure that
patients get the health care and reproductive services that they need – and
that includes protecting patients from the deceptive practices of some
so-called “crisis pregnancy centers,” or CPCs.Nationwide, there are over 2,500 known CPCs, although some claim the number
is closer to about 4,000. Now, before Roe was overturned, over 16 million women
of reproductive age lived closer to a CPC than to an abortion clinic. Now, some
estimate as many as 34 million women do – and today in Massachusetts, CPCs
outnumber true abortion clinics by about 3 to 1.CPCs often lure women seeking legitimate reproductive care – including
abortions – into their facilities by advertising themselves as comprehensive
reproductive health care providers. But this is flatly untrue.  Many of
these CPCs are not health care providers, and they often operate specifically
to deceive pregnant women with the goal of preventing them from having
abortions. CPC websites often feature images of people in white lab coats and promises
of services like ultrasounds or STD tests. Yet CPCs rarely employ licensed
physicians or offer a full range of reproductive health services. According to
one study, 84% of CPCs had no physician, and 75% had no registered nurse even
affiliated with the staff. In fact, of the staff that did have some medical
training, most worked part-time or as volunteers. As for the services they
provide, the same study found that only 1 out of 607 CPCs provided
contraceptive care, and 95 percent of CPCs offered no prenatal care—none,
zero.  Most have no doctors, no nurses, and offer no medical care, but
they have a lot of medical opinions. Nearly two-thirds promoted medically
unsound claims, such as offering information about unproven and unscientific
“abortion pill reversal” treatments.Deception is at the heart of the operation for many CPCs. The director of a
CPC in Texas explained to the Washington Post how she revamped
operations so her center could pull in more people who were seeking an
abortion. The director paid thousands of dollars to ensure that searches for
phrases like “need an abortion” would lead people to her center, and she filled
the website with phrases like “I Want An Abortion” and promised “CONFIDENTIAL
ABORTION CONSULTATION — NO COST TO YOU.”   The website is so deceptive that the director said she even receives angry
calls from anti-abortion advocates who want to know why her center even talks
about abortion – to which she replies, “How else do you get an abortion-minded
girl to know that you’re there?” Deception is wrong. No one should be deceived—directly or indirectly—about
the services they can access or the risks of receiving care. That is
particularly true for someone under great stress and time constraints who is
coping with an unplanned pregnancy. And that is why I am glad to introduce the Stop Anti-Abortion
Disinformation Act with Senator Menendez – and why I am joining him today
in calling up this legislation for a vote. Our bill directs the Federal Trade
Commission to prohibit deceptive or misleading advertising related to the
provision of abortion services. It also empowers the Commission to enforce
these rules and collect penalties from organizations that violate the
law. This is far from a radical proposal: For more than a hundred years, the FTC
has been authorized to prosecute entities that use deceptive practices. And let
me be clear: any crisis pregnancy center that operates fairly, disseminates
factual information, and is clear about what services it does and does not
provide would be free to continue its work. This bill is not about preventing parents from receiving diapers or other
supplies if they have chosen to continue a pregnancy. This is about
organizations that deliberately deceive women and girls who are seeking help to
terminate a pregnancy. And unfortunately, deception is at the heart of the
typical CPC’s business model.As the director of a CPC explained, the deception begins when women search
for an abortion provider.  The deception then continues once women walk
through the doors of a crisis pregnancy center. I just want to tell you a bit
about the experience of a young woman living in Massachusetts who visited a
crisis pregnancy center earlier this year.  Now, after finding the facility, which promised a “free abortion
consultation,” this woman was asked to fill out forms to disclose personal
information.  She was repeatedly lied to about how far along she was in
her pregnancy.  She was told—falsely—that terminating her pregnancy would
increase her risk of breast cancer and depression and that an abortion could
mean that she could never become pregnant in the future. And sadly, her
experience is not unique.Here’s the kicker: women and girls visiting CPCs, like this young woman,
often fill out forms and answer questionnaires requesting both personal identification
and personal health information, which women provide because they believe they
are in a medical facility that will protect their privacy. But because CPCs are
not health care providers, these women have no legal protection and these
centers have no legal obligation to protect those data. These unlicensed
facilities are not subject to federal privacy laws like the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. This means that
CPCs could pass along private information about who was seeking an abortion,
where that person lives, and so on—information that, in the wake of the Dobbs
decision, is particularly dangerous.  The evidence of abuse is overwhelming.  It’s time to crack down on
deceptive and misleading practices many crisis pregnancy centers employ –
because the last thing that a woman seeking reproductive care should have to
worry about is whether she’s being tricked, lied to, or deceived about the
medical care that she seeks. Thank you Mr. President. I yield.…Senator Menendez: While my colleague is
still here, I would like to propose the question to my colleague through the
chair. Does the first amendment allow you to promote fraud? Does the first
amendment allow you to promote deception? Is it great work to lie to someone
about what you are providing them? Is it great work to allow someone to get
your vital health information, believing that you are a health provider and
then being able to use that private information? Senator Marshall: To answer my colleague,
the fraud and the deception is occurring in the abortion clinics. I can tell
you story after story of patients crying in my office who went to Planned
Parenthood for a pregnancy test and were scheduled for an abortion, coming to
my office wondering, do I have to do this abortion? That’s where the fraud and
deception is occurring. These women aren't being told about the potential
complications of these abortion procedures. They're not being told that these
abortion pills are going to cause pain and cramping and bleeding, that they
could end up in the emergency room as well. They're not told about the
complications from the abortion procedures. That's where the fraud and
deception is present. You talk about this as reproductive services. You're
afraid to say the word abortion in these clinics. That's the fraud and
deception. This isn't reproductive services. These are abortions. This is
taking the life of the unborn. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator Warren: Actually could I? Can I
ask you a question then because I am a little confused, I think,  by
what's just happened here. I presume deception is wrong, whoever does it. So if
we just said, no deception around pregnancy services, would you be willing to
support this? Senator Marshall: Mr. President, we could
never support any part of this legislation. I think the deception and fraud is
occurring on the part of abortion clinics. This is a threat to our first
amendment rights, and I think, like I said in my opening remarks, this is just
simply unacceptable. That's why we continue to object. Thank you. Senator Menendez: Mr. President, if I may
ask my colleague through the chair, is it right, no matter who gets the
information by fraud, to give your most private health – surely as a doctor –
the Senator would say that no one should give up their health information to an
entity that does not preserve it under HIPAA laws. So could the Senator not
join us if we limit it to fraud that ultimately has that fraud create the
insecurity of HIPAA information? Senator Marshall: Mr. President, I think
this is not the place to try to rewrite legislation. Of course I'm against all
fraud. I think all fraud is bad. I think that I'm all for the truth, all for
protecting patients' personal information. But I'm also here proud to say what
great work that these clinics do. I'm not sure what you are even accusing them
is even true. I have not witnessed that. The pregnant clinics that I have seen
do great work for these folks. They truly do sit down and talk with them. They
give them a hand up. They do so many great things. I don't know where this fraud and deception is coming about except that
they're talking to women and saying, do you realize that your baby has a
heartbeat? Do you realize that your baby can feel pain at 14 weeks? Do you
realize that your baby recognizes the voice of your husband right now? Do you
recognize – so I think those are great things to share with patients, how
wonderful life is, that we're all wonderfully, beautifully made in the womb,
that life begins at conception. I think that's all the truth that should be
shared with them. So, no, I don't think there's anything you could do with this
legislation that could change it that I could support. And I continue to
object. Thank you, and I yield.Senator Warren: Mr. President, then could
I ask through you another question and that is, if we're not talking about the
fraud part, can we at least talk about collecting health information, that any
so-called crisis pregnancy center – I'm sorry, is the Senator leaving? The one
who said that it's important to protect private health care information? That
at least we could agree that private health care information – I guess the
Senator is just going to walk off the floor. So the question would have been,
how about agreeing that anyone that collects information about a pregnancy and
collects medical and personal information has to be bound by HIPAA so that that
information is fully protected? That would be my question, Mr. President. But
since there's no one here to answer it on the Republican side, I guess we will
have to leave it for today. Thank you. Senator Menendez:  I would like to
answer the Senator's question. That makes eminent sense that we would protect
HIPAA information regardless of who is in a position to maybe have access to
collecting it. And therefore, in the first instance, you shouldn't collect it
if you're not a medical entity, but if you do, you should be ultimately bound
by the same guarantees that anyone else would be guaranteed. You know, it would
baffle me that particularly a medical professional, a doctor, would suggest
that HIPAA information is something that we shouldn't protect. I think that at
a minimum we should all be able to agree to that. Senator Warren: This is a reminder again
why I am so honored to fight alongside Senator Menendez. I don't think anyone
should be deceived, and particularly a woman who is seeking information about
termination of a pregnancy, and I don't believe anyone's private medical
information should be shared. The idea that these crisis pregnancy centers
gather information from women who believe they are giving it to a medical
provider, and that information will be protected, and that that is not the
case, is truly despicable. Thank you again, Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr.
President.

Scoring System Text
of Letter (PDF)Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
and Mark Warner (D-Va.) and U.S. Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.)
sent a letter to Equifax, blasting the company for its failure to correctly
report consumer credit scores and its delays in informing lenders and consumers
of these problems – resulting in consumers being denied or charged higher
interest rates for auto loans, mortgages, and credit cards. The lawmakers are
calling on Equifax to answer for the mistakes in its credit scoring system and
its failure to alert consumers and regulators about these mistakes.“This is a deeply troubling allegation, raising questions about the impact
your opaque practices may have on America’s financial institutions and on
individual borrowers, who may be stuck paying higher costs for loans, credit
cards, cars, and houses. Your company owes the public a clear and transparent
explanation for why and how it made such grievous errors, the scope of the
errors, and why you have failed to notify affected consumers of these errors,” wrote
the lawmakers. Equifax, just one of the three national credit bureaus, maintains credit
scores on more than 200 million U.S. consumers and sells this information to
lenders to help determine loan decisions. In 2021, Equifax delivered more than
2.8 billion consumer credit card files to U.S. lenders. New reporting revealed
that from March 16, 2022 to April 6, 2022, Equifax sent incorrect credit scores
for hundreds of thousands of consumers to lenders, resulting in higher interest
rates and denied applications. Equifax claimed that “300,000 consumers
experienced a score shift of 25 points or more”, but has not released any
additional data on how these consumers were impacted. Swings of 25 points or
more could materially impact the rates consumers are offered or even result in
an unfair rejection.In the letter, the lawmakers call out Equifax for its failure to alert
consumers of these inaccuracies and for waiting more than three weeks to alert
lenders. They also note Equifax’s disturbing pattern of failing to alert
consumers and lenders about problems with its credit scoring system. In 2017,
the company waited 40 days to alert regulators and consumers about an egregious
data breach. The lawmakers are calling on Equifax to answer a set of questions about its
inaccurate credit score reporting, its impact on consumers, and its plans to
notify and compensate impacted consumers by August 19, 2022. Senator Warren has led efforts in the Senate to protect consumers and hold
consumer credit agencies accountable for massive data breaches and exploiting
consumers:

without the Inflation Reduction Act’s mitigation investments. Transcript: Borrowed Time: The Economic Costs of
Climate Change
U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
Thursday, August 4, 2022Senator Elizabeth Warren: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So with the Inflation Reduction Act, Democrats have announced a
historic down payment in the fight against the climate crisis. This bill will
cut our carbon emissions by 40% in just eight years. It's also going to cut
both the immediate and long term costs of energy, create American jobs, raise
American wages, and most importantly, save American lives. Today, I want to talk about how the Inflation Reduction Act would
tackle two of the major costs that fossil fuels inflict on American families
and on the federal budget. First, the cost of public health and second, the
cost of natural disasters. So let me start with the public health costs. Burning fossil fuels pollutes
our air, with low income communities and communities of color being hit the
hardest. And one of the biggest causes of emissions from diesel is from diesel
vehicles, like buses and trains. Mr. Flarida, you are an expert on climate and environmental issues. So let
me ask you, if these vehicles, buses and trains, ran on electricity rather than
fossil fuels, what impact would that have on public health?Mr. Joe Flarida, Executive Director, Power a Clean Future Ohio:
Senator Warren, one of the major benefits of transitioning to electric vehicles
is the simple fact that they have zero tailpipe emissions. So every day we have
cars, trucks, buses, driving up and down our streets, driving through our
neighborhoods, taking our kids back and forth to school, and they're emitting
pollutants every time they drive on our roads.And I think one important point which a recent assessment showed, and I am
happy to submit this for the Commitee, is that as a result of transitioning
that entire fleet, if we were to take our entire bus fleet, our entire railroad
fleet, and transition it to electric drive motors, we would see 4,200 fewer
deaths annually, many of which are from children and elderly who are especially
susceptible to ambient air pollution.Senator Warren: Wow. So 4,200 deaths, and presumably a lot
of people who just wouldn't get as sick, right? Mr. Flarida: Correct.Senator Warren: –But don't die from this. Thank you. You
know, this is the reason that Congressman Levin and I introduced the BUILD
Green Act and Buy Green Act to purchase American-made electric
vehicles and clean energy products for federal, state, and local use, and for
export. Now, fortunately, parts of our bill were included in the infrastructure bill
and now in the Inflation Reduction Act, which puts $4 billion toward
electrifying our federal fleet as well as school and transit buses. This is
going to help with public health and help reduce public health costs, and
advance environmental justice by ensuring that our most vulnerable Americans
are breathing cleaner air.In fact, estimates suggest that the IRA will result in as many as 3,900
fewer premature deaths due to pollution in 2030. Now, in addition to making us sicker, fossil fuels are exacerbating extreme
weather events, as Senator Menendez just noted. They harm local communities,
harm communities all around the world. A storm surge of 40 inches in South
Boston could displace more than 35,000 people and recovery would be massively
expensive. Dr. Vajjhala, your organization works on issues such as addressing sea level
rise and fire risks. Would the climate investments in the Inflation
Reduction Act lower the cost of disaster relief for the federal
government?Dr. Shalini Vajjhala, Executive Director, San Diego Regional Policy
& Innovation Center: Thank you, Senator Warren. The answer is 100%
absolutely, yes. Investing in prevention is far more cost-effective than relief and recovery.
And the recent OMB study that highlighted that climate change could lead to an
annual federal revenue loss of equivalent $2 trillion per year, noted that it
could also cost the government $25 to $128 billion more a year just for dealing
with coastal disaster relief, flood insurance, crop insurance, health care and
wildfire suppression and flooding in federal facilities. So there's no doubt that the Inflation Reduction Act would help
address these costs.Senator Warren: Thank you very much. You know, tackling
climate change is a bargain compared to the alternative. According to the
National Institute of Building Sciences, every dollar spent on mitigating
natural hazards saves society about $13 in expenses we don't incur. The Inflation Reduction Act will help us avoid the costs in both
dollars and in lives, lives lost from pollution and from climate change, and it
is essential that Congress pass this legislation immediately. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

of Letter (PDF)Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawai'i), and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.) sent a letter
to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) urging concrete
actions  the Department can take to help meet President Biden’s goal of
protecting and expanding access to medication abortion. This letter comes ahead
of the deadline set by the President Executive Order Protecting Access to
Reproductive Health Care Services. For more than two decades, people have used Mifepristone and misoprostol for
medication abortion. Years of research have shown that medication abortion is
both safe and effective, and medication abortion now accounts for more than
half of all abortions nationwide. Right-wing state legislatures across the
country have passed laws banning the use of FDA-approved medication, further
stripping away women’s access to abortion care and undermining the FDA’s
authority to protect the nation’s public health.In response to the Supreme Court’s devastating decision in Dobbs v.
Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned nearly 50 years of
judicial precedent, President Biden signed an Executive Order directing HHS to
take action to protect access to medication abortion and to submit a report on
those efforts within 30 days, which is this Sunday, August, 2022.
Recommendations offered by the lawmakers could help the administration reach
this goal.In the letter, the lawmakers commended President Biden’s executive order and
outlined seven powerful steps that HHS could take in accordance with President
Biden’s order to expand  access to medication abortion:“We support your efforts to take all possible actions to protect abortion
access, and as you work to meet this goal, we urge you to consider these
options, which we believe will have the greatest impact on expanding access to
medication abortion across the nation,” concluded the lawmakers.As access to abortion care services is under attack by the extremist Supreme
Court and Republican state legislatures, Senator Warren has called on the
government to use every tool to expand and protect reproductive care:

in unsafe privatized military housing with black mold, collapsed roofs, or
exposed electrical wires because DoD is falling behind in proper oversight and
providing safe housing to these service members,” said Senator Warren.
“The bipartisan Military Housing Readiness Council Act will create a Council
with a strong mandate to conduct oversight of military housing, collect public
complaints, and report its work to Congress – ensuring that military families
receive the safe housing conditions they deserve.” “I have long been a proponent of safe and accessible housing for all
military personnel and military families. I am proud to introduce this
bipartisan legislation with my colleagues to establish a Military Housing
Readiness Council within the DoD to make recommendations regarding privatized
housing and support services and monitor all compliance with current law,” said
Senator Tillis. ""Our military families sacrifice enough. The least we can do is provide
housing to them that's safe and hazard-free,” said Representative Ryan.
“I’m proud to support the Military Housing Readiness Council Act to provide
transparency and oversight over military housing, eliminate neglect and
mismanagement, and ensure our servicemembers don’t have to worry about their
families’ housing while they are serving our nation.”""Servicemembers and their families make incredible sacrifices for our
country,"" said Representative Porter. ""We should be
matching our gratitude for military families with action. Congress has
repeatedly passed legislation to improve military housing conditions, but it's
clear we need to do more to hold private companies accountable to the law. I'm
proud to co-lead this legislation that'll boost oversight and better protect
families in private military housing.""Specifically, the Military Housing Readiness Council Act would do
the following: The Military Housing Readiness Council Act is endorsed by the
Military Officers Association of America, the National Military Family
Association, and Armed Forces Housing Advocates.“Establishing a Military Housing Readiness Council will provide
servicemembers and military spouses with an opportunity to provide important
feedback to Congress and DoD senior leaders,” said Lt. Gen. Dana T.
Atkins, USAF (Ret), President and CEO of the Military Officers Association of
America. “This Council will increase transparency, support
accountability of the resolution process instituted by the Tenant Bill of
Rights, and report on the impacts and trust in privatized housing.” “The Military Housing Readiness Council Act will allow for real substantive
conversations to occur in the public view about the state of military housing.
AFHA is proud to support the Military Housing Readiness Council Act
and look forward to seeing how the implementation of it can change the
narrative surrounding military housing,” said Rachel Christian, Founder
and Chief Legislative Officer of the Armed Forces Housing Advocates.

of Hearing Exchange (YouTube)Washington, D.C. – At a hearing of the Senate Banking,
Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee today, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.) called out corporate landlords’ growing role in the rental market and
emphasized the need for a Tenant Protection Bureau to hold corporate landlords
accountable and protect renters from extreme rent hikes, illegal eviction, and
other predatory practices.“Today, with families struggling with these rapidly rising rents, and with
the economy at risk of being pushed into recession by the Fed’s overzealous
interest rate hikes, it is urgent that we take steps to protect renters from
predatory schemes and ensure that corporate landlords at least follow the rules
that are in place,” said Senator Warren. The Senator pointed to a recent earnings call for private equity firm Blackstone
on which executives boasted about how slowing home construction and rising
mortgage rates due to the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes would lock more
families into the rental market, benefitting  Blackstone’s bottom line.
Big investors like Blackstone have acquired an increasing share of the rental
market and now serve as landlords to thousands of Americans. In response to Senator Warren’s questions, Professor Matthew Desmond,
Maurice P. During Professor of Sociology at Princeton University, noted that
families living in corporate-owned homes “will pay more, and sometimes a lot
more,” and that housing quality would decrease because “institutional investors
divest from housing as part of their business model.” Senator Warren has proposed the creation of a Tenant Protection Bureau that
would allow tenants to easily file complaints against unscrupulous landlords
and provide federal and local officials with the data they need to enforce
tenant protection laws. Diane Yentel, President and CEO of the National Low
Income Housing Coalition, agreed that a Tenant Protection Bureau would be
“tremendously helpful” and “if we had it today, it could help further enforce
tenant protections, prevent egregious rent hikes, and let tenants hold their
landlords accountable.”Transcript: Senate Banking Committee Hearing to Examine How Renters
and Communities are impacted by Today's Housing Market
U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs
Tuesday, August 2, 2022Senator Elizabeth Warren: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
America's renters are struggling and the Fed's interest rate hikes are making
it both more expensive to build more housing and more expensive to take out a
mortgage to buy a home. This could lock more families into the rental market
and push rents even higher. Now, big Wall Street firms are watching this with
dollar signs in their eyes. Private equity, real estate investment trusts, and
big corporations have gobbled up more and more of the rental market and now
serve as landlords to thousands and thousands of Americans. In 2018,
non-individual investors owned 26% of the rental stock, up from 18% in 2001. On a recent earnings call executives at the private equity firm
Blackstone bragged that slowing housing construction -- that is less supply --
and higher mortgage costs (quote) ""provide a lot of support"" (end
quote) for their bottom line since (quote) ""people will still have to live
somewhere."" So Professor Desmond, you're the leading expert on predatory
housing schemes. So let me ask you, as corporate landlords like Blackstone buy
up rental properties, what will be the impact on families who are in those
homes?Professor Matthew Desmond, Maurice P. During Professor Of Sociology
And Director Of The Eviction Lab: Senator Warren, first those families
will pay more, and sometimes a lot more. Institutional investors are on record
by raising the rents double digits, even in a single quarter. Those families
also might experience a reduction in housing quality as institutional investors
divest from housing as part of their business model. They saddle tenants with
extra fines and fees, including tenants that can't make the rent at the
beginning of the month, just because they don't get paid on a monthly basis.
Plus, those tenants are often outgunned, not only politically but in court,
where many of those tenants don't have access to a lawyer but over 90% of
landlords do. That leaves those families in an incredibly vulnerable situation.Senator Warren: Right. You know, in fact, thanks to an
investigation by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, we
know that during the height of the pandemic corporate landlords illegally
evicted families by the thousands, violating federal and state moratoriums that
had been put in place to protect tenants. So today, with families struggling with these rapidly rising rents that you
talked about, and with the economy at risk of being pushed into recession by
the Fed's overzealous interest rate hikes, it's urgent that we take steps to
protect renters from predatory schemes, and ensure that corporate landlords at
least follow the rules that are in place. And that's one reason I've proposed creating a new Tenant Protection Bureau,
which would allow tenants to easily file complaints against unscrupulous
landlords and to provide officials with the data they need to enforce tenant
protection laws. Ms. Yentel, how could a Tenant Protection Bureau protect
family's rights and force these Wall Street landlords to actually follow the
rules?Diane Yentel, National Low Income Housing Coalition: It
could be tremendously helpful, Senator Warren. As you said, that report only
verified what we knew was happening during the pandemic, which was some of
these corporate landlords were flouting the law. And we pushed throughout the
pandemic for the federal government to hold them accountable, to apply the
penalties to them for not following the CDC eviction moratorium, but there was
no single agency that was charged with or empowered to do that. And so it
didn't happen. If we had a Tenant Protection Bureau in place during the
pandemic, it could have prevented untold harm and evictions of some of the most
marginalized people. And if we had it today, it could help further enforce
tenant protections, prevent egregious rent hikes, and let tenants hold their
landlords accountable.Senator Warren: Yes, that's a very powerful answer, and I
appreciate it. Look, to ensure that every family has access to safe and affordable places
to live. We've got to build more housing, that is the ultimate answer. We need
more supply. There's no way around it. These investments are overdue. But it is
also urgent that right now we stand up to big corporate landlords and to
protect tenants from these predatory schemes that could push them out on the
street. And a Tenant Protection Bureau would be a good start. So, thank you very much. Thank you for your work. Thank you for being here.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

of Letter (pdf)WASHINGTON, DC – United States Senator Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.) and Rosa DeLauro, Chair of the House Appropriations Committee
(D-Conn.), sent a letter to the Biden administration requesting that the
agencies involved engage in robust consultation with Congress and outside
stakeholders on the recently announced Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)
and Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity (APEP), and urging them learn
from the failures of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The letter was sent
to U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, Secretary of Commerce Gina
Raimondo, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and National Security Advisor Jake
Sullivan. “We urge you to consider the lessons of past trade negotiations that too
often were conducted in secret, with members of Congress, workers and their
unions, environmentalists, and consumer advocates largely unable to review text
and ensure their interests were addressed,” the lawmakers wrote. “…If
negotiations on IPEF and APEP proceed, we urge you to ensure that any agreement
benefits American workers, not corporate offshoring, and to provide Congress
and the public with clearer insight into your approach to the negotiation
process, including through robust consultation throughout the process and
congressional approval of any binding commitments.”The proposed partners for IPEF include nations such as Vietnam and Malaysia
with autocratic governments, terrible human and labor rights practices, and
poor environmental protections. While the Office of U.S. Trade Representative
has committed to including strong labor standards, including country-specific
provisions where needed, other agencies have yet to make a similar commitment.This letter was also signed by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), as well

well-known tax dodgers operating offshore by misleadingly claiming that
“American manufacturers” will pay half of corporate minimum taxJCT
Analysis (PDF)Washington, D.C. – In response to Finance Committee
Republicans’ release of misleading data suggesting the corporate minimum tax
was primarily a tax on “American manufacturers,” U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, and U.S. Senator Ron Wyden
(D-Ore.), Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, released additional data
provided by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) that rebuts this deceptive
claim.About half of the 15 percent corporate minimum tax paid by “American
manufacturers” would include well-known tax dodgers in the pharmaceutical and
technology industries, as well as other outsourcers like the apparel industry,
where 97 percent of clothing sold in the U.S. is made in overseas factories.“This analysis shows that American manufacturing would not be hurt by having
multinational corporations pay a 15% minimum tax on billions in profit. About
200 of the largest, most profitable corporations ship jobs overseas while
paying a lower tax rate than most businesses and workers,” said Senator
Warren. “Republican politicians and their corporate lobbyist friends
are rushing to defend tax loopholes for billionaire corporations, while
Democrats are working to invest in manufacturing clean energy technology and
lower costs for working families.”“Republicans always distort the truth about tax changes to protect corporate
tax dodging, but this new analysis shows they're clearly wrong about the
corporate minimum tax proposal and manufacturing. Big pharma, tech and apparel
companies would account for half the revenue coming in from ‘manufacturers’
under the corporate minimum tax. These companies are playing the most games,
and avoiding tax by manufacturing their drugs, phones, and shoes abroad. This
is a minimum tax for tax dodgers stamping ‘Made in China’ on their products,”
said Senator Wyden. “Here’s an example of the kind of company we’re
talking about: The Finance Committee just released a report showing that one of
the biggest drug companies in the world paid about 9 percent in taxes while making
nearly $8 billion in profit. This company produces its best-selling drug
overseas, while the vast majority of its revenue is from American customers.
This is the type of company Republicans are defending to justify their
continued support of corporate tax avoidance. The American people know that’s
wrong, and they want to see companies with billions in profits contribute their
fair share.”

Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawai’i), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.),
Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), and Martin Heinrich
(D-N.M.) and Representatives Ed Case (D-Hawai’i), and Teresa Leger Fernández
(D-N.M.), sent a letter to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairwoman
Jessica Rosenworcel urging the FCC to consider more ways to advance Native
communities’ access to and ownership of spectrum over their lands.It was recently estimated
that nearly a third of Tribal lands in the United States lacked internet
access. Over 1.5 million people living on Tribal lands lack
access to broadband services. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated this
disparity, limiting access to telemedicine, virtual and remote learning, and
public safety programs, among other services.“It’s vital that we ensure economic development and connectivity for Native
communities, whose access to digital services already lags far behind the rest
of the country,” said Senator Warren. “I’m calling for the FCC
to take additional steps to advance Tribal spectrum access and ownership to
enhance Tribal self-sufficiency and self-governance for Native communities.”“In today’s digital era, equal opportunity is impossible without equal
access to high-speed, reliable internet. Connectivity is key in ensuring that
everyone can benefit from essential, modern day resources such as telehealth,
online learning and remote job opportunities. Mahalo FCC Chairwoman Rosenworcel
for your commitment to increase broadband access on Tribal lands, and I look
forward to continuing our work with this administration to ensure Native
communities across our country are not left behind,” said Congressman
Kaiali'i Kahele (Hawai'i-02).“We ask that you continue to support the economic development of Tribal
Nations and Native communities by working to advance their spectrum access and
ownership,” said the lawmakers. “Advancing Native spectrum
access and ownership is the best way for the FCC to work toward fulfilling the
federal government’s trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations.”In the letter, the lawmakers recognize the Commission’s previous investments
and commitments to advancing Tribal broadband and the Chairwoman herself has spoken
to the necessity of bridging the digital divide that disadvantages many Tribal
communities. Still, the lawmakers note that while “these steps are all
important and commendable,” more can be done to facilitate economic development
in these communities.“The need is clear,” concluded the lawmakers. “So is the
solution: enhance Tribal self-sufficiency and self-governance by facilitating
Tribal spectrum access and ownership.”Senator Warren has worked to protect and advance tribal sovereignty and to
support Native communities’ increased digital connectivity:

and Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii) led 23 of their colleagues in a letter to the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), calling on the VA to take immediate
administrative action to offer abortions and all abortion-related services to
veterans and eligible dependents. Almost 400,000
women veterans of reproductive age live in states that are certain or likely to
ban abortions following the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson
Women’s Health Organization overturning Roe v. Wade.A total of 25 senators – half of the Senate Democratic Caucus – signed the
letter. In addition to Senators Warren and Hirono, the letter is also signed by
Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal
(D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Tammy

(I-Vt.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Raphael Warnock
(D-Ga.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).“Last month’s disastrous Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson
Women’s Health Organization overturned the nearly fifty-year precedent
established by Roe v. Wade and removed constitutional protection for
abortion access from millions of individuals in this country, including an
ever-growing number of veterans and dependents who are able to become
pregnant,” wrote the senators. “This decision makes it even
more critical that veterans receive access to the reproductive care to which
they are entitled. Thus, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) must urgently
begin rulemaking to allow veterans and eligible dependents to receive abortions
and all abortion-related services.”  Under current VA regulations, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is
prohibited from providing abortions and abortion counseling as part of the
medical benefits package. But the law also makes clear that the VA Secretary
“shall furnish hospital care and medical services which the Secretary
determines to be needed.” In a letter sent to VA Secretary Denis McDonough, the
members argue that because the VA has the statutory authority to provide abortions,
they must immediately begin a rulemaking process to change the current
regulations to provide abortion and abortion-related services. The letter
highlights that Secretary McDonough also recently expressed that the VA has the
statutory authority to provide abortions. “We contend that the VA has the statutory authority and discretion to
provide abortions and abortion-related services and resources,”
continued the lawmakers. “The VA’s authority to provide care to
veterans is established in the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of
1996. That statute provides that the VA Secretary ‘shall furnish hospital care
and medical services which the Secretary determines to be needed’ to certain
veterans. Importantly, the VA has used its authority under the Veterans Health
Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 to provide reproductive care such as
pregnancy care and infertility services, even though such care was initially
excluded from the health care packages allowed under the Veterans Health Care
Act of 1992.”As reproductive health care is under attack from the Supreme Court and
right-wing state legislatures, Senator Warren has called on the government to
use every tool to protect reproductive care and freedom:

of Hearing Exchange (YouTube)Washington, D.C. – At a hearing of the Senate Armed
Services Committee today, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) raised
concerns to Dr. Radha Plumb, nominated to be Deputy Under Secretary of Defense
for Acquisition and Sustainment, about continued weaknesses in revolving door
laws and the ongoing need to address conflicts of interest between the Pentagon
and private defense contractors. In response to Senator Warren’s questions, Dr. Plumb, committed to working
with Senator Warren  and the Senate Armed Services Committee to strengthen
ethics standards at the Pentagon without hurting the ability to attract top
talent in public service. Plumb also agreed that current ethics laws are not
strong enough to prevent those conflicts and that “there's absolutely space to
make progress.”Senator Warren has long advocated limiting the revolving door and restricting
the influence of defense contractors. Last July Senator Warren reintroduced her
Department of
Defense Ethics and Anti-Corruption Act (S. 2396). The bill
would enforce limits to the influence of contractors on the military, restrict
foreign influence on retired senior military officers, and assert greater
transparency over contractors and their interaction with the Department of
Defense. Most recently, she has pushed for and received agreement from
President Biden's DoD nominees, including
Secretary Lloyd Austin, to extend their ethics agreements and industry recusals
from two years to four years and to avoid seeking waivers to their ethics
agreements.Transcript: Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing to examine the

Virginia, and Laura Taylor-Kale, of California, both to be an Assistant
Secretary, all of the Department of Defense.U.S. Senate Armed Services CommitteeTuesday, July 28, 2022Senator Elizabeth Warren: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
congratulations to all of you. I want to thank Senator Tillis. I so appreciate
his partnership in our work on military housing and he’s asked my questions so
I think Mr. Owens knows that Senator Tillis and I, and this entire Committee,
is going to stay on this issue. It’s powerfully important to our military and
to our national defense, and also it's about what's right. So I'm going to try
to be efficient and ask about some other issues. And what I'd like to focus on
is conflicts of interest and ethics at the Pentagon.This year the Pentagon's budget is going to exceed $800 billion. About half
that spending is going to go to for-profit defense contractors to build
weapons, to perform maintenance, and to provide consulting services. Contract
and program decisions should be based on what's in the best interests of
national security. Period. But the revolving door between the Pentagon and
private defense contractors sometimes spins so fast it just looks like a blur.
Senior Pentagon officials leaving work for Lockheed or Boeing. Top lobbyists or
executives from these companies coming into government to hand out contracts to
their former employers.You know, real or perceived conflicts of interest undermine the public's
confidence, and can also lead to program delays or even cancellation. So Dr. Plumb, you have been nominated to a top role in the part of the
Pentagon that focuses on acquisition. Can you say a word about your views about
why it is important that government officials making decisions about which
defense contractors get taxpayer dollars must be free from conflicts of
interest?Dr. Radha Plumb: Senator, thank you and thank you for your
leadership on this issue. As you note, it is just so important at the
Department that our number one job is to deliver capabilities to the warfighter
and those capabilities need to be selected to get the best capabilities and that
means that conflict of interests, apparent or actual, can undermine as you
know, that trust, but also make it harder for key new ideas to break through
and get into that process. We have a number of efforts underway, ethics
agreements in this administration, improved oversight of our standards of
conduct. If confirmed, I pledge to continue those, but also more to fulsomely
work with you and this committee to make sure we're getting this balance right,
getting the conflicts out.Senator Warren: Well that's a really good point about how
conflicts of interest can actually keep us from finding the best products, from
innovating in the ways we need to innovate – a very strong point. So let's talk
about the things we can do in order to reduce the conflicts of interest. You
know, through the years I have proposed a number of changes to strengthen our
ethics laws. Now, some of my colleagues think that strong ethics requirements
will stop people from wanting to go into government. There have been at least
10, 10, government funded studies now on this exact issue, how to improve the
recruitment and retention of the federal workforce, and not a single one of
them has concluded that ethics laws are the barrier. When we talked last week,
you said that we need to consider both needing to attract and retain people who
want to solve big problems and preventing the appearance of self-dealing. Dr.
Plumb, do you agree that we could strengthen ethics standards at the Pentagon
without hurting our ability to attract top talent in public service?Dr. Plumb: Senator, I do agree. I think we need to think
about how we structure and make precise our ethics requirements and our
oversight so that we can attract top talent, let them work on hard problems,
let them solve hard problems for this country, while making sure we avoid
conflicts of interest. And there's absolutely space to make progress there. And
I, if confirmed, would really welcome an opportunity to work on that with you.Senator Warren:  Well, I think you've already answered
then the question I was going to ask and that is will you commit to working
with me to ensure that government officials working on acquisition programs and
policies are free of conflicts of interest?Dr. Plumb: Senator, I would welcome an opportunity to work
with you on that, thank you.  Senator Warren:  That is terrific. Thank you very
much. This is a problem across administrations and across government agencies,
but it is particularly acute at DoD given the size of the Pentagon's budget. A
lot of money is at stake here. Our last three secretaries of defense came to
DoD straight from the board or from being a lobbyist for the Pentagon's top
five contractors. We've got to do a lot more to end the cozy relationship
between the Pentagon and the defense industry. Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.

Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.) called out the role that large institutional investors, including
venture capital, hedge funds, and private equity, play in funding, hyping, and
sucking money from crypto projects that scam mom-and-pop investors. Senator Warren noted that large professional investors are playing a growing
role in the crypto market. Venture capital firms invested $33
billion in crypto-related companies last year, and hedge funds and other
big investors traded $1.1
trillion on Coinbase last year, more than double the amount of retail

by big investors that recently filed for bankruptcy. The companies promised up
to 20% interest to customers while claiming they were FDIC insured or “safer
than banks.” Senator Warren noted that these claims were lies from the start.
Melanie Lubin, the President of the North American Securities Administrators
Association, confirmed that mom-and-pop investors who handed money over to
these companies will likely be last in line to get their money back in these
bankruptcies. Senator Warren called on regulators and Congress to protect mom-and-pop
investors from crypto scams propped up by seemingly legitimate financial
institutions and said that she will soon introduce a bill to regulate the
crypto market and protect consumers. Transcript: Protecting Investors and Savers:
Understanding Scams and Risks in Crypto and Securities Markets
U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
Thursday, July 28, 2022Senator Elizabeth Warren: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.So crypto has made it faster and cheaper than ever before to rip off
consumers. According to the Federal Trade Commission, since the start of 2021, about
one in every four dollars that consumers were defrauded out of – totaling about
a billion dollars – was lost in a crypto scam. And those are just the scams
that are reported – not the ones people are too ashamed to tell anyone about or
never report because they know the money is gone and it just doesn’t feel like
any point in it. Today is about scams, but crypto isn’t an industry with a few scam artists
operating around the fringes. Crypto is an industry that is built to favor
scammers, and some of the biggest players in our financial system are in on the
con. Venture capital, giant hedge funds, and private equity rake in profits
from a system that’s designed to reward insiders and to defraud mom-and-pop
investors. Now, Ms. Walsh, you are an expert on protecting mom-and-pop investors, so
I’d just like to ask you who those mom-and-pop investors are up against. Are
big institutional investors becoming more prominent players in the crypto
market? Gerri Walsh, Senior Vice President of Investor Education, Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority: Thank you, senator, for that question.
Well my, you know the FINRA Foundation focuses on retail investors and has
information about retail investors. We’ve certainly seen from media reports
that there are large investments by institutional investors and hedge funds and
other entities. Senator Warren: You know, in fact, I have some of the data.
VC firms invested $33 billion in crypto-related companies last year. That’s
more than all the previous years combined. And hedge funds and other big
investors are now the main source of trading activity. Last year, professional
investors traded $1.1 trillion on Coinbase, more than double the amount retail
investors traded.In other words, some of the biggest players in our financial system – the so-called
“smart money” – are all in on crypto. Now, two companies that these big investors poured money into recently were
Voyager and Celsius, which, as it turned out, both of them filed for bankruptcy
earlier this month. Celsius, for example, announced raising $750 million from
professional investors just months before it collapsed.Ms. Walsh, Voyager and Celsius made money by taking people’s deposits and
lending them out – a lot like traditional banks. But they made astonishing
claims, like offering up to 20% interest while claiming they were FDIC insured
and quote “safer than banks.” Does that have the earmarks of a scam to you?Ms. Walsh: Senator, I appreciate that question. And if that
were happening within the space of broker-dealer regulation, FINRA would be
able to look at the advertising, because that’s what we do. We would be able to
look at the disclosures because that’s what we do. It’s important to have clarity in the digital asset space. Senator Warren: Well I appreciate clarity, but let’s be
clear here. No risk, 20% returns. Look, that was a lie from the start. It
doesn’t take a lot of deep analysis to understand what’s going on here. But notice, it did not stop big professional investors from throwing money
at crypto firms that were clearly drawing in mom-and-pop investors on a
scam. So, Ms. Lubin, do you think the mom-and-pop investors who handed their over
money to Voyager and Celsius are likely to be at the head of the line in
getting their money back during the bankruptcies of those companies? Melanie Senter Lubin, President, North American Securities
Administrators Association: Thank you, senator, for that question. And
I wouldn’t presume to tell you how bankruptcy law works. On the other hand, if
those investors are considered unsecured creditors, they’re going to be put in
the pool with everybody else, and they’re typically at the end of the
line. I have some other theories, and there are other things being litigated, so
I’m going to invoke investigative privilege and not discuss some of the other
approaches that investor’s counsel might want to take in some of those cases.Senator Warren: Fair enough, but this is going to be tough,
right? Ms. Lubin: I think it’s an uphill battle. Senator Warren: That’s right.Ms. Lubin: I’m sorry to interrupt. I think there’s an
uphill battle, and there’s always an uphill battle in bankruptcy or when we put
cases into receivership because there’s rarely enough money to cover the
investors. Senator Warren: Right. Across the crypto market, the big
investors are funding, hyping, and then vampire-sucking money out of crypto
projects that scam mom-and-pop investors.Regulators need to protect customers from cyber criminals, grifters, from
other illicit characters that are scamming consumers from the shadows. But
these shadowy actors shouldn’t distract us from the big, seemingly legitimate
players that are financing crypto and helping crypto attract the mom-and-pop
customers who are going to lose their money. And that’s why I’ll soon introduce a bill to regulate the crypto market and
stamp out the worst scams – by scam artists both big and small.Thank you, thank you Mr. Chairman.

(PDF)Washington, D.C. – Today, United States Senator Elizabeth
Warren (D-Mass.), and Representatives Katie Porter (D-Calif.) and Tony Cárdenas
(D-Calif.) reintroduced the bipartisan Behavioral Health Coverage Transparency
Act, legislation that would strengthen oversight and enforcement of federal
mental health and substance use disorder parity laws. This bill was previously
introduced by Senator Warren in 2016, 2018, and again in 2019. For the first
time, the Behavioral Health Coverage Transparency Act of 2022 will be introduced
with bipartisan support. This Congress, the legislation has been updated to account for improvements
passed in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (CAA). The CAA granted
the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Labor (DOL), and Treasury
increased oversight authority to help provide new insights into insurance
companies’ compliance with federal parity laws. In February of this year, the Departments issued their first report
following the implementation of these new provisions and documented significant
gaps in compliance, confirming that more needs to be done to strengthen
enforcement and protect consumers.“Health care – including behavioral health care – is a human right, and we
must ensure that Americans don’t face any additional barriers to getting the
often life-saving care that they need,” said Senator Warren. “The
Behavioral Health Coverage Transparency Act would help protect consumers, hold
insurers accountable, and increase compliance with federal parity laws.”“Federal law requires that insurers cover mental health the same as physical
health, yet I continue to hear from Orange County families that this isn’t
what’s happening on the ground,” said Rep. Porter, a member of the
House Oversight Committee. “Patients are three to six times more
likely to be forced out of network for mental health treatment because
insurance companies still refuse to follow the law on mental health coverage.
My Behavioral Health Coverage Transparency Act with Senator Warren will empower
consumers to report violations and increase accountability for insurers that
fail to cover mental health treatments.”“Navigating our complicated health care system is often confusing and
frustrating for people who are just looking to get help,” said
Congressman Cárdenas. “Mental health and substance use care are as
important as other forms of health care, but can be more difficult to access.
The Behavioral Health Coverage Transparency Act will improve the quality of
behavioral health care that patients are entitled to by federal law by
encouraging insurer compliance, increasing consumer protection and improving
coordination.”The updated legislation, which builds on the provisions passed in the CAA,
would: This legislation is co-sponsored by Senators Baldwin (D-Wis.), Blumenthal
(D-Conn.), Booker (D-N.J.), Brown (D-Ohio), Kaine (D-Va.), Klobuchar (D-Minn.),
Luján (D-N.M.), Markey (D-Mass.), Murphy (D-Conn.), Sanders (I-Vt.), Smith
(D-Minn.), Stabenow (D-Mich.), and Van Hollen (D-Md.) and by Representatives
Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), Trone (D-Md.), Doggett (D-Tex.), Raskin (D-Md.), Barragán
(D-Calif.), Butterfield (D-N.C.), McEachin (D-Va.), Napolitano (D-Calif.),
Jayapal (D-Wash.), Doyle (D-Pa.), Deutch (D-Fla.), Jackson Lee (D-Tex.), and
Kuster (D-N.H.).In a letter sent to Senator Warren and Representative Porter, the Mental
Health Liaison Group (MHLG), a coalition of national mental health and
addiction organizations, expressed its strong support for the legislation. The
MHLG previously offered
its endorsement for the Behavioral Health Coverage Transparency Act in 2019.“The MHLG commends the introduction of legislation to strengthen
implementation and enforcement of federal rules requiring coverage of mental
health and substance use disorder treatment at parity with other health
benefits.,” said the letter. “Given the poor compliance of
issuers and health plans in performing the comparative analyses required by
law, as revealed by the federal agencies’ report to Congress in January 2022,
we are united in the belief that more action is needed.”The letter continues, “[The Behavioral Health Coverage
Transparency Act of 2022] will help ensure mental health and substance use
disorder coverage is in compliance with parity, and treatment ultimately
becomes available to those in need.” It has received support from over 50 advocacy and expert organizations,

amendments to the parity law and requires greater accountability from health
plans and insurers. January's report to Congress from the federal agencies
responsible for parity enforcement revealed that significant work remains to
achieve full compliance with the law. We applaud Senator Warren and
Representatives Porter and Cárdenas for their continued focus on mental health
parity implementation."" – American Psychiatric Association CEO and
Medical Director Saul Levin M.D., M.P.A.“The Behavioral Health Coverage Transparency Act addresses
two essential strategies to achieve the Parity Act’s promise: helping consumers
understand and enforce their right to equitable substance use disorder and mental
health insurance coverage and improving federal oversight of health plan parity
compliance. Providing new federal funds for states to establish independent
offices of consumer assistance will ensure individuals and families who
encounter insurance barriers have the hands-on support they need to overcome
them. Coupled with stronger federal enforcement of carrier compliance
requirements and greater transparency, this bill will help address rising
mental health needs and the escalating overdose crisis in communities across
our nation."" — Ellen Weber, Sr. Vice President for Health
Initiatives, Legal Action Center“Discriminatory practices by health insurers are preventing people from
getting the life-saving care they need for substances use disorders and mental
illness. By holding health plans accountable for providing equitable coverage,
the Behavioral Health Coverage Transparency Act will increase access and
promote health equity so everyone has the care they need, when they need it!” –
Emily Stewart, Executive Director, Community Catalyst“The American Psychological Association applauds Senator Warren and
Representatives Porter and Cárdenas for introducing the Behavioral Health
Coverage Transparency Act of 2022. It has been 14 years since mental health
parity was enacted and far too many individuals are still not receiving the
mental health supports and services that they need. This initiative would
address this crisis by increasing transparency, encouraging compliance,
protecting patients and supporting consumers. APA believes that the bill’s
focus on metrics for the key issues of network adequacy, reimbursement parity
and denial rates will provide crucial data to address these remaining issues
under the law.” – Jaime “Jim” Diaz-Granados, Deputy Chief Executive
Officer, American Psychological Association“Despite passing the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act 14
years ago, we still too often see health insurers fail to provide coverage for
mental health and substance use services at parity with physical health care,” said
Hannah Wesolowski, Chief Advocacy Officer for NAMI, the National Alliance on
Mental Illness. “The strong oversight provisions in the Behavioral
Health Coverage Transparency Act will help us make progress toward receiving
equity for mental health care. We thank Senator Warren and Representatives
Porter and Cárdenas for continuing the fight for parity so that people can
receive mental health care when they need it.”“The Parity Law has gone unenforced for years as Americans die from substance
use disorder and mental health issues. We are pleased to support the Behavioral
Health Coverage Transparency Act which will move toward enforcement of this
critical law."" – Mark Dunn, Director of Public Policy, National
Association of Addiction Treatment Providers

of deregulation and consolidation have created an airline industry that
routinely heaps inconvenience and abuse on consumers. To
put an end to these harmful consumer practices and safeguard competition in the
industry, the Department must play a leading role by aggressively using the
authority it has been given by Congress.”Text
of Letter (pdf)Washington, D.C. — United States Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) sent a letter to the Secretary of the U.S.
Department of Transportation (DOT), Pete Buttigieg, urging DOT to fully utilize
its statutory authority to protect consumers, promote competition in the
airline industry and hold airlines accountable for delayed and canceled
flights. In the letter, the lawmakers raised concerns about Americans’ air
travel experiences, which have grown steadily worse over the past year, and
laid out specific actions DOT can take to hold airlines accountable for
avoidable delays and cancellations and stem the tide of airline consolidation. “By utilizing its existing licensing and
rulemaking authority, the Department can improve experiences for travelers and
help bring down exorbitant ticket prices driven in part by anticompetitive
mergers,” wrote the lawmakers.Over the past year, Americans’ air travel
experiences have grown steadily worse. One in five flights has arrived behind
schedule this year, while airlines have canceled flights four times as often
during high-travel weekends than they did in 2019. Airlines have already
canceled nearly 122,000 flights in 2022—more cancellations than occurred during
all of 2021. Airline consumer complaints to the Department have increased
threefold relative to pre-pandemic levels. Airlines have also increased flight
overbookings, causing passengers to be involuntarily denied boarding nearly
three times as often this year than they were in 2018. Unions are sounding the
alarm that airlines are selling tickets for flights they know they will not be
able to staff.Since January 2022, prices for domestic flights
have shot up 47 percent. Although airlines received $50 billion in government
assistance, they have failed to issue at least $10 billion in refunds for
flight cancellations throughout the pandemic, despite being required to do so
by federal law.  The Senators also called for DOT to play a
stronger role in the review process for mergers in the airline industry. Under
existing statutory provisions, transfers of operating certificates through
merger are only permissible when the Secretary of Transportation determines
such transfers are consistent with the public interest, which includes an
evaluation of competition in the domestic airline industry.  In the letter, the lawmakers highlight the

in The Wall Street JournalWashington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal warning that the Federal
Reserve’s decision to aggressively raise interest rates risks triggering a
devastating recession.Read the full op-ed here
and below:Wall Street Journal – Elizabeth Warren: Jerome Powell’s Fed Pursues
a Painful and Ineffective Inflation CureJuly 25, 2022By Elizabeth WarrenEven as the pandemic continues to take its toll, the U.S. has experienced a
surprisingly strong economic recovery. Since President Biden’s inauguration,
the U.S. economy has created nine million new jobs. Private-sector jobs have fully
recovered. Yet the Federal Reserve, led by Jerome Powell, is on the verge of
sacrificing all this progress in its effort to tamp down inflation. With Mr.
Powell expected to announce another round of aggressive interest-rate hikes,
the Fed risks triggering a devastating recession.Inflation is a global phenomenon inflicting significant financial pain on
families everywhere. Rising costs are an urgent problem, and interest rates
play a key role in maintaining price stability. But urgency is no excuse for
doubling down on a dangerous treatment. As with any illness, the right medicine
starts with the right diagnosis. Unfortunately, the Fed has seized on
aggressive rate hikes—a big dose of the only medicine at its disposal—even
though they are largely ineffective against many of the underlying causes of
this inflationary spike.Mr. Powell has acknowledged this. Testifying before the Senate Banking
Committee in June, he noted that elevated interest rates likely wouldn’t bring
down gasoline or food prices. “There are many things we can’t affect,” he
admitted in a June press conference—namely, the key causes of today’s
inflation. Higher interest rates won’t end skyrocketing energy prices caused by
Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine. They won’t fix supply chains still reeling
from the pandemic. And they won’t break up the corporate monopolies that Mr.
Powell admitted in January could be “raising prices because they can.”If the Fed’s interest-rate hikes won’t address many causes of today’s
inflation, it’s worth asking: What would they do?When the Fed raises interest rates, increasing the cost of borrowing money,
it becomes more expensive for businesses to invest in their operations. As a
result, employers will slow hiring, cut hours and fire workers, leaving
families with less money. In the bloodless language of economists, that’s
referred to as “dampening demand.” But make no mistake: If the Fed cuts too
much or too abruptly, the resulting recession will leave millions of
people—disproportionately lower-wage workers and workers of color—with smaller
paychecks or no paycheck at all.The likelihood that overzealous rate hikes trigger a recession is growing.
Goldman Sachs cautioned that the Fed’s policy is more aggressive than necessary
and doubled its forecast of the likelihood that the economy falls into a
recession over the next year. Nobel Prize-winning economist Peter Diamond has
warned about the substantial risk of a crash landing from the Fed’s aggressive
approach. Mr. Powell has even conceded that the Fed’s actions may lead to a
downturn, saying recession “is not our intended outcome at all, but it’s
certainly a possibility.”Despite these warnings, the Fed chairman still has cheerleaders for his
rate-hiking approach. Chief among them is Larry Summers. “We need five years of
unemployment above 5% to contain inflation—in other words, we need two years of
7.5% unemployment or five years of 6% unemployment or one year of 10%
unemployment,” the former Treasury secretary recently told the London School of
Economics. You read that correctly: 10% unemployment. This is the comment of
someone who has never worried about where his next paycheck will come from.If Messrs. Powell and Summers have their way, the resulting recession will
be brutal. As in past downturns, Republicans in Congress will press for
austerity—tax cuts for giant corporations and the rich, weaker regulation on
big businesses, and little economic support for the most vulnerable. Democrats
should be ready to reject the Republican playbook and prepared to help working
families survive.But it doesn’t have to be this way. The Biden administration recognizes the
U.S. has many tools for fighting inflation that wouldn’t make the economy
smaller and Americans poorer. The president has undertaken a range of actions.
To relieve the pain at the pump imposed by Mr. Putin’s war, the president
ordered the largest-ever release of strategic oil reserves and spurred one of
the fastest declines in gasoline prices in more than a decade. To lower food
prices, he dedicated $1 billion to expand meat-processing capacity. To
straighten out supply-chain kinks, Mr. Biden has tackled shipping-container
backlogs at our ports. And to combat corporate monopolies using inflation as an
excuse to pad their profits, the president has empowered the most aggressive
antitrust enforcers in a generation.Congress should do its part to fight inflation. Investing in high-quality,
affordable child care would lower costs by bringing more than a million parents
into the workforce. Ending tax breaks for off-shoring and investing in American
manufacturing would create good jobs and strengthen supply chains. Allowing
Medicare to negotiate prices for prescription drugs would lower healthcare
costs. And giving the Biden administration more tools to bolster competition
policy would help crack down on price gouging by large corporations.Before the Federal Reserve triggers a recession, Mr. Powell should remember
that the one medicine in his kit doesn’t treat every economic illness. Low
unemployment and high inflation are painful, but a Fed-manufactured recession
that puts millions of Americans out of work without addressing high prices
would be far worse.Ms. Warren, a Democrat, is a U.S. senator from Massachusetts.

Exchange (Youtube)Washington, D.C. - During a Senate Committee on Banking,
Housing, and Urban Affairs (BHUA) hearing, United States Senators Elizabeth
Warren (D-Mass.) expressed concern about two key drivers of rising housing
prices: an extreme housing supply shortage and the growing role of private
equity firms and other institutional investors in the housing market. She also
called out Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s interest rate hikes for
potentially exacerbating the housing crisis by making it more expensive to
build new housing and for families to take out a mortgage.In response to Senator Warren’s questions, Dr. Lawrence Yun, Chief Economist
and Senior Vice President for Research at the National Association of Realtors,
explained that higher interest rates are likely to increase rental costs for
families while allowing large corporate investors like private equity firms to
increase their purchases of homes. Peggy Bailey, Vice President for Housing
Policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, noted that increased
investor activity in the housing market could further increase rental prices
and displace families of color. Transcript: Priced Out: The State of Housing in America
U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs
Thursday, July 21, 2022Senator Elizabeth Warren: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Our country has faced an affordable housing crisis for decades now, and we
have a shortage now – the estimates are as many as 6.8 million units that we
need. Everyone needs housing, there’s just not enough to go around. It is a
classic case of demand outstrips supply. So this is Econ 101, and that says
we’re going to end up with higher prices. Indeed, this severe lack of supply
has relentlessly pushed up the cost of rent for families, taking bigger and
bigger bites out of budgets – as you identified – that are now doubly strained
by rising prices on everything else from gasoline to groceries. Rents are up nearly 6% more than they were just a year ago, and higher
housing costs are one of the biggest overall drivers of inflation. So to tackle rising costs, the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates at
an aggressive pace. But we should be clear about the impact of the Fed’s rate
hikes on the housing market.Dr. Yun, the Fed claims its rate hikes will bring down prices for families
by taming inflation. So, let me ask you – do you expect the Fed’s interest rate
hikes will meaningfully bring down rental costs for families?Dr. Lawrence Yun, Chief Economist and Senior Vice President for
Research, National Association of REALTORS: The rental component in
the Consumer Price Index comprises about 30% – including something a homeowner
equivalency rent. Given that there will be fewer buying activity and more
renters, rents will be rising, so, in fact, one can say at least the rental
component with higher interest rates, it will be rising even faster.Senator Warren: So the Fed’s actions on aggressive interest
rate increases are likely to drive up the cost of rent. Dr. Lawrence Yun: Yes -Senator Warren: And as you say, that’s about 30% of the
inflation calculation. So it’s not going to bring down rental costs, it’s not
going to bring down the cost of food, or gas, or other necessities that have
spiked because of Putin’s war in Ukraine, it’s not going to fix supply-chain
kinks, it’s not going to stop corporate price gouging. But by increasing borrowing costs, the Fed’s rate hikes will do two things:
First, make it more expensive to build new housing – which dampens investment
in construction and makes the housing shortage even worse. And second, make it
more expensive for families to take out a mortgage and buy a home. The cost of
a mortgage – as you’ve pointed out – has already doubled since last year.So, Dr. Yun, people renting and buying homes are worse off when the Fed
jacks up rates. But are there any participants in the housing market who are
relatively better off under these conditions – like, big investors and private
equity firms? Dr. Yun: The multiple offers – intense multiple offers were
prevalent throughout last year. Now the multiple offers are far less
occurrence, which means that people who are still in the market are able to
grab property with much easier access, and certainly, the corporate investors
would be in that category.Senator Warren: And corporate investors, I take it, are
often buying for cash?Dr. Yun: Cash buyers – which consequently makes it very
difficult for the first-time buyer who needs to take out a mortgage to
compete. Senator Warren: Right. So private equity firms are buying
in. They swoop up what little housing is available. They rent it out to
families at a premium. In fact, in the first quarter of this year, investors
purchased one out of every five homes that was sold – which is a national
record. Ms. Bailey, if private equity and other big investors buy more of the
housing stock, what do you expect will be the impact on rent prices on the
families that are living in those homes?Peggy Bailey, Vice President for Housing Policy, Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities: Thank you, Senator, for that question. I think
that we can expect that rents will increase, putting more pressure on families’
incomes and having them have to stretch their already thin budgets even
further. The other thing, though, that often gets missed is that that can also
lead to gentrification of neighborhoods and displacement of families that live
in those neighborhoods, which is also a challenge when equity firms purchase
properties. Senator Warren: Yes, thank you. You know, the solution to
bringing down housing costs for families is clear. Step one: build more
housing. And step two: loosen big investors’ grip on the market to make sure
that it is families, not just private equity firms, that have an opportunity to
buy a home. There’s also a third step that the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell
should take: think twice before jamming through overly aggressive rate hikes
that are only going to make the housing crisis worse. Thank you very much for
being with us today.And thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing.

of Letter (pdf)Washington, D.C.— United States Senator Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.) and Representative Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) sent a letter to the
U.S. Department of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo raising questions about the
revolving door between the Department of Commerce and Big Tech companies, and
its potential impact on global digital trade rules. In the letter, the
lawmakers express concerns about how key Commerce officials who previously
worked for Big Tech companies now work at the Department and may have the
ability to shape digital trade policies. The lawmakers also request information
about the safeguards the Department has in place to prevent corruption and
ensure that corporate interests do not undermine the digital rights of global
consumers, workers, and small businesses. The lawmakers’ questions come as
Commerce is currently engaged in digital trade negotiations in the U.S.-EU
Trade and Technology Council (TTC) and the proposed Indo-Pacific Economic
Framework (IPEF). “Congress is considering important steps to rein in Big Tech and protect
consumers, workers, and small businesses, as are trading partners like the
European Union (EU). But Big Tech companies want to continue to exploit our
data unchecked, and are deploying hordes of lobbyists to stop legislatures from
acting. At the same time, Big Tech is seeking to weaponize global digital trade
rules, painting privacy regulations or competition policy as unfair ‘barriers
to trade’ in order to tie regulators’ hands,” wrote the lawmakers.The use of the revolving door is not a new problem at the Commerce
Department. According to a review of executive branch staff under former
President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, 18 percent of Commerce
appointees were registered as lobbyists before or after their government service
(or both), the highest of all Cabinet departments. A recent analysis by the
Revolving Door Project highlighted Big Tech’s current influence within the
Department, with several former employees for companies like Google and Amazon
filling key Commerce roles.For example, former Commerce Deputy Assistant Secretary Christopher Hoff has
taken several turns through the revolving door between the Department of
Commerce and Big Tech. Hoff worked on digital trade policy at the Commerce
Department during the Obama Administration, but left in 2015 to work for law
firms that represent Big Tech. In 2021, Hoff returned to Commerce as Deputy
Assistant Secretary for Services at the International Trade Administration,
where he continued to push for weaker data regulation that would permit Big
Tech companies to extract data from people with little government
oversight. “These reports – combined with your own stated commitment to protect Big
Tech’s market share from EU regulation and unanswered questions about your
meetings with Big Tech – raise serious concerns about your agency’s approach to
digital trade policy in the TTC and IPEF.  The American people deserve to
know that your agency is working on their behalf and not for past or future Big
Tech employers,” continued the lawmakers.Senator Warren has long pushed to end corrupt revolving door practices, curb
Big Tech’s growing power, and protect consumer data.

Decision to Repeal Roe v. Wade, Student Activity Monitoring Software May Place
Students at Increased Risk of Criminalization Text
of Letters (PDF)Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) sent letters to Bark Technologies, Gaggle.net,
GoGuardian, and Securly Inc., raising concerns that the software these
companies use to monitor students’ online activity could be used to criminalize
or punish students who are seeking information about abortion services and
reproductive health care. In their letters, the senators ask whether the
companies’ software flags students’ online searches for terms related to
reproductive health and how they are ensuring that their software is not used to
criminalize or punish students. “While the stated intent of your products is to protect student safety, an investigation that
we released in March 2022 revealed significant privacy and equity concerns
associated with your software,” wrote the senators. “A recent
report by privacy experts… found that digital surveillance data can be
weaponized ‘to target pregnant people and use their health data against them in
a court of law,’ and internet search engines were identified as ‘particularly
potent tool(s)’ as ‘police can not only obtain search histories from a pregnant
person’s device, but can also obtain records directly from search
engines.’” Despite assurances from these companies that their products are not intended
to be used for disciplinary or punitive purposes, the senators note that their
report found that student activity monitoring software often is used to punish
students: A survey of teachers found that almost half work in schools that have
used the software to identify violations of discipline policies. Additionally,
many companies immediately flag certain activities and content for law
enforcement. “It would be deeply disturbing if your software flags words or activity that
suggest students are searching for contraception, abortion, or other related
services, and if school administrators, parents, and even law enforcement were
potentially informed of this activity,” continued the senators. With abortion and reproductive rights under attack, the senators are asking
the companies to answer a set of questions about their policies for handling
students’ sensitive reproductive health data or searches, their software’s
flagging of certain search terms, and their policies for sharing student search
data with parents, schools, and law enforcement by August 3, 2022. Since the extremist Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and
unleashed a nationwide attack on abortion and reproductive rights, Senator
Warren has called on the government to use every tool to protect reproductive
freedom and protect Americans’ sensitive data:

Family Planning Act Would Provide Strong, Mandatory Funding for the Title X
Family Planning ProgramText
of Bill (pdf) | One
Pager (pdf)Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.),
Tina Smith (D-Minn.), and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Chair of the Senate Health,
Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, led a group of their
Democratic colleagues in introducing the Expanding Access to Family
Planning Act. The bill would protect access to critical reproductive
health care services—like birth control, cancer screenings, and more—by
providing a consistent and strong source of funding for the Title X Family
Planning Program.The Title X Family Planning Program is the only federal program dedicated to
providing comprehensive family planning and preventive health care services.
Millions of Americans rely on the program for essential health care. In 2020
alone, over 1.5 million patients received family planning services through
Title X. The program is funded through the annual appropriations process, which
subjects it to an unpredictable funding stream that is insufficient to meet the
national need. The senators’ Expanding Access to Family Planning Act would
provide a consistent and strong source of funding for Title X.“All across this country, Americans are facing rampant attacks on their
reproductive freedom, emboldened by the extremist Supreme Court and radical
right-wing politicians,” said Senator Warren. “In the face of
these attacks, we must strengthen and expand the Title X Family Planning
Program, which ensures access to contraception, cancer screenings, HIV tests,
and other essential health care. If Republicans really support women and
families, as they claim, they should join us.”“At a time when Americans’ reproductive freedoms are under attack from
extremist Republicans, the Title X Family Planning Program is more important
than ever,” said Senator Smith. “Title X funding provides
American women with access to critical reproductive health services. I invite
all my Republican colleagues who claim to champion family planning services to
join us in supporting this commonsense legislation that will protect women’s
access to birth control, pregnancy counseling, basic infertility services, and
more.”“Our legislation will strengthen Title X to help more patients get the birth
control they need, the cervical and breast cancer screenings that could save
their life, and the support they need to plan a family on their own terms,” said
Senator Murray. “I’d just ask all of my Republican colleagues—who have
been loudly talking about supporting women and have been using their so-called
support for family planning to cover up their extreme agenda—what is your word
worth? Will you actually support women—and help them get the birth control they
need? On Thursday, women across the country will be watching closely.” The Expanding Access to Family Planning Act would:In addition to Senators Warren, Smith, and Murray, the legislation is also

http://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/warren-calls-for-answers-from-brookings-institution-about-allegations-of-its-former-presidents-lobbying-for-qatar,"Warren Calls out Troubling Accusations
of Illegal and Inappropriate Lobbying By Brookings Officials and LeadersText
of Letter (PDF)Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.) sent a letter to the Brookings Institution following reports
that former Marine Corps General John R. Allen, the former President of the
Brookings Institution, is under investigation by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for making false statements and withholding documents about his
role in possible illegal lobbying for the government of Qatar. Senator Warren
is asking Brookings for answers about its efforts to prevent Allen and other
researchers from violating the law or inappropriately or unethically aiding
foreign governments, and about the Institution’s efforts to rein in its
researchers' conflicts of interest.“While Allen has resigned, this incident raises broader concerns about
conflicts of interest and foreign influence at Brookings, and the impact that
these financial ties with foreign entities may have on Brookings Institution
staff and the work they do,” wrote Senator Warren.“The
American people deserve to know how foreign countries and corporations buy
influence over the federal government, and through think tanks that are
designed to influence federal government decisions and actions.” Reports indicate that General Allen was “pursuing multi-million dollar
business deals with the Qatari government” and led a behind-the-scenes
influence campaign that  “played an important role in shifting the U.S.’s
response” toward Qatar. According
to authorities, Allen “lobbied then-National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster
to have the Trump administration adopt a more Qatar-friendly tone.”Although Allen has resigned, Senator Warren’s letter raises broader concerns
about Brookings’ failure to address and disclose financial conflicts of
interest. In 2015, Senator Warren sent
a letter to Brookings regarding its failure to disclose that the financial
industry funded research by Dr. Robert Litan, then a Nonresident Senior Fellow,
and was given editorial control of his work products, calling into question the
independence of his work. Last month,  Senator Warren sent
letters to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd
Austin, requesting information about Allen’s alleged lobbying for the Qatari
government.Senator Warren is asking Brookings for a response to a set of questions
about its efforts to prevent Allen and other researchers from violating the law
and preventing financial conflicts of interest by July 29, 2022.Senator Warren has led efforts to fight government corruption and the
revolving door that lets former government officials cash in on their service.
Senator Warren’s Anti-Corruption
and Public Integrity Act is sweeping anti-corruption
legislation that would rein in corruption, strengthen ethics, end lobbying as
we know it, improve the integrity of the judiciary, and reform campaign finance
law. Her DoD Ethics
and Anti-Corruption Act (S.
2396) would require the explicit approval of the Secretary of State for all
former senior officials of the White House and Departments of State, Defense,
and Treasury who seek paid work for a foreign government or non-governmental
foreign entity, and bans former senior Pentagon officials from lobbying and
behind-the-scenes lobbying DoD for four years. Senator Warren has also worked
to secure commitments from nominees — including Secretary
Austin and other
Department of Defense nominees — on ethics standards.

of Letter (PDF)Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
and Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Vice
Chair Jesus “Chuy” Garcia (D-Ill.) led 12 Senators and 31 Representatives in
letters to President Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, calling on the
Biden administration to immediately support the issuance of at least $650
billion in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), a cost-free reserve asset distributed
by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). A new SDR issuance would provide
urgently needed resources for developing countries and address the combined
international crises of an ongoing pandemic and alarming increases in food
insecurity and poverty, while supplying a critical infusion of immediate
financial support to Ukraine. “Developing countries, and the billions of people who inhabit them, are
facing unprecedented challenges and need financial support now… we urge
the United States to pursue this opportunity to provide cost-free relief
worldwide. The United States has demonstrated its leadership and the value of
the existing multilateral financial system and we ask that it do so once again.
It is currently in the power of the administration to immediately act
in support of a new $650 billion new SDR issuance for global relief,” wrote
the lawmakers. In 2021, the Biden administration supported the issuance of $650 billion in
SDRs, which allowed at least 99 developing countries “to stabilize their
currencies, shore up reserves, pay off debts, and finance health care, such as
vaccinations, and other urgent needs.” Since then, the lawmakers point out the doubling of people facing acute food
insecurity globally, billions who remain unvaccinated against COVID-19,
emerging debt crises, and declining economic growth in the developing world.
The urgency for a new issuance of SDRs has only increased since Russia’s war of
aggression in Ukraine, the lawmakers argue, noting that the Ukrainian
government used the entirety of its SDR holdings, and Ukraine’s Finance
Minister Sergii Marchenko has described the need for additional SDRs as “a
question of the survival of our country” in light of estimates that the
country’s GDP will contract by 45 percent. Ukraine’s economic crisis has
disrupted the global food supply, increasing developing countries' need for
funding that can stave off life-threatening hunger. Signatories on the letter include Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.),
Cory A. Booker (D-N.J.), Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Benjamin
L. Cardin (D-Md.), Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.), Senate Appropriations Chair

ServicesText
of Letter (PDF)Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) sent letters to Facebook and Instagram,
calling on them to address their reported censorship of posts related to
abortion services, following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade
last month.“As a result of the Court’s decision [overturning Roe v. Wade], it
is more important than ever that social media platforms not censor truthful
posts about abortion, particularly as people across the country turn to online
communities to discuss and find information about reproductive rights,” the
senators wrote.As Americans used social media to discuss the impacts of the Supreme Court’s
overturning of Roe v. Wade, both Facebook and Instagram reportedly
removed numerous users’ posts about abortion services. Reports show that
many posts providing information about access to legal abortion services were removed from
the platforms, often minutes after they were posted, and other
posts mentioning abortion were taken down or tagged with “sensitivity
screens” and warnings. The senators are asking Facebook and Instagram to
provide answers to a set of questions about their content-moderation policies
and statistics about abortion-related posts by July 15, 2022. As the right to abortion and basic health care is under attack by the
Supreme Court and Republican extremists across the country, Senator Warren has
worked to protect the right to an abortion and protect the sensitive data of
all Americans.

Reveals Consumers Lost an Estimated $440 Million through Fraud and Scams in
2021Nearly 18 Million Americans
Were Defrauded Through Scams Involving Zelle and Other Instant Payment
Applications in 2020Text
of Letter (PDF)Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.); Bob Menendez (D-N.J.); Jack Reed (D-R.I.); Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio),
Chair of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee; Chris Van
Hollen (D-Md.); Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.); and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) sent
letters to seven of the nation’s largest banks, demanding answers about
widespread fraud on Zelle, their online peer-to-peer money transfer program.
Copies of this letter were sent to Bank of America, Truist, Capital One,
JPMorgan Chase, PNC, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo, which collectively own Zelle’s
parent company. “In 2021, consumers and businesses made 1.8 billion payments to transfer
$490 billion through Zelle…[and p]ayment volumes have increased 49%
year-over-year. As these payment networks have become ubiquitous, frauds and
scams have proliferated,” wrote the senators. “One of Zelle’s
biggest selling points to consumers – the ability to immediately transfer money
– makes the platform a ‘favorite of fraudsters’ because consumers have no
option to cancel a transaction, even moments after authorizing it… At least in
the case of Zelle, the banks that participate in the network appear not to have
provided sufficient recourse to their customers.”In 2020, nearly 18 million Americans were defrauded through scams involving
Zelle and other instant payment applications; yet, the banks that participate
in the network appear not to have provided sufficient recourse to their
customers. According to
Consumer Watchdog, this is a widespread problem that the big banks are
doing little to address. In late April, Senators Warren, Menendez, and Reed wrote
a letter to Early Warning Services, LLC (EWS), Zelle’s parent company which
itself is co-owned by seven of the nation’s largest banks: Bank of America,
Truist, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, PNC, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo. EWS’
response has only heightened the senators’ concerns about fraud on Zelle and
the ongoing failures to adequately address these fraudulent schemes.EWS claims it has gone beyond what is required under Regulation E and
adopted a ‘zero-liability’ approach for any transaction through a participant
institution on the Zelle Network determined to be unauthorized, and added that
its rules require each participant institution to provide full refunds for
Zelle transactions determined to be unauthorized within the meaning of the
Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) and Regulation E. Yet, only a narrow set of
transactions are clearly unauthorized within the meaning of the EFTA and
Regulation E. According to EWS, the company uses the term ‘fraud’ to refer to
unauthorized transactions, meaning transactions that a consumer does not themself
authorize and initiate – a definition that excludes the fraudulent schemes that
have been extensively documented in the press and by Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau guidance.According to EWS, consumers sent $490 billion through Zelle in 2021, of
which an estimated $440 million were lost through fraud and scams; however, it
is unclear exactly how or who determined whether a transaction is fraudulent or
a scam – meaning the money consumers have lost through such schemes could be
higher than what EWS has estimated. “The distinction EWS draws between fraud (transactions not authorized by the
account owner) and scams (transactions authorized by the account owner, but
induced through deception) ignores how consumers actually suffer financial loss
on Zelle,” concluded the senators. “…While several banks have
made the argument that they should not be held responsible for such scams, we
believe that you need to do more to protect your customers. Given the sheer
numbers of consumers using online payments services such as Zelle and the
amount of money at risk, the absence of protective measures is unacceptable.”

Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Jeff Merkley
(D-Ore.) and Representatives Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and Rashida Tlaib
(D-Mich.) sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the
Department of Energy (DOE), highlighting findings from their investigation into
the environmental impacts of cryptomining and requesting that the EPA and DOE
work together to require cryptominers to report their emissions and energy
use. “The results of our investigation… are disturbing… revealing that
cryptominers are large energy users that account for a significant – and
rapidly growing – amount of carbon emissions. Our investigation suggests that
the overall U.S. cryptomining industry is likely to be problematic for energy
and emissions. But little is known about the full scope of cryptomining
activity. Given these concerns, it is imperative that your agencies work
together to address the lack of information about cryptomining’s energy use and
environmental impacts, and use all available authorities at your
disposal…  to require reporting of energy use and emissions from
cryptominers,” wrote the lawmakers.Cryptomining’s energy usage rivals that of entire countries. The total
annual global electricity consumption associated with just the two largest
cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Bitcoin and Ethereum, has been
comparable to the annual electricity usage of the United Kingdom and resulted
in almost 80 million tons of carbon dioxide emission in 2021. This substantial
energy use also drives up electricity costs for consumers and small businesses.
According to a recent study, “the power demands of cryptocurrency mining
operations in upstate New York push up annual electric bills by about $165
million for small businesses and $79 million for individuals.”The lawmakers note that state and federal regulators know very little about
the full scope of electricity use and emissions associated with cryptomining,
given the lack of national or state reporting requirements and data about the
locations and operations of cryptomining facilities. In December
2021 and January
2022, the lawmakers sent letters to seven large cryptomining companies,
seeking information about the locations of their facilities, their energy
sources and consumption, and the climate impacts associated with this
production. While the companies did not provide full and complete information,
their responses and the lawmakers’ investigation revealed the following:The lawmakers are calling on the EPA and DOE to use their authority to
require reporting about cryptomining’s energy use and environmental impact and

increasing assault weapons export licenses by 30% and turning down less than
one-half of one percent of applications is consistent with the President’s
stated objectives? Is the Commerce Department working for the President or working
for the gun industry here?”Hearing
Exchange (YouTube)Washington, D.C. – Today, at a hearing of the Senate
Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.) questioned Alan Estevez, Under Secretary for Industry and Security at
the Department of Commerce about the agency’s lax approach to export controls
of military-style assault weapons like the one used on the Fourth of July to
kill seven people in Highland Park, Illinois. Senator Warren called on the
Biden administration to fulfill a campaign promise to return assault weapons
exports to the control of the U.S. Department of State in order to increase
oversight of these firearm exports. In 2020, the Trump administration implemented regulations that changed
export controls of assault weapons and their ammunition and accessories by
transferring them from the United States Munitions List (USML), which is
administered by the State Department, to the Commerce Control List, which is
administered by the Commerce Department. The Commerce Control List’s export
requirements are typically seen as less strict and do not provide the same
authorities for Congress to block licenses. During the 2020 presidential
campaign, President Biden committed to keeping assault weapons under State
Department control, but the Biden administration has not taken action to return
assault weapons to the USML. At the hearing, Senator Warren highlighted that the Commerce Department has
approved $15.7 billion in assault weapons export licenses, an increase of 30%
compared to the State Department. The Commerce Department has also turned down
less than one-half of one percent of applications. Transcript: Advancing National Security and Foreign
Policy Through Export Controls: Oversight of the Bureau of Industry and
Security
U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
Thursday, July 14, 2022Senator Elizabeth Warren: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So I
want to ask specifically about military-style assault weapons like the one used
on the Fourth of July to kill seven people in Highland Park.  Congress should reinstate the assault weapons ban to keep these guns off our
streets. But we shouldn’t be shipping them to just anyone overseas either. In
fact, companies need licenses from the federal government to sell assault
weapons overseas, these are called an export license. But in 2020, the Trump
administration made it easier to get that permission by putting the Commerce
Department in charge, instead of the State Department, where those permissions
had always resided. This shift is important. The State Department has deep expertise in foreign
instability, human rights abuses, and terrorism. The Commerce Department
specializes in promoting U.S. industry overseas – even the gun industry.In the 2020 campaign, President Biden promised to reverse the Trump decision
and put export control back with the State Department. But as of today, that
has not happened.So, Under Secretary Estevez, how many billions of dollars in assault weapons
sales has Commerce approved since it took over export control in March 2020?Under Secretary Alan Estevez, Department of Commerce: I
will have to get back to you on the exact amount, Senator. So I’ll get you-Senator Warren: -Do you want to do an estimate?Under Secretary Estevez: Uh. Secretary Warren: I think your records show-Under Secretary Estevez: -I think the website shows 15
billion. Senator Warren: 15.7 billion.Under Secretary Estevez: All types of weapons, not just
assault weapons. Senator Warren: So, Commerce approved $15.7B in weapons
sales in its first 16 months on the job. And by comparison, the State
Department, when the State Department was making these decisions, it approved
$12B on average in the same time period – including some weapons that never got
transferred to Commerce. So, if you do the math—that’s about a 30%
increase.  That is a huge boon to the gun industry. The $15.7B in Commerce-approved
exports is nearly as large as the current size of the entire $19B U.S. gun
manufacturing industry.  Export control law gives Commerce a lot of authority to disapprove license
requests, including if such weapons sales threaten our national security or
undermine our foreign policy.So, Under Secretary Estevez, how often since March 2020 has the Commerce
Department actually denied the gun industry’s requests to export these assault
weapons?Under Secretary Estevez: So, Senator, a couple of things.
And it is a small percentage. I get it, I don’t have a percentage. But can I
answer a couple of other points?Senator Warren: Well-Under Secretary Estevez: -The State Department is part
of my review process. State Department can stop a sale. Senator Warren: I am asking now that you have the approval
process, what have you done? How many have you disapproved in that time period?
Do you know the number?Under Secretary Estevez: I do not know.Senator Warren: It’s four-tenths of one percent. That is
less than one-half of one percent of the applications were disapproved. Which
sounds a lot like the Commerce Department is rubber stamping these license
applications, including to places like Mexico, where corruption puts these
weapons in the hands of criminals, or the Philippines, where there are multiple
reports of security forces shooting civilians.Now, President Biden has stated clearly that he supports cracking down on
assault weapons – both at home and overseas.So let me ask Under Secretary Estevez, can you explain how increasing
assault weapons export licenses by 30% and turning down less than one-half of
one percent of applications is consistent with the President’s stated
objectives? Is the Commerce Department working for the President or working for
the gun industry here?  Under Secretary Estevez: Senator, that also includes sales
to people like Ukraine that are using those weapons against the Russians.Senator Warren: I have no doubt.Under Secretary Estevez: So, this is an inter-agency
process now that has moved to Commerce. There’s a power of the Department of
State that brings State’s jurisdiction to that discussion, the Department of
Defense and the Department of Energy. So it’s an inter-agency process that-Senator Warren: Wait, wait a minute- Under Secretary Estevez: -that approves gun-Senator Warren: Excuse me Under Secretary-Under Secretary Estevez: -it’s not just the Commerce
Department.Senator Warren: Excuse me, what happened was authority was
transferred to the Commerce Department and what has happened is that it has a
minuscule disapproval rate and the weapons sales have gone up dramatically.Look, the Commerce Department is helping put more assault weapons in more
hands and this needs to stop. It’s time to put overseas gun sales back in the
hands of the State Department where someone can exercise better judgment. Thank you Mr. Chairman.

of Letter (PDF)Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and over a dozen Senate
Democrats wrote to President Biden and Health and Human Services (HHS)
Secretary Xavier Becerra, urging them to immediately declare national and
public health emergencies over Americans’ access to reproductive care.The letter was signed by 18 Senators in total, including Senators Elizabeth
Warren (D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Richard
Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawai'i), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Kirsten
Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Tina Smith
(D-Minn.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Amy Klobuchar
(D-Minn.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Tammy Baldwin
(D-Wisc.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).“By overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decided that the
government – not the person who is pregnant – should determine private health
care decisions, denying women the right to control their own bodies and
exacerbating the nation’s shameful maternal mortality crisis,” said
Senator Warren. “This is an emergency – and we need to treat it like
one. Declaring a national and public health emergency will help ensure that
abortion and other reproductive care is accessible, affordable, and available.”“The U.S already has the highest rate of maternal mortality among its peer
countries. Health experts agree that the outrageous Dobbs ruling will
increase maternal mortality rates, with a disproportionate impact on Black,
Indigenous and other communities of color. The federal government should do
everything in its power to ensure all Americans have access to the reproductive
care they need. Declaring a national and public health emergency underscores
the urgency of this crisis and opens new options to protect Americans’
reproductive rights,” said Senator Booker.“A post-Roe America puts people’s lives in danger and we strongly urge the
President to declare a public health emergency,” said Senator Padilla.
“The Dobbs decision has created a public health crisis for millions of
Americans as extreme Republican state legislatures across the country implement
dangerous abortion bans. We must act urgently and use every tool at our
disposal to protect reproductive health care.”Millions of Americans have been endangered by the Supreme Court’s reckless
decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and eliminate the constitutional
right to an abortion. In state after state, Republican lawmakers have
implemented extremist abortion bans and restrictions. Health care providers
have already been forced to withhold lifesaving care. And the maternal
mortality crisis, mental health outcomes, and economic disparities are bound to
worsen, especially if rightwing extremists follow through on their public calls
for a nationwide abortion ban. “As President of the United States and Secretary of Health and Human
Services, you have the authority to declare a national emergency and public
health emergency over these attacks on Americans’ reproductive rights. . . .
These authorities have been used by the Biden-Harris Administration—and other
presidential administrations—to address public health crises ranging from the
COVID-19 pandemic to the opioid epidemic,” wrote the lawmakers.The letter is endorsed by leading reproductive rights organizations including: Planned Parenthood Federation of America, NARAL Pro-Choice America, Center for Reproductive Rights, and EMAA Project.The lawmakers outlined six powerful flexibilities and resources that could
be unlocked by emergency declarations to safeguard and improve access to
reproductive care across the country. By declaring a national and public health
emergency, the administration could:“While it is impossible to immediately undo the damage inflicted by the
Supreme Court’s repeal of Roe v. Wade, the Biden-Harris Administration must use
every tool within its power to fight back,” concluded the lawmakers.
“Your leadership during this unprecedented crisis for women is more important
than ever.”As the right to abortion is under attack by an extremist Supreme Court and
rightwing state legislatures, Senator Warren has called on the government to
use every tool to protect reproductive freedom:

and easy tax filing tools and cut down on the 13 hours and $240 that taxpayers
spend on average filing taxesText
of Bill (pdf)  | One
Pager (pdf)Washington D.C. -  U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.) led 22 colleagues in introducing the Tax Filing Simplification
Act of 2022, with Representatives Katie Porter (D-Calif.) and Brad Sherman
(D-Calif.) introducing the House companion. This legislation would simplify the
tax filing process for millions of Americans, saving them hours and hundreds of
dollars. Along with lowering costs and eliminating red tape for all taxpayers,
simplified filing tools would ensure that more eligible people – including
millions of low-income Americans – receive important tax refunds, like the
Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit. According to recent polling, 77%
of Americans support this legislation.This legislation follows years of issues with the Free File program, which
was outsourced by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to the tax prep industry
and serves
just 3% of taxpayers when 70% are eligible. Longtime Free File Alliance member
Intuit has
been
sued for scamming taxpayers into paying for filing services that should have
been free, and faced reports
of ongoing abuse of revolving door tactics to defend the broken tax filing
system. The Government Accountability Office recently recommended that the IRS
develop additional options for free online filing, and Treasury Secretary Janet
Yellen agreed
that investing in truly free and simple tax filing tools like those proposed in
this legislation is “definitely a priority."" “The average American spends 13 hours and $240 every year to file their
taxes — that's too much time and too much money. This is the result of
corporations like Intuit sabotaging the Free File program to rake in large
profits. Congress should pass my Tax Filing Simplification Act, and
the IRS itself can and should adopt my plan to simplify the tax filing process
for millions of Americans and lower their costs.” said Senator
Elizabeth Warren.“It should be free and easy for Americans to file their taxes; instead,
Orange County families have to waste time and money each year,” said
Congresswoman Katie Porter, a member of the House Oversight and Reform
Committee. “The IRS already has the information it needs to calculate
tax liabilities and refunds, but corporate special interests like TurboTax have
lobbied Congress for years to allow them to keep abusing taxpayers to line
their pockets. Our Tax Filing Simplification Act puts people first and
makes government work better for taxpayers.”“American taxpayers spend too much time and money preparing their tax returns.
It doesn’t have to be this way,” said Congressman Brad Sherman, a CPA
and Co-Chair of the Bipartisan CPA Caucus. “The Tax Filing
Simplification Act represents a common-sense solution to a problem that’s
burdened taxpayers for too long -- simplifying the tax filing process with
fewer costs and complications. Pleased to team up with Senator Warren and
Congresswoman Porter in this effort to help the government work better for the
people.”   “Wisconsin taxpayers waste hours and hundreds of dollars each year on a
confusing tax system. It does not have to be this way,” said Senator
Tammy Baldwin. “This legislation would offer an easy-to-use online
service that would simplify the tax filing and preparation process, saving
Wisconsinites time and their hard earned money.”“This legislation will save taxpayers valuable time and money. Our current
system is so confusing  that filers purchase unnecessary third-party
programs, forcing them to share their sensitive information and leaving them
vulnerable to fraud,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal.
“Americans deserve access to simple, free tax preparation and filing services.
I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing this measure to modernize and
streamline the burdensome tax filing process.”  “Granite Staters spend too much time and money filing their taxes—a process
that should be simple and free,” said Senator Maggie Hassan.
“This bill will ensure that the IRS has a more streamlined system that offers
free tax-filing online. I urge my colleagues across the aisle to support this
bill, and I will continue working to improve government
efficiency.”  “Every tax season, Americans spend countless hours sifting through
complicated tax forms and filing their taxes,” said Senator Tim Kaine.
“This legislation is a necessary step to simplifying the tax filing process and
ensuring Americans have access to a free online filing service.”“Far too many Americans struggle with an expensive, complicated, and
time-consuming process just to file their taxes,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar.
“This common sense legislation will make it easier for Americans to file their
taxes while lowering their costs.”“Seventy percent of Americans qualify for quick, easy, and free tax filing –
but a complex and intimidating system for accessing free tax preparation means
that millions of families feel forced to spend their precious time and money on
third-party tax software,” said Senator Angus King. “The Tax
Filing Simplification Act of 2022 would end the third-party chokehold on
tax filing and direct the IRS to create their own simple and free online portal
where taxpayers can directly enter and file their returns. The bill would also
help taxpayers automatically receive and submit the information they need to
file their taxes, saving time and reducing the risk of costly errors. This is a
long overdue, commonsense step to demystify tax filing, converting a
universally-dreaded chore into a straightforward, easy-to-navigate
process.” “American taxpayers deserve to be able to file their taxes with ease and
simplicity,” said Senator Edward J. Markey. “The Tax Filing
Simplification Act will lower costs for taxpayers, reduce the time and effort
it takes to file taxes, and lessen the stress millions of Americans feel each
and every filing season.”“Taxpayers all over the country are spending too much time and money filing
their taxes every spring,” said Senator Jeff Merkley. “This
current system is needlessly complicated and costly for everyday Americans.
This bill will simplify the process of filing taxes, help keep sensitive
information out of the hands of third parties, and will also help save American
taxpayers their hard-earned money by providing free, comprehensive guides and
resources to help individuals, families, and businesses confidently file their taxes.
I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this bill passed.”“Our tax filing system is a mess. The only people who think it’s working are
the private software companies that make millions taking advantage of its
complexity,” said Senator Tina Smith. “This legislation will
make our system more simple, secure and affordable by directing the IRS to
develop a free, online filing service and making existing tax information more
readily available for taxpayers.”“Filing taxes can be stressful and time-consuming for everyone, and for
millions of families it stands between them and vital tax credits that can help
them pay the bills and save for the future. Simplifying tax filing is critical
to lift the burden off families, ensure everyone can access the refundable
credits they are owed, and realize the potential of these credits to promote
economic security and advance racial and economic equity,” said Megan
Martin, Executive Vice President at the Center for the Study of Social Policy.“The problems caused by an overly complicated tax filing system—the time,
expense, and worry that families are faced with each April—should not be a
given in this country,” said Susan Harley, Managing Director of Public
Citizen’s Congress Watch division. “By implementing reforms to
simplify the system such as return-free filing and a government run Free File
program, the Tax Filing Simplification Act would ensure the IRS takes swift
action to provide filers with a better experience while lessening the chances
they make the small, well-meaning mistakes that tie up the IRS’
resources.” The Tax Filing Simplification Act makes several commonsense changes
to simplify and decrease the costs of the tax filing process for millions of
American taxpayers by:  This bill is cosponsored by Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Richard
Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Tammy Duckworth

U.S. Senate Finance Committee
Tuesday, July 12, 2022Senator Elizabeth Warren: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
American families are getting hammered by soaring prices while giant
corporations are raking in huge profits.  And one big reason is that corporate lobbyists have rigged our tax code to
reward offshoring.  Now, offshoring means fewer good jobs for American
workers. It also means overseas supply chains that keep breaking on American
consumers.Professor Shambaugh, if confirmed, you would be Treasury’s top international
official leading work on investment issues. So today I wanted to talk with you
about how our tax code disincentivizes investments in U.S. manufacturing. And I’d like to talk about AbbVie, the company that the Chairman just
raised, a Big Pharma company known for jacking up drug prices and exploiting
tax breaks for offshoring. Now, AbbVie has manufacturing in Ireland, where it
pays just 12.5% of its profits in taxes.  Now the U.S. has international
minimum tax rules that are supposed to prevent the abuse of tax havens, topping
up AbbVie’s tax bill if it pays too little overseas. But giant loopholes in
this minimum tax means that AbbVie still gets a huge tax break for investing in
Ireland instead of the US.Professor Shambaugh, do you agree that our tax code should level the playing
field for U.S. manufacturing and incentivize investments in the U.S. rather
than in tax havens?Jay Shambaugh, nominee for Treasury Under Secretary for
International Affairs:  I would agree that we would want our tax
code to encourage investment in production in the United States.Senator Warren: Ok, so let’s dive into that a bit more. I
agree with you, but tax loopholes are rewarding AbbVie’s offshoring of drug
manufacturing to tax havens.  But here’s the part I want to focus on: it
gets worse by including tax incentives to offshore to high-tax countries, as
well.So, take Germany, where AbbVie also has a manufacturing facility and the
corporate tax rate is about 30%, much higher than the U.S. rate of 21%. You
would think that would mean investing in the U.S. is more attractive than
investing in Germany. But because our international minimum tax rules look at
all foreign taxes in totality, paid together, AbbVie can use high taxes in
Germany to shield its low tax Irish income. AbbVie would not get the same
benefit for paying U.S. taxes. So it’s actually incentivized to invest in
high-tax Germany, rather than investing here in the United States.So, Professor Shambaugh, when you think about our international investment
policy, does it make sense to invest in rewarding investing in Germany over
investing in the United States?Professor Shambaugh: I think we as a country do better when
companies are choosing their location based off the skills of the workers and
productivity of the economy and not gaming tax rates.Senator Warren: Alright. So, look, I agree with you on
this. Our international tax rules are broken, and incentivizing companies like
AbbVie to invest everywhere outside the United States – low tax, high tax –
makes no sense at all. So, would it surprise you, then, that AbbVie has used these broken rules to
slash its effective tax rate in half, and that it books 99% of its income
overseas?Professor Shambaugh: I guess in some sense it wouldn’t
surprise me based off some of the things I’ve heard the Chairman say so far
today, but it does not sound like the way we want our tax system to function.Senator Warren: So, would you like to see changes in this
system?Professor Shambaugh: I think having a global tax system
that would not encourage booking tax – profits in tax havens would definitely
be better for the country.Senator Warren: You know, I appreciate – I know you’ve done
work on this, and I appreciate the work you’ve done. I also want to say how
much I appreciate the work that Chairman Wyden has done on this, long and
consistently.We just have to recognize that corporate lobbyists have rigged our tax code
for Big Pharma, and that it is incentivizing offshoring when we need to be
investing in good jobs and secure supply chains here at home. This is why
Secretary Yellen has negotiated an historic minimum tax agreement, and why
Congressional Democrats are working to end Big Pharma’s overseas tax breaks –
and to lower prescription drug prices.I know that corporate lobbyists are kicking and screaming because they like
a situation where their companies don’t have to pay taxes, and they like to be
able to continue to raise their prices. But our job is to put American workers,
American small businesses, American consumers first. And we need to reward
investments here in America instead of everywhere else in the world.So, thank you very much both of you for your work.

of Letter (PDF)Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Representative Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) sent a letter
to Tom Sands, President of Beverly Hospital, urging him to delay the planned
closure of the North Shore Birth Center and to carefully consider alternative
options. The lawmakers have asked for a response by August 11, 2022.Since its opening in 1980, the North Shore Birth Center has provided women
in Eastern Massachusetts with a critical alternative to hospital-based labor
and delivery services. The midwives at the Center have helped deliver nearly
10,000 babies and continued to help deliver babies throughout the COVID-19
pandemic, despite the risks to their health as frontline workers. Advocates claim that Beverly Hospital has been starving the facility of
resources for years, which has contributed to a decline in staffing. The
Massachusetts Nurses Association (MNA), which represents nurses and midwives at
the Hospital and Birth Center, negotiated a new contract with the Hospital in
May of this year that included raises up to 27% for Birth Center midwives, with
the goal of recruiting and retaining staff. Beverly Hospital assured the MNA during negotiations that it would not close
the Birth Center; yet, eight days after the union approved the contract, the
Hospital announced it would close the Birth Center anyway, citing the staffing
shortages the new contract was supposed to address. “Beverly Hospital’s decision to close the Birth Center almost immediately
after reaching a contractual agreement to increase wages for the nurses and
midwives that work there casts doubt on whether leadership ever intended to
effectuate the negotiated wage increases,” wrote the lawmakers.The Birth Center is an essential resource for North Shore communities,
including women of color who face a disproportionate risk of maternal mortality
and morbidity. Black women in the United States are three times as likely and
Indigenous women are 2.3 times as likely as white women to die from pregnancy
and childbirth-related causes.“At its core, closing the North Shore Birth Center will deny women a choice
in birth options and reproductive care, pushing patients away from more
affordable, high-quality care into more expensive, hospital-based care,” concluded
the lawmakers.Senator Warren has long fought to lower maternal mortality rates and tackle
racial disparities in maternal health outcomes:

investments in rail electrification, “to improve service for commuters, 
reduce long-term maintenance costs, help meet climate goals, and solve issues
across housing, affordability, traffic, congestion, efficiency, and at the same

“assume an increased safety oversight role of the MBTA system” [close quote]
and conduct inspections and obtain data to provide the MBTA with a (quote) “roadmap
to building a robust safety culture.” I share the FTA’s concerns.After the FTA issued special safety directives, however, the MBTA reacted by
reducing service frequency on many lines. And these service cuts and long
delays have negatively impacted all riders, many of whom rely on public
transportation to try to get to work or school.So I have two intertwined questions. The first is, how did we get to a point
where people are literally dying on the T? And second, when will the FTA have a
detailed roadmap to get the T back on track? Nuria Fernandez, Administrator of the Federal Transit Administration:
Senator Warren, thank you so much for highlighting the importance of safety in
public transportation, in particular in the rail system. We, as you noted in
the letter that was issued by our Chief Safety Officer at the Federal Transit
Administration, was a result of a series of events that have occurred
subsequent to a study of 2019 that identified a series of issues that needed to
be addressed that the Transit Agency was in line to address. And when we
experienced ongoing safety incidents that could have been averted, that’s the
reason that we sent that letter. Senator Warren: And I’m glad you did, I’m sorry, let me
just, you talk about a series of issues, how is it, the question I have is, how
did we get to this place? Where people die on the T? What went wrong?Administrator Fernandez: That is the question. The
situation here is, safety is our number one priority and when we see that
safety, that the focus on safety, whether it’s culture, whether it’s decision
making, or lack thereof, contributes to incidents that result in death, that’s
when we raise the flag and we go beyond just raising the flag where we step in
and we immediately sent personnel so that we could conduct a safety management
inspection and it was through the inspection that we identified additional
issues and that’s the reason we issued a safety directive. Senator Warren:: When do you expect to have a report so we
can get the T back on track? Literally. Administrator Fernandez: Well, we are going to be issuing a
report in August-Senator Warren: -August.Administrator Fernandez: -to the Safety Management
Inspection Findings. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority needs to
continue, one with the training, they need to hire personnel and that’s one of
the reasons to your second question that has to do with the impact on
ridership, the impact on service. And that impact on service only occurs when
projects and maintenance have not been completed in a timely manner that now
need to be performed during service. Senator Warren: I appreciate that, I think what you’re
saying is the MBTA wasn’t paying enough attention to the maintenance and
inspections needed to keep the system safe. I look forward to the report in
August, I’m going to hold you to that.But, prioritizing safety and service be either-or. It should be both-and.I have one other thing I want to ask about, and that is investment in
electrification. I think it’s a big part of the answer when it comes to making
the MBTA both safer and more modern. Electrification would improve service,
would reduce long-term maintenance costs, would help us meet our climate goals,
and would solve issues across housing, affordability, traffic, congestion,
efficiency, and at the same time create new jobs and promote regional economic
prosperity and environmental justice. But under the Baker administration, the
MBTA is not prioritizing electrification.Administrator Fernandez, while electrification would cost more in up-front
capital costs, would this be a way to make the T safer, more reliable, greener,
create jobs, and reduce costs in the long term?Administrator Fernandez: Senator Warren, it would achieve
all of the above. And as a matter of fact we did issue a grant to MBTA for the
replacement of a bus facility. It’s going to be a combination of, I believe
there’s a [INAUDIBLE 5:30] involved to be sure that they have an adequate
facility so that they can start to accommodate electric vehicles. Senator Warren:  You know, electrifying the commuter
rail would mean a faster, more reliable ride and a cleaner environment. And it
is mystifying that the T has no tangible plans to get us there.Transitioning to an electric system would be costly, but right now, the
Commonwealth has a large budget surplus and is set to receive record amounts of
federal funding from the infrastructure bill. Rather than continuing to pour
money into dirty, unreliable technologies from the last century, we can replace
broken down trains with electric ones and invest more in electric
buses.  I know that this is not going to be easy, but we have to use every tool in
the toolbox to avert these disasters and give Massachusetts residents the first
class infrastructure they deserve.Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

of Bill (PDF) | One
Pager (PDF)Washington, D.C. – Today, United States Senator Elizabeth
Warren (D-Mass.) and Representative Nikema Williams (D-Ga.) will introduce the Youth
Voting Rights Act, comprehensive legislation to enforce the Twenty-Sixth
Amendment and expand youth access to voting. This legislation is co-sponsored
in the Senate by Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Ron
Wyden (D-Ore.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and
Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii.). In the House of Representatives, this legislation is
cosponsored by Representatives Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), Earl Blumenauer
(D-Ore.), Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), Chuy Garcia (D-Ill.), Ted Lieu (D-Calif.),
Dwight Evans (D-Pa.), Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.), Mary Gay Scanlon (D-Pa.), Juan
Vargas (D-Calif.), Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.), Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.), Carolyn
Maloney (D-N.Y.), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), John Sarbanes (D-Md.), and
Deborah Ross (D-N.C.).The Twenty-Sixth Amendment, formally ratified on July 1, 1971, prohibits the
denial of the right to vote on account of age for all citizens aged 18 or
older. But over fifty years after its ratification, the Twenty-Sixth
Amendment’s promise remains unfulfilled. Young voters participate in elections
at lower rates than voters in older age cohorts. Their provisional ballots and
mail-in ballots are rejected at disproportionate rates. And they routinely face
serious obstacles to voter registration and in-person voting.“Voting is the beating heart of our democracy. Young people are the future
of America, and with voting rights under attack across the country, we must do
everything we can to ensure they can exercise their right to vote. My new
bicameral bill with Congresswoman Williams will ensure young people aren’t left
out of the voting process, and I’m thrilled to partner with her and my
colleagues on this effort,” said Senator Warren.“Our democracy is stronger when our youth are heard at the ballot box.
Unfortunately, young citizens still face disproportionate barriers to voting.
We must do more to strengthen democratic access across generations. I am proud
to join with Senator Elizabeth Warren to introduce the Youth Voting Rights Act
so we can end age-based barriers to voting. Everyone deserves free and fair
access to the ballot box–no matter your age, no matter your ZIP Code,” said
Representative Nikema Williams.“More than 50 years since the ratification of the 26th Amendment, young
people participate in elections at significantly lower rates than the rest of
the population because of barriers to voting,” said Sen. Booker. “This
comprehensive legislation will bolster youth voter participation by expanding
voter registration services and requiring polling places in institutions of
higher education while also guaranteeing that states accept broader forms of ID
that meet voter-identification requirements. At a time when voting rights are
under attack across the nation, we need to encourage young Americans to
participate in our democratic process and this bill ensures they have the
access to the ballot box to do just that.” “Every eligible American, including youth voters who turn 18, should be able
to exercise their constitutional right to vote,” said Senator Hirono.
“Public officials around the country are making decisions that will affect
young people for generations to come, and they deserve to have a say in how these
decisions are made. As we continue fighting to protect voting rights, the Youth
Voting Rights Act will make it easier for young people to vote in elections and
expand youth participation in our democracy, especially for historically
disenfranchised groups like young people of color and young people with
disabilities. I’ll continue working to protect and expand voting rights for
young people and all Americans.”“It has never been more important to protect the health of our democracy and
defend the most fundamental right of every American – the right to vote,”
said Senator Markey. “The Youth Voting Rights Act will ensure young
Americans, who represent the future of our democracy, are equal parts eager and
empowered to participate in their first election by the time they turn
eighteen.”“Across the country, the right to vote is under coordinated attack by
special interests, and young people are among the prime targets,” said
Senator Whitehouse.  “That’s a big problem, because young voters
stand to lose the most from being denied a voice in our democracy.  It’s
our younger generation that will face the long-term consequences of our
political challenges – like stymied action on climate change, gun violence, and
reproductive rights.  We need to defend their right to vote.”“For our democracy to thrive, young voters need to be full participants in
elections and have the ability to exercise their Constitutional right to vote.
And yet, young voters, particularly youth of color, face unique and growing
obstacles to voting,” Senator Wyden said. “I’m proud to
cosponsor the Youth Voting Rights Act, which contains crucial
provisions that will close the gap in voting rates between younger and older
Americans, and ensure the promises of our Constitution are universally fulfilled.”Voting is a fundamental right in any democracy, as bipartisan
supermajorities in Congress and the states nearly unanimously recognized when
the United States adopted the Twenty-Sixth Amendment in the fastest
ratification process in American history. Specifically, the bill would:The bill is endorsed by a wide range of democracy and youth organizations
including: American Civil Liberties Union, Common Cause, NAACP Legal Defense
and Educational Fund, Campaign Legal Center, Demos, League of Women Voters of
the United States, End Citizens United / Let America Vote Action Fund, MoveOn,
NextGen America, The Andrew Goodman Foundation, ALL IN Campus Democracy
Challenge, When We All Vote, the Fair Elections Center’s Campus Vote Project,
Students Learn Students Vote, The Civics Center, and Tufts University’s
Institute for Democracy in Higher Education. “The ACLU is proud to support the Youth Voting Rights Act. Voting
is a fundamental right in our democracy and it must never be infringed. Young
people face serious obstacles when registering to vote and casting a ballot. We
must do all we can to ensure young people have unrestricted access to the
ballot box, especially given the upcoming federal elections.” - Bobby
Hoffman, Deputy Director of the ACLU Democracy Division“Democracy is how we work together to solve the pressing issues of our
times. When democracy works best, it also secures the future, and the future
belongs to young people. Common Cause and our more than 1.5 million supporters
and members commend Senator Warren and Representative Williams for introducing
the Youth Voting Rights Act, important legislation that enhances
opportunity and participation for young people. Common Cause is proud of our
history helping to advance the 26th Amendment that lowered the voting age to
18. There is more work to do so that it lives up to its promise of a more empowered,
reflective, and representative democracy. The Youth Voting Rights Act
is another important step forward in the march toward inclusivity.” - Karen
Hobert Flynn, President, Common Cause “Our democracy is strongest when every voice is heard, including those of
our young voters. The League of Women Voters of the United States strongly
supports this legislation to make voting more accessible for young voters by
breaking down obstacles they continue to face when registering to vote or
casting a ballot. We must equip young voters with the necessary resources to
fully participate in the democratic process if we want to create strong and
engaged citizens.” - Jessica Jones Capparell, Director of Government
Affairs, League of Women Voters of the United States“The Youth Voting Rights Act is the most comprehensive measure
introduced by Congress to uphold the promise of the Twenty-Sixth Amendment,
which lowered the voting age to 18 and outlaws age discrimination in access to
the ballot. Fifty years ago, the nation came together, nearly unanimously, and
across partisan lines to ratify the Amendment in record time. Yet, young people
continue to face special burdens to vote due to inaccessible polling locations
and voter registration and identification requirements that are out of reach to
this protected class. The Act will do what the Twenty-Sixth Amendment intended:
encourage youth political participation based on a cross-partisan recognition
that young people serve an invaluable role in upholding our democracy.” - Yael
Bromberg, Esq., constitutional rights attorney and Twenty-Sixth Amendment legal
scholar.“At The Andrew Goodman Foundation, we empower college student organizers
across the country to mobilize their peers to the ballot box. We do this not
only because we are carrying forward the principled spirits of Andrew Goodman,
James Earl Chaney, and Michael Schwerner — young voting rights workers who were
murdered by the KKK in Mississippi on June 21, 1964 for registering Black
Americans to vote — but also because we fervently believe in the proven power
of young people to build an inclusive democracy. That is why we applaud Senator
Warren and Representative Williams’s introduction of the Youth Voting
Rights Act in support of the ongoing struggle to ensure that the purpose
of the 26th Amendment is fulfilled,” says Charles Imohiosen, Esq.,
President and CEO of The Andrew Goodman Foundation.“Even though the 26th Amendment was ratified over a half century ago, young
people continue to have one of the lowest voter turnouts of any age group. We
have to change that. We applaud Sen. Warren and Rep. Williams for leading the
charge on this important bill to enforce the 26th Amendment and expand access
for youth voters to participate in our democracy.” - Tiffany Muller,
President, End Citizens United / Let America Vote Action Fund.“NextGen America is excited to endorse the Youth Voting Rights Act, a bill
that represents comprehensive legislation to enforce the 26th Amendment and
expand youth access to voting. The largest, most diverse generation in American
history needs to have their voices heard. We have seen time and time again that
state legislatures will do anything to undermine young people’s right to vote,
and that’s why this bill is so critical. In order to foster our democracy and
create a future that truly represents the will of the people, it is essential
that we fight back and create pathways for young people to join our political
process and exercise their basic civil power to vote.” - Cristina
Tzintzún Ramirez, President, NextGen America.Senator Warren is a national leader on efforts to defend our democracy and
the sacred right to vote:

investigation reveals need for new, strong  regulations to protect retail
investors from SPAC industry ripoffsText of Letter (PDF) | Responses
from SPACs (PDF)Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
sent a letter to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary
Gensler, supporting the agency’s proposed rules for special purpose acquisition
companies (SPACs). The rules would enhance disclosures and investor protections
in SPAC initial public offerings and de-SPAC transactions.SPACs are publicly traded shell companies that raise money for the sole
purpose of buying a private company to take it public. These shell companies
are structured to benefit institutional investors – such as hedge funds,
venture capitalists, and investment banks – at the expense of retail investors.In 2021, Senator Warren launched an investigation into SPACs, writing
to six high-profile SPAC creators, and asking
the SEC to investigate Digital World Acquisition Corp., the SPAC that proposed
merging with former President Trump’s Truth Social. Senator Warren released
a report in June highlighting the findings of her investigation, which revealed
misaligned incentives, self-dealing, and fraud that plague the industry.“Our investigation found rampant fraud and self-dealing in the SPAC sector,
and requiring additional disclosures on SPAC sponsors, boards of directors, and
financial institution’s potential conflicts of interest could give retail
investors more transparency into the decision-making process,” said the
letter.Sen. Warren’s investigation, which she highlighted in her letter, also
revealed several major findings on SPACs’ structural and regulatory
weaknesses: Senator Warren has been a leader in calling for additional regulation of
SPACs. She is planning to introduce the SPAC Accountability Act of 2022
which would codify and expand upon the SEC’s proposed rules. This legislation
would expand the transparency and disclosure requirements to further protect
retail investors and prevent Wall Street insiders from prematurely cashing out
on SPAC deals.

from Placer.ai (PDF)Washington, D.C. – United States Senator Elizabeth
Warren (D-Mass.) announced that SafeGraph and Placer.ai, two data brokers, have
committed, in response to her request, to permanently stop selling the location
data of people who visit abortion clinics. The data brokers’ commitment follows
a May 2022 letter
that Senator Warren led with thirteen of her Senate colleagues, blasting the
companies for collecting and selling the cellphone-based location data of
people who visit abortion clinics and risking the safety of anyone seeking
access to abortion services.“Two large data brokers have committed to stop selling the location data of
people who visit abortion clinics. This is a good start,” said Senator
Warren. “But with Roe v. Wade dead and states across the
country seeking to criminalize essential health care, we can’t rely on the
goodwill of Big Tech to protect Americans’ data and safety. That’s why I’m
calling on the United States Congress to pass my Health and Location Data
Protection Act to ban brokers from selling location and health data and
establish serious privacy protections for consumers.” In their responses to Senator Warren’s letter, the two companies provided
detailed answers about their data collection practices and answered Senator
Warren’s call to permanently stop selling the location data of people who visit
abortion clinics. SafeGraph said, “SafeGraph has removed all of the visit-related Patterns
statistics aggregated to businesses categorized by the NAICS Code for family
planning centers, 621410. In other words, it is now impossible to access any
information about visits to family planning centers from our platform.”Placer.ai said, “the Company commits, on a permanent basis, to disabling
user access to data about any additional sensitive locations that raise similar
concerns—including other reproductive health providers that may not have been
identified in the Company’s prior reviews.”In June 2022, Senator Warren introduced
the Health and Location Data Protection Act, which would reform the
$200 billion-a-year data broker market by banning data brokers from selling
Americans’ location and health data.

Infrastructure Bill will support various airport improvement projects and
produce over 1,000 jobs for MassachusettsWashington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA.)
and Edward J. Markey (D-MA) and Representatives Richard E. Neal (D-MA-01),
James P. McGovern (D-MA-02), Stephen F. Lynch (D-MA-08), Bill Keating
(D-MA-09), Assistant Speaker Katherine Clark (D-MA-05), Seth Moulton (D-MA-06),
Ayanna Pressley (D-MA-07), Lori Trahan (D-MA-03), and Jake Auchincloss
(D-MA-04) today announced that General Edward Lawrence Logan International
Airport in Boston will receive $62 million in FY2022 funding from the FAA as a
part of the Airport Terminals Program. This grant is funded by the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law passed in November of 2021.The funding will support the replacement and rehabilitation of the arrival
roadways for Terminals A and E and the roadway between Terminals C and E in
addition to providing 154 full time jobs during construction.The grant also provides funding for the rehabilitation and renovation of the
existing 1974 Terminal E facilities. It will replace the HVAC system, expand
the baggage claim area to accommodate the on-going gate expansions, improve and
expand the curbside area, and rehabilitate the existing ticket counter area,
gates and jet bridges. Improvements to the curbside area and to circulation in the Terminal E
ticket counter areas will produce over 900 jobs and help provide better
accommodations to address ADA requirements. Funding from this grant will also
increase energy efficiency in Terminal E, and assist Massport in meeting its
Gold LEED certification goal. “Boston Logan is a vital hub for travelers in Massachusetts and beyond, and
this federal funding from the Infrastructure Bill will help make much-needed
improvements to our airport roadways and terminals,” said Senator
Warren. “This federal investment will create over 1,000 new
construction jobs, fund terminal renovations and expansions, and continue to
grow our local economy.” “This investment in Boston Logan represents a strong commitment to improving
service and operations at one of our nation’s finest airports, and comes at a
crucial time for travelers who are experiencing record delays and
cancellations,” said Senator Markey. “This funding from the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will create hundreds of good jobs here in our
Commonwealth and ensure that travelers from the Bay State and across the world
are able to travel more safely and swiftly, with fewer delays and shorter
waiting lines.”“The federal investments announced today will go a long way towards ensuring
Logan Airport best serves the people of the Commonwealth and all of New
England,” said Chairman Jim McGovern. “A critical part of
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s mission includes uplifting communities and
workers across the country, and these grants will help fast-track the region’s
economic recovery, bring our airport infrastructure up to speed, and create
over 1,000 new jobs. I look forward to continuing to work with Massport, local
officials, and my federal colleagues to ensure the success of these projects.”“As a member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I
am proud to announce that Logan Airport will be awarded two grants totaling $62
million dollars from the Department of Transportation’s Airport Terminal
Program,” said U.S. Rep. Stephen F. Lynch.  “This
funding, which was provided for by the House-passed Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, will be used to carry out critical renovation projects at Terminals A, C,
and E—including roadway improvements, baggage claim expansions, and HVAC system
replacements—and, in so doing, it is expected to create more than 1,000
well-paying jobs.”“The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is delivering concrete results for the
people of New England,” said Congressman Bill Keating. “The
$62 million awarded to Logan Airport does not just mean improvements to one of
the country’s busiest airports or greater transportation options for travelers.
It also means well-paying jobs. And for each of those new jobs created we will
see money being put back into the Commonwealth’s economy, strengthening it. I
look forward to the success of this project as well as the others that come
from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.”“I am thrilled to see this major funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law coming to Logan,” said Assistant Speaker Katherine Clark.
“As travelers continue to experience delays and small businesses face ongoing
supply chain disruptions, this investment in our airport infrastructure will
both benefit the economy of Greater Boston and improve the lives of
Massachusetts families.”“Massachusetts is a world-class destination for millions of tourists,
students, and business travelers every year. Our largest airport needs to
reflect that,” said Congressman Seth Moulton. “This new
federal investment in Logan is a positive step toward repairing an important
aspect of our state’s neglected infrastructure—and it will create many new jobs
along the way. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law affords us a once-in a
lifetime opportunity to bring all Massachusetts infrastructure into the 21st
century. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that happens.”“Improving service and operations at Logan will help boost our economic
recovery, create good-paying jobs, and make air travel for Massachusetts
families safer and more efficient,” said Rep. Pressley. “This
new funding will help us do just that and I won’t stop fighting to bring
critical federal investments like these to my district and our Commonwealth.”“When we passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we did so knowing it
would improve the lives of every person across the Commonwealth,” said
Congresswoman Lori Trahan. “Of course, that means better roads, safer
bridges, and cleaner drinking water, but it also means creating more jobs and
improved travel through Massachusetts’ largest airport. I’m proud to announce
this new round of investments in Logan and look forward to seeing the
good-paying jobs it helps create.”“A better Logan is a big win for Massachusetts, and another testament to the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law we passed last year,” said Congressman
Auchincloss.“We are grateful to our Federal Delegation for their strong support and
advocacy,” said Massport CEO Lisa Wieland.  “This funding
will help improve the customer experience, support our role as an economic
engine for the Commonwealth, and boost our Net Zero efforts.”

of Letter (PDF)Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) led Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Ed Markey
(D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) to send a letter to
President Biden, Attorney General Merrick Garland, and Health and Human
Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra, following up on previous requests that
the administration use its authority to deschedule cannabis and pardon
non-violent cannabis-related offenders. “We commend the administration’s recent pardons and commutations of 78
people, including nine with non-violent cannabis related offenses,” said
the lawmakers.  “However, much more has to be done to address the
racist and harmful legacy of cannabis policies on Black and Brown communities.”In November 2021, Senators Warren and Markey sent a letter to the President
asking him to use constitutional authority to pardon all individuals convicted
of non-violent cannabis-related offenses, whether formerly or currently
incarcerated. To date, the administration has not responded to this letter, and
it is estimated
that over 40,000 individuals are still incarcerated for cannabis-related
offenses. A month earlier, Senators Warren and Booker wrote
to Attorney General Garland urging him to begin the process of declassifying
cannabis as a Schedule I drug. In April 2022, six months after the first
letter, the Department of Justice (DOJ) answered
with an inadequate half-page response, noting the Department of Health and
Human Services’ (HHS) determination that “cannabis has not been proven in
scientific studies to be a safe and effective treatment for any disease or
condition”' and disregarding the DOJ’s clear authority under the Controlled
Substances Act (CSA) to begin the descsheduling process and act independently
of HHS’s outdated and flawed determination conducted under a previous
administration.In the letter, the Senators point out that there is widespread public
support for cannabis legalization, and the American Nurses Association,
American Public Health Association, American Academy of Family Physicians, and
New England Journal of Medicine have all endorsed the legalization of cannabis
for medicinal use. The Senators argued for more to be done to address the racist and harmful
legacy of cannabis policies on Black and Brown communities. Black individuals
are nearly four times as likely to be arrested
for possession of cannabis, and in some states, this statistic jumps to almost
10 times more likely. “The administration’s failure to coordinate a timely review of its cannabis
policy is harming thousands of Americans, slowing research, and depriving
Americans of their ability to use marijuana for medical or other purposes,”
concluded the lawmakers. “We ask that the administration act quickly
to rectify this decade long injustice harming individuals, especially Black and
Brown communities.”Senator Warren has long fought to reform cannabis policy and seek justice
for individuals currently and formerly incarcerated for cannabis-related
offenses:

with the intent of our Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act,” said
the senators. In 2017, the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act, introduced by
Senators Warren and Grassley, was signed
into law. The legislation removed outdated regulations that block consumer
access to hearing aids and allows certain types of hearing aids to be made
available over-the-counter. The FDA was responsible for implementing this law,
and in October 2021, it issued a proposed rule for “Establishing
Over-the-Counter Hearing Aids.” Over the course of a 90-day public comment
period. FDA received approximately 1,100 comments on the proposed rule. To
understand the public’s response, the senators conducted a comprehensive review
of these comments. The report finds:The senators are calling on the FDA to review the findings of their report
when analyzing the public comments and to finalize a rule that ensures safe,
effective, accessible, and affordable OTC hearing aids. Since the senators’ legislation was signed into law, they have been leading
the effort to implement the legislation and create an affordable and effective
OTC hearing aid market. In April 2022, Senators Warren and Grassley introduced
new legislation that would require the FDA to issue a final rule regarding
OTC hearing aids within 30 days of the enactment of the bill.

(D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Richard
Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawai’i), and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) sent
a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra,
requesting an update on the commitments the Department made in response to
President Biden’s March 2021 executive order on expanding and promoting access
to voting, including the Department’s commitment to expand voting access
through HealthCare.gov. “The Biden Administration’s most recent update on the implementation of the
Voting EO indicates that all agencies, including HHS, have made important
progress in enhancing Americans’ access to information on elections and voter
registration. But HHS can do more to fulfill its commitments under the
President’s Voting EO. In particular, it should expeditiously implement changes
to HealthCare.gov to facilitate access to voter registration services for
millions of Americans,” said the lawmakers. In March 2021, President Biden issued
an Executive Order entitled “Promoting Access to Voting,” which
required the various federal agencies to examine the ways they could expand
access to voter registration and election information and present their
strategic plans within 200 days of the order’s issuance. In late 2021, HHS
pledged to launch a new voting access hub and make it easier for consumers
using HealthCare.gov to connect to voter registration services and also made a
commitment to work with states to improve voter registration
accessibility. Despite record voter turnout during the 2020 election, low-income voters
still voted at lower rates than higher earners, and difficulty with voter
registration is the most significant barrier to voting for low-income Americans
and communities of color. HHS can and should provide the millions of low-income
users of HealthCare.gov the opportunity to register to vote.In the letter, the Senators are calling on Secretary Becerra and HHS to
provide an update on their efforts to comply with President Biden’s executive
order and its progress regarding the implementation of voter registration
access through HealthCare.gov by July 13, 2022.Senator Warren has aggressively fought for the expansion and protection of
voting rights:

Ways and Means Health Subcommittee, along with Senator Angus King (I-Maine),
Representatives Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.), and Katie
Porter (D-Calif.), led a group of 100 members from across the ideological
spectrum to urge Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra to swiftly
act and use his existing authorities to lower prices on critical prescription
drugs.“High U.S. medicine prices are the result of prescription drug corporations
using their monopoly power to hike prices and pad their bottom lines,” wrote
the lawmakers. “Meanwhile, U.S. law forbids direct government
negotiations and other restrictions on pharmaceutical pricing. This uniquely
American combination of rules has led to pharmaceutical companies making more
money in the U.S. than the rest of the world combined for the 20 top-selling
drugs.”“We thank you and President Biden for your leadership in seeking relief for
many of these patients by calling for Congress to finally allow Medicare to
negotiate drug prices for a selection of high-priced, brand-name drugs and to
prevent prices for all drugs from rising faster than the rate of inflation. We
stand committed to delivering on these vital legislative priorities,” the
lawmakers continued. “But to provide the urgent relief that Americans
demand, including patients who would not initially benefit from Medicare drug
price negotiations, you must simultaneously use the executive tools readily at
your disposal.” The administration has two long standing statutory authorities to waive
patent monopolies and assure reasonable drug prices, including taxpayer
protection authority under the Bayh-Dole Act and broad competitive
licensing authority under Section 1498. Requesting that the Secretary take
action as soon as possible, the lawmakers wrote, “You can
provide immediate relief for millions of patients from Big Pharma’s price
gouging and show millions more Americans that you, President Biden, and his
administration are on their side.”This letter is supported by Public Citizen, T1 International, Indivisible,
Social Security Works, People’s Action, Center for Popular Democracy, PrEP4All,
and the Action Center on Race and the Economy.Senator Warren has called on the government to use every tool to lower drug
prices and crack down on corporate profiteering to bring down consumer costs:

and below:New York Times – Elizabeth Warren and Tina Smith: We’ve Seen What
Will Happen Next to America’s Women
June 25, 2022
By Elizabeth Warren and Tina SmithThe Supreme Court has spoken: Roe is gone. But the Supreme Court doesn’t get
the final say on abortion. The American people will have the last word through
their representatives in Congress and the White House.With its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, an
extremist Supreme Court has overturned nearly 50 years of precedent, stripping
away the constitutional right to an abortion and ruling that the government —
not the person who is pregnant — will make the critical decision about whether
to continue a pregnancy. At least nine states have already banned abortion;
over a dozen more could soon follow suit by severely restricting or outright
outlawing abortion, putting the lives, health and futures of girls and women at
risk.If we sound angry and alarmed, that’s because we are. This decision is
devastating — and we have seen what happens next. We both lived in an America
where abortion was illegal. A nation in which infections and other
complications destroyed lives. A nation in which unplanned pregnancies derailed
careers and livelihoods. A nation in which some women took their own lives
rather than continue pregnancies they could not bear.But we must hold on to hope. Each of us can and should act — both elected
officials and everyday Americans. We can start by helping those who need access
to an abortion. Support Planned Parenthood and other organizations that are
expanding their services in states where abortion is available. Contribute to
abortion funds. Encourage state legislators to protect reproductive rights in
states like New Mexico and Minnesota that border places where abortion services
will most likely be severely restricted and even criminalized. Encourage
employers in states with abortion bans to give their employees adequate time
off and money for travel to find the abortion care they need. Do all you can —
and demand the same all-you-can approach from all of our elected leaders.Earlier this month, along with Senator Patty Murray and half the Senate
Democratic Caucus, we sent a letter to President Biden outlining executive
actions he could take to defend reproductive freedom. These actions include
increasing access to abortion medication, providing federal resources for
individuals seeking abortion care in other states and using federal property
and resources to protect people seeking abortion services locally. We need
action, and we need it now.On Friday, with the release of the Dobbs decision, we entered a perilous
time that threatens millions of women across this nation. We urge the president
to declare a public health emergency to protect abortion access for all
Americans, unlocking critical resources and authority that states and the
federal government can use to meet the surge in demand for reproductive health
services. The danger is real, and Democrats must meet it with the urgency it
deserves.We’re in this dark moment because right-wing politicians and their allies
have spent decades scheming to overrule a right many Americans considered
sacrosanct. Passing state laws to restrict access to abortion care. Giving
personhood rights to fertilized eggs. Threatening to criminalize in vitro
fertilization. Offering bounties for reporting doctors who provide abortion
services. Abusing the filibuster and turning Congress into a broken
institution. Advancing judicial nominees who claimed to be committed to
protecting “settled law” while they winked at their Republican sponsors in the
Senate. Stealing two seats on the Supreme Court.For nearly 50 years, right-wing extremists rejected the beliefs held by an
overwhelming majority of Americans. They doubled and redoubled their efforts to
create a future in which women and their doctors could face a prison sentence
for seeking or providing basic health care. When these extremists couldn’t
impose their radical views through the legislative process, they stacked the
courts. And now that the Supreme Court has opened the door by overturning Roe,
Republicans will continue their assault on our civil rights and liberties.Former Vice President Mike Pence called for a national ban on abortion in
all 50 states; Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, flat out stated
that it’s a possibility. And the logic laid out by the majority in Dobbs seems
to undercut other precedents, raising the alarming possibility that we could
soon see an assault on privacy and marriage equality.In order to fix the damage Republicans have done to our system in their
efforts to control women’s lives, we need broad democracy reform: changing the
composition of the courts, reforming Senate rules like the filibuster, and even
fixing the outdated Electoral College that allowed presidential candidates who
lost the popular vote to take office and nominate five of the justices who
agreed to end the right to an abortion.We can’t undo in five months the damage it took Republicans five decades to
accomplish, but we can immediately start repairing our democracy. The public is
overwhelmingly on our side. A vast majority of Americans oppose the decision
the Supreme Court just made. Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe that
abortion should be legal in all or most cases. And more Americans describe
themselves as pro-choice today than at any other point in the last 25 yearsLet’s be clear: Roe may be gone, but the protections it once guaranteed are
on the ballot. States like Kansas and Kentucky have initiatives to strip away
state constitutional protections for abortion, while Michigan and Vermont are
working toward statewide votes to create constitutional protections for
reproductive freedom. But make no mistake, this radical decision affects all
Americans, not just those in states where the right to a safe, legal abortion
will soon fall.Now is the time to demand that every single candidate for every single
office voice a firm position on reproductive rights. Ask every Senate candidate
to commit to reforming the filibuster rules, so that the chamber can pass
federal legislation protecting the right to reproductive freedom. If voters
help us maintain our control of the House and expand our majority in the Senate
by at least two votes this November, we can make Roe the law all across the
country as soon as January.Simply put: We must restore our democracy so that a radical minority can no
longer drown out the will of the people. This will be a long, hard fight, and
the path to victory is not yet certain. But it’s a righteous fight that we must
win — no matter how long it takes. The two of us lived in an America without
Roe, and we are not going back. Not now. Not ever. ###

http://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-maloney-bonamici-menendez-introduce-legislation-to-stop-anti-abortion-disinformation-by-crisis-pregnancy-centers,"Text of Bill (pdf)Washington, D.C.  – United States Senator Elizabeth
Warren (D-Mass.), Congresswomen Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Suzanne
Bonamici (D-Ore.), and Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) today introduced the Stop
Anti-Abortion Disinformation Act to crack down on false advertising that
crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) employ to dissuade patients from getting the
reproductive care they need, including abortion care. This bill directs the
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue rules to prohibit deceptive or
misleading advertising related to the provision of abortion services. The bill
also authorizes the FTC to enforce these rules and collect penalties from
organizations in violation.“With a far-right Supreme Court poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, it’s
more important than ever to crack down on so-called ‘crisis pregnancy centers’
that mislead women about reproductive health care. I’m working in the Senate to
stop these deceptive practices and ensure every American can access the
abortion care they need,” said Senator Warren.“No one should have to question that the person they are seeking medical
advice from is actually a doctor or that information is accurate, objective,
and complete,” said Congresswoman Maloney. “It is truly
disgusting that reproductive rights are being threatened and attacked by crisis
pregnancy centers whose guiding principle is to mislead, misinform, and
outright lie to pregnant people in order to dissuade them from having an
abortion. It is long past time that we prohibit these predatory tactics to
undermine reproductive rights. This legislation cracks down on disinformation
by simply requiring the FTC to ensure honesty for those that advertise
reproductive healthcare.""“At a time when reproductive rights are under attack, it is especially
important for anyone seeking abortion care to be able to find a provider they
can trust,” said Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici. “Crisis
pregnancy centers often engage in deceptive advertising to get people in, then
mislead them about the services they provide. The Stop Anti-Abortion
Disinformation Act would prohibit this egregious behavior so people looking for
care get accurate information.”“With women’s reproductive rights under a coordinated attack by Republicans
across the country, it is more important than ever that women continue to have
access to trusted information and comprehensive reproductive health care
services,” said Senator Menendez. “By promoting deceptive or
misleading advertisements about abortion services, crisis pregnancy centers jeopardize
women’s health and well-being, all while elevating unproven theories about
birth control and contraceptive care. Our bicameral legislation would help
address this problem by allowing the Federal Trade Commission to crack down on
these centers for their misleading tactics and hold them accountable for their
actions.Every year, thousands of pregnant people seeking objective and medically
sound reproductive health care end up walking into CPCs. These clinics falsely
and deliberately advertise themselves to potential clients as comprehensive
reproductive health care providers; however, their intent is to discourage
pregnant people from having abortions.CPCs routinely use a variety of deceptive tactics, including making false
claims about reproductive health care and disseminating inaccurate, misleading,
and stigmatizing information about abortion and contraception. Additionally,
most CPCs in the United States do not employ licensed medical personnel or
provide referrals for birth control or abortion care.According to the Journal of Medical Internet Research Public Health and
Surveillance, there are more than 2,500 CPCs in the United States, though some
anti-abortion groups claim that the number is closer to 4,000. One study found
that, on average, CPCs outnumber abortion clinics nationwide by an average of 3
to 1, but in some states, the ratio is as high as 11 to 1.The  Stop Anti-Abortion Disinformation Act does the
following: “The fake clinics known as CPCs have a long history of suggesting – or
outright claiming – that they offer comprehensive reproductive health care
services,” said Power to Decide CEO Raegan McDonald-Mosley, MD, MPH.
“In fact, they are typically run by anti-abortion organizations, often with no
certified medical staff, and no intention of providing either abortion care or
birth control. Instead, they push inaccurate, incomplete and stigmatizing
information, and few if any clinical services. Even more troubling, the
majority of CPCs are located in communities where it is already difficult to
access abortion or other essential health care. People in these communities
face additional barriers to care when they find themselves in a fake clinic
that fails to provide them with medically accurate and complete information
about their own pregnancies and health care options. At a time when so many
stand to lose access to abortion care, we must put a stop to the fraudulent
practices of CPCs that deceive and delay time-sensitive, essential care.”She continued, “We at Power to Decide thank Representatives
Maloney and Bonamici, and Senators Warren and Menendez for introducing this
critically important bill, and all of the legislative champions working to
ensure that everyone has equitable access to the information they need to
protect their reproductive autonomy, health and well-being.”“Access to comprehensive medical care, including abortion, is essential for
people’s health, safety, and wellbeing.  People must be able to receive
the full spectrum of medical care without the fear of being manipulated by
misleading, inaccurate, or biased information,” said Iffath Abbasi
Hoskins, MD, FACOG, President of the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists. “As states move to ban and criminalize abortion care,
it is critical that people who need abortions are able to access
evidence-based, non-judgmental health information from qualified professionals,
not crisis pregnancy centers that use deceptive advertising and misinformation
to spread their ideology. We are grateful to Representative Carolyn Maloney for
her leadership in counteracting misinformation surrounding abortion
care.”   ""So-called ‘crisis pregnancy centers’ masquerade as abortion providers
but deliberately deceive pregnant people through lies, disinformation, and
anti-abortion propaganda,” said Jamie L. Manson, President of Catholics
for Choice. “These fraudulent clinics, nearly all of which are
religiously affiliated and many of which are Catholic, exist to coerce people –
but coercion is not healthcare.”She continued, “To make matters even worse, CPCs actively
target marginalized people who already face the highest barriers to accessing
abortion care – particularly the Black, Latina, Indigenous, Asian American,
Pacific Islander, and immigrant communities. They trick folks into believing
they are receiving legitimate healthcare, but in fact have no medical
professionals on staff. Too often, they provide no prenatal testing, putting
both the pregnant person and the pregnancy at great risk. Catholics for Choice
thanks Congresswoman Maloney for introducing the Stop Anti-Abortion
Disinformation (SAD) Act to address these dangerous fake clinics and looks
forward to working with her to advance this critical legislation.""“Every day, pregnant people seeking information are harmed by the dangerous
and deceptive tactics of fake reproductive health clinics,” said Sheila
Katz, CEO of the National Council of Jewish Women. “National Council
of Jewish Women New York Section has long been at the forefront of this issue
through their work on ‘Pro Truth,’ a coalition of reproductive rights
advocates, policy makers, and service providers, united to fight fake abortion
clinics that has also expanded to Florida. Everyone deserves to seek and
receive accurate information about all their options if they are pregnant. We
thank Representative Maloney and Representative Bonamici for introducing the
Stop Anti-Abortion Disinformation Act to help pregnant people get the
information and care they need.”“Communities of color, including the Asian American and Pacific Islander
community, have long been targeted by misinformation from crisis pregnancy
centers advertising in their native language,” said Yvonne Hsu, Chief
Policy and Government Affairs Officer at the National Asian Pacific American
Women' Forum (NAPAWF). “They take advantage of the intrinsic trust
that comes from speakers of the same language to mislead and prevent people
from getting the care that they need. Despite an arduous path to abortion care
for the AAPI community — filled with language barriers, cultural stigmas, and
low rates of insurance coverage for our most vulnerable members - a third of
AAPI pregnancies end in abortion. We are so grateful for Rep. Maloney's
leadership to put an end to these deceptive practices.”“When someone is denied the sacred right to make decisions about their own
body and reproduction, their reproductive dignity and religious freedom are
violated. The use of deceptive advertising by crisis pregnancy centers to
suggest they perform abortions—which they don’t—is meant to trick, confuse, and
manipulate those seeking abortion care and further rob them of their full
decision-making power. This is a travesty, and the Religious Coalition for
Reproductive Choice (RCRC) supports the Stop Anti-Abortion Disinformation Act,”

Collect, Mine, and Disseminate Private Client Information to Big Tech Companies
and Data BrokersText
of Letter (PDF)Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) sent letters to
BetterHelp and Talkspace, two leading mental health apps, expressing deep
concerns about the companies’ use of patients’ personal health data and
requesting more information about their data sharing and privacy practices.
Their letter follows reports that mental health apps are collecting, mining,
and disseminating private client information to third parties, including data
brokers and Big Tech companies like Google and Facebook. “We have long been concerned about the misuse of personal data by Big Tech
companies and unscrupulous data brokers, especially for the purpose of
microtargeting vulnerable populations. Unfortunately, it appears possible that
the policies used by your company and similar mental health platforms allow
third-party Big Tech firms and data brokers, who have shown remarkably little
interest in protecting vulnerable consumers and users, to access and use highly
confidential personal and medical information.” said the
senators. Mental health apps, including BetterHelp and Talkspace, exploded in
popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, marketing
themselves as a “cost-effective alternative to traditional therapy.”
However, they appear to be taking
advantage of the “regulatory gray area” in the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) to exploit their
patients’ data for profit.A February 2020 investigation found that BetterHelp was sharing analytics
with Facebook about how often users opened the app, and metadata from every
message shared on the platform – giving the company information on how long,
and where users were using mental health services. Former Talkspace employees claimed
that “treatment transcripts (were treated) as another data resource to be
mined,” and revealed that “individual users’ anonymized conversations were
routinely reviewed and mined for insights” to help the company with research
and marketing tactics.The senators raise additional concerns about the apps’ claims about sharing
and using “anonymized” data. Both companies were sharing anonymized information
with the research and analytics panel MixPanel, allowing MixPanel to see “where
(users) were and what device (users) were using; approximately how old (users)
were, whether (users) considered (them)selves spiritual or religious,
(their) financial status, and (their) sexual orientation,” as well as
information about where and when users had used therapy. A 2019 study reported
that even anonymized data could be used to identify individuals, finding that
with just a zip code, gender, and date of birth, companies could identify an
“anonymized” person 81% of the time. Given these concerns, the senators are calling on BetterHelp and Talkspace
to answer a set of questions about the type and breadth of data they share with
third parties, including Big Tech companies like Google and Facebook; the
methods they use to protect clients’ information; and their processes to inform
potential clients and current users about their privacy policies and the risks
of data sharing by July 6, 2022. Senator Warren has used oversight and policy tools to protect the sensitive
data of American consumers from Big Tech companies and data brokers:

(YouTube)Washington, D.C. – At a hearing of the Senate Indian
Affairs Committee, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) delivered
remarks calling for passage of her bill, the Truth and Healing Commission
on Indian Boarding School Policies Act (S. 2907), which seeks healing for
stolen Native children and their communities.Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, who testified at the hearing,
announced the administration’s strong support for the legislation.Senator Warren’s legislation would establish a commission to formally
investigate, document, and acknowledge the Federal Indian Boarding School
Policies. These policies included attempts to terminate Native cultures,
religions, and languages; assimilation practices; and human rights
violations. “The full effects of these policies have never before been appropriately
addressed by the federal government,” said Senator Warren.
“This work will be painful, but long overdue.”At the hearing, Senator Warren described how the Indian Boarding School
Policies forcibly removed Native children from their tribal lands and families
and placed them in boarding schools, where they were subjected to spiritual,
physical, industrial, psychological, and sexual abuse; neglect; and trauma.Senator Warren explained that this bill would build upon the work of
Secretary Haaland, who launched the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative—a
Department of the Interior review of the troubled legacy of the Federal Indian
Boarding School Policies—in June 2021. On May 11, 2022, Interior released
the first volume of its report, marking the start of the federal government’s
reckoning with this painful legacy. The hearing focused on Senator Warren’s
legislation as well as the first volume of Interior’s report.Senator Warren first
introduced the legislation in 2020 with then-Representative Haaland
(D-N.M.). This Congress, she reintroduced the bill alongside the Co-Chairs of
the Congressional Native American Caucus, Congresswoman Sharice Davids (D-Kan.)
and Congressman Tom Cole (R-Okla.), on September 30, 2021—the National Day of
Remembrance for U.S. Indian Boarding Schools. The reintroduced bill has
garnered 23 cosponsors in the Senate, including both the Chairman and Vice
Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i)
and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). Senator Warren thanked Chairman Schatz and Vice
Chairman Murkowski for their leadership on this issue and emphasized her desire
to work with the Committee to advance the legislation.The commission established by the bill would provide a forum for victims,
survivors, and other community members to speak about their experiences tied to
these human rights violations. This is a step that the first volume of
Interior’s report highlighted as necessary. The commission would also develop
recommendations for Congress to aid in the healing of the historic and
intergenerational trauma passed down in Native families and communities,
including the establishment of a support hotline for survivors and affected
communities. “The administration strongly supports this legislation, especially the
development of the national survivor resources to address the intergenerational
trauma, and the inclusion of the commission’s formal investigation and
documentation practices,” Secretary Haaland testified. She
later noted “how strongly we feel that this bill is actually complementary to
the work that we’re doing” at Interior.This hearing is the latest step in Senator Warren’s efforts to address
the Indian Boarding School Policies. Last month, Senator Warren, along with 18
of her colleagues, requested
that the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs hold this hearing. In August 2021,
she and Representative Davids sent
a letter to the Indian Health Service urging the agency to ensure that
culturally appropriate supports are in place for survivors and communities
affected by the Indian Boarding School Policies. Senator Warren also
cosponsored Vice Chairman Murkowski’s concurrent resolution (S.Con.Res.
28) supporting the designation of September 30, 2021, as National Day of
Remembrance for the Native American children who died while attending the
Indian boarding schools; the concurrent resolution was agreed to in the Senate
by unanimous consent.
