https://www.braun.senate.gov/senators-braun-and-hassan-introduce-bipartisan-bill-lower-prescription-drug-costs-increasing,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Mike Braun and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) introduced bipartisan legislation today to lower prescription drug costs by removing barriers that prevent some medications, including generic drugs, from entering the market. Generic medications generally cost less than name-brand drugs, and when generics enter the market, it increases competition and brings down overall prescription drug costs.“For far too long, politicians and pharmaceutical companies have sparred over drug pricing, all the while patients and their families bear the costs of expensive inaction and endless bureaucratic red tape. We need to shake up this dysfunctional system, and more generic drug competition in the pharmaceutical industry would give patients the upper hand. This is why I am proud to co-introduce the Increasing Prescription Drug Competition Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation that will open the door for more generic drugs to enter the market, ultimately driving consumer-friendly price competition. This bill will help patients in every state get drugs they need for less,” said Senator Braun.“Granite Staters and Americans need us to keep working together to stand up to Big Pharma and bring down prescription drug costs,” said Senator Hassan. “Our bipartisan bill would take an important step forward to lower costs at the pharmacy counter by preventing pharmaceutical companies’ efforts to block generic drugs from entering the market. I encourage my colleagues to join us in supporting this commonsense bill.”DETAILS:###Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "
https://www.braun.senate.gov/braun-sponsored-bill-would-make-dealing-deadly-fentanyl-felony-murder-offense,"WASHINGTON – Fentanyl overdose is the number one cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 45. Hoosier communities are seeing record rates of overdose deaths, including Vanderburgh County which saw a record number of overdose deaths last year – 60% of which were from fentanyl.  U.S. Senator Mike Braun has joined his colleagues U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) in introducing the Felony Murder for Deadly Fentanyl Distribution Act.  The bill makes the distribution of fentanyl resulting in death punishable by federal felony murder charges.  “Fentanyl is killing young Hoosiers and cutting a path of destruction through the Midwest,” said Senator Mike Braun. “If you are peddling this poison you should pay the price.”  “A wide-open Southern border has fueled a fentanyl epidemic in this country. The dealers and distributors of this deadly drug must be held accountable, and that’s what we’re fighting to do,” said Ernst. “This effort will impose felony murder charges for people who willingly distribute this lethal opioid to unknowing recipients.”  “Fentanyl is killing Americans at a record high. This deadly drug is widespread throughout our country and has left no community untouched,” said Rubio. “This bill would make drug dealers pay the price for selling deadly fentanyl.”  Illicit use of fentanyl is now the leading cause of death among Americans aged 18-45. Ernst, Rubio, and Braun were joined by Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) in introducing the bill.  ###  Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "
https://www.braun.senate.gov/senator-braun-submits-comments-regarding-lake-freeman," WASHINGTON -- Today, Senator Mike Braun submitted comments to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in support of the new proposed flow rates at the Oakdale Dam. If approved by the Commission, the new flow rates will help maintain normal water levels during times of low flow and drought conditions.  After hearing from many constituents about the local concern over water levels at Lake Freeman, Senator Braun convened a meeting this summer to hear from local stakeholders and the relevant agencies. Conversations from that meeting and further exchange between relevant parties resulted in the amendment submitted to the commission, which is now under consideration.  Senator Braun issued the following statement:  “Lake Freeman is a valuable commodity to the local economy and when water levels become too low to sustain recreation on the lake, local businesses and livelihoods are negatively impacted. I hope the Commission approves the proposed amendment in a timely manner and local residents and lake-goers can put this issue behind them.” – Senator Mike Braun   In the letter, Senator Braun wrote of his personal trips to Lake Freeman to learn about the issue and help bring about a solution:  “Having visited the lake and spoken with business owners, local elected officials, state officials, and homeowners, I know how important this issue is to residents of the City of Monticello and Carroll and White counties. Lake Freeman is both a driver of economic growth and strength and a recreational tool to families who have planted roots in the area. An economic impact study conducted by the Carroll and White County Economic Development Corporations found that the lake level fluctuations negatively impacted the local economy across 25 different industries over the course of multiple peak season interruptions. Addressing the lake level issue will ensure the safety of boaters, lake wildlife, lake businesses, the broader economy, and the endangered mussels downstream for decades to come.”   He also noted the positive experience of working with the local community leaders and groups involved in the conversation:  “I have been assured by community leaders that the flow rates in the proposed amendment will greatly improve the certainty of lake operations going forward and strike an even balance between the needs and long-term prospects of the community and the protections provided to animals on the Endangered Species Act. I am honored to have played a role in these groups coming to a consensus.”   Read the full letter below or on Senator Braun’s website.  September 19, 2022Dear Secretary Bose and Deputy Secretary Reese,  I write in support of the application filed by the Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) on FERC Docket No. 12514 for Non-Capacity Related Amendment of License and Request for Expedited Approval for Norway-Oakdale Hydroelectric Project. This amendment would represent the end a long and arduous process that has touched multiple agencies, local businesses, and homeowners over the past decade. Should this application be approved, it will strike a healthy balance between local economic concerns and the health and safety of endangered mussels downstream of the Oakdale Dam.              Having visited the lake and spoken with business owners, local elected officials, state officials, and homeowners, I know how important this issue is to residents of the City of Monticello and Carroll and White counties.

Addressing the lake level issue will ensure the safety of boaters, lake wildlife, lake businesses, the broader economy, and the endangered mussels downstream for decades to come.              Local landowners, businesses, the Shafer and Freeman Lakes Environmental Conservation Corporation (SFLECC), and elected officials have been seeking reprieve from the current policy from US Fish and Wildlife (USFWS), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NISPCO) for a decade over this issue. Following the meeting I convened at Lake Freeman and conversations I had with USFWS I was pleased to learn that a series of cooperative conversations took place between private and government stakeholders during the summer months. Eventually, those conversations resulted in the amendment submitted to the commission which is under consideration. I have been assured by community leaders that the flow rates in the proposed amendment will greatly improve the certainty of lake operations going forward and strike an even balance between the needs and long-term prospects of the community and the protections provided to animals on the Endangered Species Act. I am honored to have played a role in these groups coming to a consensus and appreciate all sides agreeing to navigate difficult conversations for the greater good.  Lastly, I would like to thank Commission staff for assisting me and my team in understanding an issue as complex as we have at Lake Freeman. On a number of occasions through the process, multiple stakeholders commented on how this is truly a unique set of circumstances involving two federal agencies, a regulated utility, the ESA, the court system, and local voices. Commission staff were able to help untangle the issue in a way that allowed me and my team to play a productive role.    Please make every fair and reasonable consideration for this application filed by NIPSCO for approval of a Non-capacity Related Amendment of License approved by FERC. My office stands ready to be of assistance until a proper resolution has been agreed and finalized.  Sincerely, Mike BraunUnited States Senator  Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "

Braun joined Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia introducing the bipartisan Access for Veterans to Records Act alongside Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) to help eliminate the current backlog of veterans’ record requests at the National Personnel Records Center.The bipartisan legislation will help more veterans and their families obtain their military records, which are often required to access critical care and benefits veterans earn through their service to the nation.“My father was a B-17 tail gunner during World War II, and I never forgot the lesson he taught me: to honor every American who has served our country with dignity and respect. The best way to provide for our veterans is to guarantee them the absolute best care possible, and this includes straightforward and easy access to their veteran service records,” Sen. Braun said. “This is why I’m a proud cosponsor of the Access for Veterans to Records Act, a piece of bipartisan legislation will greatly improve access to medical and service records for veterans and their families – so many of which require critical care. This bill is the least we can do to thank the men and women who have stood on the front line defending our great nation.”“Too many Georgia veterans are having to wait too long to access their service records. It can impact their access to health care and veterans’ benefits,” said Sen. Ossoff. “That’s why I’m leading this bipartisan bill to address the backlog.”“Our men and women in uniform have sacrificed so much to protect our freedom,” said Sen. Rounds. “The current backlog is unacceptable and impedes veterans’ ability to access the services they have earned. This bill would work to reform the National Personnel Records Center so our veterans can acquire their records in a timely manner. I am pleased my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are coming together to pass this commonsense legislation.”“Administrative challenges should never prevent veterans from accessing the critical care and benefits they deserve. Congress must take action – that’s why I’m helping introduce this bill to address the backlog of personnel records to ensure veterans can swiftly process their claims and access the benefits they have earned. By creating systems and infrastructure to streamline veterans’ ability to access records, we can better deliver on their benefits and needs, from health care and housing to jobs training and education,” said Sen. Shaheen. “I’ll keep fighting to ensure veterans can access the full range of benefits they’ve earned through their service to our nation.”Rep.

https://www.braun.senate.gov/sen-braun-colleagues-introduce-bill-maximize-americans-retirement-funds,"WASHINGTON—Today, Sens. Braun, Burr, Tuberville, Lummis, Marshall, Wicker, Daines, and Inhofe introduced legislation to build a stronger retirement system for Americans by clarifying the fiduciary duty of plan administrators to select and maintain investments based solely on financial factors. Recently, the Biden Administration Department of Labor proposed a rule that would essentially coerce workers and businesses into supporting corporations deemed “woke” through ESG (environmental, social and governance) funds.
 
A number of studies have shown that ESG investing policies have worse rates of return. In comparison to other investment plans, ESG investors generally end up paying higher costs for worse performances.
 
“At a time when energy costs are soaring and Hoosiers are grappling with record high inflation, Democrats are politicizing American retirement funds and targeting companies that invest in energy sources that could help alleviate these soaring costs. The Biden Administration should not be sacrificing the retirement savings of thousands of individuals to promote liberal policy objectives.”—Sen. Mike Braun
 
“When retirement savers use financial advisors with a fiduciary responsibility to invest their money, they should be confident that their economic best interests are their asset manager’s top priority. Unfortunately, investment managers are increasingly being pressured by the left to factor in companies’ environmental, social, and corporate governance practices into investment decisions. This bill protects investors by ensuring investment managers only consider financial risk and return when investing on behalf of Americans saving for retirement. It’s my hope that Americans, who are already struggling with inflation’s negative impact on their investment accounts, will be protected from fiduciaries investing their money in ways that are not financially beneficial to them.” —Sen. Tommy Tuberville
 
“Retirement funds should be invested based on their long-term fiscal performance, not based on the political and social whims of the day.  Employees in Wyoming are working hard, and they want to know that their investments are financially sound. They are focused on being able to retire and provide for their families, not on if their investments are woke or popular. The Biden administration should put more effort into righting our economy instead of bowing to progressive pressure.”—Sen. Cynthia Lummis
 
“Inflation is already crushing Kansans’ hard-earned retirement savings. This is largely driven by the Democrats’ out-of-control spending and drastically increased energy costs. The Biden Administration is now looking to further advance their war against American energy by forcing companies to make extreme commitments to climate change and social justice to be eligible for investments. I hear all the time how these radical policies are harming Kansas energy producers ability to gain access to capital and they will diminish the value of Kansans investment funds. I’m pleased to join Sen. Braun to fight back against this misguided and harmful policy.”—Sen. Roger Marshall
 
“Most Americans trust their retirement plan administrators to look out for them and maximize their return on investments, but recent moves by the Biden Administration threaten to upend this longstanding system in favor of “woke” activism. Retirement accounts should be off-limits to the President’s politics.”—Sen. Roger Wicker
 
“Montanans’ don’t want to see woke CEOs play politics with their hard-earned retirement savings. Congress must ensure that folks’ retirement funds are being invested responsibly – not at the whim of President Biden’s far-Left agenda.”—Sen. Steve Daines
 
“Oklahomans are suffering the consequences of the Biden administration’s far-left policies. Even as we deal with record-high inflation, this administration continues to push for more extreme spending and radical policies that will only make the damage worse. They’ve proposed a rule that could coerce workers and businesses into supporting organizations that promote these radical ideologies, putting American retirement accounts at risk in the process. That’s why I am glad to join Sen. Braun in introducing legislation to protect our retirement system and ensure it is not undermined through outlandish rules like this.”—Sen. Jim Inhofe

Braun’s budget is a blueprint for rolling back excessive deficit spending, providing accountability, and growing our economy once again.  Congress must then reject reckless spending bills and instead enact the legislation to carry out this budget.” – Garrett Bess, Vice President of Heritage Action“Senator Mike Braun’s budget resolution lays out an alternative path to our current unsustainable course. His plan would balance the budget and limit spending to GDP growth, a policy that would encourage lawmakers to focus on pro-growth policies like extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Braun’s budget also makes important reforms to strengthen budget enforcement and improve scorekeeping at the Congressional Budget Office.” – National Taxpayers Union“For far too long, the federal government has engaged in irresponsible overspending and with the latest inflation numbers, taxpayers are feeling the impact of these inflationary policies.

We applaud Senator Braun for his commonsense solution to reign in the nation’s debt and hold elected officials accountable in serving the American taxpayer.” – Patrick Hedger, TPA Executive Director“America desperately needs responsible Congressional budgeting. For too long, the federal government has engaged in reckless fiscal spending that has left the economy in a dire state. We welcome Senator Braun’s proposal to roll back excessive deficit spending, increase accountability, and lower inflation. Taxpayers need a fiscally responsible budget proposal that puts the economy back on its feet and holds the government accountable for its spending. Braun’s plan seeks to do just that.” - Krisztina Pusok, Research and Policy Director for the American Consumer Institute“We applaud Senator Braun for putting forward a budget that would move our country toward a path of fiscal sustainability. Lawmakers have a basic duty to put forward a fiscal plan for our country. Budgeting is about tradeoffs. If other lawmakers have a different vision for our country, they should put forward their budgets showing their priorities. Then, Congress should debate and enact a real governing budget, something they have failed to do for years. ” - Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget“The congressional budget resolution is supposed to set the stage for managing all aspects of the federal budget, including controlling the debt that has helped create today’s high inflation. Senator Braun deserves a lot of credit for bringing a responsible budget resolution to the Senate floor, an opportunity created by the failure of the Senate Budget Committee. Senator Braun’s framework would encourage Congress to control spending, adopt pro-growth tax and regulatory policies, follow a glide path to primary balance, strengthen budget practices and program authorizations, and put major entitlement programs on a sustainable path. We urge all senators to support consideration of this budget resolution.” - Kurt Couchman, Senior Fellow in Fiscal Policy, Americans for Prosperity“The American people are currently grappling with the grave economic consequences of the disastrous Biden Administration. Every American has been harmed in the process, especially those who are trying to raise healthy, thriving children. In order to create a society that values life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, we must produce responsible economic policies that empower American families. While President Biden and radical pro-abortion legislators focus on facilitating the genocide of innocent preborn babies, the pro-life movement is working to strengthen families, especially through economic means. The majority of Americans do not want to be made complicit in the violence of abortion by paying for it, which is why the people deserve a budget that includes the Hyde Amendment. Students for Life Action supports the Braun budget because it respects the will and hard-earned resources of taxpaying American families.” - Kristan Hawkins, President, Students for Life Action“Three cheers for Senator Braun's budget, which ends the Democrats' reconciliation threat to the American economy and forges a new path forward to American prosperity: low taxes, spending restraint, sensible regulations, unleashing American energy production, and securing the border.” – Phil Kerpen, President, American Commitment""Senator Braun offers a bold and thoughtful plan for correcting the federal budget's wayward course. His focus on accelerating economic growth, restraining federal spending growth, and permanently extending the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, is EXACTLY what we must do if we are to get our country's fiscal house in order. The America First Policy Institute commends Senator Braun and his plan to restore economic integrity in our federal budget."" - James Carter, America First Policy Institute, Director of the Center for American Prosperity“The budget proposal offered by Senator Mike Braun (R-Ind.) provides commonsense solutions to eliminate wasteful spending and balance the federal budget.  At a time when inflation is running at a 40-year high, the Braun budget protects taxpayers by making permanent the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which will help increase wages and lead to new investment, rolls back unspent funds issued by the American Rescue Plan Act, and prioritizes eliminating improper payments, one of the key drivers to waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government.  We applaud Senator Braun for his efforts to bring fiscal sanity back into the budget process.” - Tom Schatz, President, Council for Citizens Against Government Waste""What our nation needs is more senators like Senator Mike Braun of Indiana.  Sen. Braun is serious about reforming our nation’s congress. Not only has Sen.

https://www.braun.senate.gov/senator-braun-introduces-balanced-federal-budget-fight-inflation-unleash-prosperity,"WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Braun is introducing “The Braun Budget” – a balanced federal budget designed to throw the brakes on out-of-control government spending, fight inflation by bringing expenses and revenue into balance over 10 years, and unleash American prosperity by making the Trump tax cuts permanent.
 
Under to Congressional Budget Act, if the Senate Budget Committee fails to report a budget resolution by April 15th, any Senator can introduce their own budget and receive a vote on the Senate floor. That vote is expected to come sometime this week. “Record high gas prices. A 9.1% inflation pay cut. Every American is paying for the President Biden’s big spending agenda and D.C.’s budget dysfunction. Americans are tired of it, and it’s clear President Biden has no plan to deal with the inflation bomb he created. That’s why I’m introducing my own balanced budget that fights inflation and unleashes American prosperity.” – Senator Mike BraunThe Braun Budget balances expenses and revenues over 10 years and saves over $4.5 trillion – without raising taxes – by capping total spending and dialing it back to 17.5% of potential GDP (the 50-year rolling average of revenue, regardless of tax policy).
 
Senator Braun’s budget provides for robust defense and extends the life of the Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid trust funds for the millions of seniors who rely on this program for their health care. The Budget also pulls back over $100 billion of the remaining American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds that had nothing to do with COVID in the first place and kicked off the inflation wave hurting American families.

“Senator Mike Braun’s budget resolution lays out an alternative path to our current unsustainable course. His plan would balance the budget and limit spending to GDP growth, a policy that would encourage lawmakers to focus on pro-growth policies like extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Braun’s budget also makes important reforms to strengthen budget enforcement and improve scorekeeping at the Congressional Budget Office.” – National Taxpayers Union
 
“For far too long, the federal government has engaged in irresponsible overspending and with the latest inflation numbers, taxpayers are feeling the impact of these inflationary policies. Senator Braun’s sound budget proposal will not only balance the budget, but add transparency back to the budgeting process that has been absent for too long. We applaud Senator Braun for his commonsense solution to reign in the nation’s debt and hold elected officials accountable in serving the American taxpayer.” – Patrick Hedger, TPA Executive Director
 
“America desperately needs responsible Congressional budgeting. For too long, the federal government has engaged in reckless fiscal spending that has left the economy in a dire state. We welcome Senator Braun’s proposal to roll back excessive deficit spending, increase accountability, and lower inflation. Taxpayers need a fiscally responsible budget proposal that puts the economy back on its feet and holds the government accountable for its spending. Braun’s plan seeks to do just that.” - Krisztina Pusok, Research and Policy Director for the American Consumer Institute
 
“We applaud Senator Braun for putting forward a budget that would move our country toward a path of fiscal sustainability. Lawmakers have a basic duty to put forward a fiscal plan for our country. Budgeting is about tradeoffs. If other lawmakers have a different vision for our country, they should put forward their budgets showing their priorities. Then, Congress should debate and enact a real governing budget, something they have failed to do for years. ” - Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget
 
“The congressional budget resolution is supposed to set the stage for managing all aspects of the federal budget, including controlling the debt that has helped create today’s high inflation. Senator Braun deserves a lot of credit for bringing a responsible budget resolution to the Senate floor, an opportunity created by the failure of the Senate Budget Committee. Senator Braun’s framework would encourage Congress to control spending, adopt pro-growth tax and regulatory policies, follow a glide path to primary balance, strengthen budget practices and program authorizations, and put major entitlement programs on a sustainable path. We urge all senators to support consideration of this budget resolution.” - Kurt Couchman, Senior Fellow in Fiscal Policy, Americans for Prosperity“The American people are currently grappling with the grave economic consequences of the disastrous Biden Administration. Every American has been harmed in the process, especially those who are trying to raise healthy, thriving children. In order to create a society that values life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, we must produce responsible economic policies that empower American families. While President Biden and radical pro-abortion legislators focus on facilitating the genocide of innocent preborn babies, the pro-life movement is working to strengthen families, especially through economic means. The majority of Americans do not want to be made complicit in the violence of abortion by paying for it, which is why the people deserve a budget that includes the Hyde Amendment. Students for Life Action supports the Braun budget because it respects the will and hard-earned resources of taxpaying American families.” - Kristan Hawkins, President, Students for Life Action“Three cheers for Senator Braun's budget, which ends the Democrats' reconciliation threat to the American economy and forges a new path forward to American prosperity: low taxes, spending restraint, sensible regulations, unleashing American energy production, and securing the border.” – Phil Kerpen, President, American Commitment""Senator Braun offers a bold and thoughtful plan for correcting the federal budget's wayward course. His focus on accelerating economic growth, restraining federal spending growth, and permanently extending the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, is EXACTLY what we must do if we are to get our country's fiscal house in order. The America First Policy Institute commends Senator Braun and his plan to restore economic integrity in our federal budget."" - James Carter, America First Policy Institute, Director of the Center for American Prosperity“The budget proposal offered by Senator Mike Braun (R-Ind.) provides commonsense solutions to eliminate wasteful spending and balance the federal budget.  At a time when inflation is running at a 40-year high, the Braun budget protects taxpayers by making permanent the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which will help increase wages and lead to new investment, rolls back unspent funds issued by the American Rescue Plan Act, and prioritizes eliminating improper payments, one of the key drivers to waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government.  We applaud Senator Braun for his efforts to bring fiscal sanity back into the budget process.” - Tom Schatz, President, Council for Citizens Against Government Waste""What our nation needs is more senators like Senator Mike Braun of Indiana.  Sen. Braun is serious about reforming our nation’s congress. Not only has Sen. Braun put forth a fiscally responsible budget for FY2023, he also is championing the “No Budget, No Pay” Act in the U.S. Senate, to bring about lasting change and restore fiscal sanity. Our group has as our goal, the ratification of the “No Budget, No Pay” Act, authored by Sen. Braun and Sen. Manchin, as the 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Sen. Braun believes strongly and correctly that our nation must get back to the habit of passing an annual budget.  His FY2023 budget proposal is a first step. We ask that all concerned citizens visit his webpage for details on his common sense, pro-America, budget proposal. Dysfunction is rampant in our nation’s capital, and we all have to pull together to support men like Sen. Mike Braun who are serious about addressing our nation’s debt before it is too late. He is committed to working across party lines to seek long-term, common-sense solutions to avert a fiscal debt crisis by passing a budget that addresses our spending dysfunction. His FY2023 budget should be welcomed, applauded, and embraced as a first step in the right direction."" - Brian Walter, Founder, Unity above Self in America“Americans have long understood and overwhelmingly supported work requirements. At a time of record-high open jobs and near record-low labor force participation, the commonsense work requirements in Sen. Braun's budget proposal are a big step in the right direction to tame inflation and get Americans back to work."" - Tarren Bragdon, FGA President and CEO.    “Americans are facing a serious fiscal crisis due to decades of overspending and reckless debt accumulation. Senator Braun’s (R-Ind.) FY 2023 budget offers an equally serious response. This budget avoids gimmicks and unrealistic assumptions by proposing reforms that are both substantive and politically palatable.  Braun’s resolution is an excellent example of how our economic prospects can be improved with both a strong fiscal rule and a strong Congress that is re-engaged in the business of governing.” - Nan Swift, Fellow, Governance Program (R St Institute)""Senator Braun’s budget is a great product that every member of Congress should support. This budget proves, through hard work, it is possible for Washington to cut spending growth, increase transparency, and secure our country. Senator Braun’s budget brings us closer to a Responsible American Budget and putting our country back on a sound fiscal track for generations to come."" - Greg Sindelar, CEO of the Texas Public Policy FoundationKeep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "
https://www.braun.senate.gov/node/1750,"Watch Here | Download HereWASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mike Braun joined Fox and Friends this morning to criticize President Joe Biden for going overseas to seek help with rising U.S. gas costs instead of promoting American energy production, and funds from the American Rescue Plan Act which was called a “COVID relief” being spent on “woke” social justice projects and kicking off a wave of inflation.Partial Transcript Below:
 
On American Energy Independence
 
“When you look at what we’re doing now, groveling over there, asking them to increase their supply—and by the way most places are producing at full tilt because of the high price—I mean it just doesn’t make sense. It frustrated me because in running anything, including this biggest business of the federal government, you’ve got to be smart enough to mix what you need to do in the short run even if it’s counter to your long-term goals. We should never have shot ourselves in the foot by eliminating our energy ascendancy and now have to go over and beg folks like Saudi Arabia.”
 
On Misuse of COVID funding
 
“Brian, there is so much money sloshing around in that $2 trillion bill - only 10% of it went to COVID. We're going to see more and more of this over time. It's part of the inflation bomb. Now we're seeing how it's blowing up around the country with stuff like this. It's no good. We've asked them to tell us what is left unspent: What do you have rat-holed away? … We're going to see it little by little, because they know if they did it all at once, it would shock everybody big time. They're not going to pull it off. We are going to watch and sadly there is going to be more of it.”
 
BACKGROUND:
 
Senator Braun was part of an effort by GOP Senators to get an accounting of how the American Rescue Plan Act’s $2 trillion have been spent, and how much is left unspent.
 
Senator Braun called for “COVID relief” money that was spent on ballparks, ski-slopes, and luxury hotels to be repaid and returned to taxpayers.

https://www.braun.senate.gov/braun-joins-bill-stop-biden-transferring-student-loan-debt-all-americans,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Sens. Mike Braun, John Thune, Richard Burr, Bill Cassidy and Roger Marshall introduced the Stop Reckless Student Loan Actions Act, legislation that would end President Biden's untargeted, budget-busting suspension of repayments on qualifying federal student loans, following 24 months of non-payment and six executive actions extending the payment pause. The bill would still allow the president to temporarily suspend repayment for low- and middle-income borrowers in future national emergencies and would prohibit the president from cancelling outstanding federal student loan obligations due to a national emergency.""The majority of Americans do not have college degrees,"" said Braun. ""Why should they be forced to pick up the tab for college degrees in the name of pandemic relief? This transfer of wealth is not a move to 'advance equity,' but rather a taxpayer handout to appease far-left activists.""""As Americans continue to return to the workforce more than two years since the pandemic began, it is time for borrowers to resume repayment of student debt obligations,"" said Thune. ""Taxpayers and working families should not be responsible for continuing to bear the costs associated with this suspension of repayment. This common-sense legislation would protect taxpayers and prevent President Biden from suspending federal student loan repayments in perpetuity. Any future suspension of federal student loan repayments should be left to Congress, not the Biden administration.""""The Biden Administration continues to call for a return to normalcy from the pandemic, while simultaneously extending emergency relief programs like the student loan repayment freeze,"" said Burr. ""They can't have it both ways. Resuming student loan repayments is long overdue, especially in today's strong job market. That's why I'm proud to work with my colleagues on this important bill, which will end the repayment moratorium that has exacerbated the existing moral hazard against borrowers and cost taxpayers an estimated $5 billion per month.""""If the administration wants to follow the science regarding COVID, we must also follow the facts,"" said Dr. Cassidy. ""Unemployment is not at pandemic levels and a student loan repayment pause benefits those who are high income and able to pay their bills. The administration is spending without congressional approval. That should be considered unconstitutional.""""Early in the pandemic when millions were out of work it was understandable to provide temporary relief for borrowers,"" said Marshall. ""Two years removed, this White House and Democrats in Congress continue to pursue the fiscally unsustainable policy of suspending payment, and ultimately canceling, student loan debt, nearly two trillion dollars owed to the federal government. Following the costly response to the pandemic, we must focus on implementing a fiscal strategy that will address the unsustainable path we're on, not compound it.""""The moratorium on federal student loan repayments has cost American taxpayers over $100 billion and will cost $5 billion every month it remains in place,"" said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform. ""Continuing this reckless policy will make surging inflation worse, at a time that we have seen it hit a 40-year high. Less than 17 percent of U.S. adults have federal student loans, and that group is disproportionately wealthy, white, and highly educated. It is unsustainable and unfair for working families to fund this indefinite giveaway to progressive elites. Senators Thune, Burr, Braun, Cassidy, and Marshall should be commended for introducing legislation to end this moratorium and protect taxpayers in the future by narrowing the president's authority to defer loan repayments.""""The student debt repayment pause will add $120 billion to the deficit through August, offer a massive handout to doctors and lawyers, and feed more inflation. It's time to end ongoing COVID relief, or at least fully offset any further extensions,"" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""We applaud Senators Thune, Burr, Braun, Cassidy, and Marshall for introducing the Stop Reckless Student Loan Actions Act, which would put an end to the pause and limit a president's ability to unilaterally cancel student debt.""Background:On April 6, 2022, President Biden announced his fourth extension of the suspension of qualifying federal student loan repayments through August 31, 2022. He also announced that when repayments do resume, all borrowers whose federal student loans are delinquent or in default would be made current. Prior to this extension, the repayment of these federal student loans was scheduled to resume in May 2022. Notably, nothing in this bill would prohibit the U.S. Department of Education from continuing to work with individuals who may be struggling to make timely payments, like helping struggling borrowers enter into income-driven repayment plans.###Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "

That starts with commonsense, pro-growth legislation like the Renewing Investment in American Workers and Supply Chains Act I am leading in the Senate to level the playing field for businesses and grow our economy in Indiana and throughout the country.”—Senator Mike Braun  “Investing in American workers and industry, including the vital manufacturers in Northern Indiana, will create jobs, make our supply chains more resilient, and strengthen our economy. The Renewing Investment in American Workers and Supply Chains Act would take bold action to level the playing field, incentivize growth here at home, and equip America to thrive in the 21st century. I thank Senator Braun for leading this legislative effort in the Senate as we seek to deliver results for hardworking Hoosiers and Americans across the country.”—Congresswoman Jackie Walorski, lead sponsor of the House bill.  “Northeast Indiana is one of America’s greatest innovation and manufacturing hubs.

As long as the federal government keeps spending money we don’t have, families in Indiana and across the county will continue to suffer,” said Braun.Emmer said, “Our national debt ten years ago was $16 trillion. Today, that debt has nearly doubled, to over $30 trillion. Our fiscal trajectory as a nation is unsustainable and threatens the future of our children and grandchildren.”“We can still change course, but we must act now” Emmer continued. The Responsible Budget Target Act offers a practical solution to our nation’s spending addiction that will help to balance our budget in the coming decades without causing major disruptions to government services. I am excited to partner with Senator Braun on this effort, which is a culmination my work over the past year to return fiscal sanity to Washington.”Kurt Couchman, a Senior Fellow in Fiscal Policy at Americans for Prosperity said, “Too much spending and debt have created today’s high inflation. Fortunately, Senator Mike Braun and Representative Tom Emmer have proposed a new, smart way to get the budget back on track.” Couchman continued, “Similar to Switzerland’s highly successful debt brake, their bill would move toward budget balance over the business cycle—instead of every year—and would allow immediate emergency spending with offsets in the years to follow. We commend them and encourage all members of Congress to support the Responsible Budget Targets Act.”BACKGROUNDPrevious attempts in Congress to establish fixed spending limits have fallen short largely due to their static nature, often failing to account for fluctuations in the growth of the economy or federal receipts. The RBTA establishes a dynamic formula that fluctuates with the expansion or contraction of our economy. If followed, this model could put us in a position to balance the federal budget excluding debt in just fifteen years.Each year, the RBTA would require the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to send to Congress a spending cap estimate at the beginning of the budget process. Congress would then work within this cap to allocate funds to meet our nation’s most important needs and obligations. The bill also allows for any emergency spending to be offset in a manner that will prevent such spending from impacting the overall baseline.You can read the bill in its entirety here.Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "

The Creating Efficiency in Foreign Inspections Act will help bring drug manufacturing back to the U.S. to create a more reliable and robust pharmaceutical supply chain for the benefit of American patients.”— Senator Mike Braun“Giving foreign drug manufacturers in countries like China a ‘heads up’ before facility inspections, while putting our own domestic producers at a disadvantage, makes about as much sense as relying on the CCP to make these critical goods in the first place. This bill will put American producers on a level playing field with foreign competitors, help bring manufacturing back to the U.S., and reduce our reliance on Communist China.”— Senator Joni ErnstBACKGROUND:Foreign pharmaceutical facilities are awarded significant lead time between the time they’re notified of a facility inspection and the time the inspections take place. Domestic facilities don’t receive the same treatment, receiving little to no advance notice prior to a facility inspection.

S. J. Res. 29, 117th Cong., 1st Sess. (2021).”BACKGROUNDCongressional Republicans tell Supreme Court to block Biden's 'health police' vaccine mandate Fox NewsElise Stefanik, Mike Braun and others argue Biden admin is exceeding its authority with vaccine-or-test rule A group of 47 Republican senators and 136 House members is asking the Supreme Court to block enforcement of President Biden's vaccine mandate for businesses with 100 or more employees, arguing that the president and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) are exceeding their authority.""Vaccine mandates—a prototypical state police power— are not within the purview of the Occupational Safety and Health Act,"" the members tell the Court, ""let alone something on which Congress intended OSHA to take unilateral action under its ‘emergency’ powers.""The Supreme Court recently scheduled an unusual Jan. 7 oral argument on an emergency appeal related to the vaccine mandate. The court normally decides such appeals on the briefs only.The argument will consider a request to bar the Biden administration from enforcing the mandate while lower courts decide whether it is constitutional. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently initially blocked the mandate, but the Sixth Circuit overruled that in a consolidated appeal, triggering a flurry of requests for the Supreme Court to reinstate the stay from opponents of the mandate.Senate votes to repeal key Biden administration vaccine and testing policy The Washington PostDecember 8, 2021Congressional Republicans on Wednesday ratcheted up their attempts to repeal President Biden’s vaccine and testing mandates, adopting a measure in the Senate to unwind policies that the White House and top public health officials see as critical to combating the coronavirus.The intensifying campaign mirrored in spirit the political and legal battles that GOP officials waged earlier in the pandemic, as they attacked business closures, mask mandates and other government-led measures to slow the contagion. With vaccines, Republicans on Capitol Hill argued that the requirements are unwarranted and unconstitutional, putting Americans’ jobs at risk.In their most public, forceful protest to date, Republicans led by Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) muscled to passage a proposal that aims to repeal the Biden administration’s rules ordering large private businesses to require vaccination or implement comprehensive coronavirus testing for their workers.Braun’s legislative push hinged on a congressional process that allows lawmakers to review, and potentially revoke, federal agency regulations. The tactic allowed the GOP to take its bill to the Senate floor, even though Democrats control the chamber, where it later passed on a 52-to-48 vote. Two Democrats, Sens.

https://www.braun.senate.gov/node/1364,"WASHINGTON - Senator Mike Braun today questioned Dr. Anthony Fauci and CDC Director Rochelle Walensky on the White House's COVID strategy. Senator Braun noted that the ""top-down"" approach from the federal government has not yielded results to justify itself, and that it is time for a new strategy of decentralizing COVID response, putting power back in the hands of local governments, and providing Americans the data to make decisions for themselves rather than telling them what to do through mandates and one-size-fits-all government overreach.SELECT QUOTES: “When you wrestle with something of this magnitude, where it’s dominated the conversation for 2 years, and you’re still seeing results equal to or worse than when we started, it begs the question: Do we need to take a different approach?""""What I’m hearing here today is that there won’t be a real change in approach, and even moreso a doubling down on what for 2 years has arguably not gotten us to a place where we feel better about this and we’re not drowning in anxiety. […] Normally a board of directors, a CEO, would be fired and a board of directors would be questioned as to how good they are, meaning maybe us in the Senate, if they don’t change strategies after results like this. It's time to decentralize [the approach], and provide the information to the American public to make their own best decisions.”“I think if you want to regain the trust of the American public, you need to look at a total revamp of how we contend with this virus.

The Senate has spoken this year that Dr. Weil is not the right fit for this position. We appreciate your responsiveness to this request, and ask for prompt confirmation that the nomination of Dr. David Weil is formally withdrawn."" Read the full letter below:Dear Mr. President, We write to urge you to formally withdraw the nomination of Dr. David Weil, of Massachusetts, to be Administrator of the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor, vice Cheryl Marie Stanton. Dr. Weil’s track record is hostile to employers, unproductive to the employees served by such employers, and the actions he took at the federal level were mired in costly litigation.The United States Constitution divides the responsibility for populating top positions in the federal government between the President and the United States Senate. The appointments clause (Article II, Section 2) empowers the President to nominate “by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate”. The role of the Senate to give advice and consent is an integral part of the process for populating top officials in our government.The Senate received Dr. Weil’s nomination on June 8, 2021. The Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) carefully considered the merits of his nomination, actions that included a full committee hearing. The HELP Committee was unable to favorably report Dr. Weil’s nomination to the full Senate during an August 3, 2021 business meeting, lacking the necessary votes to do so. In the nearly five months that followed this failed business meeting, no action was taken by the full Senate to discharge or otherwise consider his nomination. On December 21, 2021, this nomination was formally returned to the White House, as the Senate did not give consent to hold over Dr. Weil’s nomination.The lack of sufficient support for Dr. Weil's nomination is not surprising considering the actions he took during the Obama administration as Wage & Hour Administrator. Chief among the concerns with his record: promulgation of a job-killing overtime rule in 2016 that overstepped and was therefore struck down by the U.S. District Court; an arbitrarily strict standard for classification of independent contractors in 2015; and a destructive expansion of “joint employer” definition in 2016 that led to a 93 percent increase in litigation. Additionally, both Dr. Weil and the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts have refused to provide all the documents regarding Weil’s actions with the Labor Advisory Board in Massachusetts. Requests to both by the Ranking Member’s staff have been stonewalled and public records requests have been unnecessarily delayed. These are not the actions of an individual committed to transparency and accountability in government service. His nomination has raised sincere concerns on behalf of many of the constituencies we represent.Small business entrepreneurs in this country deserve a Wage and Hour Division Administrator that will work constructively alongside them. The Senate has spoken this year that Dr. Weil is not the right fit for this position. We appreciate your responsiveness to this request, and ask for prompt confirmation that the nomination of Dr. David Weil is formally withdrawn.Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "

https://www.braun.senate.gov/senator-braun-writes-letter-secretary-becerra-ensure-federal-dollars-arent-spent-abortion,"JASPER, IN - At his confirmation hearing earlier this year, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told Senator Mike Braun he would “uphold the law” regarding federal dollars being spent on abortion. On March 31, Senator Mike Braun sent a letter to Secretary Becerra to ensure that he is following the current HHS Title X Rule in place which confirms the Congressional intent and requires that Title X funds not be distributed to any program or organization which provides or recommends abortion.Senator Braun writes in his letter:“On March 29, 2021, my office received notice that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded over five million dollars to the Indiana Family Health Council Incorporated (IFHC), an entity tasked with distribution of Title X grant dollars to organizations in the Hoosier state.  During your nomination process, you pledged that if confirmed, you would uphold the law. It is imperative that you take steps to ensure the longstanding intent of Congress is respected and no federal dollars under Title X are used to support abortion.”In 1970, the Title X Family Planning Program was authorized by the United States Congress with the aim of ensuring that low-income patients have access to reproductive health services by distributing funding for testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, contraception, and cancer screenings.Since its authorization, Congress has prohibited Title X funding from being used for abortion services, including abortion counseling and referrals.On March 18, 2021, Secretary Becerra published a release indicating that HHS plans to propose revised regulations without the compliance measures in place with a goal of finalizing any Title X regulation by December of this year. Eleven days after this release, Secretary Becerra issued over $5 million to the Indiana Family Health Council Incorporated to implement Title X programming.Senator Braun is requesting documents and communications related to Title X applicants, as well as a detailed explanation of how HHS will ensure compliance with the existing Title X law and corresponding regulations so that no funding is used to support abortion services, including abortion counseling and abortion referrals.Senator Braun concludes his letter to Secretary Becerra:“I must stress that while an alternative rule is being drafted, reviewed, and finalized, the Trump Administration Title X Rule remains in place.  During your confirmation hearing, I asked whether you would respect the longstanding position of Congress and American taxpayers by excluding funding for abortion in the distribution of HHS dollars. While you did not answer my question, you were firm in stating that you would uphold the law. As the Biden Administration rushes to get Title X funding out the door, I ask that HHS remain compliant with the law and corresponding regulations currently in place.”Read the full letter.Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "

https://www.braun.senate.gov/senators-braun-hassan-representatives-latta-rice-introduce-bipartisan-bill-support-new-va-program,"WASHINGTON- Today, U.S. Senators Mike Braun (R-IN) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) introduced bipartisan legislation that helps the Department of Veterans Affairs actively recruit and hire separating Department of Defense medical department personnel to help fill its more than 45,000 open positions.The Hire Veteran Health Heroes Act of 2021 directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to create a program that will help actively recruit medical personnel, who are within one year of completing their military service, to remain in federal health care in departments like Veterans Affairs. Representatives Robert E. Latta (OH-05) and Kathleen M. Rice (NY-04) introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.“The VA Inspector General has reported that staff shortages are a challenge for solving problems in Veteran care. This bill will empower the VA to proactively recruit active duty medical personnel who are separating from the military at the conclusion of their contract or at retirement to improve health care services for Veterans,” said Senator Braun.“This commonsense, bipartisan bill will help address two critical issues: It will expand opportunities to recruit VA health care providers, as well as help increase veteran employment by recruiting newly separated veterans to work in VA Medical Centers,” Senator Hassan said. “I will continue to advocate for innovative solutions like these in order to support our veterans’ health and job opportunities.”“During my time in Congress, I have worked to make sure veterans are provided with the resources they need to successfully reintegrate into civilian life,” said Congressman Latta. “I’m honored to join my colleagues in the Senate to reintroduce the bipartisan Hire Veteran Health Heroes Act, which will make it easier for veterans to use the skills they learned in the service to help other veterans.  At the same time, the VA will benefit from employing qualified and hardworking professionals who have already proven their love and dedication to this nation.  Moving this legislation should be a no-brainer.”“The Hire Veteran Health Heroes Act will help the VA finally fill lingering employment vacancies and provide veterans with quality job opportunities after completing their military service,” said Rep. Kathleen Rice. “I’m proud to co-lead this bipartisan legislation with Representative Latta, and I thank Senators Braun and Hassan for leading it in the Senate. We must work to push this common-sense bill through both chambers of Congress and get it signed into law.” BACKGROUNDIn November 2019, the VA Inspector General stated that staff shortages are a root cause of many of the problems in Veterans’ care. The Department of Defense has robust medical departments in the Army, Navy, and Air Force totaling 111,462 Active Duty and 67,951 Reserve personnel in 2020. All or part of the medical education and training has been paid for by the Federal government. Their Military Occupation Specialties (MOSs) span the full spectrum of the medical professions from primary care physicians, to neurosurgeons, nurse practitioners, health care administrators, physical therapists, pharmacists, radiology technicians, medical logistician, biomedical maintenance, etc. All of these medical specialties can be utilized in the VHA, and their knowledge of the new electronic health record will also be invaluable. Currently, an average of 13,000 active duty medical department members separate from the military each year at the end of enlistments/contracts or through retirement. There is no formal program in place to actively recruit them to remain in federal health care in departments like Veterans Affairs (VA). We feel this must change. Read the full bill text.Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "

https://www.braun.senate.gov/bill-benefit-als-patients-signed-law,"WASHINGTON – Today, a bill introduced by Senator Mike Braun, Senator Tom Cotton, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, and Senator Chris Coons to help ALS patients was signed into law by President Biden. The bill is a technical clarification that will ensure ALS patients are given access to their Social Security Disability Insurance benefits without a five month waiting period whether they applied prior to the passage of the ALS Social Security Disability Insurance Act or not. The ALS Social Security Disability Insurance Access Act was introduced by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Senator Tom Cotton and signed into law in December. This law eliminated the five-month waiting period for Social Security disability benefits for those with medically-diagnosed ALS, because due to the quick and devastating effects of the disease many of those diagnosed do not have five months to wait. Due to how the Social Security Administration interpreted this law, ALS patients who had already applied for their disability benefits were still being forced to wait the five months. Senators Braun, Cotton, Whitehouse, and Coons introduced a bill to clarify how that part of the law is to be applied: all Americans with medically-diagnosed ALS should be able to access their Social Security Disability benefits without the five month waiting period - not just those who haven’t applied yet. That bill was signed into law today. ""The financial burden of ALS is staggering, and those who are diagnosed have no time to waste,"" said Senator Braun. ""With this technical fix which is now signed into law we will ensure timely access to Social Security disability benefits is available to ALS patients and the ALS Social Security Disability Insurance Access Act fulfills its promise to help those fighting this terrible disease."" “I’m glad President Biden signed our bill to further increase the number of ALS patients who can immediately receive the disability benefits they are entitled to.  ALS is a terrible disease that takes so much from a person and places a lot of stress on caretakers.  This change to the law will make the diagnosis a little bit easier for patients and their families.  Senators Braun and Coons have done a lot for ALS patients through the Senate ALS Caucus, and I was proud to work with them on this effort.” – Senator Whitehouse“Americans suffering from ALS shouldn’t have to wait for assistance, especially given their tragically short life expectancy,” said Cotton. “Congress was able to quickly fix the ALS Social Security Disability Insurance Access Act to ensure support is available for all ALS patients—including those who applied for disability benefits before our bill was signed into law last year. I hope the Social Security Administration will implement these changes immediately.”“With this technical fix to the law, we’ll finally ensure that ALS patients get the timely financial support they need,” said Senator Coons. “Speedy access to support programs like SSDI after a diagnosis is essential for patients and their families – and one of the priorities we set when we first launched the bipartisan ALS Caucus last year. We must continue to improve the law to make life easier for ALS patients and their loved ones.”ABOUT ALS:Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a neurodegenerative disease affecting the ability of the brain to control muscle movements. Individuals with ALS progressively lose the ability to speak, walk, and breathe.  There is no effective treatment for the disease, no known cause, and—currently—no cure.ABOUT THE SENATE ALS CAUCUS:The Senate ALS Caucus founded in January 2020 by Senators Chris Coons, D-Delaware, and Mike Braun, R-Indiana. The Caucus brings together senators from both sides of the aisle who share a commitment to working collaboratively to advocate on behalf of ALS patients and their families to: raise awareness about the difficulties faced by ALS patients and their families; advance policies that improve the quality of life for ALS patients; expand the network of support for those suffering from ALS; and advocate for investments in research that will enhance our understanding of the causes of ALS, identify effective treatments, and eventually discover a cure. # # #Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "
https://www.braun.senate.gov/indystar-sen-mike-braun-federal-government-should-not-reform-local-police-departments,"https://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/2021/05/13/sen-mike-braun-tim-scott-justice-act-police-reform-bill/5064416001/Over the past year I have spent many hours listening to law enforcement officers and police groups, and as discussions of policing reform continue to dominate the news and threaten to upend the policing profession and the protections afforded to those who wear the badge, two things are very clear to me: No one does a more difficult job than our nation’s law enforcement, and the federal government is not where these discussions should be taking place.Last year, I signed on to U.S. Sen. Tim Scott’s JUSTICE Act, a reform bill that had the support of many national and state law enforcement groups.In June of last year, as violent riots broke out in our cities, Senate Democrats used the filibuster to kill that bill so they could exploit this issue for political gain at the ballot box in November.Last year, the United States had a strongly pro-police administration in the White House. The dynamic of the debate in Washington has changed drastically in a year.And now, those same Senate Democrats have returned to the negotiating table under threat of eliminating the filibuster that they used to shut down Republicans’ good faith efforts last year. Though top Democrats in Congress have tried to replace the radical left’s rallying cry of “Defund the police” with bureaucratic baloney as much as they can – likely after discovering the vast majority of Americans know that defunding our police is as foolish as it sounds – their end goal is the same: to divert funds away from police, make our communities less safe and demonize those who protect and serve.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer last year blocked a resolution in opposition to defunding the police. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has spoken of “rebalancing” police budgets and directing funds away from law enforcement and into other priorities.Vice President Kamala Harris has called for diverting police funds away from departments and “reimagining” police departments across the country.What’s the difference between “defunding the police” and “rebalancing” and “reimagining” their budgets to include less resources for enforcing laws? Nothing but rhetoric.No one wants to improve policing in this country more than law enforcement, and yet, in these negotiations, Democrats have continued to make sticking points out of issues law enforcement groups have deemed nonstarters.While law enforcement has resoundingly rejected calls to modify or end qualified immunity, Democrats have continued to push for ending this protection. I oppose any reform to the current doctrine of qualified immunity, which I believe extends critical protections for law enforcement officers who are forced to act in split-second scenarios when lives are on the line.Any federal reform package that cannot garner the support of law enforcement is not the right solution to me, and considering that 12,000 of America’s 18,000 police agencies are local departments, it raises the question why the federal government is the venue for these negotiations at all.Because Republicans came to the table in good faith in 2020 with solutions and were rejected by Democrats whose end goal is the dissolution of law enforcement as we know it, I do not believe the federal government should be the source of reform measures for police departments. Indiana on this issue has it right. In April of this year, Indiana’s state government unanimously passed a police bill that was signed into law by Gov. Eric Holcomb.Rather than foolishly defunding the police or punishing all cops for the misconduct of a tiny handful of officers, Indiana’s law focused on empowering the Indiana Law Enforcement Training Board to decertify officers who are found to have abused their power and provided funds for repairs and updates to the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy’s training facility.Indiana’s law includes de-escalation training requirements, prohibits chokeholds under certain circumstances, criminalizes an officer turning off their body camera to conceal criminal behavior, requires that police agencies request an officer’s employment record during the hiring process, and most importantly, earned the support of our state Fraternal Order of Police, the Indiana Association of Chiefs of Police, and the Indiana Sheriff’s Association.That’s the kind of reform that works best: the kind that's designed with the officers who serve our communities engaged and negotiated by local representatives who are most accountable to the communities these decisions will impact. Federal reform that cannot garner the support of law enforcement will be ineffective and put us further down the path toward defunding the police that has already jeopardized those who protect and serve our communities so much.Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "
https://www.braun.senate.gov/senator-mike-braun-reintroduces-promising-pathway-act-ppa-accelerated-drug-approval-prescription,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Mike Braun reintroduced two bills that will help get treatments to American patients more efficiently: The Accelerated Drug Approval for Prescription Therapies (ADAPT) Act and the Promising Pathway Act (PPA).“Americans are clamoring for real solutions on healthcare. These two solutions were inspired by the lessons I learned in the real world by taking on the healthcare industry in my company and the stories I’ve heard from Hoosiers struggling with rising costs and dwindling options. The ADAPT Act will create a much needed expedited drug approval process at the FDA, and is a better solution that will help solve this problem and increase market competition between drugs on the marketplace, without compromising safety. The Promising Pathway Act will help patients with rare and life-threatening diseases get meaningful treatments that they simply don’t have time to wait for.”  – Senator Mike Braun  BACKGROUNDThe Accelerated Drug Approval for Prescription Therapies (ADAPT) Act: this bill would amend the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to create an accelerated approval pathway to act as a “passing lane” for prescription drugs that have already been approved for sale in other developed countries like the U.K. and Canada, with a history of safe and effective clinical trial data. ADAPT Act adds a layer of FDA review that would focus on quality control, supply chain safety, and manufacturing processes in order to drive down prices through increased competition. This approval pathway would also cut down on a long list of drug shortages, allowing American patients more rapid access to meaningful treatments already sold in other developed countries that are proven to work. Promising Pathway Act (PPA): this bill would expedite beneficial outcomes for patients by requiring the FDA to establish a rolling, real-time, priority review pathway for drugs intended to treat, prevent, or diagnose serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. Under this pathway, FDA would grant time-limited, provisional approval to drugs that demonstrate substantial evidence of safety, and relevant, early evidence of efficacy. Drug sponsors would be allowed to incorporate scientifically-substantiated surrogate endpoints and real-world data to demonstrate the efficacy of the drugs under review. The period of provisional approval is time-limited and effective for a two-year period. Drug sponsors may request provisional approval status renewal for subsequent two-year periods (up to a total of six years) and can apply for full approval at any time. PPA would require patient registries for all provisionally approved drugs to track patient usage until the drug is fully approved. The FDA would review the drug and renew provisional approval status based on real world data collected in the patient registries—which track patient usage of provisionally approved drugs—until the drug receives full approval or provisional approval expires. Under this provisional approval pathway, those with rapidly-progressing terminal illnesses would have access to drugs that provide their only hope for treatment, and real world data collected from these patients would be incorporated into the drug approval process. Click here to watch Senator Braun’s floor speech on Promising Pathway Act.Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "

https://www.braun.senate.gov/braun-reintroduces-healthcare-transparency-bills,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Mike Braun has reintroduced his Drug Price Transparency Act and Health Care PRICE Transparency Act. “As one of the leading voices on Capitol Hill for healthcare reform, I am proud to put forth much needed solutions to address rising prices and access challenges in several sectors of the health care industry,” said U.S. Senator Mike Braun. “These solutions will bring transparency to the healthcare system and in turn create more competition and drive down health care costs for Americans. Knowing the cost of health care will empower Americans to shop for the services best suited to their needs.BACKGROUND:Drug Price Transparency ActPharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) act as middlemen between drug manufacturers and patients to administer prescription drug benefits and negotiate price concessions (or rebates). The current system allows for PBMs and insurers to retain rebates that should be passed along to patients. PBMs are pocketing an undisclosed portion of rebates, causing drug manufactures to raise prices to account for PBMs’ growing rebate retention. These misaligned industry incentives and opaque pricing maneuvers implemented by PMBs force patients to shoulder the burden of increasing drug prices.  This legislation would require insurers and PBMs to pass rebates directly to consumers enrolled in commercial health plans and Medicare Part D, which incorporates HHS’s Rebate Rule, finalized last year. This legislation would establish two new requirements to qualify for safe harbor for rebates: one for rebates which are passed on to patients at the point of sale, and the other for flat service fee payments made to PBMs, which cannot be tied to the list price of drugs. The intent of this legislation is to pass rebates directly to patients, which will allow drug manufacturers to lower list prices. This legislation would lower out-of-pocket payments for patients, lower prescription drug list prices, and increase drug price transparency.Health Care PRICE Transparency ActHospitals and insurers have long taken advantage of the health care industry’s misaligned incentives that promote opaque pricing maneuvers over transparency to increase their profits at the expense of Americans. Increased price transparency would empower patients to make informed decisions to choose the health care that is best for them, as well as increase competition among all hospitals, group health plans, and insurance issuers in the individual and group markets to lower the cost and improve the quality of health care services.  The Health Care PRICE Transparency Act would codify two U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) final rules, Hospital Price Transparency and Transparency in Coverage. The Hospital Price Transparency rule would require hospitals to disclose standard charges, the cost of an item or service set by the hospital, for a total of 300 shoppable services.  In order for a hospital to participate in Medicare, it must establish and maintain an internet-based price estimator, free of charge and without subscription. This tool would allow health care consumers to receive an estimate of the costs they will be responsible for paying to a hospital for a shoppable service. Under this legislation, hospitals that fail to comply with price transparency requirements will be penalized $300 per day, until the violation is resolved.Additionally, this legislation would codify HHS’s Transparency in Coverage rule, which requires insurers to provide consumers with real-time, personalized access to cost-sharing information in order to shop and compare costs between specific providers, before receiving care. This legislation would require health plans seeking certification as qualified health plans to disclose in-network provider rates, out-of-network allowed amounts and billed charges, negotiated rates, and historical net prices for a covered prescription drug. Additionally, insurers would be required to establish and maintain an internet-based self-service tool to provide information to an individual, free of charge and without subscription, to allow individuals to search for cost-sharing information by a specific in-network provider or by all in-network providers, as well as an out-of-network allowed amount.  It would also allows individuals to refine and reorder search results based on geographic proximity of in-network providers and the amount of the individual’s cost-sharing liability for a covered item or service.# # #Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "
https://www.braun.senate.gov/consider-teachers-act-passes-senate,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Consider Teachers Act, a bill introduced in the Senate by Senator Mike Braun, Senator Kyrsten Sinema, and in the House by Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton aimed at fixing a broken system burdening teachers with unfair loans, has passed the U.S. Senate.The TEACH Grant program provides grant assistance to students who serve four years as a full time teacher in high-need, often underserved communities. However, often due to basic clerical mistakes, thousands of teachers have found their grants converted into loans that must be paid back with interest. The Consider Teachers Act aims to fix this broken system permanently, and provides extra time for teachers to complete service requirements due to the coronavirus pandemic.""The TEACH grant is an important program to incentivize teachers to serve in neglected communities, but 12 years of poor government management has turned these grants into groans for thousands of teachers,"" said Senator Mike Braun. ""This bill passing the Senate shows our appreciation for America's great teachers, and now I hope the House of Representatives will act to fix this broken system once and for all."" “Arizona teachers receiving TEACH grants serve in low-income schools, helping Arizona students access quality educations across our state. The government made a promise to these teachers—and our commonsense, bipartisan bill ensures the government honors its obligation and protects our teachers from surprise bills,” said Senator Kyrsten Sinema. “I am pleased to join Senators Braun and Sinema in introducing the Consider Teachers Act of 2021, which will reform the Teach Grant program that is unfairly converting many teachers' grants to loans. Currently, many teachers are finding their grants converted to loan debt because of small administrative errors that might be unavoidable due to the coronavirus crisis. This bill will correct the administrative process and extend the period teachers have to fulfill their service requirements by three years for those who were affected by the coronavirus crisis,” said Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton.BACKGROUND: 

In 2007, the federal government created the TEACH Grant, providing grant assistance to students who serve four years as a full time teacher in a high-need field. Under program terms, if service requirements are not met, grants are converted into loan obligations. While the program was well- intentioned, poor program administration has resulted in teachers unfairly having grant dollars converted into loans—prompting many to refer to the converted grants as “groans.” The Consider Teachers Act addresses these challenges that are thwarting the program’s intent.

According to the Office of Management and Budget, the majority of TEACH Grants, 66%, are converted into Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans which must be paid back with interest. Previously, once converted, a loan cannot revert back to grant. 21,000 teachers have completed the program without a conversion, but 94,000 recipients have had their grants converted to loans. Small paperwork issues often triggered the conversions. For example, if teachers sent in their annual form one day late, or had other problems, such as a missing date or signature, the grant was converted.# # #Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "

The bill has broad, bipartisan support from 42 Senators and over 70 agricultural and environmental organizations. Today, the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry will consider advancing the legislation at a business meeting.QUOTES IN SUPPORT OF THE GROWING CLIMATE SOLUTIONS ACT:“Iowa’s hardworking farmers continue to lead the way on conservation, and they’ve already made tremendous strides in practicing responsible stewardship of their land and farm while promoting a clean environment,” said Senator Ernst, ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy. “Carbon credit markets provide our ag community with an avenue to capitalize on their ongoing commitment to sustainable farming, and it’s critical that we dissolve any obstacles standing in the way of this untapped potential. That’s why I’m proud to support this bipartisan effort to reduce barriers for Iowa farmers looking to enter carbon credit markets and adopt climate-smart conservation practices.”“Climate change is among our most pressing global challenges, and our farmers and foresters can play a critical role in our response,” said Senator Chris Coons, co-chair of the Senate Climate Solutions Caucus. “The Growing Climate Solutions Act is an example of how we can bring everyone to the table to find common ground on solutions that will protect our environment and combat climate change. I look forward to working with Senators Braun, Stabenow, and my colleagues to advance it into law.”“I am proud to join my colleagues in introducing this common-sense bipartisan proposal, which will inform farmers, ranchers, and foresters how to navigate around the barriers-to-entry that have historically prevented them from accessing voluntary environmental mitigation credit markets,” Senator Marco Rubio said. “This common-sense proposal will assist agriculture stakeholders in identifying alternative sources of income, while at the same time empowering them to pursue efforts to restore ecosystems including wetlands and forests, mitigate environmental impacts, and improve water quality. As a member of the Climate Solutions Caucus, I look forward to working with caucus co-chair, Senator Braun, to advance this legislation.”“Time and again I hear from farmers across Colorado concerned that climate change is going to make it more difficult for them to pass down their operations to the next generation,” said Senator Michael Bennet. “We must tackle the climate challenge, in part by ensuring that farmers, ranchers, and foresters have the opportunity to be a part of the solution. The Growing Climate Solutions Act is an important step toward that goal and I look forward with working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get this across the finish line.”“Foresters, farmers, and ranchers are good stewards of our farm and timberlands, already possessing the skills and characteristics to help the environment on which their livelihoods depend.  This legislation represents a solid plan to give them access to carbon credit markets and benefit economically from their good work,” Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith said. “We have very strong voluntary participation in existing federal conservation programs in Mississippi.  Our strong agriculture sector and forests make improving access to the carbon credit markets a smart move.”“The agricultural community has a vital role to play in addressing climate change. By increasing access to the voluntary carbon credit market, our legislation will help reduce confusion and improve information for farmers and ranchers looking to implement practices that capture carbon, reduce emissions, improve soil health, and empower them in their stewardship of the land. I’m proud to join my colleagues in this effort and look forward to our continued work on the Bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus,"" said Senator Mitt Romney.“The Growing Climate Solutions Act will help Hoosier farmers navigate the emerging activity in carbon markets.  This bill prioritizes the needs of agriculture in climate efforts, and I’m glad to partner with my colleague from Indiana in supporting both our rural communities and the environment,” said Senator Todd Young.“The Growing Climate Solutions Act is a meaningful step toward accomplishing the often-contentious goal of preserving and maintaining our natural environment without relying on heavy-handed federal mandates.  Idaho is a national leader in the use of clean, renewable power, and this legislation allows Idaho’s farmers and forest land owners to more easily access private, voluntary carbon markets and be rewarded for climate-smart practices.  I continue to support policies like this that protect ecological health, facilitate sustainable and multiple use of our public lands, and incentivize the proper stewardship of private property,"" said Senator Mike Crapo.“We believe that farmers, ranchers, and producers are the mainstay of the agriculture industry and play an essential role in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions,” said John R. Tyson, Chief Sustainability Officer at Tyson Foods. “The Growing Climate Solutions Act of 2021 is a great move in the right direction, and we commend the bipartisan work to address climate change”.""Expanding the natural carbon sequestration potential of America's agricultural sector represents one of the best opportunities for real climate action.

Sheep grazing and wool production sequester carbon, manage vegetation, improve wildlife habitat and enhance rangeland systems. The Growing Climate Solutions Act provides a framework to recognize our producers’ efforts, while reducing barriers for them to participate in new and innovative markets. We greatly apprecaite the bipartisan approach and the broad support that Senators Stabenow and Braun have been able to get behind this initiative,” said Susan Shultz, President of the American Sheep Industry Association“America’s sugar farmers are dedicated to advancing climate-smart policies and support efforts to dismantle technical barriers that impede the ability for farmers to voluntarily participate in carbon markets. The bipartisan Growing Climate Solutions Act is an important step forward and the American Sugar Alliance applauds its reintroduction. We appreciate Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) for their work with Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.) to improve this legislation and ensure it helps rural America further achieve its climate goals. A number of farmer-friendly changes have been added to the Growing Climate Solutions Act to achieve funding needs without reopening the Farm Bill or otherwise affecting the existing funding of farm and conservation programs. Importantly, this legislation has already garnered support from a bipartisan group of senators who represent a broad cross-section of American agriculture,” said the American Sugar Alliance“This legislation is at the heart of everything we fight for at BIO and proves that climate action and economic growth can go hand in hand. By helping our agricultural producers solve the technical entry barriers to carbon markets, this bill will encourage farmers and ranchers to use biotechnology breakthroughs to reduce emissions and deploy their land in the fight against climate change. It will bring greater value to the biobased economy by allowing the manufacturers of biobased chemicals, plastics, food, animal feed, and everyday materials, to reliably demonstrate their true environmental benefit, from farm to consumer. Because of the significant positive impact the legislation will have for American farmers, rural economies, and our planet, BIO supports and applauds Senators Mike Braun (R-IN) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) for their leadership in introducing the bipartisan Growing Climate Solutions Act,” said Dr. Michelle McMurry-Heath, President and CEO of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization“BPC Action commends Sen.

The Growing Climate Solutions Act is an area of great potential, carbon sequestration of land through farming and other land management practices. The Act provides greater opportunities for farmers and foresters to participate in carbon markets. Like many other faith communities, my own Amish and Mennonite community has long connected our relationship with the land with our relationship with God, for God placed humans in the garden to ""till and keep it."" (Genesis 2:15) Another translation of the Hebrew could be ""serve and protect."" This act can move us towards restorative and proactive practices that more fully engage and heal our land, divine, and human relationships,” said Rev. Douglas Kaufman, Director of Pastoral Ecology at the Center for Sustainable Climate Solutions""We are pleased Chairwoman Stabenow and Senator Braun have reintroduced the Growing Climate Solutions Act, and we appreciate the Senate Agriculture Committee's leadership on this issue. America's farmers and ranchers bear an outsize burden of the impacts of climate change, but they can also play an important role in addressing America's greenhouse gas emissions. This bill is an important step to giving farmers, ranchers and foresters new tools to address climate. Citizens' Climate Lobby applauds quick action on this legislation,"" said Ben Pendergrass, Senior Director of Government Affairs at the Citizens Climate Lobby“When our farmers, ranchers, and foresters go the extra mile to help reduce America’s carbon footprint, they should be rewarded, not penalized. The Growing Climate Solutions Act is exciting because it would allow valuable carbon credits to be harvested along with any crops farmed using climate-friendly practices. By normalizing how those credits can be sold on voluntary carbon credit markets, the GCSA also makes it easy for farms of all shapes and sizes to connect with and sell these credits to the scores of American companies and utilities that have committed to going carbon neutral but can’t do it alone. CRES commends Senators Braun, Stabenow, Graham and Whitehouse for their continued leadership on this legislation and for prioritizing commonsense clean energy and climate policy. The support for this legislation by a large, bipartisan group of senators—especially those hailing from the Midwest and across the Heartland—is a testament to the positive impact this bill will have on the men and women who give so much to feed, fuel and clothe us all,” said Heather Reams, Executive Director of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions“This legislation is the latest example of the growing bipartisan collaboration in Congress on climate. The surest way to make lasting progress on climate change is for both parties to come together and develop solutions that work for the American people. The GCSA offers a promising approach to partner with farmers and ranchers to reduce agricultural emissions,” said Greg Bertelsen, CEO of the Climate Leadership Council“The Growing Climate Solutions Act is an important step in encouraging farmer and forest landowner participation in carbon markets. Having USDA enhance the legitimacy and transparency of carbon credits will improve and expand market participation, thereby providing a strong economic incentive for land use practices that contribute to efforts to address climate change.  ConservAmerica applauds lead sponsors Senators Mike Braun, Debbie Stabenow, Lindsey Graham, and Sheldon Whitehouse and their staffs for their hard work on this legislation, and we urge its swift passage,"" said Jeff Kupfer, President of ConservAmerica""Responsible stewardship of the land is a tradition that has been handed down through generations of American farmers. This important bill creates a system to further incentivize that tradition, helping farmers and forest landowners deliver on their promise for their children and grandchildren,"" said John Bode, President and CEO of Corn Refiners Association“Corteva Agriscience supports the Growing Climate Solutions Act, and we look forward to working with the Senate Agriculture Committee to advance this bill and similar proposals that are designed to support farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners in voluntary efforts to expand – and derive income from – climate smart practices,” said Anne Alonzo, Senior Vice President of External Affairs and Chief Sustainability Officer at Corteva Agriscience“The Growing Climate Solutions Act gives farmers and landowners the tools to improve their land and profitability, while benefiting habitat for waterfowl and other wildlife. We thank Sen. Stabenow, Sen. Boozman and Sen. Braun for their leadership in spearheading this bipartisan legislation, and we look forward to additional scientific, voluntary and incentive-based proposals to guide our federal climate policy,” said Ducks Unlimited CEO Adam Putnam.“The Ecosystem Services Market Consortium (ESMC) applauds the reintroduction of the Growing Climate Solutions Act. If passed, it will help farmers and ranchers better access voluntary ecosystem services markets that incentivize beneficial environmental outcomes for society and provide additional revenue streams for agricultural producers. Ecosystem services markets are an important tool in the fight against climate change and we hope the Growing Climate Solutions Act will help scale their use in agriculture to help the U.S. meet its global climate commitments. ESMC thanks Sens. Stabenow, Braun, and Boozman, as well as their staffs, for their tireless efforts to craft this legislation, which is an important, bipartisan step in the right direction,” said Debbie Reed, Executive Director of the Ecosystem Services Market Consortium (ESMC)“Since the earliest biblical record (Genesis 2:15), Christians have been called to tend and care for God’s creation. Many of our nation’s farmers are practicing Christians who believe in this biblical calling but have found it difficult with falling incomes and low crop prices. The Growing Climate Solutions Act provides a way for the agriculture community–especially family farms–to increase income, enrich soil, sequester carbon, and empower American farmers as part of the climate solution. The Growing Climate Solutions Act establishes a Verifier Certification Program providing a uniform carbon measuring method that ensures farmers a fair price and an accountable carbon markets,” said Rev. Mitch Hescox, President of the Evangelical Environmental Network“Climate change directly impacts the farmers, ranchers and forest owners who rely on a healthy environment to produce food and forest products. The Growing Climate Solutions Act would ensure agricultural producers and forest owners of all sizes looking to enter the carbon market for the first time have access to reliable information, qualified technical service providers and third-party verifiers. In addition, the bill establishes a robust USDA advisory council composed of farmers, scientists and other climate stakeholders. FACA would like to recognize Chairwoman Stabenow and Ranking Member Boozman for their work together to ensure producer representation on the advisory council,” said the Food and Agriculture Climate Alliance “Today, on Earth Day, we applaud Senators Stabenow, Braun, Graham, and Whitehouse and the broad and bipartisan list of co-sponsors for their leadership on the Growing Climate Solutions Act. Our ag communities are already eager to play a large role in reducing emissions nationwide and soil carbon sequestration expands this participation in our nation’s climate change strategy. The Growing Climate Solutions Act rightly rewards farmers for climate-smart practices and provides important guidelines for success,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor""We applaud Ag Committee leaders Senators Stabenow, Braun and Boozman on the release of the Growing Climate Solutions Act, an important step in helping farmers participate in maturing agricultural carbon markets. The GCSA can strengthen the existing voluntary carbon market by providing a USDA stamp of approval on high quality greenhouse gas (GHG) credit programs that provide incentives to farmers to participate in these markets. We look forward to advancing solutions alongside Congress for climate-smart agriculture to deliver on its potential and value for farmers, buyers, and the planet,” said Chris Harbourt, Global Head of Indigo Carbon.“When governments invest in farmers, our communities and environment thrive. State department of agriculture leaders understand the central role agriculture serves in building climate resiliency and preserving our shared natural resources. NASDA is proud to support the Growing Climate Solutions Act, as it acknowledges and invests producers’ contribution to environmental sustainability and unites the industry around climate goals,” said Dr. Barb Glenn, CEO of the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture“Climate change is an all-hands-on-deck crisis, and our working lands are critical to warding off the worst effects of a warming planet. This bill will help provide a better future for both people and wildlife by opening up opportunities for farmers, foresters, and ranchers to reduce emissions and increase revenues, while also improving the places that birds need to survive. While the fight against climate change will require the broad participation of all sectors, agricultural stewards are a critical part of the solution. The people who know the land best are the people that work it every day, and this bill presents sensible and bipartisan solutions to ensure a cleaner environment for us all,” said Sarah Greenberger, Senior Vice President for Conservation Policy of the National Audubon Society“Corn farmers have been leaders in adopting conservation practices to improve the quality of soil, water, and air around our farms.  We are pleased to endorse the Growing Climate Solutions Act which would lay the groundwork for private agriculture carbon markets by authorizing USDA to certify credit verification services. This bipartisan effort recognizes agriculture’s role in combating climate change. NCGA thanks the Senators for their leadership and looks forward to working together to implement policy that benefits both the environment and farmers’ bottom line,” said John Linder, President of the National Corn Growers Association.“The U.S. cotton industry fully supports this legislation which will direct USDA to provide producers with reliable information and remove technical barriers to participating in private carbon credit markets,” said Kent Fountain, Chairman of the National Cotton Council Chairman“The Growing Climate Solutions Act is a critical step to breaking down barriers and providing certainty to farmer co-op members and other producers who want to participate in carbon markets. I would like to thank Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) for their leadership in reintroducing the bill with broad bipartisan support. If farmers are to be part of solving climate challenges they need to rely on proven science, accurate data and standardization to help us get there—this bill is an important step in that direction,” said Chuck Conner, President and CEO of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives“Recognizing the potential of climate-smart agriculture, a patchwork of carbon markets has sprung up to incentivize and reward such practices. However, there is currently no formal oversight of these markets or uniformity among them for criteria, payment rates, or measurement, which can make selecting the right one a confusing and overwhelming process. By creating a certification program, the Growing Climate Solutions Act would bring much-needed clarity and certainty to this burgeoning sector, thus making it easier for farmers to obtain the financial resources they need to invest in climate solutions. We welcome and support this important initiative and will continue working with the committee to leverage agriculture in our fight against the climate crisis,” said Rob Larew, President of the National Farmers Union“Climate and New Ag is one of the most important issues that this Congress is addressing.  Growing Climate Solution Act is a major step towards providing farmers, and those who are considering growing hemp as America’s new natural resource and commodity crop, more reason to do so”, said Geoff Whaling, Chair of the National Hemp Association“We commend Chairwoman Stabenow and Senator Braun for continuing their bipartisan leadership on the Growing Climate Solutions Act, which would encourage greater farmer participation in environmental markets. This legislation will enhance the proactive, sustainable initiatives dairy farmers are expanding as our sector strives to achieve carbon neutrality,” said Jim Mulhern, President and CEO of the National Milk Producers Federation“As stewards of the land, U.S. potato growers are committed to advancing environmentally sustainable solutions that reduce the industry’s carbon footprint.

https://www.braun.senate.gov/growing-climate-solutions-act-reintroduced-0,"Growing Climate Solutions Act reintroducedWASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Mike Braun (R-IN), Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) reintroduced the bipartisan Growing Climate Solutions Act, which will break down barriers for farmers and foresters interested in participating in carbon markets so they can be rewarded for climate-smart practices. The bill has broad, bipartisan support from over 60 leading agricultural and environmental organizations.Cosponsoring the Growing Climate Solutions Act are Ranking Member John Boozman (R-AR), and Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Susan Collins (R-ME), Chris Coons (D-DE), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Angus King (I-ME), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), John Thune (R-SD), Todd Young (R-IN), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), John Hoeven (R-ND), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Tom Carper (D-DE), Ron Wyden (R-OR), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY).“As a Main Street entrepreneur and conservationist, I know firsthand that if we want to address our changing climate then we need to facilitate real solutions that our farmers, environmentalists, and industry can all support, which this bill accomplishes by breaking down barriers for farmers and foresters interested in participating in carbon markets so they can be rewarded for climate-smart practices,” said Senator Braun.“Addressing the climate crisis is one of the most urgent challenges we face and our farmers and foresters are an important part of the solution,” said Senator Stabenow, Chairwoman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. “The bipartisan Growing Climate Solutions Act is a win-win for farmers, our economy and for our environment. Our bill is a perfect example of how we can work across the aisle and find common ground to address a critical issue affecting all of us and our future.”“As Americans, we have the ability to come up with climate solutions that can benefit our economy and our way of life,” said Senator Graham. “The United States has long been a leader in innovation. This legislation is an opportunity to put our knowledge and can-do spirit to work to promote business opportunities for the agriculture industry while promoting the protection of our environment.”“Farmers and foresters are seeing firsthand the effects of climate change on their livelihoods, and I’m glad to have them at the table working on solutions,” said Senator Whitehouse.  “We will need nature-based solutions like the ones this bill seeks to incentivize in order to rapidly get to net zero emissions, as science tells us we must.”“I appreciate the collaborative approach Chairwoman Stabenow and Senator Braun took in developing this bill. As a result of their hard work and their openness to input, the Growing Climate Solutions Act is poised to help our farmers, ranchers and private forest landowners benefit from becoming a greater part of our climate solution. American agriculture has already made great strides in reducing its environmental footprint while growing even more efficient. The Growing Climate Solutions Act will help empower farmers, ranchers and private forest landowners to build on that progress in a manner that rewards them for their efforts,” Senator Boozman said.“AFBF welcomes the introduction of the Growing Climate Solutions Act, which builds on the strong foundation of environmental stewardship in American agriculture by providing more clarity and guidance for farmers and ranchers as they explore or expand participation in carbon markets. This bill is evidence lawmakers can come together in a bipartisan manner to find solutions to environmental challenges while respecting the role of farmers and ranchers as they feed families around the globe. I commend Sens. Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Braun (R-Ind.) for working with Ranking Member Boozman (R-Ark.) to introduce an improved Growing Climate Solutions Act,” said Zippy Duvall, President of the American Farm Bureau Federation.“The Growing Climate Solutions Act is the first major piece of bipartisan legislation to help ensure farmers, ranchers and foresters benefit from reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and building climate resilience. Agriculture has a great opportunity to measurably contribute to climate solutions, from cutting emissions of nitrous oxide, methane and carbon dioxide, to storing carbon. EDF commends the bill’s co-sponsors for seeing this potential and paving the way for farmers to be part of the solution,” said Elizabeth Gore, Senior Vice President of Political Affairs at Environmental Defense Fund.“Passage of the Growing Climate Solutions Act would be a big win for agriculture, conservation and the climate. Farmers, ranchers and forest landowners are critical to helping combat climate change, but they need a straightforward way to tap revenue streams for implementing climate-friendly practices. This bill would help ensure producers are recognized and rewarded for the role they play. We are grateful to the sponsors for working across the aisle to support natural climate solutions and address the climate challenge,” said Lynn Scarlett, Chief External Affairs Officer, The Nature Conservancy.“Farmers, at their core, are businessmen, but they are also conservationists and they are also environmentalists.

These issues – including access to reliable information about markets and access to qualified technical assistance providers and credit protocol verifiers – have limited both landowner participation and the adoption of practices that help reduce the costs of developing carbon credits. To address this, bill establishes a Greenhouse Gas Technical Assistance Provider and Third-Party Verifier Certification Program through which USDA will be able to provide transparency, legitimacy, and informal endorsement of third-party verifiers and technical service providers that help private landowners generate carbon credits through a variety of agriculture and forestry related practices. The USDA certification program will ensure that these assistance providers have agriculture and forestry expertise, which is lacking in the current marketplace. As part of the program, USDA will administer a new website, which will serve as a “one stop shop” of information and resources for producers and foresters who are interested in participating in carbon markets.Through the program, USDA will help connect landowners to private sector actors who can assist the landowners in implementing the protocols and monetizing the climate value of their sustainable practices. Third party entities, certified under the program, will be able to claim the status of a “USDA Certified” technical assistance provider or verifier. The USDA certification lowers barriers to entry in the credit markets by reducing confusion and improving information for farmers looking to implement practices that capture carbon, reduce emissions, improve soil health, and make operations more sustainable.Today, many third-party groups are developing protocols and testing methods to calculate emissions reduction and sequestration in agriculture and forestry. The landscape is evolving rapidly. The Growing Climate Solutions Act recognizes this fact and provides the Secretary with a robust advisory council composed of agriculture experts, scientists, producers, and others. The advisory council shall advise the Secretary and ensure that the certification program remains relevant, credible, and responsive to the needs of farmers, forest landowners, and carbon market participants alike.Finally, the bill instructs USDA to produce a report to Congress to advise about the further development of this policy area including: barriers to market entry, challenges raised by farmers and forest landowners, market performance, and suggestions on where USDA can make a positive contribution to the further adoption of voluntary carbon sequestration practices in agriculture and forestry.###Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "

https://www.braun.senate.gov/senators-braun-daines-lankfords-amendment-outlaw-animal-human-hybrids-receives-vote-senate-floor,"WASHINGTON – Senator Mike Braun, Senator Steve Daines, and Senator James Lankford's amendment to the Endless Frontier Act that would make it a crime to engage in chimera research, or the creation of animal-human hybrid organisms, received a vote on the Senate floor tonight. Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey introduced the original legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.A chimera is an organism that contains cells from two distinct species, such as an animal-human hybrid created in a laboratory setting. In recent years, research programs involving chimeric organisms have become more prevalent.“Human life is distinct and sacred, and research that creates an animal-human hybrid or transfers a human embryo into an animal womb or vice versa should be completely prohibited and engaging in such unethical experiments should be a crime,” said Senator Braun.“We shouldn’t need to clarify in law that creating animal-human hybrids or ‘chimeras’ is ethically unthinkable, but sadly the need for that very clear distinction has arrived,” said Senator Lankford. “Currently the National Institutes of Health does not do this research, and we need to keep it that way. Researchers who are attempting these horrific once-science-fiction experiments should focus on valuing the dignity of human life, not trying to genetically merge and manipulate humans and animals. I’m glad to stand against this unethical practice with Senators Braun and Daines.”“In trying to compete with China, we shouldn’t become like them. It’s critical that we draw a bright line against unethical forms of research that fail to recognize the distinct value of humans over animals,” said Senator Daines.While the National Institute of Health (NIH) does not currently fund this research directly, chimera research programs continue in local universities as exhibited by last year’s creation of a mouse embryo with 4% human cells.In 2016, the NIH considered lifting their moratorium on experimentation involving human stem cells in animal embryos. Though the NIH has not to date lifted that moratorium, chimeric research has continued to advance in private research settings with alarming results.In April of this year, researchers at the Salk Institute in California created a human-monkey chimeric embryo by injecting human stem cells into embryos from long-tailed macaques. The human cells survived within the monkey embryo and generated additional cells; the researchers noted that all 132 macaque embryos injected with human cells still contained human cells seven days after fertilization.Acting on the significant ethical concerns and ramifications such animal-human hybrid research has for the sanctity of human life, the senators introduced an amendment to the Endless Frontiers Act which would make it a crime for any person to knowingly 1) create or attempt to create a prohibited human-animal chimera; 2) transfer or attempt to transfer a human embryo into a nonhuman womb; 3) transfer or attempt to transfer a non-human embryo into a human womb; 4) transport or receive for any purpose a prohibited human-animal chimera.This amendment is endorsed by the following groups: ·         Family Research Council·         March for Life Action·         National Right to Life·         Senate Pro-Life Caucus ·         Susan B. Anthony List·         US Council of Catholic Bishops·         White Coat Waste ProjectWatch on YouTubeSenator Braun on the amendment:In recent years, research involving human-animal hybrids has become much more prevalent.For example, in April, researchers in China created a monkey-human hybrid embryo that they allowed to grow and study for weeks.I have serious ethical concerns with this type of human chimera research continuing. My amendment would ban the practice, by applying the NIH’s current anti-chimera policy universally.Due to the dangerous and offensive nature of this research, my amendment imposes criminal penalties on those that participate in this unethical research.We must act now. Just this morning, the International Society for Stem Cell Research, an international standards-setting body, issued guidance that permits the creation human-animal hybrids.I ask that my Senate colleagues reject this foreign position and maintain our NIH’s ethical standards.All life is sacred. It is Congress’ responsibility to enact common-sense bioethics restrictions that protect human and animal life from unethical experimentation.I ask that you vote yes on Amendment 1771.Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "

https://www.braun.senate.gov/senator-braun-and-congressman-carson-introduce-resolution-honor-100th-anniversary-wonder-bread,"WASHINGTON — Today, Senator Mike Braun and Congressman André Carson (IN-07) are honoring the 100th Anniversary of the creation of Wonder Bread at Taggart Baking Company in Indianapolis by introducing a joint resolution. Taggart Baking Company of Indianapolis, Indiana, began producing Wonder Bread on May 21, 1921. 
 
“Created by Hoosier immigrants, brothers Alexander and Joseph Taggart, and Alexander’s son, Alexander Jr., Wonder Bread became a staple in American homes, cafeterias, and restaurants. Their ‘soft’ bread was a phenomenon that led their company to become the largest bread bakery in Indiana. These immigrants’ innovation transformed the bread industry and are deserving of this recognition on the 100th anniversary.” – Senator Mike Braun
  
“Indianapolis has long been a haven for hard-working entrepreneurs with big ideas – from Madam C.J. Walker to the current generation of visionaries. I am honored to join Senator Braun in celebrating that legacy through our resolution commemorating the 100th Anniversary of the creation of Wonder Bread. This legendary product has become an American icon, and the Hoosiers who created it deserve a great deal of recognition.” – Congressman André Carson 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Wonder Bread was founded in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1905 by brothers Alexander and Joseph Taggart, and Alexander’s son, Alexander Jr.. Made popular after World War II, their “soft” bread led many people in United States to switch from baking bread at home to buying Wonder Bread due to convenience and affordability. Wonder Bread has transformed and been purchased by multiple companies over the years, but it will always be a product that is iconic to our state and connected to Indianapolis.

https://www.braun.senate.gov/senator-braun-leader-mcconnell-introduce-dont-weaponize-irs-act,"WASHINGTON -- Senator Mike Braun and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell today introduced a bill to prevent the IRS from being used as a political weapon against conservative non-profit groups. From 2010 to 2012, the Obama IRS spent over two years systematically targeting conservative tax-exempt groups. The Trump administration released a final rule in May 2020 that prevented the IRS from targeting certain tax-exempt groups based on their political beliefs. House Democrats’ H.R. 1 – the “For the People Act” - and Senate companion legislation S. 1 seek to repeal and undermine the Trump rule to weaponize the IRS to target nonprofit organizations based on the applicants’ political and policy positions. The Don’t Weaponize the IRS Act codifies the Trump rule that protects groups regardless of their political ideology or beliefs and prevents the IRS from doxing donors to these groups.Removing the requirement to report the names and addresses of donors helps protect taxpayers’ First Amendment rights: such information is not needed for tax administration purposes.The bill is cosponsored by 43 Republican Senators. Joining Senators Braun and McConnell are Senators Mike Crapo, Cindy Hyde-Smith, Shelley Moore Capito, Mike Lee, Cynthia Lummis, Thom Tillis, Ron Johnson, Rand Paul, Mike Rounds, Marsha Blackburn, Richard Shelby, John Cornyn, Roger Marshall, Tommy Tuberville, John Barrasso, Josh Hawley, Steve Daines, Richard Burr, Bill Cassidy, Ted Cruz, Rick Scott, Jim Risch, Pat Toomey, Kevin Cramer, Joni Ernst, James Lankford, Jerry Moran, James Inhofe, Roger Wicker, John Thune, Todd Young, Chuck Grassley, Roy Blunt, Ben Sasse, Bill Hagerty, John Boozman, Deb Fischer, Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton, John Hoeven, and John Kennedy.“The American people remember all too well what can happen when the IRS is allowed to subject individuals to unequal scrutiny, depending on their political beliefs,” said McConnell. “The prior administration was right to intervene and put hard limits on the sort of personal information unelected bureaucrats could demand from nonprofit organizations and their donors. In the face of left-wing plans to tear down these commonsense protections, our bill would codify them permanently. I’m proud to stand with Senator Braun, the overwhelming majority of our Republican colleagues, and with citizens across America in defense of the First Amendment.” – Senator Mitch McConnell, Senate Republican Leader“Politics has no place in federal tax compliance efforts. We have seen what happens when the IRS misuses information in its possession to target specific groups or individuals. Providing the IRS with additional private information that it doesn’t even need to perform its tax administration responsibilities would only further put the privacy and constitutional rights of American citizens at risk.” – Senator Mike Crapo, Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee“We saw during the Obama years that the IRS was used as a political weapon to target conservative nonprofits, and under H.R.1 the Biden IRS would be empowered to block tax-exempt status and publicly expose a group’s donors to harassment from liberal groups and the media if their beliefs are deemed to be politically unfavorable. This bill will prevent the IRS from being weaponized against conservatives like it was under President Obama.” – Senator Mike BraunThe bill is endorsed by the following groups:
​​​​​​​Quotes in Support of ‘Don’t Weaponize the IRS’ Act""Americans should not be targeted simply due to the views they hold, political or otherwise. Unfortunately, we've seen in the past exactly what happens when the federal government is empowered to go after people for just that. Senator Braun's leadership in preventing the federal government from weaponizing the IRS against its own citizens is not only laudable, but critical to the preservation of our constitutionally-guaranteed rights."" - Adam Brandon, President, FreedomWorks“Senator Braun and Senator McConnell should be applauded for introducing the Don’t Weaponize the IRS Act. The IRS has an extensive track record of ineptitude, incompetence, and targeting taxpayers based on their political beliefs. This bill will codify important protections for non-profit organizations irrespective of their political affiliation and ensure that the IRS has one less tool to harass Americans that are exercising their first amendment rights.” - Grover Norquist, President, Americans for Tax Reform“The IRS should not be the speech police, and the ‘Don’t Weaponize the IRS Act’ would make sure it isn’t. The bill is good for both free speech and good government. It would encourage more Americans to join and support nonprofits by protecting their personal information from prying bureaucrats. The IRS itself has said collecting this information is an unnecessary burden. Senator Braun’s bill offers an alternative to efforts to politicize and weaponize the IRS, like H.R. 1 and S. 1, and lets the agency focus on providing taxpayer service and fair enforcement of the tax laws. The Institute for Free Speech appreciates the efforts of Senator Braun, Leader McConnell, and the other cosponsors of this bill for supporting Americans’ privacy rights.” - David Keating, President, Institute for Free Speech“People shouldn’t have to choose between supporting a cause and becoming a political target. Stripping people of their privacy makes it easier for politicians of all stripes to monitor, intimidate, and silence people who join movements those in power oppose. This bill protects the rights of all Americans to support the causes they care about. And we are proud to stand in support of it.” - Brent Wm. Gardner, Chief Government Affairs Officer, Americans for Prosperity“Transparency is for government and privacy is for people. The “Don’t Weaponize the IRS Act” is important legislation that will ensure the IRS does not collect and store nonprofit donors’ private information - information the IRS does not need to enforce tax code. This prevents the IRS from becoming the “speech police” and infringing on Americans' constitutionally protected activities and beliefs.”  - Heather Lauer, Executive Director, People United for Privacy“We support the Don’t Weaponize the IRS Act to codify the May 2020 rule that ended the forced disclosure of private donor lists.  This information had no legitimate use -- but was frequently subject to misuse and abuse.  The ""transparency"" rationale put forward by Democrats is a dead giveaway—confidential information can't be transparent unless it is improperly and illegally leaked.” - Phil Kerpen, President, American Commitment“AMAC Action is pleased to support the Don’t Weaponize the IRS Act. This legislation is necessary to safeguard people’s privacy rights and ensure that Americans do not become political targets simply because they take an opposing position to that of those who are currently in power.” - Bob Carlstrom, President, AMAC Action“While Democrats push their dream bill, the Corrupt Politicians Act (S. 1) to put Americans who support conservative organizations on a list to be targeted by the woke mob, Senator Braun is pushing back. The Don’t Weaponize the IRS Act is a welcome defense of Americans’ First Amendment right to freely associate with groups that align with their values.  No American should fear government retribution based on their religious or political beliefs, and this legislation helps prevent a repeat of the Obama-era IRS targeting scandal.”  - Garrett Bess, Vice President, Heritage Action for America“The Council for Citizens Against Government Waste strongly supports the ‘Don’t Weaponize the IRS Act,’ introduced by Sen. Mike Braun and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell.  The legislation will codify IRS rules that prevent nonprofit organizations from being subject to intrusive and partisan IRS interference with their First Amendment rights.  S. 1 and H.R. 1 include provisions that would begin to undermine that rule as part of a larger effort to regulate political activity and free speech. Sens. Braun and McConnell should be commended for introducing this legislation."" – Tom Schatz, Council for Citizens Against Government Waste""To protect the interests of taxpayers, the IRS's authority must have appropriate guardrails.

https://www.braun.senate.gov/braun-grassley-call-oversight-fema-covid-funeral-assistance-program,"WASHINGTON - Senator Mike Braun & Senator Chuck Grassley have sent a letter to Michael Horowitz, Chair of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, calling for oversight of FEMA’s Funeral Assistance Program. The Senators wrote in the letter that they are “concerned that the lack of congressional direction under this program, the high payment amounts of up to $35,500 per applicant, and the resulting guidance issued by FEMA will result in the Program being one rampant with fraud.”Reasons for concern cited in the letter include:·         The Frequently-Asked-Questions section of the FEMA website provides guidance on how to amend a death certificate if “[t]he death certificate doesn’t attribute the death to COVID-19.”
 ·         FEMA’s Funeral Assistance Program eligibility criteria issued on April 14 stated there is no requirement for the decedent to have been a U.S. citizen.
 ·         On the first day, FEMA’s call center received over one million calls. While a high demonstration of interest is not a problem in of itself, compared to the number of U.S. deaths from COVID-19 the level of interest in this program - when paired with the broad eligibility criteria and high payment amounts - is an indication the Program may be ripe for fraud.Senators Braun and Grassley are calling for an audit or investigation into the FEMA Funeral Assistance Program. Specifically, asking that the relevant report include:1.    Statistical and biographical information of approved and applied decedents, including the number of applications received from each state, race, age, gender, income level and region.2.    As an attachment, all FEMA documents guidance, and communications that are cited in the report.3.    The actions FEMA took to deter fraud within the program.4.    The average amount of benefit provided.5.    The number of applicants that utilized amended death certificates and the states and localities they were from.6.    The number of decedents that did not have legal immigration status.Read the full letter:# # #Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "

https://www.braun.senate.gov/growing-climate-solutions-act-passes-us-senate,"WASHINGTON — Today the U.S. Senate passed the Growing Climate Solutions Act, legislation that will help farmers, ranchers, and foresters understand and access carbon markets, helping the environment and boosting farm income at the same time. The legislation, introduced by U.S. Senator Mike Braun (R-IN) and Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), joined by U.S. Senators John Boozman (R-AR), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and co-sponsored by more than half the Senate, helps producers to generate and sell carbon credits by setting up a third-party certification process through the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The bill also creates an online resource for farmers looking to connect with those experts and get more information and establishes an Advisory Council to provide input to USDA and ensure the program remains effective and works for farmers.“Farmers have always led the way on protecting our environment, and the Growing Climate Solutions Act helps them get paid for their sustainable practices through voluntary carbon credit markets,” said Senator Braun. “Hoosiers and Americans want real-world solutions, and Growing Climate Solutions is a bipartisan, common-sense, pro-jobs win that farmers, industry leaders, and conservationists can all support - all without growing our government or our deficit.”“Addressing the climate crisis is one of the most urgent challenges we face and our farmers and foresters are an important part of the solution,” said Chairwoman Stabenow, Chairwoman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. “The bipartisan Growing Climate Solutions Act is a win-win for farmers, our economy and for our environment. Our bill is a perfect example of how we can work across the aisle and find common ground to address a critical issue affecting all of us and our future.”“Farmers, ranchers and private forest land owners are eager to explore emerging voluntary markets that will compensate them for reducing their environmental footprint. The Growing Climate Solutions Act seeks to remove barriers that stand in their way. It will give farmers, ranchers and private forest land owners resources at USDA to learn more about the voluntary opportunities they may wish to pursue, as well as information to identify expertise that can help them implement practices to sequester carbon or reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” Ranking Member Boozman said. “I commend Senators Braun and Stabenow for their willingness to partner with me to make improvements to this bill before committee consideration. This bipartisan approach was key to securing Senate passage.”“As Americans, we have the ability to come up with climate solutions that can benefit our economy and our way of life,” said Senator Graham. “The United States has long been a leader in innovation. This legislation is an opportunity to put our knowledge and can-do spirit to work to promote business opportunities for the agriculture industry while promoting the protection of our environment.”“Farmers and foresters are seeing firsthand the effects of climate change on their livelihoods, and I’m glad to have them at the table working on solutions,” said Senator Whitehouse.  “We will need nature-based solutions like the ones this bill seeks to incentivize in order to rapidly get to net zero emissions, as science tells us we must.”More than 175 organizations and companies from across food, agriculture, forestry and conservation support The Growing Climate Solutions Act.

https://www.braun.senate.gov/senators-braun-boozman-cramer-cruz-scott-inhofe-and-rounds-introduce-irs-customer-service,"WASHINGTON - Senator Mike Braun has introduced the IRS Customer Service Improvement Act that will require the IRS to prioritize federal taxpayers over representational work during tax filing season. Cosponsors of this bill include Senators Boozman (R-AR), Cruz (R-TX), Cramer (R-ND), Scott (R-FL), Inhofe (R-OK) and Rounds (R-SD). While President Biden has requested $80 billion for the IRS to double the workforce at the IRS, many current IRS employees are spending much of their time on the job completing tasks unrelated to their official duties, called taxpayer-funded union time. WHAT IS TAXPAYER-FUNDED UNION TIME?Taxpayer-funded union time is when federal employees perform representational work for a bargaining unit in lieu of their regularly assigned work. In other words, federal employees performing taxpayer-funded union time are paid by federal taxpayers to do union work versus the duty stations jobs they were hired to perform. ·         In fiscal year 2019, 1,421 Treasury employees used taxpayer-funded union time and consumed 353,820 hours of taxpayer-funded union time.
 ·         Of these 1,421 Treasury employees on taxpayer-funded union time, 350 IRS employee job categories are classified as customer service representatives/contact representatives. Of these 350, 46 were greater than or equal to 80% of TFUT hours versus overall work time.THE IRS HAS A CUSTOMER SERVICE PROBLEMThe Taxpayer Advocate Services (TAS) is an independent organization within the IRS that works to identify and fix systemic problems affecting taxpayers. In the 2020 report for taxpayers, the TAS found that poor customer service and personnel problems were among the top challenges facing the IRS. ·         In its 2020 report to taxpayers, TAS documented the top challenges facing the IRS, and many of these challenges concerned poor customer service and personnel problems.
 ·         For example, one such challenge concerns telephone and in-person service that is in part due to a “lack of staff.”  The TAS found that the IRS received more than 100 million calls, but only answered 24 million; calls averaged 18 minutes of hold time; and face-to-face assistance declined from 4.4 million in 2016 to 2.3 million in 2019 and 1.0 million in 2020.
 ·         As another example, TAS found that while the IRS processes most amended returns in a timely manner, some returns nevertheless linger for months, generating over a million calls that the IRS cannot answer and thousands of TAS cases annually.Given these and other challenges, the IRS should focus all available staff to the pressing needs of taxpayers, but at the very least during tax filing season.THE IRS CUSTOMER SERVICE IMPROVEMENT ACT:Senator Braun’s bill would prohibit staff at the Internal Revenue Service from leaving their duty stations during filing season to do taxpayer-funded union official time.QUOTES:“The pressing needs of American taxpayers should be the top priority for IRS staff, at the very least during tax filing season,” said Senator Braun. “While President Biden has requested $80 billion to muster an army of bureaucrats at the IRS, currently many IRS employees are spending their work time completing unrelated representational work on the taxpayer’s dime. This bill will focus all available staff to complete the duties of the positions for which they were hired, rather than union work, during tax season.”“Arkansans consistently express to me their frustrations with the IRS, particularly its customer service which is clearly lacking,” said Senator Boozman. “It should almost go without saying that, during tax season, IRS employees should be fully devoted to fulfilling their mission to help Americans meet their tax responsibilities. Our bill requires the agency to ensure it is prioritizing taxpayers’ needs.”“The American taxpayer expects federal employees to be using their time on the job to perform the duties they were hired by the country to do,” said Senator Cramer. “At a time when the agency is already experiencing a backlog, our bill would require IRS employees, during tax season, to complete the primary responsibilities of the positions they were hired for before they participate in taxpayer-funded union time.” “President Biden has requested $80 billion to increase the budget of the IRS, but simply throwing more money at a bloated, inefficient government agency won’t fix it,” said Senator Cruz. “Every tax season, hardworking Americans file their taxes expecting timely refunds to support their families, yet this expectation goes unmet, and refunds are held up for months. I am proud to join Sen. Braun in cosponsoring this bill to protect taxpayer funds and to ensure that the American people receive the service they not only expect but deserve.”“Throughout my time as Governor and now as Senator, my focus continues to be on making government more efficient so Americans get the best return on their tax dollars,” Senator Rick Scott. “I’m glad to join Senator Braun to introduce the IRS Customer Service Improvement Act, which puts the needs of taxpayers first.” “The federal government works for you—the taxpayer—and should accordingly prioritize taxpayer assistance over taxpayer-funded union time,” said Senator Inhofe. “Federal taxpayers in Oklahoma deserve to be given all of the IRS’ attention during tax season—it’s as simple as that. I am proud to cosponsor Sen. Braun’s IRS Customer Service Improvement Act to support Oklahoma federal taxpayers and improve IRS customer service.” BACKGROUND:Taxpayer-funded union time (TFUT), also known as “official time,” is when federal employees perform representational work for a bargaining unit in lieu of their regularly assigned work. In other words, federal employees performing TFUT are paid by federal taxpayers to do union work versus the duty stations jobs they were hired to perform.While TFUT is authorized by 5 U.S.C. § 7131, it was intended to be limited in nature.Instead, and as OPM noted in October 2020: “Large amounts of official time allocated to agency employees conducting activities on behalf of unions have resulted in widespread diversion of resources from agency mission-critical functions. In many cases, where agency union representatives serve as full-time union officials, agencies are no longer able to rely on employees even for a portion of their duty time, to complete the duties of the positions for which they were hired.""Taxpayer-funded union time at the IRS:Diversion from agency mission is particularly acute at the Treasury and the IRS, the latter of which faces systemic customer service challenges.  In fiscal year (FY) 2019, 1,421 Treasury employees used TFUT and consumed 353,820 hours of TFUT—a decrease from the FY2016 total of 481,500 hours.·         Associated compensation costs was $17.27 million (FY2019)(a decrease of 3.1% from the FY2016 costs of $22.4 million). ·         In addition, Treasury allows labor organizations or individuals on TFUT free or discounted use of government property—the value of which at Treasury was an additional $2.5 million (FY2019).·         Treasury also supplied “other agency expenses” valued at $343,364 (FY2019).·         Of these 1,421 Treasury employees on TFUT, 350 IRS employee job categories are classified as customer service representatives/contact representatives. Of these 350, 46 were greater than or equal to 80% of TFUT hours versus overall work time.
 ·         Of these 1,421 Treasury employees on TFUT, 204 IRS employee job categories are classified as internal revenue agents. Of these 204, 12 were greater than or equal to 80% of TFUT hours versus overall work time.Customer Service Challenges at IRS:The Taxpayer Advocate Services (TAS) is an independent organization within the IRS that works to identify and fix systemic problems affecting taxpayers.In its 2020 report to taxpayers, TAS documented the top challenges facing the IRS, and many of these challenges concerned poor customer service and personnel problems.For example, one such challenge concerns telephone and in person service that is in part due to a “lack of staff.”  The TAS found that the IRS received more than 100 million calls, but only answered 24 million; calls averaged 18 minutes of hold time; and face-to-face assistance declined from: 4.4 million in FY16, to 2.3 million FY19, and 1.0 million in FY20.As another example, TAS found that while the IRS processes most amended returns in a timely manner, some returns nevertheless linger for months, generating over a million calls that the IRS cannot answer and thousands of TAS cases annually.·         Given these and other challenges, the IRS should focus all available staff to the pressing needs of taxpayers, but at the very least during tax filing season. ·         While the volume of Treasury staff is small in comparison to its overall employee population (87,336 in FY2019), the agency is agreeing to official time in a manner that is not in keeping with statute.  Federal law authorizes official time for employees representing the union in CBA negotiations.  Agencies and unions may also grant official time for other purposes, but only if “reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest.”  ·         Given statutory expectations, and customer service challenges faced by the IRS, Treasury should ensure that the IRS focuses all available staff to the pressing needs of taxpayers, but at the very least during tax filing season.The IRS Customer Service Improvement Act:  ·         Amends 5 U.S.C. § 7131 to prohibit staff at the Internal Revenue Service from leaving their duty stations during filing season to do taxpayer-funded union official time.  
 ·         In other words, during IRS filing season, the priority must be serving federal taxpayers with the highest quality service and not doing representational work. 
 ·         Supersedes existing Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs) which prevents stalling of renegotiations. Going forward CBA terms cannot authorize official time use during tax season. Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "

https://www.braun.senate.gov/senators-braun-daines-lankford-ernst-inhofe-and-thunes-bill-would-outlaw-animal-human-hybrid,"Originally introduced: May 27. Updated: June 11WASHINGTON – Senator Mike Braun, Senator Steve Daines, Senator James Lankford, Senator Joni Ernst, Senator James Inhofe, and Senator John Thune have introduced a bill that would make it a crime to engage in chimera research, or the creation of animal-human hybrid organisms.Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey introduced the original legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.A chimera is an organism that contains cells from two distinct species, such as an animal-human hybrid created in a laboratory setting. In recent years, research programs involving chimeric organisms have become more prevalent.“Human life is distinct and sacred, and research that creates an animal-human hybrid or transfers a human embryo into an animal womb or vice versa should be completely prohibited and engaging in such unethical experiments should be a crime,” said Senator Braun.While the National Institute of Health (NIH) does not currently fund this research directly, chimera research programs continue in local universities as exhibited by last year’s creation of a mouse embryo with 4% human cells.In 2016, the NIH considered lifting their moratorium on experimentation involving human stem cells in animal embryos. Though the NIH has not to date lifted that moratorium, chimeric research has continued to advance in private research settings with alarming results.In April of this year, researchers at the Salk Institute in California created a human-monkey chimeric embryo by injecting human stem cells into embryos from long-tailed macaques. The human cells survived within the monkey embryo and generated additional cells; the researchers noted that all 132 macaque embryos injected with human cells still contained human cells seven days after fertilization.Acting on the significant ethical concerns and ramifications such animal-human hybrid research has for the sanctity of human life, the senators introduced this bill which would make it a crime for any person to knowingly 1) create or attempt to create a prohibited human-animal chimera; 2) transfer or attempt to transfer a human embryo into a nonhuman womb; 3) transfer or attempt to transfer a non-human embryo into a human womb; 4) transport or receive for any purpose a prohibited human-animal chimera.This bill is endorsed by the following groups: ·         Family Research Council·         March for Life Action·         National Right to Life·         Senate Pro-Life Caucus ·         Susan B.

The central idea is that declaring gun violence as a “public health emergency” would open “a broad set of powers to accelerate steps to prevent gun violence.”As The New York Times points out, with “gun violence” declared as a public health emergency, the Administration will be able “to swiftly enact executive orders that would regulate the tracking of homemade firearms, require background checks for virtually all gun sales and mandate dealers notify the F.B.I when they compete gun sales before completing a background check.” Meaning, the Administration would then potentially have the power to indefinitely hold up a gun sales. “Declaring a public health emergency does not give the Executive Branch the right to infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of Americans to defend themselves and their families, and Congress must make this 100% clear in law so the rights of law-abiding citizens can’t be destroyed through the bureaucratic loophole that is opened by exploiting a crisis.” – Senator Mike Braun   The Right to Protect and Bear Arms Act:# # #Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "

Scott (R-FL), and T. Scott (R-SC) introduced the ATF Accountability Act to provide transparency to gun owners across America on rules made by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The ATF engages in a secretive classification review process where the agency makes decisions about whether a particular firearm is regulated by the National Firearms Act. Decisions and justification for decisions are often only made available to manufacturers in private correspondence. This causes a lot of uncertainty for both gun-owning Americans and firearm manufacturers, especially in combination with the ATF’s refusal to make final public rules regarding classification. 

Law-abiding gun-owning Americans are too often last to know the classification status of firearms, leaving them unsure as to what licenses or tax stamps are required for legal ownership, and firearm manufacturers are forced to make production decisions without final approval by ATF. Additionally, contrary to regular administrative procedure, gun manufacturers have no way to appeal if they believe that a classification decision was reached in error or is not reflective of a comprehensive review. “American gun owners and manufacturers have been left in the dark for far too long with closed-door rule changes by the ATF. Americans exercising their Second Amendment rights shouldn’t be the last to know the classification status of firearms, or what licenses or tax stamps they need to avoid running afoul of the law.

https://www.braun.senate.gov/senators-braun-warnock-introduce-bill-make-railroad-crossings-safer,"WASHINGTON – Last week, Senator Mike Braun and Senator Raphael Warnock introduced S. 1919, the Railway Upgrades for Rural American Lines (RURAL) Act in order to build on the successes already found through the Section 130 grant program and help states modernize unsafe or functionally outdated railroad warning devices. “Since the Section 130 grant program’s creation in 1987, fatalities at railway-highway crossings have decreased by 57 percent. While the Section 130 grant program has been successful in reducing deaths at railway-highway crossings, there is still work to be done to eliminate the threat posed by unsafe railroad crossings. Indiana is crossroads of America and this bill provides a way for states to modernize out of date and functionally obsolete railroad warning devices based on a community’s discretion. The RURAL Act is a realistic answer to creating safer roads for all Americans,"" said Senator Mike Braun“For the last four years, Georgia has been one of the top five states for highway-rail incidents. Much of rural Georgia has inadequate crossing equipment, which not only leads to inconvenient and costly delays for local businesses and commuters, but also endangers our communities and railroad workers. It doesn’t have to stay that way, especially with the RURAL Act as a practical solution,” said Senator Warnock. “This smart legislation further incentivizes improvements in risk management and equipment measures onsite at highway-rail grade crossings across the state of Georgia, and I look forward to working with my partner Sen. Braun to get this legislation passed.”BACKGROUNDCreated by Congress in 1987, the Railway-Highway Crossings Program (also known as the “Section 130grant program”) is administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and provides funds to eliminate hazards at public railway-highway crossings. Section 130 funds are provided as a set-aside from each state’s Highway Safety Improvement Program funding and are apportioned by formula. States may spend Section 130 grant dollars for projects to eliminate hazards or install protective devices at any public crossing—including roadways, bike trails, and pedestrian paths. Projects pursued with Section130 funds are funded at a 90 percent federal share. The RURAL Act would provide states with additional flexibility in the use of Section 130 funds— allowing these dollars to also be spent towards the replacement of functionally obsolete warning devices. Additionally, in order to encourage local communities to close hazardous grade crossings, the RURAL Act would also increase the incentive payment available to governments who close such crossings from $7,500 to $100,000.# # #Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "

https://www.braun.senate.gov/braun-pushes-let-states-set-medicaid-requirements-act-after-biden-administration-revokes-indianas,"WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Braun requested unanimous consent for his Let States Set Medicaid Requirements Act on the Senate floor.He was joined by Senator Todd Young (R-IN) and Senator John Cornyn (R-TX).This legislation would empower states to set their Medicaid work and community engagement requirements for certain Medicaid recipients. Indiana’s Gateway to Work program would require 20 hours-per-month of work, job searching, school, or community service activities for certain able-bodied adults receiving state health coverage, but the waiver was revoked by the Biden administration. Senator Braun believes states should be able to set these standards, and should be able to adapt programs to the particular needs of their communities' Medicaid enrollees.BACKGROUNDThe Social Security Act authorizes a framework to allow innovation in the Medicaid program.  States are able to use waivers under this framework in a variety of ways, including adding work and community engagement requirements for certain Medicaid enrollees, and implementing innovative service delivery systems.Since President Biden took office, HHS and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have revoked several state waivers that were previously approved under the Trump administration.In April 2021, HHS overturned an approved waiver to extend the Texas’ Medicaid plan for another 10 years, and did so without providing notice or holding a public comment period.One month prior, HHS notified Arkansas and New Hampshire it was withdrawing approval of demonstration projects which had permitted those states to effectuate work requirements as a condition for Medicaid benefit eligibility.And again, in July, CMS revoked approval of Arizona and Indiana’s Medicaid work and community engagement requirements.Indiana’s program—called the Gateway to Work program—would require 20 hours-per-month of work, job searching, school, or community service activities for certain able-bodied adults receiving state health coverage.This program allows the Hoosier State to design programs that provide Medicaid enrollees with community engagement activities that can improve their quality of life over the long-term. Senator Braun's RemarksWatch on YoutubeFull clip with Senator Young and Senator Cornyn's remarks. Watch on YouTube

https://www.braun.senate.gov/node/1069,"WASHINGTON -- Today, Senator Mike Braun and Senator Todd Young commended the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) decision to back off a proposal to change the federal definition of “city” and instead retain the existing Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) designation. The OMB’s proposed change would have doubled the population threshold for a city from 50,000 to 100,000 people, negatively impacting five Indiana cities – Terre Haute, Columbus, Kokomo, Michigan City-LaPorte, and Muncie — and over a hundred cities across the country.Senators Braun and Young heard from many Mayors across Indiana who would be negatively affected by this decision, and in March wrote a letter urging OMB to deny the proposal that would double the minimum population required for an MSA designation. In the letter, the senators emphasized that, “each of these areas of the state have used a regional approach to economic development and positive impacts from each of these metro areas is felt in surrounding and more rural counties.” The senators also joined a broader bipartisan Senate letter to the OMB.You can read their letter here.“Hiking the population threshold to be defined as a city would be a terrible idea, and I’m glad the White House Office of Management and Budget listened to representatives like Senator Young, myself, and several Indiana mayors and backed off this proposal which would have negatively impacted many Indiana cities,” said Senator Braun. “This would have negatively impacted not only the municipalities themselves, but caused a ripple effect for constituents in the broader region that rely on these cities as economic drivers in their areas of the state.”“I’m glad the Office of Management and Budget listened to our concerns and backed off its proposal to double the minimum population requirement for a Metropolitan Statistical Area designation. The proposed change would have excluded Terre Haute, Columbus, Kokomo, Michigan City-LaPorte, and Muncie from this important designation, making it more difficult for these communities to receive federal resources for housing, transportation, health care, and more,” said Senator Young. “We listened to the concerns of Hoosiers and took action to stop this misguided proposal from moving forward.”“The City of Columbus is pleased the OMB did not substantially change the standards for delineating core based statistical areas, which allows the city to maintain its MSA designation,” said Columbus Mayor Jim Lienhoop. “As many other communities across the nation, we rely on federal funding to help in many areas, including community development, transportation and planning. Many local street, transportation and neighborhood projects benefit from these dollars and enhance our ability to provide services to city and regional residents, particularly under-served populations. We appreciate the hard work from Senators Braun and Young, and our other Congressional representatives, who partnered with us in making federal officials aware of the importance of this designation for our city.”""Maintaining the MSA threshold at 50,000 is imperative for a community such as Terre Haute,” said Terre Haute Mayor Duke Bennett. “In a City of just over 60,000 citizens, this ensures our community continues to receive our fair share of federal dollars to invest back into the local community and allows Terre Haute to remain competitive with multiple funding opportunities.  We are grateful for federal leadership for taking a stance on the issue.”“The City of La Porte is appreciative of Senator Braun and Senator Young’s efforts in working to protect our status as an MSA,” said La Porte Mayor Tom Dermody. “If the Office of Management and Budget had implemented the recommendation of the Metropolitan Statistical Review Committee, the Michigan City/La Porte area would have been negatively impacted by the inability to apply for federal funding. As well, the Michigan City/La Porte area would no longer appear in Site Selector or Company-directed searches using MSAs as a filter or a source of data.  We are thankful to our Indiana Senators’ efforts in this matter.”“The City of Kokomo is more than pleased to hear that the OMB has heard the collective concerns of municipalities like ours and has decided not to change the delineation of MSA’s as was being proposed,” said Kokomo Mayor Tyler Moore. “Keeping the MSA Metropolitan designation at 50,000 will allow Kokomo to continue to compete with other larger metropolitan areas for economic development. We want to personally thank Senator Braun and Senator Young for their support in opposing that proposed change which will allow the Kokomo area to continue its progress in growth.”“I was pleased that Senator Braun, Senator Young and Congressman Pence listened to my concerns over the Metropolitan Statistical Areas threshold, as it was an important decision for the City of Muncie,” said Muncie Mayor Dan Ridenour. “I along with our Hoosier leadership in Washington felt very strongly that drastic changes like the original proposal would have fostered a loss of confidence among those looking to create a future in Muncie. My office is always concerned about how changes on a federal level can impact our community.”###Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "
https://www.braun.senate.gov/node/1065,"WASHINGTON – Senator Mike Braun has cosponsored the Travel Mask Mandate Repeal Act of 2021, legislation to prohibit the imposition of mask mandates on public transportation. This legislation was introduced by Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) and U.S. Representative Andy Biggs (AZ-5) will be introducing companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives later this week. This bill is cosponsored by Tom Cotton (R-AR), Roger Marshall (R-KS), and Roger Wicker (R-MS).“It is far, far past time to end the federal government’s contradictory one-size-fits-all COVID mandates, including the rule requiring masks on planes and public transportation,” said Senator Braun.“The federal government forcing the American people to continue to wear masks despite the fact that we’ve already reached herd immunity is ridiculous and needs to end immediately,” said Dr. Paul. “I am introducing the Travel Mask Mandate Repeal Act of 2021 to put a stop to this nanny state mandate of requiring masks on public transportation. In a free county people will evaluate their personal risk factors and are smart enough to ultimately make medical decisions like wearing a mask themselves.” “Mask mandates have outlived their usefulness, yet they remain in effect on flights and other modes of public transportation. This policy discourages family travel and forces Americans with children—especially those with disabilities—to cancel travel or else live in fear that an untimely tantrum or bad day could ruin their trip and cost them more than a thousand dollars in fines. Our bill will put an end to this unscientific and punitive practice,” said Senator Cotton.“Unelected bureaucrats don’t make laws, Congress does. After over a year of battling COVID-19, our communities and states have reopened, and our nation has finally regained a sense of normalcy,” said Senator Marshall. “It’s past time for the federal government to restore Americans’ freedoms and remove these unnecessary rules.”“Americans have been told for more than a year to ‘trust the science,’ and the science now says it is safe to resume normal life once we have been vaccinated,” said Senator Wicker. “Getting the vaccine significantly lowers the risk of contracting and becoming sick from the coronavirus across all activities, including travel. I am pleased to join my colleagues in pushing to end the unnecessary federal mask mandate and bring travel in line with other major sectors of the economy.”“There is no scientific evidence for the continuation of mask mandates on public transportation. Bottom line, mask mandates are old news, and are only being kept in place by those who relish controlling our day-to-day lives. The viral spread is collapsing and our normal lives are returning. It's time for the CDC to follow the science and end the tyrannical COVID-19 restrictions once and for all,” said Representative Biggs.The entire text of the Travel Mask Mandate Repeal Act of 2021 can be found HERE.Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "

“Everyone agrees America needs to invest in infrastructure. But with our national debt growing out of control and Democrats dedicated to passing a 100% partisan blowout spending package totaling $3.5 trillion, we cannot support any additional deficit spending on Joe Biden’s, Nancy Pelosi’s, Chuck Schumer’s and Bernie Sanders’ liberal wish list.
“We can pay for needed infrastructure without incurring additional debt by instead repurposing previously appropriated but unspent funds.

Estimating what a piece of legislation will cost is more of an art than a science in our nation’s capital.
 
While appraisals of the bipartisan infrastructure package’s price have hovered around $550 billion, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., revealed the true price tag of the deal last week: $5 trillion, and a fundamental change in Americans’ relationship to their government. 
 
""I would say that if the bipartisan infrastructure bill falls apart then everything would fall apart,"" Sen. Manchin told reporters on Capitol Hill last Monday. ""If one falls apart, how do you do the other one?""
 
Though many Republicans have tried to delink the two proposals, for Democrats they remain as President Biden first described them: inextricably intertwined.
 
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has repeatedly spoke of these two bills as one in the same. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has gone so far as to say that the House of Representatives will not vote on one without the other.  
 
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders has confirmed that Senator Manchin’s axiom works both ways: No reconciliation bill, no infrastructure package. 
 
Democrats in Congress and President Biden are building an inflation bomb with their unprecedented deficit spending proposal, and the Republicans falling for this infrastructure bait-and-switch are lighting the fuse. 
 
And though Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., has stood up to say that Democrats $3.5 trillion estimated price is too high, it doesn’t matter if the final number is $2.5 trillion or $1 trillion. We don’t have the money, and the taxes it’ll take to get it will hobble our recovering economy.
 
There are also serious problems with the bipartisan infrastructure framework itself.
 
Following $4 trillion of bipartisan COVID relief spending last year and a $1.9 trillion liberal shopping spree marketed as COVID relief this year, I believe now is the time to cut up the credit card, not put another half trillion of new spending on it. 
 
Infrastructure is great when it’s paid for, and it’s not clear to me that some of the so-called ""pay-fors"" in the package will even pay for themselves.
 
Repurposing unused COVID relief funds should absolutely take the place of new spending, especially now that government intervention has become more of a weight on the economy than a boon. But repurposing money we borrowed in the first place isn’t quite a pay-for. 
 
The bill anticipates receiving a large amount of funding from recouping fraudulently-paid enhanced federal unemployment payments. Much like the ""tax-gap,"" estimates for how much fraudulent unemployment insurance was paid out and how much can be recouped is conjecture.
 
Repurposing money the federal government previously wasted shouldn’t count as paid-for.
 
This bill anticipates $49 billion in ""savings"" from delaying the implementation of President Trump’s Medicare Part D rebate rule. Raising drug prices on seniors shouldn’t be a pay-for, it’s just wrong.
 
The bill estimates $8.7 billion from the mandatory sequester, which is unlikely to materialize considering these sequesters never get done because Congress doesn't follow any of our own budget rules. 
 
And while I’m glad to see the Congressional Budget Office using dynamic scoring to incorporate return-on-investment for infrastructure spending in its cost estimates for the bill, which they previously would not apply to the increase in revenues we were expected to reap due to a hot economy spurred by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the 33% ROI estimated by this framework appears to be based on little but wishful thinking. 
 
The $550 billion of spending proposed in this bill sits on top of our baseline spending which is already not paid for. The Highway Reauthorization has a $100 billion deficit that has been ignored, and the real pay-fors in this package should be going to address that shortfall.
 
There is much in this bill that concerns me, but those issues shrink in comparison to the $5 trillion beast looming on the horizon.
 
Democrats are going for broke with their partisan overhaul of Americans’ relationship to their government. They see this reckless taxing and spending spree as their last chance before the midterm elections to pave the next stretch of road between the United States as we know it and the far left’s socialist goals.
 
It’s not clear at the moment what all will be in the Democrats’ budget reconciliation monstrosity, but we know their intent: a several trillion-dollar injection of federal government into every aspect of our lives and economy.
 
And we know what the effect will be: more of the federal government working against businesses who desperately need labor, and more debt spending yielding more inflation.
 
As a representative of the crossroads of America and a former head of a distribution and logistics company, I know the importance of strong roads and bridges better than anyone.
 
But infrastructure investment is not worth the debt if it’s not really paid for. So long as Democrats are intent on sending us further down the road to socialism, runaway inflation, and more labor shortages, it’s not worth paving the way there.Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "

Regardless, my worry is that for the number of people that look to the federal government for defending the country infrastructure, our entitlement programs, we are not putting ourselves in a strong position for down the road.

Americans across the country construct budgets and prioritize spending, and Congress is failing to do the same. The first bill I introduced upon being sworn into the Senate was No Budget No Pay, legislation that would simply say if Members of Congress don’t get a budget done, they don’t get paid until they do. I believe we must adhere to budgeting and spending basics.Regrettably, the Appropriations Committee considered bills without budget and spending allocations in place. For this reason, I offered a procedural motion to send all three bills back to the Subcommittee level to ensure we carefully, transparently, and properly decide how to spend taxpayers’ money.  I also submitted amendments to strip all earmarks from these spending bills. Earmarks are Congressional pork that Senators and Representatives carve out in spending bills. My office identified 417 pork requests in these bills alone.  I will always stand up against Washington's broken budget process that's putting our country deeper into debt and on the road to catastrophe.# # #Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "

Instead, we vote that the rules don’t matter.It seems like Congress can only agree on one thing: deficits and debt don’t matter.But they do, and both parties are to blame.And they threaten our ability to respond to emergencies when they arise, like the important ones in this bill.My budget point of order cheat-sheet has my friend Mike Enzi’s name at the top, and I’m speaking up today for those reason and also in his honor.# # #Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "
https://www.braun.senate.gov/tweet-thread-infrastructure-bill-not-paid,"View Tweet Thread on TwitterInfrastructure investment is great when it's paid for. This bipartisan infrastructure package's pay-fors are either completely phony or don't quite cut the mustard. Thread:-1. CLAIM: $205 billion from repurposing unused COVID relief funds. FACT: We should be repurposing COVID relief funds, but reshuffling money we borrowed in the first place doesn't count as a pay-for.-2. CLAIM: Funding from recouping fraudulent enhanced federal unemployment payments.FACT: Just like the ""tax-gap,"" estimates for how much fraudulent UI was paid and how much can be recouped is conjecture.Repurposing money the federal government previously wasted doesn't count.-3. CLAIM: $49 billion in savings from delaying the Medicare Part D rebate rule.FACT: Raising drug prices on seniors is not a pay-for, it's wrong.-4. CLAIM: $53 billion from states returning unused federal enhanced unemployment benefits.FACT: Repurposing unused COVID relief funds we borrowed in the first place is not a real pay-for.-5. CLAIM: $56 billion in economic growth I'm glad CBO is using dynamic scoring to take into account economic effects, which they should have done on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Tax cuts create far more growth in the economy than federal spending. This is a rosy estimate at best.-6. CLAIM: $8.7 billion from mandatory sequester.FACT: Wishful thinking. These ""mandatory"" sequesters never get done because D.C. doesn't follow any of our own budget rules.-7. CLAIM: $6 billion in sales from Strategic Petroleum Reserve. FACT: This is liquidating an asset we previously paid for, and we will have to pay to replace.-8. CLAIM: $3 billion in savings from reducing Medicare spending on discarded medications FACT: $2.8 billion is estimate of Medicare drugs thrown away every year due to single use vials.Setting aside concerns about safety, this dollar amount will certainly not reach $3 billion.-9. CLAIM: $2.9 billion interest rate smoothing options for defined benefit pension plansFACT: Interest rate smoothing is a creative accounting gimmick that rears its head in Washington every few years.It was a gimmick then, it's a gimmick now.-This $550 billion of spending is on top of the baseline which already isn't paid for.The Highway Reauthorization has a $100B deficit.Real pay-fors in this bill (future spectrum auctions, Bitcoin tax, GSE fees, and a Superfund tax) should be used to cover that shortfall.-Even if these rosy CBO estimates are accurate, that still leaves us a day late and several hundred billion dollars short.The bipartisan infrastructure bill is NOT paid for.# # #Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "
https://www.braun.senate.gov/senator-braun-colleagues-infrastructure-package-continues-insane-deficit-spending-enables-multi,"WASHINGTON - Senator Mike Braun today signed on to a joint statement led by Senator Rick Scott with Senators Mike Lee, Ron Johnson, Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, and Marsha Blackburn on the bipartisan infrastructure framework.""Congress can’t keep spending trillions of dollars we don’t have. The infrastructure package announced today continues the trend in Congress of insane deficit spending. Let’s not forget, this is just the first step in the Democrats’ plan to pass their $5.5 trillion tax and spend liberal wish list. Our nation is facing a nearly $30 TRILLION federal debt crisis. There are real infrastructure needs across the country. But, with growing inflation and many families struggling to financially recover from the events of the last year, it is not wise to throw fuel on the fire that is the raging inflation crisis and labor shortage we are seeing across America.“Needless to say, we will not support this legislation.”###Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "
https://www.braun.senate.gov/senator-braun-no-more-mandates-and-masking-didnt-work,"WASHINGTON - Senator Braun released the following video responding to reports that the CDC would go back on their previous guidance and again recommend masks for vaccinated Americans.   Download Clip | Watch on YoutubeI wanted to take a brief moment to talk about what it looks like we're hearing from the CDC: that they're going to recommend masking again.  I'm afraid we're going to roll right back in to how the heavy hand of government dealt with COVID in the first place.My observation is when you put the task to businesses and Main Street, they did everything to keep their employees and customers safe.Now we're talking about some of the failed policies that put our economy in a hurt. Blue states asked for a bailout from the federal government on account of it, and it looks we're looping right back to it.  I'm going to be a voice for saying, hey, let this be solved at the grassroots level. Let local governments and businesses deal with it.  There was no data to show that it worked with the oppressive, heavy-handed government approach to begin with.Be respectful of the disease, but exercise individual responsibility. That's the key.No more mandates, masking, and things that didn’t work from the get-go unless it makes common sense to do so.Keep up with Senator Braun's work for Hoosiers with his weekly media roundup. "
