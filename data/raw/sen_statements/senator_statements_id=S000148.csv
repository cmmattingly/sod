Since these safety laws were enacted, not a single major U.S. airline has had a fatal crash, and I will never let us turn back the clock. Time after time, the 3407 family members work tirelessly to beat back industry’s effort to roll back safety standards, and I am proud to have stood with them shoulder to shoulder to beat back this latest attempt. We must always remain constantly vigilant to stop special interests from getting their way, but today the aviation reforms which carry with them the memory of those lost in Flight 3407 continues to burn bright.” ###

U.S. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today announced the U.S. Department of Labor’s (DOL) Strengthening Community Colleges Training Grants Program has awarded $5 million to expand healthcare education programs, close opportunity gaps, and increase access to good-paying, in-demand healthcare careers across New York State. Onondaga Community College will lead a coalition of ten Upstate community colleges, in partnership with leading workforce development agencies, healthcare industry leaders, unions, and other community partners in a bold new project called the  Community College Health CARES (Career, Acceleration, Retention + Employment Support) Consortium. The senators said that this proposal, with the support of the federal funding that they secured, will expand these critically-needed programs to strengthen the healthcare workforce in communities across Upstate New York and help underserved individuals get the skills they need to enter these good-paying careers that are in demand across New York.“I am proud to deliver this $5 million federal investment to give Upstate community colleges, led by OCC, the shot in the arm they need to help providers fill in-demand, good-paying healthcare jobs in their communities,” said Senator Schumer. “Healthcare providers across the state are struggling to find enough workers to meet the demand for services, but this funding will help students and job seekers get the skills they need to enter better paying careers and give back to the community. This funding will go a long way to filling healthcare jobs in the areas that need them most and will strengthen Upstate New York’s medical workforce for years to come.”“Our health care providers have been under historic levels of stress. They have worked night and day to meet rising demand and keep their fellow New Yorkers safe and healthy, and they need reinforcements,” said Senator Gillibrand. “Funding like the $5 million going to Onondaga Community College is a critical step in addressing the health care staffing shortage and recruiting, training and building the next generation of health care workers.”Onondaga Community College President Dr. Warren Hilton said, “We are extremely grateful to Senator Schumer and Senator Gillibrand for their support of Onondaga Community College and their understanding of our mission as Central New York’s partner in education for success. In our School of Health we are creating programs which will train students for good-paying jobs in the shortest time possible. Their success in the classroom will both satisfy significant workforce needs, and give our students an entry point to a rewarding career and ultimately a better life. Moreover, the broad reach of this project will allow OCC and ten other collaborating community colleges to bring these benefits to individuals and communities across New York State.”Specifically, this funding will allow Onondaga Community College to lead SUNY Broome, Corning, Cayuga, Genesee, Herkimer, Jamestown, Jefferson, North Country, Schenectady, and Tompkins Cortland Community Colleges to expand their healthcare training programs. This will be done in partnership with top regional healthcare employers like SUNY Upstate Medical University, United Health Services, Arnot Health, Cayuga Medical, Lourdes, Samaritan Medical Center, and many others.The senators explained this new funding will allow partners to collaborate to enhance and accelerate career pathway programs leading to industry-recognized credentials and entry into Health Care and Social Assistance careers, including nursing, healthcare technicians, social assistance and management, and health information technology and administration. The program will also have an added focus on closing opportunity gaps for low-income individuals and underrepresented populations seeking to enter the field, increasing the diversity of New York’s healthcare workforce.The Strengthening Community Colleges Training Grants Program aims to help people in marginalized and underrepresented populations overcome barriers to career and technical education programs they need to connect with quality jobs. The DOL awarded $45 million in grants to 13 community colleges, including seven consortium grants and six single institution grants in 12 states, more information can be found here.A copy of Schumer’s original letter of support on behalf of Onondaga Community College appears below:Dear Secretary Walsh:I am pleased to write in support of the application submitted by Onondaga Community College (OCC) application for funding through the Department of Labor’s (DOL) Strengthening Community Colleges Training Grant program.The COVID-19 pandemic created a massive public health crisis and resulted in a disruption of New York State’s Health Care and Social Assistance (HCSA) industry. With funding, OCC plans to partner with other community colleges in the State University of New York (SUNY) system in a five-part plan to strengthen career pathways in the HCSA fields. Partners will; Form a HCSA Community of Practice, Formalize a cross-regional employer engagement team leveraging existing strategic employer partners, Pilot and recommend for adoption of Prior Learning Assessment (PLA) to accelerate HCSA pathways, Develop agreements to create stackable credentials and enhance and accelerate HCSA pathway programs, and introduce evidence-based, equity and industry informed HCSA pathway recruitment materials, resources and career selection supports with public workforce and employer partners.I applaud Onondaga Community College for its foresight and I sincerely hope the application meets with your approval.Thank you for your consideration.Sincerely,###

Schumer immediately came to Buffalo to launch an all hands on deck 3-pronged plan to secure the federal support needed to begin to save the iconic WWII Buffalo landmark.“I am putting out an SOS to the feds – Save Our Sullivans. This historic landmark is the pride and joy of the Buffalo waterfront, for our veterans and our strong Irish community, and we cannot allow its future to sink any further,” said Senator Schumer. “That is why I am here today to get all hands on deck and launch my push to secure the emergency lifeboats this historic vessel needs to set sail once again and preserve its history and stories for generations to come.”First, Schumer said that he is immediately beginning work on a congressionally directed spending request for funding through the Fiscal Year 2023 omnibus and will be pushing for the maximum eligible amount based off the relevant committee. The senator said that this direct cash infusion would help provide the fiscal relief needed as damage is assessed.Second, Schumer is immediately calling on the Environmental Protection Agency to begin working with local leaders to help address any remaining clean up issues and oil that may be continuing to pollute the waters during the hull breach. Environmental cleanup crews have been working consistently to help mitigate any environmental damage, but Schumer said that the feds need to help in these efforts and to make sure Lake Erie and the harbor remains pristine. Schumer just secured $1 billion for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and billions for the EPA’s cleanup programs. He said this massive infusion of funds can help supplement the needs of this emergency cleanup effort in coordination with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, and ensure the long-term protection of the waterways. Finally, the senator said that he will be pushing for major increases to the National Maritime Heritage Grant Program in this year’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) so that the USS The Sullivans can not only apply, but receive more funding from the program than ever before. The National Maritime Heritage Grant Program helps celebrate and honor the nation’s maritime legacy by funding projects that boost maritime heritage and fund the preservation of maritime history. Schumer explained that program is currently funded by the sale of obsolete maritime vessels from the Maritime Administration’s (MARAD) National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF), and that he has routinely fought for increases to the program, but that the current cap of $5 million on the program’s authorization level must be boosted to help provide large grants. Schumer’s push would authorize an increase in funding available and the senator said he would make additional appeals for the USS The Sullivans to receive the maximum allowable funding given the emergency nature of the situation.Schumer said that collectively these pushes can provide the emergency lifeboat the historic vessel needs as it undergoes repairs, and that he will not stop fighting to secure additional funds to ensure that the story of The Sullivans can continue to inspire the Buffalo community for years to come.Commissioned in 1943, the USS The Sullivans operated in the Pacific Theater during World War II and is one of four remaining Fletcher-class destroyer left in the world. The ship is named in honor of the working-class family that lost all five of its sons during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. It was decommissioned in 1965 and donated in 1977 to Buffalo, where it now received designation as a National Historic Landmark and has served as a memorial and museum ship ever since. ###

I’m proud to have fought to secure this critical funding and I’ll keep fighting to bring federal resources home to New York.”“I am so proud to have joined my colleagues in securing this vital funding for New York-Presbyterian Hudson Valley Hospital. The pandemic required a massive and sustained response that challenged our health care providers at great expense and, in turn, required a response of equal magnitude from the federal government to meet that challenge.” said Congressman Jones. “We are so fortunate to have New York-Presbyterian Hudson Valley Hospital in our district.” ###

I will continue to fight tooth and nail to deliver the resources needed to grow the Southern Tier economy and further make Upstate New York a top location for employers to invest and create new jobs.” Per Stromhaug, Associate Vice President of Innovation and Economic Development at Binghamton University said, “The Southern Tier Soft Landings Program at the Koffman Southern Tier Incubator will build on the momentum of the Southern Tier of New York as a hotspot for the development and manufacturing of clean energy technologies by attracting and assisting international companies providing products and services that can help the US meet the administration’s climate goals as well as create jobs.”Senator Schumer has a long history of supporting job-creating investment for Binghamton University and the Southern Tier. Most recently, Schumer announced that following his direct advocacy the Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration (EDA) selected the Binghamton University-led New Energy New York battery manufacturing project as a Phase 1 awardee and finalist for investment through the American Rescue Plan’s Build Back Better Regional Challenge. Schumer said that as a Phase 1 awardee, the project will receive $500,000 in technical assistance funds to develop its proposal to compete for a Phase 2 implementation grant, worth up to $100 million, to expand research, development, testing, and workforce assets to meet the demand of the emerging battery manufacturing industry in the Southern Tier and Upstate NY.Senator Schumer’s original letter of support to U.S. Department of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo appears below:Dear Secretary Raimondo:I am pleased to write in support of the application submitted by Binghamton University to the US Economic Development Administration.With funding, Binghamton University will establish a program to attract foreign companies to the region to bolster the manufacturing and supply chain ecosystems.

Binghamton University will pursue an approach to combine individualized training with on-site support of candidate companies and match the companies with students at Binghamton and Cornell Universities, providing the students with real-life training, while helping candidate companies solve challenges associated with establishing operations in the U.S. The company training delivered will leverage university, community, industry, and government resources and assets that will generate outcomes to meet our shared objectives of deepening the pool of manufacturing companies and local talent, while matching the talent with the workforce needs of the companies, thus spurring economic activity and creating jobs.I applaud Binghamton University for their foresight, and sincerely hope the application meets with your approval.Thank you for your consideration.Sincerely,###

Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand announced that the USMCA panel has ruled in favor of the United States that Canada is breaching its USMCA dairy commitments. The senators said this ruling will allow Upstate New York dairy farmers, many who are still struggling from the economic impacts of the pandemic, to fully benefit from the expanded market access opportunities and will eliminate unfair practices that hurt their bottom lines.   “Dairy farmers are the lifeblood of the Upstate economy, and today’s ruling is a massive win for them,” said Senator Schumer. “Dairy farmers in New York and across the country are still being squeezed by the economic impacts of the pandemic, and now more than ever depend on stable and fair rules to compete equitably in the nearby Canadian market. This decision will ensure the Upstate New York dairy industry fully benefits from the USMCA agreement’s expanded market access opportunities, unimpeded by unreasonable trade barriers, and will help our dairy farmers churn up profits and mitigate the huge losses they have suffered this year.”“Today is a huge win for New York’s dairy farmers. Canada’s violation of USMCA dairy provisions was putting New York’s regional economies at risk, and this decision will hold our trading partners accountable and ensure equitable trading practices are upheld moving forward,” said Senator Gillibrand. “Dairy is New York’s primary agricultural product and this win is needed now more than ever as economic disruptions from the pandemic continue hurting industry. I will always work to ensure our dairy farmers have access to fair trade opportunities.”The senators explained that under USMCA, Canada agreed to an expansion of tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) for several categories of U.S. dairy products. TRQs are a system of tariffs negotiated between countries that allow a predetermined quantity of imports at a specified and often very low tariff rate. Imports above the predetermined quantity are subject to a higher tariff rate that typically prices U.S. dairy products out of the Canadian market. Because of this, securing fair access to Canadian dairy TRQs is vital to ensuring New York’s farmers have equitable access to that market.Schumer, supported by New York milk producers including Cayuga Milk Ingredients and O-AT-KA Milk Products, raised concerns in June 2020 that the unfair way Canada was allocating its TRQs weakened the intent of the USMCA and as a result, New York dairy farmers and exporters were unable to make full use of USMCA’s benefits. The landmark decision found Canada is improperly restricting access to its market for U.S. dairy products in violation of its commitments.A copy of Schumer and Gillibrand’s original September 2020 letter to Ambassador Lighthizer and Secretary Perdue appears below:Dear Ambassador Lighthizer and Secretary Perdue:With the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) now in effect as of July 1, we write urging you to ensure that both Canada and Mexico are held accountable to their dairy trade obligations in the agreement. It is of particular importance that dairy farmers in New York and across the country – many of whom are struggling as a result of this unprecedented economic crisis – fully benefit from the expanded market access opportunities and the elimination of unfair practices under USMCA.  We have heard concerns from the New York dairy industry regarding Canada’s recent allocation of tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) for U.S. exports of several categories of dairy products, including milk, cheese, and yogurt. While the new tariff-rate quota commitments were intended to provide U.S. dairy producers with greater access to Canada’s dairy market, it is our understanding that Canada’s announced TRQs place U.S. producers at a disadvantage and are inconsistent with the market access provisions secured in agreement. Canada cannot be allowed to evade its trade obligations in order to protect its tightly-controlled dairy market and must fairly administer its TRQs as agreed to under USMCA.Another key issue is ensuring the full elimination of Canada’s Class 6 and 7 milk price classification programs, which was a top priority of ours during the USMCA negotiations. As you are aware, Class 6 and 7 are market-distorting supply management programs that allow for the dumping of Canadian milk products onto the global market at artificially low prices, causing significant harm to New York dairy producers. While it was encouraging to see the elimination of these programs included in the final agreement, there are outstanding concerns from the U.S. dairy industry about Canada providing sufficient transparency on dairy pricing, which is critical for establishing a baseline against which the U.S. can evaluate Canada’s new post-Class 6 and 7 pricing policies, as well as with how Canada implements its USMCA dairy export surcharge commitments. There must be vigilant monitoring to ensure Canada complies with its commitment to eliminate these programs with full transparency, and in a manner that does not reproduce the programs’ harmful effects through different means.Additionally, in a side letter accompanying USMCA, Mexico affirmed a list of more than 30 terms for cheese that would remain available as common names for U.S. cheese producers when exporting to Mexico. It is critical that our domestic producers continue to have the opportunity to sell products to consumers in Mexico using common cheese names and that New York dairy exporters do not lose the valuable market share they have spent years fighting for. As such, Mexico must translate its USMCA commitments into regulations in a way that ensures commonly-used cheese names specified in the agreement are respected.Our hardworking dairy producers in New York and across the U.S. deserve to fully benefit from the provisions secured in USMCA. We therefore ask for your commitment to raise these concerns with your government counterparts in Canada and Mexico as soon as practicable and to take the appropriate enforcement measures going forward to ensure both countries’ dairy trade obligations are upheld.Sincerely, ###

Schumer announced that the recently-signed American Rescue Plan includes $480,249,023 that will guide Upstate New York’s pandemic-battered airports and transit systems to lift off. Specifically, Upstate airports will receive $84,410,140, and Upstate transit systems will receive $395,838,883 of the total amount.Schumer said that as the COVID crisis extends beyond what was initially estimated, impacting the air travel industry and public transportation systems for months on end, the federal funding allocated for them in the American Rescue Plan will help transportation systems keep their wheels turning while New York recovers from the pandemic and returns to ‘normal’.“Air travel and public transportation are among the most severely impacted industries amid the pandemic, and both are vital to the connectivity and success of the Upstate economy,” said Senator Schumer. “Airports and transit systems serve important functions in their communities, especially in more rural areas, connecting communities and residents and allowing for economic opportunities to cruise in. As Majority Leader, I was proud to make transportation funding a priority and the American Rescue Plan will deliver this much needed aid to keep Upstate residents connected. Help is on the way that will put Upstate New York’s transportation on the road to recovery.”Schumer explained that the funding announced today will be allocated by the Department of Transportation (DOT) and includes $12.5 million for the New York State DOT Rural 5311 program. This program aims to support public transportation in areas with populations of less than 50,000 people and funds may be used for capital and operating assistance grants to local public bodies, tribes, and operators of intercity bus services in rural areas.This funding is in addition to the $143,980,632 Schumer secured for upstate airports and $395,239,378 for upstate transit in the past relief bills. In total, Schumer has now secured over $624,229,655  for upstate airports and  $624,472,505 for transit in the past year.Estimated breakdowns of the $480 million going to Upstate New York airports and transit systems can be found below:AIRPORTSAIRPORT NAMEGRAND TOTALAlbany International$13,395,263Plattsburgh International$2,158,652Columbia County$59,000Saratoga County$59,000Floyd Bennett Memorial$59,000Schenectady County$59,000Adirondack Regional$59,000Fulton County$32,000Ticonderoga Municipal$22,000Piseco$22,000Lake Placid$22,000Malone-Dufort$22,000Syracuse Hancock International$12,209,054Ogdensburg International$1,155,748Watertown International$1,130,240Massena International-Richards Field$59,000Potsdam Municipal/Damon Field$59,000Griffiss International$59,000Oswego County$32,000Cortland County-Chase Field$32,000Hamilton Municipal$32,000Greater Rochester International$12,061,336Penn Yan$59,000Perry-Warsaw$32,000Finger Lakes Regional$32,000Dansville Municipal$32,000Genesee County$32,000Canandaigua$32,000Westchester County$8,908,599New York Stewart International$4,050,393Orange County$32,000Sullivan County International$32,000Warwick Municipal$32,000Joseph Y Resnick$32,000Hudson Valley Regional$32,000Elmira/Corning Regional$2,498,550Ithaca Tompkins Regional$1,980,173Greater Binghamton/Edwin A Link Field$1,220,370Corning-Painted Post$32,000Tri-Cities$32,000Wellsville Municipal Airport, Tarantine Field$32,000Sidney Municipal$32,000Albert S.

Schumer explained how each of these pieces of the legislation will help artists and live venues, like Elsewhere, stay afloat throughout the pandemic. Schumer said independent venues and artists are the beating heart New York’s cultural life and a driving force in the economy, and the COVID package that he negotiated, prioritizes the venues and everyone who supports them as the critical cultural hubs that they are.“I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, independent venues, like theaters and concert halls, are the beating heart of New York’s cultural life and a driving force in the economy,” said Senator Schumer. “These local businesses were among the first to shut down at the start of the pandemic, have been struggling to stay afloat, and will be among the last to reopen. The COVID package that I negotiated, prioritizes the venues and everyone who supports them as the critical cultural hubs that they are.”“In our hearts, we are not only artists, but workers. I want to take you back to that moment when all of the arts, entertainment, and media industry was shut down. The lights went off in movie theaters. No more bright light reflected off movie screens. All music venues closed. Broadway and  live theater shut down - not just in New York, but all across the country. The people who make their living making the things that make life fun; who bring stories to life, had to stop working. But Senator Schumer was there. Senator Schumer immediately reached out to labor unions in this state and around the country to ask how he could help. And that matters - because we won’t have a real recovery until we bring back business and help the working people in New York State and this country. Real recovery means bringing back the arts and the American Rescue Plan is an important first step,” said SAG-AFTRA Vice President, New York Local President, Rebecca Damon.Schumer added, “The dedicated federal assistance to independent venues ensures that when it is safe to do so, we can gather again for comedy, music, theater, and movies and to once again enjoy the cultural institutions that have been around for generations. The final COVID relief package will help these places keep the lights and the laughs on, and keep the curtain from closing on New York City.”Schumer said that live venues are a part of one of the hardest hit industries right now, and the dedicated assistance will save many venues from permanently shutting their doors to the public. The senator said the federal assistance was imperative because independent venues not only drive economic activity within communities through restaurants, hotels, taxis and other transportation and retail establishments, but live events provide 75% of all artists’ income.Schumer explained how the American Rescue Plan (ARP) benefits artists who are out of work and cultural hubs throughout the state struggling to stay afloat. Specifically, ARP covers 100 percent of costs for the COBRA health insurance program which will help workers who lost their job through no fault of their own retain their health insurance. Additionally, the legislation provides multiple sources of critical relief to struggling independent live venues, movie theaters and cultural institutions by allowing eligible entities under the Save Our Stages program to get a PPP loan and a Shuttered Venue Operators Grant, and it included $1.25 billion in additional funding for the program, on top of the $15 billion Schumer secured in December. The bill also provides billions in additional federal relief for struggling New Yorkers by extending the historic unemployment insurance reforms established in the CARES Act, through September 6, 2021. It continues the critical lifeline of the enhanced federal unemployment assistance, providing an additional $300 per week on top of all state and federal unemployment benefits. The bill extends the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program for the self-employed, gig workers, freelancers and others in non-traditional employment, as well as the additional weeks of federal unemployment insurance for workers who exhaust their regular state benefits.Previously, in December 2020, Schumer negotiated the Save Our Stages Act into the bipartisan COVID relief package, which provided $15 billion nationally for independent live venue operators, independent movie theaters, and cultural institutions such as live performing arts organizations and museums that have been significantly impacted by the economic effects of the COVID crisis. Specifically, the COVID relief package created a new Small Business Administration (SBA) grant program which independent live venue operators, promoters, producers, talent representatives, independent movie theaters, and cultural institutions are eligible for. These grants can be used for payroll costs, rent, mortgage, utilities, and personal protective equipment, and other needs, and will help keep the industry alive and rebound as New York emerges from the pandemic.###

Schumer today announced, following a call with the CEOs of IBM and Intel, that a collaboration between the two companies for a major new investment in the domestic semiconductor industry is expected to add hundreds of new jobs to the Capital Region at IBM’s Albany Research Center and its research and industry partners in the area. The senator revealed that as Intel expands its domestic manufacturing operations, they will conduct new semiconductor research in advanced semiconductor technology working with IBM’s Albany Semiconductor Research Facility. “This major new collaboration between Intel and IBM’s Albany Research Center is a job-creating match made in Upstate heaven and highlights IBM’s deep history and investments in the semiconductor industry, as well as the world-renowned talent of the nearly 1,000 strong semiconductor workforce at IBM and the broader set of industry and research partners in the Capital Region,” said Senator Schumer. “The Capital Region is the perfect place to conduct semiconductor R&D and expand the country’s leadership in competitiveness in next generation chip research and manufacturing. IBM and Intel’s historic collaboration will not only help shore up our domestic production of semiconductor technology, but it also positions Upstate New York for even more semiconductor manufacturing jobs, a point I made to the Intel CEO as they consider building out their manufacturing operations. With this new partnership, our Capital Region’s powerhouse workforce is ready to lead the U.S. semiconductor industry’s cutting edge new development and Upstate New York is further positioned for more semiconductor manufacturing investment from companies like Intel.”IBM’s CEO shared on the call that this Intel collaboration with their Albany research facility will support hundreds of new jobs at IBM and across industry and research partners in the Capital Region. IBM also is planning to apply for funding from the U.S. Department of Commerce National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC) program authorized in last year’s NDAA. The NSTC is meant to be a hub for industry, academia and the broader research community, and government to come together to serve as a hub for conducting advanced semiconductor research and prototyping that strengthens the domestic semiconductor ecosystem.  The new partnership with Intel further positions IBM to compete for the NSTC. Schumer is leading a push in the Senate to fund the NSTC and the other federal semiconductor incentives authorized in the NDAA to begin to implement those programs.“Senator Schumer has been a tireless advocate for accelerating America's progress in advanced technologies and we are grateful for his leadership,"" said Arvind Krishna, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IBM. ""The semiconductor technology ecosystem we have assembled in Albany is uniquely positioned to deliver rapid new breakthroughs that will catalyze the economic and societal benefits of AI, quantum computing and other technologies while transforming industries. We look forward to bidding for the NSTC, which would drive innovation at an even faster pace and double the 1,000-plus strong semiconductor innovation workforce in and around Albany.”Schumer has led the effort to create a historic new federal investment in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and R&D.  Last year, Schumer unveiled his bipartisan American Foundries Act to bolster U.S. leadership in semiconductor and broader microelectronics industries. He successfully added this bill as an amendment in July 2020 to the Senate’s Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The new programs included in NDAA will increase federal support for semiconductor manufacturing by providing new federal incentives to conduct advanced research and development of semiconductor technology, including the creation of the NSTC, secure the supply chain, and ensure national and economic security by reducing reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturing. Schumer is now pushing for Senate consideration of emergency funding to implement the NDAA semiconductor programs, an effort that may come to the Senate floor next month as part of the consideration of his bipartisan Endless Frontier Act, which invests in U.S. research and technology leadership.###

These funds, provided in the American Rescue Plan, will give New York’s CHCs the support needed to expand COVID-19 vaccination, testing, and treatment for underserved populations. CHCs are on the frontline of health care in the United States, particularly in rural and underserved areas, and provide a critical health care safety net during times of crisis. Throughout the pandemic, these health centers have provided their communities with testing, tracing, vaccine preparedness, and other health services. “New York’s Community Health Centers are a cornerstone of the state’s healthcare system and have been our frontline armor in the battle against COVID-19, especially in underserved and disadvantaged communities where COVID hit the hardest,” said Senator Schumer. “This critical federal investment, that I fought to secure in the American Rescue Plan, will help Community Health Centers maintain their vital operations, providing health care to those at high risk of contracting COVID-19, and continuing to administer vaccines to as many New Yorkers as possible.”“In the midst of this global pandemic, people across New York are turning to Community Health Centers for affordable primary and preventative health care,” said Senator Gillibrand. “CHCs provide a wide-range of services to some of our most underserved populations and this funding will help address the pandemic challenge and the health disparities it has exacerbated within our communities and ensure these centers can continue providing quality care to every New York community. Due to strained financial resources, hundreds of these vital centers have been faced with closure when health care services are needed more than ever. I am proud to have fought and helped secured this funding in the American Rescue Plan, and I will continue fighting to provide CHCs with the critical resources they need to thrive.“Every American should have the security of knowing they have access to quality, affordable health care, especially as we face a pandemic that has exposed the disparities facing rural, minority, and lower- income communities,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “The Biden Administration is committed to getting help to those who need it most, and the communities hit hardest by COVID-19 will benefit from these critical investments.”Earlier this year, Senator Gillibrand fought for billions in funding for CHCs and helped successfully secured $7.66 billion in the American Rescue Plan to help CHCS prepare for and respond to public health crises. CHCs provide affordable primary and preventative health care to the most vulnerable and underserved communities. Over 30 million patients, including almost 400,000 veterans and almost 9 million children, receive quality medical, dental, vision, and behavioral health care services from a CHC. CHCs employ over 250,000 full-time employees nationally, produce nearly $63.5 billion in economic activity, and save our health care system more than $24 billion per year (facts and figures prior to the pandemic). CHCs also help people access healthy food, safe housing, and affordable transportation. In the midst of the addiction epidemic, CHCs are well-positioned providers of substance use disorder and mental health treatment in communities. Services provided by CHCs help patients avoid unnecessary trips to the emergency room and reduce health disparities in our communities. Distribution of funding will begin in April through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). HRSA-funded health centers are community-based and patient-directed organizations that deliver affordable, accessible, quality, and cost-effective primary health care to high-need urban, rural, and frontier communities across the country. Health centers serve 1 in 5 people living in rural communities, and 1 in 11 people nationwide. More than 91% of health center patients are individuals or families living at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, and nearly 63% are racial or ethnic minorities.Specifically, this funding willFunding Recipients Listed Below:NYCRecipientCityCountyAward AmountTHE ADDABBO JOSEPH P FAMILY HEALTH CENTER INCArverneQueens County$7,014,375DAMIAN FAMILY CARE CENTERS, INC.JamaicaQueens County$2,290,750FLOATING HOSPITAL INCORPORATED (THE)Long Island CityQueens County$4,320,500BRONX COMMUNITY HEALTH NETWORK, INCBronxBronx County$16,116,750BRONXCARE HEALTH INTEGRATED SERVICES SYSTEM, INC.BronxBronx County$15,077,000LA CASA DE SALUD INC.BronxBronx County$1,387,875MONTEFIORE MEDICAL CENTERBronxBronx County$1,859,000MORRIS HEIGHTS HEALTH CENTER, INC.BronxBronx County$10,663,000UNION COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER, INC.BronxBronx County$5,786,875URBAN HEALTH PLAN, INC.BronxBronx County$17,060,750VOCATIONAL INSTRUCTION PROJECT COMMUNITY SERVICES, INC.BronxBronx County$877,125BEDFORD STUYVESANT FAMILY HEALTH CENTER, INC., THEBrooklynKings County$2,675,250BROOKLYN PLAZA MEDICAL CENTERBrooklynKings County$1,479,500BROWNSVILLE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONBrooklynKings County$3,827,500COMMUNITY HEALTH INITIATIVES INC.BrooklynKings County$968,750EZRA MEDICAL CENTERBrooklynKings County$4,056,625HEALTHCARE CHOICES NY, INC.BrooklynKings County$1,099,375HOUSING WORKS HEALTH SERVICES III, INC.BrooklynKings County$1,881,500ODA PRIMARY HEALTH CARE CENTER, INC.BrooklynKings County$8,916,750SUNSET PARK HEALTH COUNCIL, INC.BrooklynKings County$24,518,750APICHA COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERNew YorkManhattan$1,490,375BETANCES HEALTH CENTERNew YorkManhattan$1,398,125CARE FOR THE HOMELESSNew YorkManhattan$2,283,125CHARLES B.

Schumer announced that New York state will receive more than $1,014,599,305 in emergency rental assistance as part of the Schumer-led American Rescue Plan. Schumer said the additional rental assistance, on top of the previous $1 billion secured in the emergency COVID package in December, can help hundreds of thousands of working families across New York who are facing crushing debt burdens and may be at risk of being evicted at the end of the month without an extension of the federal eviction moratorium.“During a time in history with endless uncertainties for New Yorkers, safe and secure housing shouldn’t be one. For hard-working New Yorkers throughout the state, the end of every month is a day they dread for weeks prior. Without this critical federal aid, too many families would be unable to make their rent and utility payments and would be faced with an unmanageable debt burden and the prospect of being thrown out of their homes when the federal eviction moratorium expires,” said Senator Schumer. “This rental assistance could not come soon enough for those families who are facing the threat of eviction and skyrocketing debt. New Yorkers deserve to be healthy, safe, and secure – in their own homes – and the over $2 billion I have delivered for New York over the past few months will work to keep the roof over the heads of our working families throughout the crisis and beyond.”Schumer revealed that the dollars from rental assistance can be used to cover past-due rent, as well as future rent payments and utility expenses, including internet. The over $1 billion the senator is announcing today is on top of the $1.3 billion in rental assistance he has already delivered for New York in previous COVID negotiations.New York state and localities will see over 5% of the $20 billion national pot designated for rental assistance. Additionally, New York will receive even more in rental assistance as the allocations for the additional $2.5 billion in rental assistance for “high need” states and localities is calculated by the Department of the Treasury.A breakdown of direct rental assistance to New York’s localities appears below.

https://www.schumer.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/schumer-ocasio-cortez-announce-critical-new-details-on-fema-funeral-assistance-program,"Maximum Financial Assistance Will Now Be $9,000 Per FuneralSchumer, Ocasio-Cortez: Now Is The Time For Applicants To Gather Relevant DocumentationApplication Expected To Open In Early AprilWASHINGTON, D.C. - The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shared additional information about the funeral assistance program with the offices of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.   Most notably, FEMA shared that the maximum financial assistance will now be $9,000 per funeral.Additionally, FEMA will only award COVID-19 Funeral Assistance for a deceased individual on a single application. If multiple individuals contributed toward funeral expenses, they should register under a single application as applicant and co-applicant. The applicant or co-applicant must have incurred the funeral expenses. The deceased individual’s documentation status is not considered as part of the reimbursement process, but the applicant(s) must be U.S. citizens, legal residents, asylees, refugees, or non-citizen nationals.Now is the time for families to decide who the applicant and any co-applicants will be and to gather the documents they need to be reimbursed for expenses. Specifically, the applicant must provide the following documents: 1) a copy of the death certificate.The death certificate must indicate the death ""may have been caused by"" or ""was likely a result of"" COVID-19 or COVID-19-like symptoms. Similar phrases that indicate a high likelihood of COVID-19 are also considered sufficient.2) proof of funeral expenses incurred. Documentation (receipts, funeral home contract, etc.) must include the applicant's name as the responsible person for the expense, the deceased individual's name, the amount of funeral expenses, and that funeral expenses were incurred after January 20, 2020.  Eligible funeral expenses include but are not limited to:If applicants already received reimbursement for certain funeral expenses through government agencies, voluntary agencies, non-profits, burial or funeral insurance, they cannot resubmit those same expenses for reimbursement through this FEMA-administered program. If you received any outside assistance, you must include documentation of this assistance in your application. If you received financial assistance through the deceased’s life insurance policy, you may still apply for reimbursement. Senator Schumer and Representative Ocasio-Cortez have worked closely with FEMA to develop the funeral assistance program, after establishing and extending it through the December and March COVID-19 relief packages.“Too many families and friends across New York have paid the ultimate price with the tragic loss of their loved ones to the coronavirus. The economic upheaval and added financial strain of this pandemic makes the added cost of funerals and burials unbearable for so many who have already lost so much. This historic use of FEMA’s funeral assistance program is much needed aid to those who need it most, and that is why Rep. Ocasio-Cortez and I worked so hard to deliver this with FEMA—and we got it done. Now that the details are finalized, we are working to get the word out, to make sure eligible families know the application will open next month, how to prepare, and that help will be available through a dedicated 800 number, that will be announced soon,” said U.S. Senator Charles Schumer in a statement. “This effort began over a year ago when community leaders in NY-14 flagged the disparate impact of COVID-19 in working-class areas, compounded with the devastating economic impact of funeral expenses. I’m so relieved that soon our families will finally be able to access relief, and I’m grateful to FEMA for working with us to make this program inclusive, generous and easily accessible,” said Rep. Ocasio-Cortez in a statement. “At FEMA, our mission is to help people before, during, and after disasters,” Acting FEMA Administrator Robert Fenton said. “The COVID-19 pandemic has brought overwhelming grief to many. We cannot change the outcome of what has happened, but we are dedicated to helping families with the substantial cost of funerals and burials that so many weren’t expecting.”At this time, a deadline to apply for COVID-19 Funeral Assistance has not been established and we expect the application period to open in early April. Additional information on the Program can be found here, COVID-19 Funeral Assistance | FEMA.gov, and will be updated as more details become available.###

Schumer announced that the recently-signed American Rescue Plan includes an estimated $2.6 billion for New York’s public, private, and proprietary institutions of higher education.Schumer said that public and non-profit schools will use half of their award on emergency financial aid grants to students to help them with college costs and basic needs like housing, food, and healthcare. The other half of the funds will allow institutions to provide additional student support activities, and to cover a variety of institutional costs, including lost revenue, reimbursement for expenses already incurred, technology costs associated with a transition to distance education, faculty and staff trainings, and payroll. Proprietary schools must use their awards exclusively to provide financial aid grants to students.“As New York’s colleges, universities, and students face over a year of unprecedented hurdles, they do so at a steep cost that it is our responsibility to address and overcome. In prioritizing the health and safety of students, faculty, and staff, New York’s higher education institutions have ripped massive holes in their budgets and are now facing down financial devastation – and we simply can’t let that happen,” said Senator Schumer. “As Majority Leader, I was proud to make funding for New York’s higher education institutions and students a top priority, and the American Rescue Plan will deliver this much needed $2.6 billion in assistance to help our world-class institutions through the crisis, get students safely back to classes, and get campuses across the state back to ‘normal’.”This funding announced today is in addition to the $2.4 billion Schumer secured for New York’s institutions of higher education in the past COVID relief bills.

Schumer announced that the recently-signed American Rescue Plan includes $2.5 billion that will allow Upstate New York’s school districts to fill budget gaps, address learning loss, meet the needs of students with disabilities, assist students experiencing homelessness, provide summer enrichment and afterschool programs, and more.Schumer explained that after the COVID crisis forced schools to close, safely reopening them has and will continue to cost tens of thousands of dollars, and the federal funding allocated for them in the American Rescue Plan will help schools bring students back to their desks when New York recovers from the pandemic and returns to ‘normal’.“Everyone wants schools to reopen completely and for our children to be able to return to the classroom, but it needs to be done in a way that is safe for students, families, educators, and learning institutions,” said Senator Schumer. “COVID brought unprecedented challenges that have cost a year of learning and development for students—challenges disproportionately felt by students of color, students from low-income families, students with disabilities, and more. As Majority Leader, I was proud to make funding for our schools a priority, and the American Rescue Plan will deliver this much needed aid to get Upstate students back in school. Help is on the way for Upstate New York’s schools put behind the curve by the pandemic.”“Thanks to Congress passing the American Rescue Plan Act, school districts can look ahead with renewed confidence that they will be able to deliver for their students in the coming year and beyond. NYSSBA and its members have consistently advocated for additional stimulus funding, and the $9 billion for New York’s K-12 schools will help students emerge in a positive direction from a year of disruptions caused by the pandemic. The inclusion of more than $12 billion to support our state and local governments will be a great benefit for our school communities as well,"" said Robert Schneider, Executive Director of the New York State School Boards Association (NYSSBA).“The name American Rescue Plan says it all: This is a real rescue package for K-12 schools across New York as they continue to grapple with needs only exacerbated by this pandemic,” New York State United Teachers President, Andy Pallotta said. “From helping districts preserve existing academic services to getting kids the social-emotional supports they need to providing the funding needed to reopen more classrooms with the right safety measures in place, Sen. Schumer, Congress and the president have delivered for New York students yet again.”New York Senator Shelley Mayer, Chair of the Senate Education Committee said, “Thank you to Majority Leader Chuck Schumer for his hard work and persistence to ensure New York schools and students receive much needed support through the American Rescue Plan. This unprecedented federal funding will put us on the right path to recover from the devastation our school communities faced during the pandemic. I am committed to working with my colleagues to ensure that all federal aid will be used to supplement, rather than replace, state funding. The pandemic exacerbated disparities in our schools, and we must ensure that resources and staff are available to help students recover academically and work through mental and emotional health challenges. Thank you also to Majority Leader Schumer’s staff members for working closely with me in our efforts to secure additional education funds for our schools.” “The American Rescue Plan investment in public education comes at a critical juncture as our MCSBA school districts establish plans for the full reopening of our buildings. Without this funding, districts would continue to be forced to redirect resources for many of the unanticipated costs related to the pandemic. Now, our districts can focus on getting students and staff back safely, make determinations on how best to meet student needs moving forward and begin to focus on helping our communities see the opportunities for education beyond the pandemic. We are grateful to Senator Schumer for his leadership and his determination to make this substantial investment in order to improve the lives of our children and their families,” said Sherry Johnson, Executive Director of Monroe County School Boards Association.“The City School District of Albany is grateful beyond measure to Senate Majority Leader Schumer, as well as Senator Gillibrand and Congressman Tonko, for their leadership in helping to make the American Rescue Plan a reality for school districts and communities like ours nationwide,” said Superintendent of Albany City School District, Kaweeda G. Adams. “The fiscal loss and uncertainty we have experienced throughout the COVID-19 pandemic has been devastating to our ability to provide the academic and social-emotional programs and staffing we know our students and families need and deserve. This very welcomed and needed federal funding will help stabilize our organization throughout the COVID-19 recovery, and allow us to provide additional supports our students and families will need in the months and years ahead.”“We would like to thank Senator Schumer and everyone involved in securing this much needed funding.  Small, distressed school districts like Rensselaer have never needed support more than right now with the additional costs of keeping our students safe and providing them with the instructional support that they will need after this crazy year.  We are comforted in knowing that our voices of student advocacy in a small, high needs district were heard loud and clear,” said Joseph Kardash, Superintendent of Rensselaer City School District.“The announcement of this federal stimulus is a bright spot in an otherwise challenging year.  This funding will assist us in Syracuse with helping to address learning loss, social emotional supports for students and families, increased technology and minor building infrastructure needs.  I would like to thank Senator Chuck Schumer for his leadership and everyone who worked tirelessly to see that this funding was awarded as a part of the relief package,” said Jaime Alicea, Superintendent of Syracuse City School District.“We are so very grateful for Senator Schumer’s advocacy for additional funding for PK-12 education. The American Rescue Plan’s thoughtful inclusion of funding to support free access to the internet, ensure resources continue to be available to open schools safely, and parallel funding for our city ensures that families, as well as children will benefit. Funding at this level allows for our students to not only survive, but thrive as our schools gear up for the full return of students to our classrooms,” said Dr. Tonia Thompson, Superintendent of the Binghamton City School District.“We are extremely appreciative of Senator Schumer’s advocacy in securing funding for New York State as a part of the emergency legislative package, the American Rescue Plan.   His continued support and dedication to the great state of New York, more specifically, the education of New York’s youth, is an invaluable asset to the Middletown School Community.  School districts have been forced to respond to the pandemic in a variety of creative ways.  This funding will be used to support the continued emphasis on the health, safety, and well-being of our students.  Additionally, it will enable our district to continue to utilize our general funds for areas of highest need and use these funds to address educational disruptions due to the global pandemic,” said Richard Del Moro, Superintendent of Middletown City School District.  “We thank Senator Schumer for securing this critical funding for the Yonkers City School District in the American Rescue Plan. These funds will directly support our students, teachers, and staff as we begin to transition back to in-person learning, providing opportunities for focused instruction and, most importantly, to address our students social-emotional challenges that have risen over the past year,” said Dr. Edwin M. Quezada, Superintendent of Yonkers City School District.This funding is in addition to the $5 billion Schumer secured for New York school districts in the past COVID relief bills. In total, Schumer has secured over $14 billion for New York school districts in the past year.Schumer previously visited the Finger Lakes, North Country, Central New York, Western New York, Southern Tier, and Hudson Valley to advocate for federal funding for Upstate school districts.Estimated breakdown by region below and district-by-district breakdown here.RegionTotalCapital Region$219,738,000.00Southern Tier$227,876,000.00Western New York$481,551,000.00Hudson Valley$633,760,000.00Rochester-Finger Lakes$391,986,000.00Central New York$254,493,000.00Mohawk Valley$173,398,000.00North Country$134,948,000.00    Total$2,517,963,000 ###

Schumer today announced that the U.S. Postal Service has reached an agreement with local leaders and the post office on N. Tioga Street will remain in operation. The senator celebrated the decision, saying that the deal puts Ithaca’s businesses, organizations, and residents first and acknowledges the economic importance of the post office’s convenient location on the community.“Ithaca’s historic downtown post office is a pillar of the city’s business district, with countless residents and commercial institutions dependent on its central location and easy accessibility for their postal needs, which is why I called on the USPS to keep it right where it is,” said Senator Schumer. “I am pleased to hear that the USPS has worked with local leaders in good faith to ensure a long-term solution for the post office that boosts Ithaca. As Ithaca has grown over the years, the post office has been critical in keeping the community connected and will continue to help the region grow for years to come.”“The Town of Ithaca is pleased that we have negotiated a long-term lease that builds upon a twenty year history of having the U.S. Postal Service as a tenant and importantly, as a downtown Ithaca presence,” said Rod Howe, Ithaca Town Supervisor.A copy of Schumer’s letter to then-Postmaster Brennan, sent in February of 2020 to urge the USPS to work with local Ithaca leaders, appears below:Dear Postmaster General Brennan,I write on behalf of the businesses, organizations and residents of Ithaca, New York, regarding the potential relocation of their post office in downtown Ithaca. Moving the post office to outside the downtown would have a negative economic impact on the hundreds of businesses and community members, which depend on the facility for their postal needs. I strongly urge the USPS to quickly meet with local officials and stakeholders, and begin working with them to establish a mutually acceptable long-term solution.For years, Ithaca has greatly benefited from the convenience and centrality of its historic downtown post office. Ithaca is a pedestrian-oriented community, and the post office is in the heart of its central business district, with many businesses dependent on the ease of the downtown post office for their operations. The location also services many residents who are reliant on the post office’s accessibility and would be greatly hindered should it move to a more remote location. The City of Ithaca, the Town of Ithaca, and the Downtown Ithaca Alliance have all expressed both overwhelming support to preserve the post office’s downtown location and their willingness to work with the USPS in resolving this matter. This vast coalition demonstrates the great significance of this post office to the community and highlights the need for the USPS to come to the table and hear from local leaders.Given the importance of this post office, and the potential long-lasting impacts on the Ithaca community, I encourage the USPS to quickly address this issue and begin work to create a permanent solution in conjunction with local leaders, which preserves the accessibility of postal services to the residents and businesses of downtown Ithaca.  Thank you for your attention to this important request.Sincerely,###

Schumer today announced that after an extended delay, the Ogdensburg Bridge & Port Authority’s (OBPA) long-awaited port deepening and expansion project will begin in 2021. After initially securing funding from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to deepen the Ogdensburg Harbor’s channel in 2017, the development was delayed as OBPA sought additional funds to complete the second phase of the project, which includes dock wall and facility storage expansion. When a threat of having federal funding withdrawn emerged, Senator Schumer worked with USACE keep the federal funding locked in place while OBPA successfully secured additional funding from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT).“Whether it’s more business or increased shipments from current customers, the Ogdensburg Harbor will now, quite literally, be more open for business,” said Senator Schumer. “I was proud to work side-by-side with OBPA, NYSDOT and USACE to ensure that federal funding for this project was not withdrawn while additional funding was secured. With full funding now locked in place, this long awaited project will allow Port of Ogdensburg to continue to play a key role in the region’s economy.”The project consists of two phases. Phase One of the project includes deepening the Ogdensburg Harbor to ease congestion, reduce shipping costs and unlock new business opportunities. Currently, sediment backlog and shallow waters at the harbor has made the port’s main dock inaccessible for larger vessels and adds tens of thousands of dollars to shipping costs. Funding for this project is costs shared 65% federal and 35% non-federal, with the total project costing $6.9 million. Phase Two of the project would add 500 feet to the port’s west side dock wall to create a second vessel berth at seaway depth and expand storage facilities for increased cargo. Taken together, the deepening, dock upgrades and storage expansion would enable two or more ships to come to port and unload their cargo. Currently, the port can handle only one ship at a time.Planning for the project dates back to 2011 when USACE initiated a feasibility study and determined that there was federal interest in deepening the port. Sen. Schumer visited Ogdensburg in 2016 to push for federal approval of the project and sent a letter to the acting assistant secretary of the Army for civil works urging him to sign the pending Project Partnership Agreement with the OBPA, which was ultimately finalized in 2017. Over the past several years, Schumer worked with OBPA, NYSDOT and USACE to keep federal funding from being withdrawn while additional funds were secured to complete both phases of the project.###

Schumer detailed the benefits available to the Hudson Valley’s live venues, performers, and artists through the American Rescue Plan, including critical relief to struggling independent live venues, movie theaters, and cultural institutions, increased COBRA health insurance benefits, and additional federal relief for struggling New Yorkers, including gig workers and others in non-traditional employment.Schumer explained how each of these pieces of legislation will help artists, performers, and live venues, like the HVSF, stay afloat throughout the pandemic. Schumer said independent venues, performers, and artists are the beating heart of the Hudson Valley’s cultural life and a driving force in the local economy, and the COVID package that he negotiated, prioritizes the venues and everyone who supports them as the critical cultural hubs that they are.“I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, independent venues, like theaters and concert halls, are the beating heart of the Hudson Valley’s cultural life and a driving force in the economy,” said Senator Schumer. “Far too many seasonal local venues, like the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival, had to cancel their 2020 season because of the pandemic, and they've been struggling to stay afloat. The COVID package that I negotiated, prioritizes these venues and everyone who supports them as the critical cultural hubs that they are.”Schumer added, “The dedicated federal assistance to independent venues ensures that when it is safe to do so, we can gather again for comedy, music, theater, and movies and to once again enjoy the cultural institutions that have been around for generations. The final COVID relief package will help these places keep the lights and the laughs on, and keep the curtain from closing on Putnam County.”Schumer said that live venues are a part of one of the hardest-hit industries right now, and the dedicated assistance will save many venues from permanently shutting their doors to the public. The senator said the federal assistance was imperative because independent venues not only drive economic activity within communities through restaurants, hotels, taxis, and other transportation and retail establishments, but live events provide 75% of all artists’ income.""COVID-19 left the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival completely dark in the summer of 2020 - it was devastating for our theater to lose 100% of earned income and for our community to lose the beloved summertime ritual of gathering together under our Theater Tent,"" said Kate Liberman, Managing Director of the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival. ""Save Our Stages will allow us to reopen. Our audience and seasonal staff of artists, many of whom spent this past year out of work, will once again contribute to the Hudson Valley's economy through spending at local restaurants, small businesses, and more.  We are thrilled to be able to be one of the first theaters to reopen in New York State, reinvigorating the local economy, and \once again safely gathering with our community in the powerful act of theater making. We are incredibly grateful to Senator Schumer for his efforts in bringing our iconic open-air Theater Tent back to the grounds of the Boscobel this summer.""Founded in 1987, Schumer explained that the HVSF has presented repertory theatre under its iconic open-air Theater Tent each summer for over 35,000 audience members, while also reaching over 30,000 students, families, and educators in schools and communities throughout the Hudson Valley. The HVSF audience is mostly comprised of local, Hudson Valley residents and its annual economic impact is estimated at $4.6 million per year. On top of the annual HVSF audience of nearly 35,000 supporting local small businesses as they go out to dinner and shop along Main Street, the HVSF is one of the largest employers in western Putnam County. The HVSF's160-person seasonal staff of directors, designers, actors, technicians, ushers, concessionaires, and more, consists of local and national union talent. These staff members live, work, and play in the community during the summer season leaving a significant impact on local small businesses. HVSF was completely dark in the summer of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Schumer explained how the American Rescue Plan (ARP) benefits artists who are out of work and cultural hubs throughout the state struggling to stay afloat. Specifically, ARP covers 100 percent of costs for the COBRA health insurance program which will help workers who lost their job through no fault of their own retain their health insurance. Additionally, the legislation provides multiple sources of critical relief to struggling independent live venues, movie theaters, and cultural institutions by allowing eligible entities under the Save Our Stages program to get a PPP loan and a Shuttered Venue Operators Grant, and it included $1.25 billion in additional funding for the program, on top of the $15 billion Schumer secured in December. The bill also provides billions in additional federal relief for struggling New Yorkers by extending the historic unemployment insurance reforms established in the CARES Act, through September 6, 2021. It continues the critical lifeline of the enhanced federal unemployment assistance, providing an additional $300 per week on top of all state and federal unemployment benefits. The bill extends the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program for the self-employed, gig workers, freelancers, and others in non-traditional employment, as well as the additional weeks of federal unemployment insurance for workers who exhaust their regular state benefits.Previously, in December 2020, Schumer negotiated the Save Our Stages Act into the bipartisan COVID relief package, which provided $15 billion nationally for independent live venue operators, independent movie theaters, and cultural institutions such as live performing arts organizations and museums that have been significantly impacted by the economic effects of the COVID crisis. Specifically, the COVID relief package created a new Small Business Administration (SBA) grant program for independent live venue operators, promoters, producers, talent representatives, independent movie theaters, and cultural institutions. These grants can be used for payroll costs, rent, mortgage, utilities, and personal protective equipment, and other needs, and will help keep the industry alive and rebound as the Hudson Valley emerges from the pandemic. According to the HVSF, Save Our Stages will be a lifeline for reopening so that HVSF’s audience and large seasonal staff of artists, who have spent the last year out of work, can once again contribute to the Hudson Valley economy through spending at local restaurants, small businesses, and more.  Schumer also briefly discussed other wins for Putnam County in the American Rescue Plan. Out of the estimated more than $100 billion headed to New York, the Putnam County and the Hudson Valley will receive:Putnam County and the Hudson Valley will also receive a sizable portion of the following funds:###

Schumer said, “I have made it a top priority to work with President Biden to prioritize the absolute necessity of making a major investment in the nation’s semiconductor domestic manufacturing and R&D, which can also fuel new high-paying jobs across Upstate New York. President Biden delivered on my requests with his inclusion of $50 billion to implement the new federal semiconductor manufacturing and R&D programs, that I fought for and passed into law in last year’s defense authorization bill. With the industry’s top companies considering expansion and new investment at New York sites like STAMP in Western New York, White Pines in Central New York, Marcy Nanocenter in the Mohawk Valley, and Luther Forest in the Capital Region, we have no time to waste, so I want to move quickly to pass this funding to support the semiconductor industry’s plans to invest in the U.S., enhance our global competitiveness, promote our national security, and create thousands of new jobs. As I announced weeks ago, I am working to bring to the Senate floor this spring a competitiveness package that includes my bipartisan Endless Frontier Act to invest in American innovation and manufacturing. As part of this legislative effort, I am working with members of both parties and the administration to include emergency spending to fully fund the federal semiconductor manufacturing and R&D programs authorized in the defense bill.”###

Schumer (D-NY) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and U.S. Representatives Paul Tonko (D-NY-20) and John Katko (R-NY-24) called on the Biden administration to invest in U.S. semiconductor production by funding federal semiconductor manufacturing and R&D incentive provisions that were signed into law as part of the FY21 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The lawmakers are urging the administration to fund and implement these important provisions to increase federal support for semiconductor manufacturing, provide new federal incentives to conduct advanced research and development of semiconductor technology, secure the supply chain, and strengthen national and economic security by reducing reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturing. “The economic and national security risks posed by relying too heavily on foreign semiconductor suppliers cannot be ignored, and Upstate New York, which has a robust semiconductor industry, is the perfect place to grow domestic semiconductor R&D and manufacturing by leaps and bounds,” said Senator Schumer. “America must continue to invest in our domestic semiconductor industry in order to keep good-paying, high-tech American manufacturing jobs here in Upstate New York. We now must move quickly to pass the necessary funding to stand up the programs we passed into law last year and bring us one step closer to ensuring our domestic semiconductor industry can safely and securely supply our military, intelligence agencies, and other government needs. This is a step essential to growth in high-tech R&D, manufacturing, and jobs across Upstate New York and to our national security and U.S. leadership in this critical industry. I am making it a top priority for the Senate to swiftly act to pass emergency spending to implement these critical bipartisan semiconductor incentives.""“For years, a global chip shortage has impacted U.S. manufacturing, slowed shipments of consumer electronics, forced our country to rely on foreign manufacturers, and called into question the security and integrity of American supply chains. The CHIPS provisions that became law last year are essential steps to reestablish the United States as a leader in semiconductor technology and strengthen our economy,” said Senator Gillibrand. “While I’m urging the Biden administration to prioritize funding for these important policies, more must be done. I will keep working with my colleagues in Congress to bolster investment in our domestic chip industry and address the vulnerabilities in domestic manufacturing and critical supply chains.”“Bold new investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing are also investments in creating good-paying jobs, in our economic strength and national security, and in American leadership and competitiveness abroad,” Congressman Tonko said. “Our bipartisan CHIPS for America Act takes needed action that will help shore up America's semiconductor supply chains and propel our global competitiveness in this vital industry and many others that depend on it. I’m proud to stand with my New York colleagues in pushing this legislation forward and urge all of our nation’s leaders to join us, implement its provisions and help propel a new, brighter future of American manufacturing.”“I’m glad to join Senators Gillibrand and Schumer in an effort urging President Biden to fully fund initiatives outlined in the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act, a bipartisan measure that was included in the FY2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and passed with my support. In Central New York, companies like SRC, SAAB, and Lockheed Martin rely on semiconductors to develop technology used by the military and in national security missions. What’s more, the local production of semiconductors has the potential to continue growing our regional economy and provide highly skilled, good-paying jobs. The CHIPS Act aims to advance domestic semiconductor research and production to reduce our reliance on foreign-produced semiconductors, secure our supply chain, grow the economy, and create more local jobs. To achieve these goals, we must commit to fully funding programs authorized under the CHIPS Act,” said Rep. Katko.Semiconductors enable nearly all industrial activities, including systems that undergird U.S. technological competitiveness and national security. Semiconductor design and manufacturing is a global enterprise with materials, design, fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging operating across national borders. In the modern age, U.S. strength in semiconductor technology and fabrication is vital to U.S. economic and national security interests. However, the number of U.S firms involved in semiconductors and related device manufacturing has dropped and the U.S only accounts for approximately 12% of global semiconductor production capacity. This reduction in the number of firms is largely a result of industry consolidation and a lack of federal investment to ensure American competitiveness in the industry. Additionally, American companies continue to outsource manufacturing while foreign governments have aggressively subsidized production. The provisions passed in FY21 NDAA will increase federal support for semiconductor manufacturing by providing new federal incentives to conduct advanced research and development of semiconductor technology, secure the supply chain, and strengthen national and economic security by reducing reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturing. Full funding and implementation of the provisions based off of the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act would help reinvigorate the economy by creating high-paying jobs, developing talent pipelines for American workers, and increasing technological innovation. The CHIPS provisions would deliver essential funding for manufacturing, advanced research and development and job-training programs for semiconductor technology, and it would expand employment opportunities for disadvantaged workers. If enacted, the CHIPS provisions could support thousands of American jobs and have wide ranging benefits throughout the economy for countless industries, communities and working families.Schumer and Gillibrand have long-championed increased efforts to expand the domestic semiconductor and broader microelectronics industries, by sponsoring legislation like the bipartisan American Foundries Act, which they negotiated, in combination with pieces of the CHIPS Act, as an amendment to the FY2021 NDAA. The amendment included Schumer’s provision to bolster U.S. leadership in the semiconductor and broader microelectronics industries through federal programs, which must now be funded. Last month, Senator Gillibrand led a bipartisan call on the Biden administration to implement these provisions. Schumer has since announced that in the coming weeks, he will be bringing his bipartisan  Endless Frontier Act to the Senate floor for consideration as part of a broader competitiveness package that will include emergency spending to implement the NDAA semiconductor provisions.Full text of the letter can be found here and below.Dear President Biden,We write today to encourage you to prioritize securing funding to implement the initiatives authorized in the CHIPS for America Act that were enacted into law as part of the fiscal year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (referred to as the ‘CHIPS provisions’). We would specifically request you consider joining us in support of funding levels that are at least the authorized amounts proposed in the original bill as you work with Congress on a package of policies to better compete with China and how best to strengthen our country’s economic competitiveness and resiliency as well as national security. While signing your Executive Order on America’s Supply Chains on February 24, 2021, we were pleased to hear your comments: “bipartisan work has already been done…We need to make sure these supply chains are secure and reliable. I’m directing senior officials in my administration to work with industrial leaders to identify solutions to this semiconductor shortfall and work very hard with the House and Senate.” We agree that the United States must build on the bipartisan Congressional efforts to authorize the CHIPS provisions and now swiftly move to fund these programs so they can be implemented and begin to address the current supply-chain vulnerabilities that threaten our national and economic security and ensure our nation’s continued global leadership in this critical technology. We are especially encouraged by the opportunity to do emergency mandatory funding for implementation of CHIPS as part of a competitiveness package the Senate is currently compiling, and would welcome your support in that effort.The United States cannot wait to provide these resources over the years ahead. The halted production lines for consumer technology, auto manufacturers, truckers, and other critical industries due to a semiconductor shortage further highlights the pressing need to act quickly and fund the enacted bipartisan provisions. In your Build Back Better initiative, you recognized the value of restoring critical supply chains to U.S. soil to help revitalize our domestic manufacturing capacity and create good-paying jobs. Full funding and implementation of CHIPS would reinvigorate our economy by creating high-paying jobs, developing talent pipelines for American workers, and increasing technological innovation. The CHIPS provisions authorize funding for manufacturing, R&D and job-training programs, with a focus on creating pathways for Americans to acquire the skills necessary for these jobs, including expanding employment opportunities for disadvantaged workers. Ensuring these provisions are fully funded would support thousands of American jobs and create a ripple effect throughout the economy, benefiting countless industries, communities and working families.In addition to enabling sustainable economic growth today, funding the CHIPS provisions is a top national security priority. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has aggressive plans to reorient and dominate the semiconductor supply chain, pouring over $150 billion in semiconductor manufacturing subsidies and investing $1.4 trillion in their efforts to become the dominate global technological power. Even full funding of the originally filed CHIPS provisions pales in comparison to the investments being made by the CCP, which speaks to why consideration of an even higher level of funding is worthwhile.The United States must also work with our allies and strategic partners to out-scale the CCP in manufacturing capabilities for advanced semiconductors. If we lose these highly-skilled jobs and know-how to China, the United States will never recapture them. Further, we risk dependence on a strategic competitor for the advanced semiconductors that power our economy, military, and critical infrastructure. As you develop your FY 2022 budget request, we encourage you to include some initial investments to support semiconductor R&D and manufacturing at agencies like Commerce, DOD, DOE, and NSF as intended by CHIPS. Finally, should you explore executive actions to address this urgent semiconductor matter, we encourage you to continue pursuing a technology neutral approach.We are committed to meeting the national imperative of securing our critical supply chains and look forward to working with you and your Administration to achieve this vital objective.Sincerely,###

New Yorkers deserve to be healthy and secure in safe housing – and the millions of dollars I have delivered for Upstate New York over the past few months will work to provide a roof over the heads of our families throughout the crisis and beyond.”“Over the past year, financial strain from unemployment and health care bills have exacerbated circumstances for families already living paycheck to paycheck, leaving so many New Yorkers in dire housing situations,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This federal funding for homelessness assistance will help countless individuals facing housing insecurity access safe and affordable shelter as we continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and begin to rebuild our economy. I am proud to have fought for and helped secured this funding in the American Rescue Plan, and I will continue fighting for the resources are communities desperately need to stay safe during and after the pandemic.”Schumer and Gillibrand said the additional homelessness assistance, on top of the $108,099,079 secured in previous COVID packages, will help thousands of New York’s residents who have faced insurmountable challenges during the pandemic and are experiencing homelessness. Local governments will be able to use this funding to plan emergency, transition, and permanent housing alternatives to address the various specific needs of the people experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity in their communities.A breakdown of direct rental assistance to Upstate New York’s localities appears below.

https://www.schumer.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/gillibrand-schumer-call-on-usda-to-deliver-additional-relief-to-new-york-dairy-farmers-to-support-recovery-from-economic-crisis,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Chair of the Senate Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock and Dairy, and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer are calling on the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to provide additional relief to New York dairy farmers who have taken a financial hit during the COVID-19 crisis. The Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) was created last year to provide direct relief to farmers and help keep them afloat as agricultural markets, supply chains, and labor were upended in the wake of the pandemic. However, dairy farmers across the country received less support than other producers. The USDA provided dairy farmers with the smallest allocation of CFAP payments of the USDA’s four payment categories including acreage-based, sales commodities, livestock, and dairy. Dairy is the largest sector of New York’s agriculture industry — the state is the fourth largest producer of milk, and the largest producer of yogurt, cottage cheese and sour cream. In recent years, dairy farmers across New York State have struggled to keep up with declining prices and an unstable dairy market, and pandemic-related costs and slashed revenues have made it almost impossible for them to recover. Gillibrand and Schumer are urging the USDA to provide more direct payments and assistance to dairy farmers through new and existing programs, such as CFAP, to help reduce the strain on dairy farmers.  “Dairy farmers in New York State have been under financial strain for years due to an unstable market and unfair pricing -- now the economic toll of the pandemic has made it nearly impossible for many to recover. Hardworking small- and mid-sized farmers deserve relief and CFAP payments have been a lifeline for them,” said Senator Gillibrand. “Continuing these payments would not only give dairy farmers the relief they need as they continue to face the fallout of the pandemic, but also help stem the loss of dairy farms we are seeing across the Northeast. I will continue to urge the USDA to provide more direct payments and assistance to dairy farmers through new and existing programs, because these farms play a critical role in our food supply chain, in our economy, and in our communities.”“New York’s dairy farmers are the lifeblood of the Upstate economy and have been squeezed by the economic effects of the COVID-19 crisis,” said Senator Schumer. “For an industry that had razor thin margins before the pandemic, for some of our dairy farmers, receiving additional federal assistance is the difference between keeping their farms and losing their livelihoods. After many were forced to dump milk and lose out on revenue streams with school and restaurant closures, direct payments from CFAP were a lifeline for our dairy farmers and they must continue for New York’s dairy industry to recover from the economic devastation of the pandemic.”In April of 2020, the USDA announced the conception of CFAP, with funds provided by Congress, to assist farmers and consumers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Included in CFAP were direct payments to dairy farmers to offset pandemic-related economic losses for farmers. This assistance was critical to farmers, especially as many were forced to dump their milk after losing buyers and income. These payments were put on pause in January of 2021 when the administration announced it was doing a 60 day regulatory review. However, when the review was concluded, no further payments to dairy farmers were announced.Even before the pandemic dairy farmers across the nation were facing the challenges of volatile milk prices that have been dropping for decades, as well as increased competition from non-dairy “milk” products. This has led to a substantial loss of licensed dairy herds, with the United States losing almost 40,000 dairy herds since 2003. Prior to the 2018 Farm Bill, Class I milk was calculated using the “higher of” Class III or Class IV price plus the applicable Class I differential. This was changed in the most recent Farm Bill to an averaging method of Class III and Class IV plus $0.74. This change, compounded by government intervention in cheese markets as a result of the pandemic, has resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in lost income for dairy farmers from May 2019 through April 2021. This has led to increased calls from the industry for USDA to hold Emergency Federal Milk Marketing Order National Hearings to resolve this issue with the Class I mover. At the beginning of the 117th Congress, Senator Gillibrand was named as the Chair of the Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, Poultry, Local Food Systems, and Food Safety and Security. In this capacity, Gillibrand is committed to find ways to guarantee dairy farmers receive a fair price for their milk moving forward, and to recoup losses caused by the new Class I pricing formula.Full text of the letter can be found below.Dear Secretary Vilsack:We write today to urge USDA to take action to support dairy farmers and help them through the crisis they are facing.The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted dairy supply chains and has caused disruptive price volatility. Feed, labor, farm equipment, and energy costs have all increased as the result of the pandemic and contributed to lower profits for dairy farmers. In addition, dairy farmers have experienced challenges receiving a fair price for their milk as a result of the change to the Class I milk price formula in the 2018 Farm Bill which moved to an averaging method of Class III and Class IV prices plus $0.74, as opposed to the previous “higher of” method of determining fluid milk prices. This one change has caused dairy farmers collectively to lose out on $725 million dollars in income since the change was implemented in May 2019.1 During the pandemic, this adjustment curtailed the payments dairy farmers received when the government intervened in cheese markets with purchases made for the Farmers to Families Food Box Program. This made the Class III price rise sharply by 161 percent from June to September 2020, while Class IV prices rose only 19 percent during the same period, further shaking the stability of the market. All of these components have hampered dairy farmers’ ability to receive a fair price for their milk, and the only thing that has helped them offset some of their losses was the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) dairy payments.We appreciate USDA’s work to implement the relief for farmers provided by Congress, as well as the agency’s commitment to support dairy farmers during the COVID-19 pandemic across a variety of programs; however, this market distortion needs to be corrected. On March 24, 2021 USDA announced the new Pandemic Assistance for Producers initiative that established new programs and efforts to bring assistance to producers who have been impacted by COVID-19. This includes assistance to dairy farmers through the Dairy Donation Program, carrying out CFAP formula payments for cattle and eligible crops and reopening the CFAP 2 sign up period for producers that were not previously enrolled in the program. However, this new announcement did not include new payments to dairy farmers.By allocating more direct payments through CFAP, USDA could take action to reduce the strain that dairy farmers are facing. Specifically, the agency should continue issuing payments to dairy farmers under CFAP, or through any further assistance programs that USDA conceives, including the Pandemic Assistance for Producers initiative, for the first six months of 2021 and make these payments retroactive to January 1st. Continuing these payments would help alleviate the loss of dairy farms we are seeing in the Northeast and around the country and give dairy farmers’ additional relief as they continue to face the fallout of this pandemic.CFAP payments have proved to be very beneficial to our dairy producers during this time of financial stress. This is particularly true for our small and mid-size dairy operations, which have been hit the hardest by this pandemic and have few cash reserves on hand to cushion their losses when milk prices fall below production costs. So far throughout the pandemic the USDA has allocated more than four billion dollars of CFAP payments to dairy farmers, which is the smallest allocation of payments out of the four categories that received payments (acreage-based, sales commodities, livestock, and dairy). According to a recent National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) report, the United States lost 2,550, or seven percent, of its dairy herds from 2019 to 2020, and without further help from USDA this number may increase this upcoming year.Dairy farmers support our food system with their milk, providing the beverages, cheese, butter, and numerous other products that hundreds of millions of Americans consume on a daily basis. Dairy farmers have been suffering due to declining prices for decades, which has led to almost half of dairy herds lost since 2003, and are now also feeling the ramifications of a milk pricing formula that has had unintended consequences and caused almost one billion dollars of lost income.6 Continued payments to dairy farmers through CFAP or other possible avenues would go a long way in making sure that these operations around the country are able to remain solvent as they continue to weather the effects of this pandemic. Thank you for your serious consideration of this request. We very much looking forward to working with you on ways to ensure that dairy farmers are supported during this pandemic and beyond. Sincerely, ###

Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today announced an increase in Community Development Block (CDBG) program funding originally announced by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on Thursday, February 25, 2021. After discovering a calculation error, HUD recently released the revised allocation totaling $333,107,801 for fifty recipients across New York State, each receiving a 1.5% increase in funding from the original calculation. “The Community Development Block Grant is a vital stream of investment that supports services to seniors and families, including affordable housing. Even as New York reopens, we must not forget to continue to invest in our future, and this funding recalculation does just that,” said Senator Schumer. “I worked hard to get this funding on the negotiating table in federal aid packages, and I will always fight tooth and nail to deliver this critical investment for our communities.”“The Community Development Block Grant Program provides critical investments that support local economic development and jobs, community revitalization, and affordable housing across New York,” said Senator Gillibrand. “I am pleased to announce this increase in CDBG funding that will help support so many New Yorkers and communities during the pandemic.”Communities across New York State use CDBG funding to address a wide range of needs. The funding enables local governments to support affordable housing initiatives and expand economic development. The CDBG program provides municipalities in New York with the critical funding needed to leverage outside investment in job creation projects and the reconstruction of public facilities, neighborhood facilities, senior centers, centers for the handicapped, recreation facilities, and streetlights. The funds continue to play a critical role in facilitating local economic development across New York State and in helping local governments succeed. Revised Funding Outlined Below:NAMEGA21 (original)GA21 (revise)$ Diff% ChangeAlbany$3,418,421$3,468,796$50,3751.5%Amherst Town$630,807$640,103$9,2961.5%Auburn$888,312$901,403$13,0911.5%Babylon Town$1,100,568$1,116,787$16,2191.5%Binghamton$1,926,237$1,954,623$28,3861.5%Brookhaven Town$2,241,714$2,274,748$33,0341.5%Buffalo$13,926,260$14,131,481$205,2211.5%Cheektowaga Town$1,041,515$1,056,863$15,3481.5%Clay Town$275,338$279,395$4,0571.5%Colonie Town$374,732$380,254$5,5221.5%Dunkirk$446,818$453,402$6,5841.5%Dutchess County$1,505,746$1,527,934$22,1881.5%Elmira$1,191,938$1,209,503$17,5651.5%Erie County$2,803,209$2,844,518$41,3091.5%Glens Falls$502,909$510,320$7,4111.5%Greece$464,317$471,159$6,8421.5%Hamburg Town$437,064$443,505$6,4411.5%Huntington Town$865,039$877,787$12,7481.5%Irondequoit$906,128$919,480$13,3521.5%Islip Town$2,049,211$2,079,409$30,1981.5%Ithaca$680,761$690,793$10,0321.5%Jamestown$1,178,810$1,196,181$17,3711.5%Kingston$725,381$736,070$10,6891.5%Middletown$468,119$475,017$6,8981.5%Monroe County$1,856,308$1,883,663$27,3551.5%Mount Vernon$1,678,325$1,703,058$24,7331.5%Nassau County$13,955,627$14,161,280$205,6531.5%New Rochelle$1,441,514$1,462,757$21,2431.5%New York$49,367,683$50,094,993$727,3101.5%New York$174,083,557$176,648,890$2,565,3331.5%Newburgh$880,650$893,627$12,9771.5%Niagara Falls$2,405,587$2,441,036$35,4491.5%Onondaga County$2,058,720$2,089,058$30,3381.5%Orange County$1,735,770$1,761,349$25,5791.5%Poughkeepsie$847,282$859,767$12,4851.5%Rochester$8,262,859$8,384,622$121,7631.5%Rockland County$2,326,840$2,361,129$34,2891.5%Rome$1,016,702$1,031,684$14,9821.5%Saratoga Springs$298,434$302,831$4,3971.5%Schenectady$2,244,683$2,277,762$33,0791.5%Suffolk County$1,338,554$1,358,279$19,7251.5%Syracuse$5,083,142$5,158,048$74,9061.5%Tonawanda Town$1,701,621$1,726,697$25,0761.5%Troy$1,797,827$1,824,319$26,4921.5%Union Town$1,250,860$1,269,292$18,4321.5%Utica$2,563,407$2,601,182$37,7751.5%Watertown City$930,085$943,790$13,7051.5%West Seneca$330,890$335,765$4,8751.5%Westchester County$4,267,448$4,330,334$62,8861.5%White Plains$916,076$929,576$13,5001.5%Yonkers$3,580,715$3,633,482$52,7671.5%###

Schumer yesterday, in a personal call to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, urged the secretary to immediately push his Canadian counterparts and public health officials to implement his four-point plan and develop a public strategy to reopen to the border.Schumer also added that a key element of his proposal could be worked out in short order. During his visit to the Northern Border, Schumer advocated in favor or expanding the definition of “essential traveler.” Schumer told Secretary Mayorkas that the current definition is too narrow, and that it should be expanded to include anyone who has been vaccinated and has familial, property, educational, commercial, or medical interests across the border. This push comes on the heels of reports that the Canadian government is considering levying an addition tax on under-utilized vacation properties, despite not allowing American property owners to access their Canadian properties. In most cases, American and Canadian citizens with vacation homes across the border have not been able to visit their properties since last March.Schumer stressed to Mayorkas that since March 2020, American and Canadian stakeholders on both sides of the border have grown frustrated with the endless cycle of month-by-month closure extensions and the lack of transparency on which they’re decided. With the current moratorium on non-essential traffic set to expire on June 21st, and vaccination rates rising on both sides of the border, Schumer urged the relevant parties to come to an agreement as soon as possible on how and when to allow for increased cross border travel to avoid the loss of another summer season and hundreds of millions in cross-border dollars.“The deep, long-standing social and economic bonds that communities in the Northern Country and Canada share were abruptly severed last March to deal with the profound public health challenge that COVID presented, and since then residents and businesses up and down the Norther Border have been eagerly waiting for the day when rates would be low and vaccinations available so that restrictions could be relaxed and logically lifted,” said Senator Schumer. “While at the beginning — and in the height — of the pandemic it was understandable for such drastic measures to be taken, we know much more about the virus than we knew in March of last year and are making strong gains against it. Since vaccination rates have risen, overall rates are steadily falling, and New York is reopening today, based on the data, it is time to take the first steps towards reopening the Northern Border to non-essential travel.”Schumer added, “That is why I made a personal call to Secretary Mayorkas to coordinate with their Canadian counterparts ASAP and come up with a plan — based on science, data and common sense — that will allow for safe and steady border travel and reunite families and friends and jumpstart local economies. I’m also asking that they take appropriate measures to ease the burden shared by thousands of stakeholders across the Northern Border.”Specifically, Schumer requested that a binational agreement on reopening criteria be established and disclosed to the public without delay, allowing clarity and certainty for the thousands who have been displaced by the continued cycle of closure extensions. Such clarity, Schumer argued, would provide transparency, goals to meet and guide policy, and would eliminate the need for monthly extensions that have seemed arbitrary.Additionally, Schumer stressed the importance of recreational and commercial boating in the waters along the border. Currently, American and Canadian boaters are not able to cross the border by water, even if they have no intention of stopping at a port of entry. This practice, Schumer said, unfairly penalizes boaters who present no risk of COVID transmission.Finally, Schumer urged Secretaries Blinken and Mayorkas to provide and any all necessary support to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers and other federal personnel along the Northern Border. Schumer explained that no effective border policy can be implemented without ensuring proper vaccination, testing, and protective equipment for the federal employees managing the border and ensuring the continued flow of goods, services, and travelers.The U.S.-Canadian Border first closed to non-essential travel on March 20, 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID between the two countries. Since then, the border has remained closed, causing hardships for individuals, families, businesses and communities, who depended on cross-border travel to see loved ones or to generate revenue. Schumer said the people who have done their civic duty to get vaccinated and complied with the border closure for the greater good of public health, deserve justification for the border’s continued closure and a plan with benchmark goals that will lead to reopening.Senator Schumer’s original letter to Secretaries Blinken and Mayorkas calling for them to work with their Canadian counterparts appears below:Dear Secretaries Blinken and Mayorkas:I write to urge the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security to work in coordination with your Canadian counterparts to finally develop a transparent, bilateral, and public plan based on public health data and guidance – with specific standards, protocols, and metrics – to safely reopen the Northern Border to non-essential travel. Similarly, I strongly urge you to negotiate an interim expansion of the essential travel designation to include the thousands of impacted New Yorkers, in addition to millions of other vaccinated American and Canadian citizens. Having endured one of the deadliest chapters in New York’s history, the residents along the border are ready to turn the page and re-establish the familiar links to their loved ones, their property, and their prosperity.While the fight against the COVID pandemic remains paramount, we must acknowledge the progress New Yorkers have made in rolling up their sleeves, getting vaccinated, and reducing the burden of the virus. Due to the rising rates of vaccinated Americans and the subsequent decline in cases in New York and elsewhere, it has become abundantly clear that an agreement can and should be reached to safely accommodate the border communities without compromising the fight against COVID-19.  A bi-national plan with clearly defined benchmarks will provide clarity and transparency to a confusing and frustrating process.  Such an agreement is critical to safely and coherently reopening the border for non-essential travel as quickly as the underlying data would permit.  I ask that this detailed plan be publicly released with all due speed.As you work bilaterally to develop this plan, I further request that you work with our Canadian allies to immediately expand the definition of essential travel to include that of citizens with family, property, educational, medical, or business interests, who have also fulfilled their civic responsibility to get vaccinated. As we approach the summer season, thousands of New Yorkers and Canadians alike are facing the prospect of being cut-off from their properties for another year. Compounding this headache is the report that the Canadian government is preparing to levy additional taxes on underutilized vacation properties, despite the inability of property owners to reach their homes.Additionally, I once again ask that you work with your Canadian counterparts to clarify the policy for boaters who traverse the border mid-transit. Boaters, including tour boat companies that cross the border without docking, do not increase the spread of COVID-19 and should not be unduly penalized by the border policy.Lastly, I request that you develop a plan to ensure the safety of our border personnel as we reopen the border. It is incumbent upon both the United States and Canada to provide adequate testing, vaccination, and protective equipment to CBP and all federal employees along the entirety of the Northern Border. I also ask that CBP evaluate current policies and processes to increase efficiency and touchless travel at ports of entry. Without ensuring the safety of our frontline personnel and adapting our port procedures to a new COVID reality, we cannot hope to return to the normalcy that has defined U.S.-Canadian border crossings in New York and beyond.Once the epicenter of the global health and economic pandemic, New Yorkers have worked diligently to significantly reduce the spread of COVID infections and have led the nation in vaccinations week after week; it is now incumbent on the federal government to do their part and aid their desperate desire to fully rebuild and recover. This recovery cannot be done, and I will not rest, until bilateral collaboration to safely reopen the United States and Canadian land border is an utmost priority and a plan for a full reopening is publicly released. Sincerely,###

Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand released the following joint statement regarding the U.S. Department of Transportation heeding the senators’ calls and implementing a local hire program for highway and other infrastructure projects:Senators Schumer and Gillibrand said, “As Central New York rebuilds from the COVID pandemic and embarks on a generational opportunity to transform I-81 through the city of Syracuse, it is critical that the federal government allows state and local governments to invest in good-paying jobs with a focus on local residents, especially from disadvantaged and underrepresented groups. These programs enable New York State and Syracuse to work with labor unions and community leaders to ensure job opportunities on federally funded transportation projects – including I-81’s transformation in Syracuse – are available for local residents.”The senators continued, “We are pleased that USDOT heeded our calls to reestablish these programs, but believe this should be a bridge to a permanent policy in which USDOT replaces the regulation that currently impedes the use of geographic preferences with a new regulation that incentivizes targeted hiring across its infrastructure investment programs to benefit local contractors and workers, including women, veterans and minority-owned business.”###

I stood in Co-Op City with local leaders and called on Amtrak and Metro-North to come to the negotiating table and hammer out the framework for this urgently-needed project, and since then I have secured more than $14B in federal funding for the MTA to continue their capital projects in spite of the COVID pandemic drop in ridership. As New York continues to recover, we must prioritize projects like Penn Station Access that increase racial and socioeconomic equity in our transit system, and I will continue to use every opportunity as Senate Majority Leader to keep this train on the tracks.”###

Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand announced today a more than $1 million federal investment in Clinton, Essex, Franklin, Hamilton, Herkimer, Jefferson, Lewis, St. Lawrence, Saratoga, Warren, and Washington counties. The money will set up the Adirondack North Country Association’s (ANCA) Center for Pandemic Response, a project to work with local businesses navigating the post-pandemic comeback in crafting recovery plans and build resilience into the regional economy. This translates into at least 210 jobs created and 1,425 more preserved.“In these trying and unprecedented times, the federal government should continue doing everything in its power to support our small businesses and put local economies on track to recovery and that is why I insisted EDA funding for communities and businesses be included in the CARES Act that Congress passed to respond to COVID-19,” said Senator Schumer. “This federal funding will help small businesses and entrepreneurs in the North Country weather this crisis and help the economy bounce back. I will continue to fight and make sure that small businesses and local New York economies have the tools and support they need to build back better from this crisis.”“The COVID-19 pandemic strained small businesses and entrepreneurs across New York State as costs surged and revenues dwindled,” said Senator Gillibrand. “I am proud to have fought and secured this CARES Act funding that will bring more than $1 million in federal relief to help our local business leaders stay afloat, grow their businesses, and build economic resilience in our communities. Rebuilding our regional economies is dependent on companies like the Adirondack North Country Association, and this funding will help them create hundreds of jobs and opportunities right in Saranac Lake. I will continue serving as a fierce advocate to provide the resources needed to rebuild a strong and equitable economy.”The funds, allocated by the Economic Development Administration (EDA) through its COVID-19 Business Assistance Program, are part of the $1.5 billion for economic development assistance programs that Schumer played an integral role in getting included in the landmark CARES Act. Private investment will contribute about $250,000 to the Center as well.###

Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand and U.S. Representative Jamaal Bowman announced that Westchester County will receive an additional $1,246,978.16 in federal funds to complete permanent repairs to Glen Island Park in New Rochelle, which suffered heavy damage during Hurricane Sandy. The storm completely demolished sections of Glen Island’s bath house and swept away half the sand on its beach, as well as downing many trees. Allocated through the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) public assistance grant program, this most recent amount is the final federal allocation towards the total cost of the project, $3,342,226.17, with  FEMA covering 90 percent of the County’s costs less a flood insurance reduction.“I applaud FEMA for recognizing the importance of this project and providing Westchester County with the additional funding it needs to continue its repairs to Glen Island Park in New Rochelle, which was a victim of Hurricane Sandy’s wrath,” said Senator Schumer. “This Westchester treasure suffered serious damage to its sea wall, sidewalks, handrails, and beach pavilions during Hurricane Sandy and this federal disaster assistance goes a long way to lift the cost burden of repairs off taxpayers and reassures local residents that the federal government will help with recovery until the job is done.”“Many New York communities are still dealing with damages sustained from Superstorm Sandy,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This significant FEMA investment will help New Rochelle continue its restoration efforts of Glen Island Park and help ensure that local residents are not stuck with the bill for damages caused by the storm. Every year, countless Westchester County residents look forward to spending their summer days at Glen Island Park. Our federal commitment to fully restoring Glen Island will help ensure that this precious resource is available for families throughout the county to enjoy for years to come.”“We’re grateful that this substantial investment from FEMA will allow recovery work in Glen Island Park to continue, without taxpayers having to take on an additional burden for further disaster relief,” said Rep. Bowman. “Our collective experience with the pandemic this past year underscored how important it is for our families and kids to have access to safe, thriving outdoor spaces in their communities. It is in all of our interests to undo the longstanding damage of Hurricane Sandy and bring the federal resources necessary to protect this New Rochelle treasure for today’s and future generations.”“Our County’s treasure in Glen Island Park has seen it all – from the simple pleasure of a waterside stroll, to super storms making landfall, to a first of its kind COVID mass testing site. And now, thanks to Senate Majority Leader Schumer, Senator Gillibrand and Congressman Bowman this south County jewel will once again be restored to its full might. Our federal representatives were there for this beloved park when it was first in need following Super Storm Sandy and I am proud that they stand with us again,” said Westchester County Executive George Latimer.During Hurricane Sandy, high winds and storm surge caused damage to Glen Island Park, located on the north shore of Long Island Sound. Westchester County has owned and operated the Glen Island Park in New Rochelle since 1923. The storm surge inundated large portions of the 105-acre park with salt water and debris. With this funding additional repairs will be made to the sea wall, sidewalks, handrails, and beach pavilions at the County-owned park. Through the public assistance program, FEMA provides reimbursement funding for eligible projects including those related to debris removal, emergency protective measures, and the repair, replacement, or restoration of disaster-damaged, publicly owned facilities and the facilities of certain Private Non-Profit (PNP) organizations. The PA Program also encourages protection of these damaged facilities from future events by providing assistance for hazard mitigation measures during the recovery process. ###

Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand introduced this week the Reconnecting Communities Act, a trailblazing initiative that would provide federal investment in construction, planning, and community engagement to expand economic opportunity in New York and across the country by reconnecting and revitalizing areas that were harmed by the disruptive construction of highways through neighborhoods. The senators explained that while highways were instrumental to the connectivity of the country, they also upended many communities, especially low-income areas and communities of color, displacing residents, hurting local businesses, and impacting quality of life across neighborhoods. Schumer and Gillibrand said that it is long past due for strong federal investment into these communities negatively impacted by highways.“In Upstate New York and across the country, highways like Syracuse’s I-81, Buffalo’s I-33, Rochester’s Inner Loop, and Albany’s I-787 have too often been built through low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, displacing residents, dividing cities, increasing pollution, and limiting economic opportunities in impacted neighborhoods,” said Senator Schumer. “That’s why I am proud to announce the Reconnecting Communities Act – a key part of my Economic Justice Act – to help right these wrongs by identifying and removing these hulking physical barriers to mobility and opportunity. Infrastructure should build up communities, not divide them. This legislation will ensure local communities have the federal resources needed to revitalize and reconnect communities that have been neglected for far too long.”“Historically, the building of highways in upstate New York and across the country has disadvantaged low-income neighborhoods and communities of color by displacing residents, contributing to poor air quality, and dividing the heart of communities. This is more than a transportation issue, it is a social justice and economic issue that we must address as our nation rebuilds,” said Senator Gillibrand. “I’m proud to introduce the Reconnecting Communities Act with Majority Leader Schumer and I will work alongside him to get it passed to deliver resources to help communities from Syracuse, to Buffalo, to Rochester, to Albany and beyond, strengthen their local infrastructure.”The Reconnecting Communities Act would establish a grant program at the Department of Transportation to help communities identify and remove or retrofit highway infrastructure that creates obstacles to mobility and opportunity. This proposal was part of a larger bill, the Economic Justice Act, a historic proposal that Senator Schumer introduced last year, along with Senator Gillibrand, to address systematic racism and historic underinvestment in communities of color in New York and across the U.S. through immediate and long-term investments.Specifically, the Reconnecting Communities Act would provide $15 billion over five years for three categories of grants:Several community and local leaders have already addressed strong support for the Reconnecting Communities Act.""The Reconnecting Communities Act would be monumental in righting historical and societal wrongs by revitalizing disenfranchised urban communities that were decimated by the installation of freeway systems across America. I applaud Senators Schumer and Gillibrand for possessing the necessary courage and vision to address one of America's worst kept secrets. I look forward to working with both Senators to correct the wrongs here in Buffalo (Routes 33 and 198) and across New York State,"" stated Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes.Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said, “I applaud Majority Leader Schumer and Senator Gillibrand for their work on this important legislation. The Reconnecting Communities Act will allocate needed resources to reverse decades of neglectful and discriminatory infrastructure practices. It’s designed to revitalize areas that were harmed by the construction of Highway Systems. For example, Buffalo’s Kensington Expressway divided and isolated Buffalo’s East Side, home to a large and growing African American Community. This program is a step in the right direction to removing obstacles that created barriers to mobility, equity, and negatively impacted the quality of life in cities.”Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren said, “Rochester is proof that by removing old underused highways we can bridge what divided us -- both literally and figuratively. By filling in Inner Loop East we built a neighborhood. A $22 million public investment generated over $230 million in private investment, including housing, retail and an expansion of our world-class Strong National Museum of Play. Now, we look forward to the Reconnecting Communities Act helping us create this success again as we plan to fill-in Inner Loop North. I’m grateful to Senators Schumer and Gillibrand for their continued efforts to rebuild and reconnect our cities.”The full text of the Reconnecting Communities Act, introduced by Senators Schumer and Gillibrand, along with Senator Carper, Senator Van Hollen, Senator Cardin, Senator Padilla, Senator Coons, Senator Warnock, and Senator Markey, can be found here and the summary can be found here.###

Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand will re-introduce three pieces of legislation to increase the safety of stretch limousines for all of the Americans and New Yorkers who ride in them: the Safety, Accountability, and Federal Enforcement of Limos Act (SAFE Limos Act), the Take Unsafe Limos Off the Road Act, and the End the Limo Loophole Act. The senators explained that their bipartisan legislation would set a full slate of new federal stretch limousine safety rules and standards, help get unsafe vehicles off the road and close federal safety loopholes. The officials urged their colleagues in Congress to honor the memory of the heartbreaking limousine crash in Schoharie in October of 2018, which took the lives of 20 New Yorkers far too soon, by passing all three pieces of legislation as soon as possible.“In the aftermath of that tragic October 2018 afternoon took the lives of 20 Upstate New Yorkers, I stood with the families and loved ones and joined in their mission close the fatal gaps in limo-safety that led to this tragedy,” said Senator Schumer. “This legislation would set a full suite of federal stretch limousine safety rules, from seat strength requirements to aftermarket alteration rules and so much more, close loopholes that bypass safety standards for commercial vehicles, and take unsafe vehicles that never should’ve been there in the first place off our roads. As Majority Leader, I will not rest until limo safety is prioritized, ensuring the lives lost in Schoharie are not in vain and our roads are forever safer.”“Deadly limousine crashes in New York State have revealed gaping holes in the nation’s road safety rules and Congress must act to set adequate safety regulations that will save lives,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This limo safety legislation would enact comprehensive guidelines to improve safety in the limousine industry and hold companies accountable for unsafe limo modifications. I will keep pushing alongside my colleagues to finally pass this legislation that creates new safety standards for limousines based on recommendations from the NTSB and helps get dangerous vehicles off the road.”On October 6th, 2018, as reported by the New York State Police, a 2001 Ford Excursion limousine was traveling southwest on Route 30 and failed to stop at the Route 30A intersection in Schoharie, N.Y. The limo traveled across the intersection into the Apple Barrel County Store parking lot and struck a parked and unoccupied 2015 Toyota Highlander. The limo continued to travel into a small wooded ravine where it came to a rest. The accident tragically took the lives of all 18 people in the limousine and two pedestrians, 20 people in total. According to wide reports, this was America’s deadliest transport accident since 2009.The federal officials said that this accident revealed an urgent need for new federal stretch limousine safety regulations. Limousines lack many of the modern safety features required on passenger vehicles due to the way they are constructed. Manufacturers test the safety features of a normal car and are required to certify that all existing safety regulations are met, but these features are often rendered useless when the car is converted into a limousine. Many limousines are not equipped with side airbags or required to provide seat belts, nor are passengers required to wear them. So, with the NTSB’s recommendations now in-hand, the federal representatives launched a push to pass three new pieces of legislation that would significantly improve the safety of stretch limousines for both passengers and other drivers on New York State roads.First, Senator Schumer and Senator Gillibrand announced the introduction of the SAFE Limos Act of 2021 to the Senate, which would require:1. Date of the most recent inspection of the limousine required under state or federal law;2. The results of the inspection; and3. Any corrective action taken by the limousine operator to ensure the limousine passes inspection.Second, Schumer, Gillibrand, argued that while states are already supposed to act to ensure unsafe vehicles are off the road, more must be done to ensure that when vehicles fail inspection that states can step in to protect people. To address these shortcomings, the senators announced the introduction of the Take Unsafe Limos Off the Road Act to the Senate, and called on their colleagues to consider and pass it right away. The bill would create a new grant program to support states’ efforts to impound or immobilize vehicles that fail inspection for critical safety reasons.  The New York State Assembly and Senate are working on legislation that allows for the immobilization or impoundment of limousines where such vehicles have an out-of-service defect or a defect related to their horn. The act will incentivize states like New York to take strong actions to keep unsafe limos that fail inspection off the road.And lastly, Schumer and Gillibrand highlighted that currently, a Commercial Motor Vehicle is defined as a vehicle that is designed to transport more than 16 passengers, including the driver. However, vehicles that are altered after manufacture to accommodate more than 9 passengers, such as many stretch limos, fall outside this definition. So, Gillibrand and Delgado introduced the End the Limo Loophole Act to both chambers of Congress, to ensure that limos comply with commercial motor vehicle safety regulations. The legislation would amend the definition of a Commercial Motor Vehicle to ensure that it covers all vehicles used to transport more than 9 people, including the driver, so that critical federal safety rules, such as driver qualifications, apply to these vehicles. The bill also would require the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to finalize a rulemaking withdrawn by the Trump Administration to require states to implement inspection programs for passenger-carrying vehicles.Senator Schumer has long fought and led the effort in the Senate to promote safety within the stretch limousine industry. In 2015, a collision between a pickup truck and a stretch limousine on the North Fork of Long Island killed four women and injured others. According to the Suffolk Times, the limousine attempted to make a U-turn on Route 48 in Cutchogue, N.Y. when a Dodge Ram pickup truck collided with the limo. Following this tragic accident, Senator Schumer urged the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to gather data needed to upgrade safety standards on stretch limos and other aftermarket altered motor coaches to better protect passengers and make the vehicles more crash resistant. In September of 2015, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) heeded Schumer’s original investigatory call and agreed to investigate future limousine accidents as they occur on a case-by-case basis.###

Schumer today announced a $403,192.06 federal grant for Stanley Theatre in Utica New York. The funding is designed to provide 6 months of financial support that can be used to keep employees and Stanley Theatre open for business as New York recovers from the pandemic.“Independent movie theaters like Stanley Theatre are the beating heart of New York’s cultural life and a driving force in the local economy,” said Senator Schumer. “These local businesses were among the first to shut down at the start of the pandemic and will be among the last to fully recover. I am proud to deliver this vital federal funding for Stanley Theatre that recognizes its critical cultural and economic impact on Utica.”Schumer added, “Stanley Theatre, specifically, has been around for nearly a century, and the dedicated Save Our Stages federal assistance I fought hard to include in COVID relief packages ensures that this Utica institution will be around for future generations to enjoy. Today’s funding will keeps the lights, camera, action, going on in Utica.”Schumer said live venues were among the hardest hit industries during the pandemic, and today’s dedicated federal assistance will help Stanley Theatre deal with the tremendous hit to their bottom-line caused by COVID-19, and fully recover as the economy opens back up. It is estimated that in 2020, live venues and theaters across the country lost $9 billion in ticket sales alone.Independent movie theaters were folded into the Save Our Stages bill following Schumer’s effort to include them in a small business relief package, the Heroes Small Business Lifeline Act, that he led last October. Schumer then successfully led the fight to pass the Save Our Stages Act and $15 billion in emergency relief into law as part of last December’s COVID package. He also fought to include an additional $1.25 billion in funding for the Save Our Stages program in the American Rescue Plan passed in March. Schumer estimated that without the SOS relief, 70% of the independent movie theaters in the country could have filed for bankruptcy or close permanently by the end of 2020, and more than 70,000 jobs could have been lost permanently.###

https://www.schumer.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/schumer-gillibrand-announce-over-5-million-in-emergency-funding-for-upstate-new-york-public-housing-authorities,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today announced $5,369,148 in funding allocated in the American Rescue Plan for sixteen Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) across Upstate New York. The funding was awarded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and will support tenant-based rental assistance for individuals who are experiencing or are at risk of experiencing homelessness, or who are fleeing from domestic violence, human trafficking, or sexual assault. EHVs are tenant-based rental assistance found under section 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937. Twenty-one Public Housing Authorities throughout New York State were awarded a total of 9,925 EHVs.“Every New Yorker deserves a safe and secure place to call home, and this federal investment helps public housing authorities address the scourge of housing insecurity in communities across Upstate,” said Senator Schumer. “When I led the American Rescue Plan to passage in the Senate, I specifically added provisions to address housing issues that have been amplified as a result of the COVID pandemic that will support affordable housing, especially for our most vulnerable residents. Access to safe and reliable housing is a fundamental right and I will not stop fighting and delivering for New Yorkers experiencing housing insecurity.”“We have seen housing insecurity threaten the health and well-being of our communities. Access to safe and affordable housing is essential now more than ever,” said Senator Gillibrand. “In addition to helping to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, the American Rescue Plan is a significant piece of poverty-reducing legislation and I’m proud to help deliver these vital resources to help ensure every New Yorker has stable, long-term housing. We must continue to support individuals and families as we recover from this economic crisis, and I will keep fighting to provide protection and assistance to New Yorkers who need it most.”Senator Gillibrand has fought for funding to support housing assistance for New Yorkers throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and helped secure $45 billion for homelessness prevention and housing assistance in the American Rescue Plan. Of this funding, $5 billion was allocated for emergency housing vouchers. She also co-sponsored the Emergency Rental Assistance and Rental Market Stabilization Act of 2020 to help families and individuals pay their rent and back rent and the Public Health Emergency Shelter Act to respond to the needs of families and individuals experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic.Funding Recipients Listed Below:Capital: OrganizationCityCountyAmountAlbany Housing AuthorityAlbanyAlbany$380,916Schenectady Municipal Housing AuthoritySchenectadySchenectady$266,856Troy Housing AuthorityTroyRensselaer$234,516Amsterdam Housing AuthorityAmsterdamMontgomery$159,456Total: $1,041,744Central: OrganizationCityCountyAmountSyracuse Housing AuthoritySyracuseOnondaga$623,280City of UticaUticaOneida$156,024City of FultonFultonOswego$151,416Total: $930,720Rochester:OrganizationCityCountyAmountRochester Housing AuthorityRochesterMonroe$1,357,608Total: $1,357,608Southern Tier: OrganizationCityCountyAmountBinghamton Housing AuthorityBinghamtonBroome$251,352Ithaca Housing AuthorityIthacaTompkins$210,672Total: $462,024Western:OrganizationCityCountyAmountCity of BuffaloBuffaloErie$800,256Jamestown Housing AuthorityJamestownChautauqua$133,440Total: $933,696Hudson Valley:OrganizationCityCountyAmountEllenville Housing AuthorityEllenvilleUlster$207,264City of PoughkeepsiePoughkeepsieDutchess$195,480Village of Kiryas Joel HAMonroeOrange$240,612Total: $643,356###

https://www.schumer.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/schumer-gillibrand-announce-legislation-to-put-an-end-to-unsolicited-robocalls,"Billions of Illegal Robocalls Target Older Americans and Put Consumers At Risk Annually; Consumers Lose Approximately $40 Billion a Year Through Telemarketing Fraud Washington, DC – U.S. Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand joined Senate colleagues in calling for legislation to enhance penalties for automated and illegal phone calls wreaking havoc on consumers nationwide. The Deter Obnoxious, Nefarious, and Outrageous Telephone (DO NOT) Call Act would increase penalties for individuals and companies intentionally preying on consumers through unsolicited and illegal robocalls.  “From every corner of New York there is one thing everyone can agree upon, and that is the enduring hope that the robocalls stop,” said Senator Schumer. “Americans are desperate to ‘hang up the phone’ and the DO NOT Call Act is the antidote we need to cut the cord on ‘spoofing’ scams that target especially elderly New Yorkers. Whether it’s the landline or cell, no one should be scared to pick up the phone, and I will fight tooth and nail to ensure that New Yorkers can have some peace and quiet from the incessant ringing of robocalls.”“Robocalls are surging nationwide as advancements in technology have made it easier for scammers to prey on vulnerable New Yorkers with little to no consequence. Not only is this harmful to consumers, but frankly, we don’t have time for the nuisance and deception,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This vital piece of legislation will give the FCC the tools needed to combat scammers who grossly violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and, all too often, target and defraud senior Americans. I am a fierce advocate of the DO NOT Call Act, and will do everything I can to put sensible protections in place and put an end to unsolicited robocalls.”According to YouMail, nearly 4.5 billion robocalls targeted Americans in April of 2021 alone. Of those calls, 229,042,000 took place in New York State, making it the fifth most-called state in the nation. Consumers lose approximately $40 billion a year through telemarketing fraud. The Deter Obnoxious, Nefarious, and Outrageous Telephone (DO NOT) Call Act would:Senator Gillibrand has been a strong advocate of increasing protections for New York consumers. In addition to cosponsoring the DO NOT Call Act in the 116th Congress, Senator Gillibrand was a cosponsor of the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act, which was signed into law in 2019. For more information and official FCC guidance on the TRACED Act program, click here. Additionally, Senator Gillibrand championed the bipartisan Senior Financial Empowerment Act to ensure that older Americans and caregivers have access to critical information and protections regarding financial abuse, and establish a national hotline to advise seniors on reporting fraud.###

Schumer today announced that following his push to secured $4.5 million last year for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to finally repair and rebuild the battered Charles Point barrier beach break wall to protect Sodus Bay and to safeguard homes on Charles Point bluff at risk of falling into Lake Ontario, construction of the new robust wall is now completed. “Over the past few years, Lake Ontario’s historic flooding has battered Wayne County communities and their bays and harbors and eroded away the vital Charles Point breakwall in Great Sodus Bay,” said Senator Schumer. “That’s why last year I was produce to join Wayne County homeowners and officials to announce I had secured $4.5 million last year to finally repair and rebuild the Charles Point barrier beach break wall.  Today I’m pleased to announce construction of the new more robust wall is now complete.  The Charles Point breakwater wall is a vital shield, protecting Sodus Bay and safeguarding homes on Charles Point bluff from falling into Lake Ontario. No one should have to fear for the safety of their home, but until now families along the Charles Point bluff have had to do just that, as Lake Ontario water levels threatened to cause serious damage. That’s why I was proud to deliver the much-needed $4.5 million for the Army Corps of Engineers to repair and rebuild the Charles Point break wall. Now the repaired wall will serve as a shield, improving resiliency along the Lake Ontario shoreline, protecting Sodus Bay, and ensuring the safety of our community and their families.”In 2017, following Lake Ontario’s floods, Schumer met with Wayne County Officials and Charles Point homeowners to begin his push for the U.S. Army Corps to allocate funding to repair the badly damaged Charles Point break wall.  The floods broke through the wall in several places, allowing Lake Ontario waters to dangerously erode the Charles Point bluff, jeopardizing and undermining the land supporting homes on top of the bluff.  Besides protecting Charles Point, the wall is a major component of the infrastructure that the Army Corps of Engineers built decades ago across the mouth of Sodus Bay to protect the Bay and the hundreds of homes and job-creating businesses located within the Bay from damaging Lake Ontario waters, waves, and erosion.  The Charles Point wall together with Crescent Beach and the Army Corps’ navigation channel wall form a vital barrier that shields Sodus Bay but the floods damaged this barrier system by destroying the Charles Point wall and by breaching and washing away entire sections of Crescent Beach land.  In 2018, Schumer first succeeded in getting the Army Corps to allocate $150,000 to design the Charles Point wall repair, then estimated to cost $1.5 million. However when the designs revealed $4.5 million would instead be required to reconstruct and rebuild the Charles Point wall to a higher resiliency standard to prevent future flood damage, Schumer wrote in late 2019 to US Army Corps Commanding General Todd Semonite to push for the Army Corps to allocate the needed $4.5 million. “The Sodus Point community is breathing a deep sigh of relief, now that Charles Point is secured.  The funds that Senator Charles Schumer was able to secure were instrumental in making this happen.  This was the highest risk area for catastrophic damage, and it has now been averted.  We appreciate the senator’s support and look forward to working with him to secure additional funds for the East breakwater which is also in need of repair,” said Dave McDowell, Mayor, Sodus Point, NYEric Depew, Charles Point resident and past Charles Point Homeowner Association Vice President said, ""It is an immense relief to see this project come to conclusion after 4 years in the making knowing that Charles Point is safe from the ravages of Lake Ontario today and for generations to come!  As the primary resident advocate for this project I know this would not have been possible without the immense efforts and influence of Senator Schumer and his staff.  We look forward to continuing to work with the Senator to finish securing Sodus Bay's future by acquiring the additional funding needed by the USACE to fix the functionally failed East Breakwater they hold responsibility for maintaining and that threatens the continued viability of the Bay itself.”Last year, Schumer announced the Army Corps heeded his push and included the $4.5 million in the Corps’ FY20 work plan to construct the new upgraded and more resilient armored stone revetment Charles Point protection wall. Last summer the Army Corps of Engineers awarded the $3.86 million construction contract to replace the wall with a new wall structure to replace the existing failed 525 ft Charles Point steel sheet pile wall.  A gap in the existing wall  caused increased erosion to the land and bluff behind it.  The new wall will provide better protection for erosion of the bluff and potential breach into the harbor. Work commenced last August and was completed May 19,, 2021.###

Schumer announced today that Southwest Airlines has agreed to expand and enhance its presence in Upstate New York by establishing service out of SYR for the first time. With the addition of new routes to SYR, Southwest will now service every major airport in Upstate New York.On his call with Southwest CEO Kelly last week, Schumer highlighted his long history of working with Southwest and other airlines to bring service to Upstate New York, the success of those routes, and the widely predicted post-pandemic economic boom as proof that establishing service for Syracuse Hancock would be a win-win. Schumer said the new routes to SYR would boost competition, availability of low-cost flights, and connectivity for travelers and businesses in Central New York.“Today’s news, landing Southwest in Syracuse, is no small peanuts, said Senator Schumer. “And let’s not forget, the decision by Southwest to finally land in Syracuse solidifies years of hard work by all of us to get the airport in tip-top shape—inside and out. The federal funds we’ve used to make the Syracuse airport the crown of regional and affordable travel ensures jewels of service like Southwest are here to stay, with more to come.” Schumer has long fought to bring affordable air service to Upstate New York. In fact, Senator Schumer’s first major victory on that front came when he successfully advocated for Southwest to start flights from Albany. Southwest’s profitable decision led many other carriers to begin servicing airports across the state that previously were not considered viable. Since then, Schumer has fought to bring new airlines and routes to Upstate New York cities, including JetBlue to Buffalo, Albany, Syracuse and Rochester. Recently, Schumer successfully pushed JetBlue to establish service to Boston from Syracuse. Lastly, Schumer secured nearly $934 million for New York airports during the pandemic, including more than $29 million to Hancock airport.###

Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand announced $1 million for Greater Binghamton Airport through the Department of Transportation’s Small Community Air Service Development Program to make improvements to facilities and expand air service to other regional transportation hubs. The funding will support the region’s continued economic growth and open up the area to more opportunities in the future.“Binghamton Airport’s expansion means continued success for the community and the entire Broome County region,” said Senator Schumer. “Transportation connections to the wider world are essential for community development and economic opportunity, and I have long been a champion of bringing those connections to Binghamton Airport. The funding announced today means opportunities for more jobs, more growth, and more investment in the future. I will always work with the community to fight for the Southern Tier’s economic take off.”“Broome County’s economic and business activity has grown in recent years, producing greater demand for air services. The Greater Binghamton Airport is invaluable in maintaining the region’s connectivity and growth as it continues to serve its nearly 200,000 local residents,” said Senator Gillibrand. “These funds will help modernize the Greater Binghamton Airport, bolster regional economic development, and ensure businesses and travelers are connected to the rest of the country. I will always fight in the Senate for programs that support New York’s transportation infrastructure.”""BGM is extremely excited to receive the Small Community Air Service Development award. The timing for this award is incredible as BGM looks to regrow and restore air service for our community and upstate NY in the wake of the pandemic,” said Mark Heefner, Commissioner of Aviation for the Greater Binghamton Airport. “This award will assist in creating a strong package that allows us to solicit additional air service.  The SCASD grant will help put BGM on a more level playing field that will allow us to focus on the right service to meet our community's needs. Without the help of Senator Schumer, Senator Gillibrand, and our NYS elected leaders, we would not have been able to create the competitive application that ultimately resulted in an award. ""“As more people resume traveling across the country and abroad following the pandemic, we want them to fly BGM. Broome County has been working nonstop to bring more flights here and the Small Community Air Service Development will help us in that effort. I’d like to thank Senator Schumer and Senator Gillibrand for their leadership and continued advocacy on behalf of the Greater Binghamton Airport,” said Jason Garnar, Broome County Executive.The senators have long advocated for Binghamton Airport, securing over $3.5 million in COVID relief packages. Schumer has also consistently fought for federal investments to fund improvements to Binghamton Airport, including to promote the airport, repair the taxiway, and make runway improvements. Binghamton Airport served ~38,000 enplanements in CY2019 according to the FAA, and with today’s federal investment, has the potential to create more jobs and land more opportunities for economic growth in Broome County.A copy of Schumer’s original letter to Secretary Buttigieg appears below:Dear Secretary Buttigieg:I am pleased to write in support of the application submitted by the Greater Binghamton Airport (BGM) for funding through the Small Community Air Service Development Program (SCASDP). This critical funding will enable airport administration to bolster existing efforts to establish BGM as a regional air service hub by expanding access to destinations, enhancing services, and supporting the needs of existing business in the Southern Tier region.The Greater Binghamton Airport, located in Upstate New York’s Broome County, is a vital component to the region’s economy, supporting the travel of many of the area’s prominent employers. The airport offers a convenient location, just outside the City of Binghamton, and helps service many of the other cities in the Southern Tier of New York. Historically, the Greater Binghamton Airport has offered its passengers a variety of travel and carrier options at competitive rates, all while maintaining the convenience of a regional airport. In 2016 and 2017, however, American and United Airlines selected to eliminate services at the airport. The diminished travel options and unreliability pushed enplanements down, threatening the vitality of this valuable community resource. Currently, the airport’s offerings have been reduced to a single carrier operating only a few flights daily to a single hub. These reduced services have limited the airport’s capacity to meet the ever-growing travel needs of the community.Since this reduction, Broome County’s economy has grown and countless new initiatives have succeeded in revitalizing the community. Binghamton University is on the precipice of opening a new Health Science Complex and Pharmacy School to support their expanding nursing and health research programs. In addition, the area recently has experienced an explosion of investment into the industrial hemp oriented space, with the development of multiple processing plants currently underway. The absence of robust and reliable connections to domestic and global transportation hubs is a disincentive to the expansion of new and developing business opportunities in the region.The SCASDP grant will provide Broome County the opportunity to improve the airport and expand its service options from the Greater Binghamton Airport to sought after hubs. The airport has assembled a consortium of support and commitment from local private sector stakeholders, Broome County, and New York State for contributions to air service development. This vast association of resources demonstrates the unwavering commitment the local community and its leaders have to creating a vibrant regional airport, and highlights the tremendous value this project holds.I ask that you please give this application your full consideration. A SCASDP grant will enable Broome County to continue to provide reliable air service to the region and will greatly support the continued economic development of this growing area.Thank you for your consideration.Sincerely,A copy of Gillibrand’s original letter to Acting Secretary Hurdle appears below:Dear Acting Secretary Hurdle,I write in support of the application submitted by Greater Binghamton Airport (GBA) for funding from the Small Community Air Service Development Program (SCASDP) through the U.S. Department of Transportation. This funding will be used to increase air service development efforts and improve access to air services throughout New York’s Southern Tier.Located in Broome County, eight miles north of the City of Binghamton, Greater Binghamton Airport serves a population of nearly 200,000 local residents. The county is home to SUNY Binghamton, which brings together students and faculty from across the United States and more than 100 countries abroad. Between 2016 and 2017, GBA lost the services of two airlines, and has seen nearly 50,000 customers lose access to flights. Meanwhile, the County has grown in recent years, both in terms of population and business activity, producing greater demand for air services.The requested funding will be used to enhance a package for air service development that includes contributions from local businesses and Broome County to increase the availability of air service at the Greater Binghamton Airport. This new funding will ensure that the region’s air services reflect the County’s recent growth and economic development efforts.

Schumer today announced – alongside Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo – a $3.4 million federal grant from the Economic Development Administration to make improvements to the Shawmut Industrial Park to support an expansion of Alstom’s train manufacturing in the region. Last month, Schumer made a personal call to Secretary Raimondo to push for the grant and explained that the project allow Alstom to build one of the only U.S.-based manufactured rail car shell operations, bringing back manufacturing from overseas and greatly strengthening America’s train and rail car domestic supply chain. Schumer said the expansion will create 250 new jobs and support Alstom’s current 800-employee workforce.Alstom recently secured an up to $1.8 billion contract to make passenger rail cars for the Chicago Metra Commuter Rail System and has already committed to investing $35 million to build a new manufacturing facility in the city. The EDA grant announced today will support this expansion, leading to new private investment and job creation in the Hornell area.“Now, Hornell can make essential improvements to the Shawmut Industrial Park to put Alstom’s new project building rail cars for the Chicago Metra Commuter Rail System on track to create hundreds of good-paying jobs and inject a massive amount of economic energy for the Southern Tier,” said Senator Schumer. “I am proud to announce this critical federal investment alongside Secretary Raimondo today and help Alstom expand their local investment with a new manufacturing facility. This funding will ensure Hornell grows into one of the nation’s main hubs for train manufacturing and is a true win-win for Upstate New York and the future of rail car manufacturing in the U.S. It’s full steam ahead for the City of Hornell!”“This is tremendous news for the City of Hornell. Senator Schumer has been an incredible advocate for Hornell and he has delivered once again for the Maple City in a big way,” said John Buckley, Mayor of the City of Hornell. “This project will allow for significant infrastructure improvements to the Shawmut Industrial Park, foster investment in the area, and create hundreds of good paying jobs. Hornell will be one of the only places in the U.S. producing train passenger car shells. Thank you Senator Schumer for helping secure Hornell’s spot on the map as one of the train manufacturing hubs for America!”“As the project coordinator for the new Alstom Car Shell Manufacturing facility, I can honestly say I have never been more impressed with the efforts of Senator Schumer's Office and Majority Leader Schumer himself, he has been a stalwart in his efforts to assist this project which will result in the creation of 258 new jobs here in Hornell, New York.,” said Shawn Hogan, Executive Consultant for the Hornell Industrial Development Agency. “This project and the resulting job creation, is tremendous news for the entire region, the State and Nation.  This project will result in technology transfer and onshore production of Car Shells that are currently imported.  Great work Senator Schumer and his team once again delivering for New York.  Many thanks to the professionalism and guidance given and offered by the EDA team, we are forever grateful.”Schumer has strongly supported opportunities for growth at Alstom's Hornell facility, which has, for more than 150 years, been manufacturing and servicing high-quality trains in Hornell. He visited Alstom in Hornell on several occasions, most recently in September 2015, to announce and celebrate with local leaders the Amtrak Board of Directors' entrance into negotiations with Alstom to provide a replacement for Amtrak's current Acela trains. In June 2015, Schumer visited Alstom in Hornell to urge the Department of Transportation (USDOT) to green light Amtrak's efforts to buy brand new Next Generation High-Speed trains. In early 2020, Schumer’s push proved to be successful and the FRA signed off on Amtrak’s permit application.A copy of Schumer’s original letter to Secretary Raimondo appears below:Dear Secretary Raimondo,I write on behalf of the Hornell Industrial Development Agency’s application to the Economic Development Administration (EDA) to support essential improvements to the Shawmut Industrial Park in Hornell, NY for the expansion of Alstom’s manufacturing facility. This funding is integral to the development of a site that will allow Alstom to build a U.S.-based manufactured rail car shell operation, strengthening the domestic supply chain, while also ensuring continued job growth in Steuben County and New York’s broader Southern Tier region. Alstom is one of the world`s leading transportation companies specializing in the manufacturing of high-speed rail and transit cars. They employ an estimated 4,700 total workers in the U.S., with their new rail passenger car manufacturing facility located in Hornell, NY employing over 800 workers. Earlier this year, Alstom was awarded a large contract to construct the steel carbody shell of bi-level rail passenger cars for the Chicago Metra Commuter Rail system. Previously, Alstom imports their rail carbody shells from abroad, but this contract has spurred interest to begin manufacturing these carbody shells in America to reduce costs and simultaneously strengthen their NY operations.Alstom and the Hornell IDA have worked together to develop a proposal for a new 135,000 square foot manufacturing facility at the Shawmut Industrial Park for building electric fusion welded stainless steel rail passenger carbody shells. This groundbreaking proposal would make Alstom’s Hornell operations  a critical stainless steel rail carbody manufacturers in the U.S. Specifically, Alstom has committed to the City of Hornell that they would finance the construction of the expanded facility with $35 million in direct investment. Notably, this project is also located in a distressed area that would especially benefit from this significant economic investment and job creation. Hornell would use funding provided through the EDA for critical site improvements such as the construction of a new parking lot, lighting, utility relocation, and other necessary facility infrastructure upgrades to accommodate the expanded manufacturing facility.This project will create an estimated 250 new manufacturing jobs by 2022. To prepare workers for these new jobs, the company plans to utilize existing training and education partnerships with specialized higher education institutions, like SUNY Alfred, Corning Community College, and Alfred University, all of which are in close proximity to Hornell. I have fought hard over the years to support opportunities for growth at Alstom's Hornell facility, from urging the Department of Transportation (USDOT) to green-light Amtrak's efforts to work with Alstom in the production of new Next Generation High-Speed trains to securing Federal Railroad Administration permits to keep the production of the Acela fleet on track. This project, if aided by the EDA, would be a massive boost to the U.S.’s overall domestic transportation manufacturing capabilities, as well as to the economic growth of a distressed rural region of New York State.I applaud the Hornell IDA and the role it continues to play in the economic development of the Southern Tier, and hope its application for funding is met with your approval.Thank you for your consideration. Please do not hesitate to contact me or my grants coordinator in our Washington, DC office at 202-224-6542.Sincerely,###

Schumer today announced, following his repeated pushes, that $11.3 million in federal funding has been secured to bring new high-speed internet broadband access to thousands of homes, businesses, schools, and farms across Livingston County.The funding, allocated through a grant awarded by the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Rural Development Broadband ReConnect Program, will be used to install hundreds of miles of fiber-optic cable that will provide broadband internet access to thousands of Livingston County households, farms, businesses and schools. Empire Access, a family-owned telecom provider based in Prattsburgh, NY, will partner with Livingston County to build out the new infrastructure. Specifically the grant will enable the deployment of a fiber-to-the-premises network to reach an estimated up to 11,000 people including over 90 farms and dozens of businesses in Livingston County, New York. “The COVID pandemic made it all too clear that the digital gap in Livingston County is far too wide,” said Senator Schumer. “In today’s modern economy, access to reliable, fast internet service is crucial to success which is why I was proud to have pushed and advocated with USDA Secretary Vilsack to secure this grant. This USDA grant will ensure Livingston County families, businesses, farms, and students can access the top-notch, high-speed broadband they need. I am proud to have helped secure this federal funding, and I will always fight to bring 21st century telecommunications technology to underserved communities across Upstate.”Today’s visit and federal funding comes after Schumer’s personal visit to Livingston to announce his push to secure these funds to provide for the county’s broadband needs in August of last year and after his push during his first meeting with then President-elect Biden’s USDA Nominee, Tom Vilsack, in January of this year to urge the nominee to prioritize Livingston County’s grant request. Schumer has provided strong support for broadband access in Upstate New York in the past and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this year, he helped pass the American Rescue Plan Act (ARP), which provided $353 million to build broadband in unserved and underserved areas. Additionally, Schumer secured over $600 million to provide Wi-Fi-hotspots and connected devices to students and teachers in New York. The funding from the ARP is on top of the $7 billion Schumer has already secured to provide free or low cost broadband service to low-in comes families in past COVID relief bills.“We thank Senator Schumer for supporting the public-private partnership between Livingston County and Empire Access for the USDA ReConnect Program,” said County Administrator Ian Coyle.  “The federal funding award is a definite game changer in our local efforts to effectively achieve greater access to reliable and affordable high-speed internet service throughout the County.”Chairman of the County Board of Supervisors, David LeFeber commented, “Expanding affordable, high-speed internet access is a key priority of the County Board of Supervisors. We thank Senator Schumer for his continued support to address this critical need. By expanding broadband service to areas which need it most, we improve the quality of life for residents and help ensure economic development opportunities for agriculture and businesses.”“We thank Senator Schumer and his dedicated staff for supporting this important initiative,” said Jim Baase, Chief Operating Officer, Empire Access. “The USDA Rural Broadband ReConnect grant will provide the necessary funding to expand high-speed broadband access to rural, unserved regions of Livingston County.  Residents and businesses will now have access to state-of-the-art fiber optic Internet service.”Schumer voted in 2018 to pass the Fiscal Year 19 Appropriations bill, which created the USDA ReConnect Program  In 2019 Schumer helped secure a $10.3 million grant for Yates County from ReConnect’s first grant round to construction broadband access to over 3000 households and businesses.  The Livingston County grant announced today is part of the second ReConnect grant round made possible by $550 million Schumer helped secure in the Fiscal Year 2020 appropriations bill. The Rural Development Broadband and ReConnect Program provides funding for the costs of construction, improvement, or acquisition of facilities and equipment needed to provide broadband service in eligible rural areas.###

Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today announced $5,258,126 in YouthBuild funding for four organizations across New York State. This federal funding, allocated through the U.S. Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration, helps at-risk youth from ages 16 to 24 develop skills and knowledge to gain industry-recognized job credentials, apprenticeships, and employment. In the United States alone, there are 3 million young adults in this age group who are living in poverty and are neither in school nor employed.“YouthBuild is a vital lifeline for at-risk young adults across Upstate New York, giving many young adults a chance to jumpstart their careers and ultimately make a better life for themselves,” said Senator Schumer. “I am pleased that the Department of Labor has recognized the importance of the YouthBuild program and look forward to hearing about its many successes across the state. Especially after the pandemic, which left many young adults stranded in an unyielding job market, the YouthBuild program will be vital in helping young people secure good jobs in an improving economy. I am proud to deliver this funding for YouthBuild programs in Upstate New York, and I will always fight to secure good jobs for our youth.”“YouthBuild has a proven track record of preparing youth throughout New York State with the skills and mentorship necessary to get good jobs and achieve their full potential,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This forward thinking funding will provide at-risk youth with opportunities to receive skills training and learn critical vocational skills, and will help our economy emerge stronger than ever from the COVID-19 pandemic. I am proud to lead efforts to fund the YouthBuild program.

Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today visited the Inner Loop North in Rochester to push for the Reconnecting Communities Act and to make permanent an expansion of the local hire pilot program as part of the American Jobs Plan, which would help kick-start the process of removing and reforming the northern portion of the Inner Loop.“Highways like Rochester’s Inner Loop have too often been built through low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, displacing residents, dividing cities, increasing pollution, and limiting economic opportunities in impacted neighborhoods,” said Senator Schumer. “That’s why I’m working with Senator Gillibrand to put it on the feds’ radar that the Inner Loop is a sunken moat-like, physical barrier to mobility for impacted communities and how with federal funding, the Inner Loop North can be transformed into a project to bring economic opportunity to Rochester, restore neighborhoods for local residents, and connect local workers to good-paying jobs. I’m proud to support the Reconnecting Communities Act and a permanent local hire program, central proposals of my Economic Justice Act introduced last year, to provide critical investment to Rochester to reform the Inner Loop North while bringing together labor and community leaders to connect local residents, especially disadvantaged workers, to high-quality construction jobs.”“When Rochester’s Inner Loop was built, it caused increased traffic levels, dangerous levels of pollution and the shuttering of local businesses. Similar stories played out in communities of color across New York and the country—highways cut through cities, destroyed neighborhoods and displaced more than a million people,” said Senator Gillibrand. “Now, we have the chance the help right the wrongs of the past. I’m proud to work with Senator Schumer to push for federal legislation that will rebuild and reconnect communities, boost the local economy, hire and train local talent, and lay the foundation for a brighter, more equitable future.”Today’s effort continues the senators’ long commitment to revitalizing Rochester. Schumer and Gillibrand were instrumental in securing a $16.5 million TIGER grant to fill in the eastern portion of the Inner Loop, which created significant new job-creating economic development opportunities in the area with the creation of six acres of new shovel-ready development sites, including space for new affordable housing units, retail, office space, and the expansion of the Strong Museum of Play. More than $230 million in private investment followed the roughly $25 million cost to fill in the Inner Loop East. The senators argue that filling in the larger Inner Loop North will lead to even larger economic opportunity for Rochester’s most impacted neighborhoods.Schumer led the push to fill in Inner Loop East since 2011, successfully calling on the Department of Transportation (DOT) to invest million in federal funds to make the project possible. Schumer made in-person appeals about the project to two different Secretaries of Transportation and is now pushing current Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to invest in a potential Inner Loop North project.The infrastructure bill that is part of the American Jobs Plan includes the Reconnecting Communities Act, a trailblazing initiative that would provide federal investment in construction, planning, and community engagement to expand economic opportunity in New York and across the country by reconnecting and revitalizing areas that were harmed by the disruptive construction of highways through neighborhoods. The senators explained that while highways like the Inner Loop were intended to boost connectivity, they also upended many communities, especially low-income areas and communities of color, displacing residents, hurting local businesses, and impacting quality of life across neighborhoods. Schumer and Gillibrand said it is time for federal investment into reforming the Inner Loop North, which would reinvigorate communities like Marketview Heights, Lewis Street, Grove Place, and the HINGE neighborhoods together with institutions adjacent to the Inner Loop East such as the Rochester Public Market, and Rochester’s World of Inquiry School No. 58 that have been negatively impacted by the presence of the highway.  The senators said the legislation is focused on providing greater opportunities to redevelop new spaces created in order to benefit the current residents and those previously displaced and it supports measures such as the establishment of community land trusts for the development and use of real estate for local residents. Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren said, “Rochester is proof that by removing old underused highways we can bridge what divided us -- both literally and figuratively. By filling in Inner Loop East we built a neighborhood. A $22 million public investment generated over $230 million in private investment, including housing, retail and an expansion of our world-class Strong National Museum of Play. Now, we look forward to the Reconnecting Communities Act helping us create this success again as we plan to fill-in Inner Loop North. I’m grateful to Senators Schumer and Gillibrand for their continued efforts to rebuild and reconnect our cities.”Rochester City Councilman Malik Evans said, ""As we seek to expand opportunities in the City of Rochester and break down barriers The Reconnecting Communities Act will address the legacy of highway construction built through communities, especially through low-income communities and communities of color, that divided neighborhoods and erected barriers to mobility and opportunity. I look forward to this legislation transforming the landscape of places like Rochester and leading to greater opportunity for everyone in our community"". Specifically, the American Jobs Plan calls for $25 billion for the Reconnecting Communities Act and other related transportation investments in marginalized communities and workers. The Reconnecting Communities Act would provide federal funds for three categories of grants:Recently, the senators also successfully included a permanent expansion of local hire or other geographic or economic hiring preferences for construction jobs created by projects funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation in the Surface Transportation Investment Act, which passed out of the Commerce Committee with a bipartisan vote of 25-3. This provision also includes support for the federal government, states, localities, labor, and community organizations to work together to offer training through pre-apprenticeship and registered apprenticeship programs to expand access to new job opportunities for local residents, with a focus on connecting disadvantaged and underserved populations to high-quality construction jobs.Schumer and Gillibrand have been vocal advocates of the need for local hire and other targeted hiring programs as part of federally-funded construction. Last month, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) heeded the senators’ calls to implement a local hire pilot program for highway projects. The provision passed out of the Commerce Committee would provide the DOT with the authority to turn the local hire pilot into a permanent authority across all DOT programs, not just the Federal Highway Administration and Federal Transit Administration.The City of Rochester initiative the Inner Loop North Transformation Study in 2019 to explore alternatives and advance recommendations for redesign of the Inner Loop North. Working alongside community stakeholders the study seeks to kick start the successful planning to transform the Inner loop North from a disruptive barrier into a corridor that improves connectivity, accessibility, and advances community development opportunities for residents and stakeholders along the corridor. The senators explained that on March 31st, the Biden Administration unveiled the American Jobs Plan, which calls for ‘reimagining and rebuilding’ a new economy. The Plan would aim to reconnect neighborhoods cut off by historic investments and increase opportunity, including through the use of local hire jobs programs, advance racial equity and environmental justice, and promote affordable access.Schumer and Gillibrand were joined by Rev. Julius Clay, Pastor of the New Bethel CME Church, City of Rochester Commissioner of Department of Environmental Services Norman Jones, Rochester City Councilman Malik Evans, Inner Loop North Transformation Study Community Advisory Committee Member Shawn Dunwoody, and local residents.The senators led the introduction of the Reconnecting Communities Act in April. Local hire and federal resources to rebuild local communities were also central provisions of the Economic Justice Act, legislation that Schumer and Gillibrand introduced last year to invest more than $435 billion to address systemic racism and underinvestment in communities of color. Additionally, Senator Gillibrand introduced in 2019 and in 2021 the Build Local, Hire Local Act, legislation that makes bold reforms to federal infrastructure programs, creates good-paying jobs, and works to right the wrongs of decades of disinvestment and exclusionary federal policies that have cut off communities of color and marginalized populations from opportunity in urban and rural areas alike. ###

Schumer, U.S. Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand and U.S. Representative Sean Patrick Maloney today announced an additional $3,820,790 will go to Orange County’s New York Stewart International Airport. The grant was awarded by the Federal Aviation Administration and funded in the Schumer-led American Rescue Plan, which was passed into law earlier this year. The funds will be used to cover costs which New York Stewart incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as enhanced sanitization and personal protective equipment.“Air travel is vital to the connectivity and success of the Hudson Valley’s economy, which is why, as we continue to build back better from COVID-19, it is critical that we provide the funding necessary to keep Stewart Airport in Orange County safe and efficient,” said Senator Schumer. “Airports stayed open during the worst of the pandemic to make sure service was available for those who needed it and did their best to keep everyone safe in an awful situation. I’m proud to deliver this funding for Stewart after all of its hard work, and I will continue to fight to make sure New York’s airports have the help they need to revive and thrive.”“The staff of Stewart International Airport worked hard throughout the pandemic to ensure that anyone who needed to travel to and from the Hudson Valley was able to do so safely and efficiently,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This funding will help mitigate the financial impact of COVID-19 by covering the cost of safety improvements and will ensure that Stewart can continue providing critical transportation services to the region. The airport’s continued success is tightly entwined with the Hudson Valley’s broader economic recovery and future prosperity and I will continue to fight on its behalf.”“New York Stewart International Airport is a key part of our local economy here in the Hudson Valley. It expands our connectivity and brings new business to our region,” said Congressman Maloney. “Ensuring Stewart has the funding it needs to reboot and expand its operations in the wake of the pandemic is a top priority for me in Washington. Today, I am proud that the nearly $4 million in funding we helped secure for Stewart in the American Rescue Plan has officially been issued. We’re getting these resources out the door quickly and efficiently so we can speed up our recovery and get New York back on track.”Senator Schumer has a long track record of fighting for New York airports due to the immense economic opportunities provided by increased connectivity. Earlier last year, prior to the pandemic, he called for Aer Lingus to consider adding flights from Stewart to Ireland and Great Britain and with the support of Gillibrand and Maloney, secured $8,715,204 million for Stewart International in previous COVID relief legislation. Stewart International is also expected to receive $12,499,175 in the Schumer-led bipartisan infrastructure deal. This announcement comes at a time when Frontier Airlines recently announced its plans to begin nonstop service to three Florida destinations from Stewart by this fall.“Hudson Valley Tourism Inc. would like to thank Senator Schumer, Gillibrand, and Congressman Maloney for securing over $3.8M for New York Stewart Airport in support of their pandemic recovery efforts,” said Amanda Dana, President of Hudson Valley Tourism, Inc. “As our team works to welcome thousands of visitors and showcase the Hudson Valley’s beautiful ten county destination this fall, this funding will not only allow Stewart to bolster the regional economy, but also to build back better than ever!”Schumer, Gillibrand and Maloney have also been instrumental in securing the necessary funds for PFAS remediation around Stewart Air National Guard Base, which is attached to the commercial airport. Earlier this year the base was selected for an accelerated and well-funded federal defense environmental clean-up program.###

Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today announced $4,661,981 in federal funding for eight projects which are key to the continued economic growth of the communities they serve. The projects range from critical infrastructure, like broadband and sewage, to housing analysis. The funding was allocated through the Northern Border Regional Commission’s (NBRC) State Economic & Infrastructure Development Investment Program to support infrastructure projects and other initiatives that create jobs, support entrepreneurs, and strengthen the economy in northern border communities.“The Northern Border Regional Commission has a special role to play spurring economic development and creating jobs. This funding will provide support to communities across Upstate New York, working to complete priority projects,” said Senator Schumer. “I am proud to support this essential funding in congress and will continue to fight to ensure it supports critical projects across Upstate New York.”“After more than a year of grappling with financial hardship caused by the pandemic, New York communities are relying on investments like this to attract new businesses, create good-paying jobs, and revitalize our communities,” said Senator Gillibrand. “Now more than ever, I am grateful for our valuable partnership with the Northern Border Regional Commission that will help New York’s local economies recover from the massive financial losses incurred during the pandemic and will continue to spur economic growth for years to come. I will continue fighting for funding that will help sustain Upstate New York economies through this difficult time and make necessary investments in infrastructure and other critical resources.”The NBRC is a federal-state partnership focused on the economic revitalization of communities across the Northern Border region, which includes northern Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York. The Commission is composed of the governors of the four Northern Border states and a federal co-chair, and provides financial and technical assistance to communities in the region to support entrepreneurs, improve water, broadband, and transportation infrastructure, and promote other initiatives to improve the region’s economy.

Built in 1929, the Wells water plant met the needs of the College’s campus. In the 1930’s, the Village’s water infrastructure was connected with the campus system and the Wells plant began providing water to all residents and business in the Village of Aurora. Currently, the system supplies 25 million gallons of water per year to a campus population of 700, along with 150 residences and a dozen businesses.With funding, Wells College seeks to address the water plant’s greatest need – replacement of two DE filters that are operating past their expected lifespan and are damaged.These filters cannot adequately manage water quality, causing the plant to shut down at high turbidity. This project will provide an updated, improved and appropriately rated DE filtration system, improving water quality and production efficiency.I applaud Wells College for its foresight and sincerely hope the application meets with your approval.Thank you for your consideration.

Schumer, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and U.S. Representative Joseph D. Morelle today announced $2,330,500 in federal grants awarded to two “look-a-like” community health clinics in the Finger Lakes: Trillium Health and His Branches. The funding was authorized and appropriated by the American Rescue Plan and delivered by the Department of Health and Human Services.The clinics’ “look-alike” designation refers to their similarity to federally-designated Community Health Centers (CHCs); they must fulfill all the same requirements as CHCs, namely providing care to any patient regardless of the patient’s ability to pay, but do not receive as much federal money as traditional CHCs. The American Rescue Plan, passed into law this spring, specifically designated look-alikes as eligible for these grants given the role they played on the frontlines of the pandemic. “The pandemic didn’t pay attention to bureaucratic distinctions as it ripped through communities in the Finger Lakes this last year,” said Senator Schumer. “As Majority Leader, when putting together the American Rescue Plan, I fought tirelessly for all community health clinics – including Trillium Health and His Branches – to have the tools they need to rebuild and recover from the pandemic. This funding helps them address the critical inequalities exposed by the pandemic and keep on saving lives.”“As New Yorkers face growing health challenges and economic hardship in the wake of the pandemic, community-based health clinics are playing an indispensable role in caring for the health needs of vulnerable communities across our state,” said Senator Gillibrand. “I am a proud champion of community health centers and ‘look-alike’ clinics, and I was proud to work with Senator Schumer to help secure this funding in the American Rescue Plan for Trillium Health and His Branches as they continue to serve the Finger Lakes community and provide access to health care to those most in need.""Just this past May, Senator Gillibrand stood at Trillium Health in Rochester to call for a package of three bills to help reduce the cost of prescription drugs, and help ensure that everyone can access the medicine they need. “Unfortunately, we know that underserved communities have been—and continue to be disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 public health crisis,” said Congressman Morelle. “Community-based health centers are critical to addressing these inequities and ensuring everyone has access to the care they deserve, which is why I’m so proud to join Senator Schumer in announcing this important funding that we helped deliver through the American Rescue Plan. Trillium Health and His Branches do incredible work to support our vulnerable communities and I’m grateful that this award will help them accelerate the vaccination process and make healthcare more accessible for Monroe County families.”“We are extremely grateful to Senator Schumer, Senator Gillibrand, and Congressman Morelle for securing $1.5 million in the American Rescue Plan to help Trillium Health serve the most vulnerable communities in Rochester and the Finger Lakes,” said Andrea DeMeo, President and CEO of Trillium Health. “The COVID-19 pandemic exposed longstanding healthcare inequities among the most vulnerable populations in our community. Trillium Health serves everyone regardless of their ability to pay, and we are uniquely positioned to bring our comprehensive services directly into hard-to-reach areas. We will use the American Rescue Plan funding to break down barriers to care, bring COVID vaccines and testing directly into underserved communities, support LGBTQ+ communities, and increase our capacity to serve the tens of thousands of patients who rely on us each and every day. Trillium Health is committed to promoting health equity through a lens of diversity, equity and inclusion, and we are deeply grateful for the support.”""The staff, board and patients of His Branches Community Health Center are incredibly grateful for the efforts of Senator Schumer and Gillibrand, as well as Representative Morelle, to secure American Rescue Plan funding for support of clinics like ours in Rochester and around the country. These funds are essential for our team’s ability to continue meeting the ever-changing needs of our neighbors by providing quality and accessible healthcare for those, like our patients, who are most at risk of health inequities,” said Mike Weston, Executive Director of His Branches.A breakdown of the funding appears below:CLINICCITYAMOUNTTrillium Health, Inc.Rochester$1,530,375His Branches, Inc.Rochester$800,125###

Schumer today announced a historic $61 million for the Capital District Transportation Authority (CDTA) to expand its Albany Washington/Western Bus Rapid Transit project. The funding comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Capital Investments Grant (CIG) Program, which funds local efforts to expand Bus Rapid Transit routes across the nation.The Washington/Western Bus Rapid Transit line will be the third rapid transit line operated by the CDTA. Schumer helped to secure federal funding for both the Central Avenue Corridor line that connects Albany to Schenectady and the River line that connects Albany to Troy and Cohoes in previous years.“Coming after a year and a half of hardship and isolation during the COVID pandemic, the $61 million announced today represents hope for a more connected and resilient future,” said Senator Schumer. “The CDTA keeps our community united, the wheels of the regional economy rolling, and serves as a vital lifeline for many Capital Region residents. I’m proud to deliver this historic investment into the CDTA, which will keep our transit moving and pave the way for expanded service.”CIG funds transit capital investments, including Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), specifically through the “Small Starts” program. The Albany Washington/Western Bus Rapid Transit project would implement bus rapid transit in the Washington/Western corridor that extends from the downtown Albany Bus Terminal, through the State University of New York at Albany and the Harriman State Office Complex, to the Crossgates Mall. The project includes limited stops, 16 uniquely branded buses, transit signal priority, queue bypass lanes, real-time bus arrival information, a one-mile semi-exclusive busway across the University campus, and bus maintenance garage expansion.Schumer is also currently working to secure implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework into law, which would provide approximately $113.9 million for the Capital District Transportation Authority (CDTA) over the next 5 years. CDTA estimates that their annual allotment over the previous 5 years has been $21.2 million and under the bipartisan infrastructure bill that would increase to $27.1 million, roughly a 30% increase. Additionally, the bill includes over $5.6 billion for clean buses. CDTA currently has four electric buses in service, with four more on order, and an ultimate goal of 25% of their fleet.###

Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today sent a letter to President Biden urging him to approve a major disaster declaration in Upstate New York following severe flooding caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred that rampaged through the Southern Tier, Central New York, and the Finger Lakes regions on August 18, 2021 until the morning of August 19, 2021. In order to receive money from FEMA, the State of New York conducted a Preliminary Damage Assessment in coordination with FEMA and on September 17, 2021, Governor Kathy Hochul requested a major disaster declaration, pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. The request now requires Presidential approval. Federal assistance through FEMA would support State, local governments, disaster relief organizations, and compensation by insurance for disaster-related losses.“Tropical Storm Fred ravaged Upstate New York and caused severe damage across the Southern Tier, Central New York, the Mohawk Valley, and Finger Lakes regions,” said Senator Schumer. “This immense damage totaled over $30 million in costs suffered and demands swift help from the federal government to help communities repair and recover. I strongly urge FEMA to approve New York State’s request for a disaster declaration as soon as possible.”“Tropical Storm Fred caused significant damage due to heavy rain and strong winds in Central New York, the Southern Tier, the Finger Lakes Region, and the Mohawk Valley. New York State has now been hit by three major storms in just the past few months. Coupled with the ongoing economic impacts of COVID-19, New Yorkers are facing crises on multiple fronts,” said Senator Gillibrand. “I am asking FEMA to promptly approve the disaster declaration and urgently needed federal assistance for state and local governments. We can’t afford to wait any longer.”“The damage from this storm is the most severe we have seen in a generation and our residents, businesses, and governments desperately need federal assistance that would come from this declaration.  We are also extremely grateful to Senator Schumer, Senator Gillibrand, and our state representatives for their support and advocacy in this trying time,” said Jack K. Wheeler, Steuben County Manager.Schumer and Gillibrand said a joint federal, state, and local Preliminary Damage Assessment to the impacted areas of Upstate NY revealed that costs exceeded $36.2 million in public infrastructure damage. The senators said the impact to the storm was substantial causing major damage and the relocation of students for the start of the school year in the Jasper-Troupsburg High School in Steuben County and Staley Elementary School in the City of Rome in Oneida County. In Steuben County alone, joint FEMA-State assessment teams identified damage to at least 122 homes and 26 businesses with a value of more than $3 million.Specifically, the request included Public Assistance for Allegany, Cayuga, Cortland, Lewis, Oneida, Steuben, Tioga, and Yates counties and Individual Assistance for the Individuals and Households Program including Other Needs Assistance, Crisis Counseling, Disaster Unemployment Assistance, Disaster Case Management, Disaster Legal Services, and SBA Disaster Assistance for Steuben County.A copy of Schumer and Gillibrand’s letter appears below:Dear President Biden:We write in strong support of the State of New York’s request for a major disaster declaration for the widespread damage and flooding caused by heavy rains on August 18, 2021 and continued until the morning of August 19, 2021.This severe storm caused significant damage across Upstate New York, including sustained damage leading to displaced residents, uninhabitable homes, the closure of schools, destroyed roads, and the tragic loss of life. A joint federal, state, and local Preliminary Damage Assessment revealed that costs exceeded $36.2 million in public infrastructure damage.Reflecting the statewide damage from these heavy rains and flooding, Governor Kathy Hochul requested a major disaster declaration on September 17, 2021, pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (P.L. 93-288), including Hazard Mitigation Grant Programs statewide and Public Assistance for Allegany, Cayuga, Cortland, Lewis, Oneida, Steuben, Tioga, and Yates counties and Individual Assistance for the Individuals and Households Program including Other Needs Assistance, Crisis Counseling, Disaster Unemployment Assistance, Disaster Case Management, Disaster Legal Services, and SBA Disaster Assistance for Steuben County.There is no doubt that this damage has overwhelmed state and local governments, and that a major disaster declaration is necessary. Federal assistance programs will be critical, so that our communities can recover from the flood damage. We thank the Governor and the State for their work thus far and strongly support the request for a major disaster declaration in the areas impacted by this storm event.  We appreciate your swift attention and consideration of this request and stand ready to work with you and the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to deliver support and resources to the impacted communities.Sincerely,###

Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today announced $12,316,450 in federal funding for five fire departments across Upstate New York to hire new firefighters. The funding was allocated through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Program.“Our brave firefighters worked around the clock during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to risk their lives to protect our communities,” said Senator Schumer. “These courageous first responders deserve all the federal support possible to help them do their jobs. I will always fight to bring more federal resources to support our brave firefighters, and I’m proud to deliver this funding so Upstate Fire Departments can hire new desperately needed firefighters without bearing the financial stress.”“Firefighters across New York State have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic to protect our communities,” said Senator Gillibrand. “I will continue fighting for funding to ensure that our fire departments have what they need to remain adequately staffed, respond quickly to emergencies, and stay safe on the front lines.”Specifically, the senators said the City of Albany, City of Auburn, Village of Johnson City, Town of Lagrange, and the City of Syracuse will receive the FEMA funding for hiring firefighters.The SAFER grant program was established by FEMA within DHS to provide funding directly to fire departments and volunteer firefighter interest organizations to help them increase the number of trained, “front line” firefighters available in their communities. The goal of SAFER is to enhance the local fire departments' abilities to comply with staffing, response, and operational standards established by the National Fire Protection Association and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.A breakdown of the funding appears below:LocationOrganizationAmountAlbany Auburn Johnson City Poughkeepsie SyracuseCity of Albany City of Auburn Village of Johnson City Town of Lagrange City of Syracuse$3,328,488 $1,266,480 $923,214 $3,561,143 $3,237,125 ###

Schumer released the following statement regarding the Commissary Kitchen’s ribbon cutting at Rochester’s Sibley Building:Senator Schumer said, “For decades the Sibley building was a gathering place for the Rochester community and an anchor for jobs and the economic prosperity of downtown. That’s why I was proud to secure a $1 million federal grant to create the Commissary Downtown Kitchen Incubator, which together with The Mercantile on Main, are leveraging their rich history to bring the Sibley building and downtown Rochester to new heights. This investment is a key ingredient to serving up economic development and new jobs, and proves that if you cook it, jobs will come!”The Commissary is a first-of-its kind food business incubator, which when partnered with “Mercantile on Main” located right next door, will create expanded access for entrepreneurs who would otherwise not have access to a commercial kitchen. Schumer visited the site in October of 2018 and worked to secure a $1 million grant from the Economic Development Administration (EDA) in support of the Commissary.Schumer has also long supported the revitalization of the Sibley Building, including securing $42.5 million in federal New Market Tax Credits needed in 2015 to kick start the $200 million redevelopment of the Sibley Building.  He also secured a $2.6 million EDA grant in 2016 to construct the NextCorps High Tech Business Incubator and Accelerator ($2.6 million) on Sibley’s 5th and 6th Floors and a $1.5 million federal DOT grant in 2014 to reconstruct East Main St with new on-street parking and pedestrian amenities so that customers can easily access the Sibley Building. Next door to Sibley, he also secured a $1.5 million federal EDA grant in 2013 to construct RIT’s Center for Urban Entrepreneurship, which like Sibley, is an anchor for downtown Rochester’s Innovation Zone. Schumer said the revitalization of the Sibley Building is a boost for downtown Rochester – bringing investment and jobs – and a return to form for an iconic Rochester landmark.###

Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today urged the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to approve any request from New York City and State for a major disaster declaration following the severe flooding caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Ida that rampaged through the New York City, Long Island and the Hudson Valley regions on September 1st. The senators specifically referenced New York City as being particularly battered by the storm, getting a record 3.15 inches of rain in Central Park over the course of just one hour and over 10 inches of rain falling in various communities.In the evening on September 1st, Governor Kathy Hochul declared a State of Emergency in New York State within the counties of Bronx, Dutchess, Kings, Nassau, New York, Orange, Putnam, Queens, Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk, Sullivan, Ulster, and Westchester in response to major flooding due to Tropical Depression Ida. Schumer and Gillibrand requested that FEMA actively prepare to issue a disaster declaration for the storm-ravaged New York City, Long Island and Hudson Valley communities, and additionally, to be prepared to participate in a Preliminary Damage Assessment with state and local officials, should the state request it.If a disaster declaration is declared, grant assistance would be made available to state and local governments, as well as certain non-profit organizations, to reimburse costs incurred for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. This funding is available on a cost-sharing basis; FEMA generally covers 75 percent of the eligible costs for permanent and emergency work.  After any severe storm, the first step in the declaration process is for the state to request a Preliminary Damage Assessment, during which FEMA representatives join state, local, and other officials to survey damage across storm-impacted counties to help determine whether the cost of the disaster meets the criteria for a federal disaster declaration. Schumer and Gillibrand urged FEMA to be prepared to support any requests for aid from New York State.The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act authorizes the president to issue “major disaster” or “emergency” declarations before or after catastrophes occur. The decision to issue a disaster declaration is at the discretion of the president, and must be requested by the governor of the state. These declarations unlock federal aid through FEMA that is broken into two broad areas: Individual Assistance (IA) that aids families and individuals, and Public Assistance (PA) that is mainly for emergency work such as debris removal and permanent repairs to infrastructure. When assessing the degree of PA damage, FEMA considers six factors: estimated cost of the assistance, localized impact, insurance coverage, hazard mitigation, recent disaster, and programs of other federal assistance. Regarding the cost, FEMA has certain thresholds that have to be met to qualify for PA specific to the state and the counties in question.A copy of Schumer and Gillibrand’s letter appears below:Dear Administrator Criswell:We write in strong support of New York City and the surrounding suburban counties, including Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Putnam, Dutchess, Sullivan and Ulster that were recently deluged by Tropical Storm Ida. Last night, September 1, 2021, the remnants of Tropical Storm Ida paralyzed the New York City, Long Island, and Hudson Valley regions, dropping an unprecedented amount of rainfall, battering the local infrastructure, trapping thousands of New Yorkers, and tragically taking the lives of a number of our citizens. We urge the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to stand ready, if requested, to immediately work with affected cities, counties, and New York State to determine whether the damage meets the statutory threshold for FEMA disaster assistance, and if it does—to make assistance available as expeditiously as possible.Given the scope and historic nature of this storm– with New York City getting a record 3.15 inches of rain in Central Park over the course of just one hour and over 10 inches of rain falling in various communities – we are confident that a FEMA disaster declaration and assistance will be necessary to meet the urgent need of thousands of New Yorkers and their communities that experienced significant amounts of damage, injury, and in some cases, loss of life. Governor Kathy Hochul declared a State of Emergency for New York, Bronx, Kings, Queens, Richmond, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Ulster, and Sullivan counties to address the subsequent flood of homes, highways, roads, subways, and other public infrastructure.As New York begins to recover from this storm, we are once again reminded and deeply appreciative of the prompt attention that the federal government has historically given when responding to disaster impacting New York State.  In that spirit, we strongly urge you to approve any forthcoming requests for FEMA assistance from New York State with all due speed as affected communities begin their recovery from these storms.Sincerely,###

The senators specifically referenced Steuben County as being particularly battered by the storm, which wreaked havoc across New York State. During the storm, New York received over 7 inches of rain in three days, with 24-hour totals exceeding 3 inches in many locations and one receiving over 5 inches, helping make this one the wettest summers in the region. On the night of August 18th, Swift Water Rescue Crews had to be deployed to assist dozens of residents evacuate their homes and take refuge in shelters. In the Southern Tier, rushing floodwaters damaged hundreds of homes, businesses, roads, bridges, and were so powerful they even caused a train to derail. Local creeks reached historic levels, with the Tuscarora Creek cresting at over 14 feet. Communities in Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, and Lewis also saw heavy rains, flooding, and damage.Additionally, the storm resulted in the Jasper-Troupsburg High School becoming inundated with nearly four feet of water and mud, causing severe damage. On August 19th, Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency for Steuben County. Schumer and Gillibrand requested that FEMA actively prepare to issue a disaster declaration for the storm-ravaged Southern Tier, Mohawk Valley, Central New York and Finger Lakes communities, and additionally, to be prepared to participate in a Preliminary Damage Assessment with state and local officials, should the state request it.“Steuben County and communities across the Southern Tier, Mohawk Valley, Central New York and the Finger Lakes were ravaged by Tropical Storm Fred’s heavy rain and historic flooding levels,” said Senator Schumer. “The damage is major and will likely total tens of millions of dollars in costs suffered, including the severely damaged Jasper-Troupsburg school. FEMA needs to mobilize its Disaster Assessment Teams and stand ready to swiftly approve any forthcoming requests from the state for assistance to help these communities recover.”“Flooding from Tropical Storm Fred devastated communities across Central New York and the Southern Tier, forcing families to flee their homes and causing severe damage to roads, bridges, businesses, and schools,” said Senator Gillibrand. “As these communities begin the process of rebuilding, FEMA should do everything in its power to ensure that aid is deployed swiftly should the state request it.”If a disaster declaration is declared, grant assistance would be made available to state and local governments, as well as certain non-profit organizations, to reimburse costs incurred for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities.

On August 19, Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency for Steuben County. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, locations in multiple counties in Central Upstate New York received over 7 inches of rain in three days, with 24-hour totals exceeding 3 inches in many locations and one receiving over 5 inches, helping make this one the wettest summers in the region.

We urge the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to stand ready, if requested, to work with affected counties and New York State to respond to the impacts of this storm and if the state requests it, to make assistance available through a pre-disaster declaration as expeditiously as possible.Hurricane Henri first formed on August 14, as a small low-pressure area over 200 miles northeast of Bermuda. The storm then moved through above average temperature Atlantic waters, picking up strength to become a tropical storm a few days later. A little before 11:00 AM on August 21, the National Hurricane Center announced the storm had strengthen to become a Category 1 hurricane. According to the latest projections, Hurricane Henri will likely make landfall somewhere along the middle of Long Island. With high speed winds, projected rainfall pockets of up to 10 inches, and 3 to 5 feet of storm surge coupled with a full moon high tide, the impact on Long Island, New York City, and the surrounding coastal communities could be devastating. Further complicating matters, recent storms have left the ground close to saturated, and with fully leafed trees, experts are predicting that numerous downed trees could lead to significant power outages, possibly lasting more than a week in some places. New York has not been hit by a storm of this magnitude since Hurricane Sandy, and following on the recent experience with Hurricane Isaias last year combined with the forecasts for this hurricane, New Yorkers are understandably concerned ahead of this storm. Therefore, we urge FEMA to stand ready to approve any pre-disaster declaration request that may come from New York State, and provide any and all assistance available to New Yorkers should the storm impact New York.We are grateful for the prompt attention that the federal government has historically give in responding to disaster impacting New York State.  In that spirit, we strongly urge you to approve any forthcoming requests for FEMA assistance from New York State as affected communities begin their recovery from these storms. Sincerely,###

Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, today announced that FEMA has granted Individual Assistance to Dutchess County.On September 2, 2021, FEMA approved a disaster declaration for NYC, Long Island, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster, and Westchester counties. Individual Assistance, however, was approved initially for just Bronx, Kings, Nassau, Queens, Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk, and Westchester counties. Now, Dutchess County residents will be able to access critical additional resources for home repairs and other services like crisis counseling and unemployment assistance. Families without insurance coverage may also be eligible for aide covering some disaster expenses to help restore their homes or personal property.“Tropical Storm Ida devastated communities across New York, and Dutchess County suffered millions in damage to roads, businesses, and hundreds of homes,” said Senator Schumer and Senator Gillibrand. “While we will continue to fight to get Dutchess County homes, businesses and communities on the road to recovery, we are proud FEMA has heeded our call for this vital federal assistance to provide families the support they need to recover and rebuild stronger. We will continue to fight tooth and nail to ensure families throughout the Hudson Valley have all the resources they need to build back stronger than before. ” The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act authorizes the president to issue “major disaster” or “emergency” declarations before or after catastrophes occur. The decision to issue a disaster declaration is at the discretion of the president, and must be requested by the governor of the state. These declarations unlock federal aid through FEMA that is broken into two broad areas: Individual Assistance (IA) that aids families and individuals, and Public Assistance (PA) that is mainly for emergency work such as debris removal and permanent repairs to infrastructure. When assessing the degree of PA damage, FEMA considers six factors: estimated cost of the assistance, localized impact, insurance coverage, hazard mitigation, recent disaster, and programs of other federal assistance. Regarding the cost, FEMA has certain thresholds that have to be met to qualify for PA specific to the state and the counties in question. ###

PNPs including food kitchens, homeless shelters, museums, libraries, community centers, schools and colleges will be eligible to apply for up to $2 million in loans through the U.S. Small Business Administration. “Tropical Storm Fred ravaged Upstate New York and caused severe damage to our businesses and communities across the Southern Tier, Central New York, Mohawk Valley, and Finger Lakes regions. This Small Business Administration funding will provide essential support to help those most affected by the storm to restore their businesses and nonprofits and rebuild stronger,” said Senator Schumer. “I will continue to fight to make sure Upstate New York nonprofits have the resources needed to fully recover and rebuild from the storm.”“Tropical Storm Fred caused millions of dollars’ worth of damages to upstate New York,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This federal assistance will allow a wide range of non-profit organizations to build back from the storm and protect against future disasters. I will continue fighting for relief measures like this one to ensure that New York makes a full and swift recovery.” In September, Majority Leader Schumer and Senator Gillibrand sent a letter to President Biden urging him to approve a major disaster declaration in Upstate New York following severe flooding caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred.PNPs located in Allegany, Cayuga, Cortland, Lewis, Oneida, Steuben, Tioga, and Yates counties in New York are eligible to apply for loans. The filing deadline to submit applications for physical property damage is December 7, 2021.

https://www.schumer.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/schumer-gillibrand-announce-agriculture-disaster-declaration-for-orange-county-,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Following multiple disaster events in the 2021 Crop Year, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has issued a primary agricultural disaster designation for Orange County, New York. Under this disaster designation, agricultural producers in Orange County are eligible to apply for emergency loans and assistance from the Farm Service Agency in order to recoup production losses.“New York’s farmers and agricultural producers are a cornerstone of the Hudson Valley, and for an industry already operating on razor-thin margins, production losses during the COVID pandemic have been the last straw,” said Senator Schumer. “Today’s disaster declaration will go a long way, not only towards helping farmers recover their losses from the 2021 Crop Year, but also towards securing the long-term economic viability of agriculture in Upstate New York. I will continue to do everything in my power to help the farmers of Orange County and the rest of the state get the critical federal assistance they need ASAP.”“This disaster declaration will connect New York’s farmers with federal resources and is an important first step to help the agricultural industry recover from disasters that impacted crop production,” said Senator Gillibrand. “I will continue fighting for resources to ensure that farmers in Orange County and throughout the state can get back on their feet.” Farmers in eligible counties have 8 months from the date of the disaster declaration to apply for emergency loans.###

This comes nearly two months after the Canadian government opened their side of the border to vaccinated U.S. travelers and will represent the first nonessential bilateral crossings since the nascent stages of the pandemic in March of 2020.  “Kudos to president Biden for doing the right thing and increasing cross border travel between Canada and the U.S.,” said Senator Schumer. “The high vaccination rates on each side of the boarder have opened the door of safe cross border travel and will now safely increase the rebirth of the economic energy of Upstate NY.”Senator Schumer added, “Since the beginning of the pandemic, members of our shared cross-border community have felt the pain and economic hardship of the land border closures. That pain is about to end. Very soon, the link between New York and our northern neighbors will finally be re-established, reuniting families, bolstering businesses, and ending a frustrating cycle of waiting for everyone involved.”Schumer has repeatedly called for a detailed, publicized plan for reopening based on science and agreed upon by public officials and health experts since May of this year, citing the economic, educational, property, medical, business, or family ties to Canada many communities along the Northern Border have. Specifically, he has made multiple calls calls to DHS Department of Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas, Canadian Ambassador Kirsten Hillman, and Secretary of State Blinken, following his personal visits to the Rainbow Bridge, Massena, Plattsburgh, and Sackets Harbor earlier this year.The U.S.-Canadian Border first closed to non-essential travel on March 20, 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID between the two countries. Since then, the border has remained closed, causing hardships for individuals, families, businesses and communities, who depended on cross-border travel to see loved ones or to generate revenue. On August 9th, Canada reopened the border to vaccinated travelers from the U.S., but the U.S. held off on following suit. Under current restrictions, which will be lifted in early November as Schumer confirmed, Americans can fly into Canada with proof of a negative COVID test, but cannot enter through a land port of entry.Senator Schumer’s original letter sent in May to Secretaries Mayorkas and Blinken appears below:Dear Secretaries Blinken and Mayorkas:I write to urge the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security to work in coordination with your Canadian counterparts to finally develop a transparent, bilateral, and public plan based on public health data and guidance – with specific standards, protocols, and metrics – to safely reopen the Northern Border to non-essential travel. Similarly, I strongly urge you to negotiate an interim expansion of the essential travel designation to include the thousands of impacted New Yorkers, in addition to millions of other vaccinated American and Canadian citizens. Having endured one of the deadliest chapters in New York’s history, the residents along the border are ready to turn the page and re-establish the familiar links to their loved ones, their property, and their prosperity.While the fight against the COVID pandemic remains paramount, we must acknowledge the progress New Yorkers have made in rolling up their sleeves, getting vaccinated, and reducing the burden of the virus. Due to the rising rates of vaccinated Americans and the subsequent decline in cases in New York and elsewhere, it has become abundantly clear that an agreement can and should be reached to safely accommodate the border communities without compromising the fight against COVID-19.  A bi-national plan with clearly defined benchmarks will provide clarity and transparency to a confusing and frustrating process.  Such an agreement is critical to safely and coherently reopening the border for non-essential travel as quickly as the underlying data would permit.  I ask that this detailed plan be publicly released with all due speed.As you work bilaterally to develop this plan, I further request that you work with our Canadian allies to immediately expand the definition of essential travel to include that of citizens with family, property, educational, medical, or business interests, who have also fulfilled their civic responsibility to get vaccinated. As we approach the summer season, thousands of New Yorkers and Canadians alike are facing the prospect of being cut-off from their properties for another year. Compounding this headache is the report that the Canadian government is preparing to levy additional taxes on underutilized vacation properties, despite the inability of property owners to reach their homes.Additionally, I once again ask that you work with your Canadian counterparts to clarify the policy for boaters who traverse the border mid-transit. Boaters, including tour boat companies that cross the border without docking, do not increase the spread of COVID-19 and should not be unduly penalized by the border policy.Lastly, I request that you develop a plan to ensure the safety of our border personnel as we reopen the border. It is incumbent upon both the United States and Canada to provide adequate testing, vaccination, and protective equipment to CBP and all federal employees along the entirety of the Northern Border. I also ask that CBP evaluate current policies and processes to increase efficiency and touchless travel at ports of entry. Without ensuring the safety of our frontline personnel and adapting our port procedures to a new COVID reality, we cannot hope to return to the normalcy that has defined U.S.-Canadian border crossings in New York and beyond.Once the epicenter of the global health and economic pandemic, New Yorkers have worked diligently to significantly reduce the spread of COVID infections and have led the nation in vaccinations week after week; it is now incumbent on the federal government to do their part and aid their desperate desire to fully rebuild and recover. This recovery cannot be done, and I will not rest, until bilateral collaboration to safely reopen the United States and Canadian land border is an utmost priority and a plan for a full reopening is publicly released. Sincerely,###

Schumer met with impacted workers in Olean and called on Siemens to sell the plant to a manufacturer that will maintain the current manufacturing jobs, many of them unionized steelworkers. Schumer urged Siemens to minimize the impact of the plant’s sale and explained that preserving each of the nearly 1,000 jobs is integral to the economic health of the entire region.“A fixture in local manufacturing for generations, Siemens Energy’s decision to close the Olean manufacturing plant will have tremendous ripple effects on everyone from the employees and their families to business owners and local governments, which depend on well-paying and reliable jobs staying in Olean,” said Senator Schumer. “Siemens must do right by the community and make sure that any manufacturer they sell to will commit to keeping steelworker jobs in Olean.”Schumer added, “Manufacturing operations in Olean go back over a century, fostering generations of skilled steelworkers and significant local pride, and Siemens should do everything in their power to ensure that legacy continues long after they’ve left.”In February, Siemens Energy announced that it would be cutting jobs across the U.S., including 530 of the 890 total jobs in Olean. Upon hearing the news, Schumer immediately reached out to Siemens top brass to argue against the decision to cut jobs and remind the company of the importance of the manufacturing plant in Olean’s community. Siemens Energy has unfortunately continued with their plan to cut manufacturing jobs and sell the plant, which would result in the loss of most of the USW Local 4601 workforce in Olean, more than 300 of whom currently work at the site.The Olean plant produces mostly turbines and compressors, which Siemens energy plans to scale back. The Siemens Energy plant in Painted Post will be absorbing approximately 100 of the jobs being cut in Olean, and many white collar, non-manufacturing jobs are slated to remain, mostly in R&D and engineering.That plan, Schumer said in February, was not a viable solution for the community or the workers whose jobs are in danger. Therefore, the senator called on Siemens to sell to a manufacturer that would commit to keeping those union jobs in Olean.Schumer’s latest push is the latest in a lengthy history of activism on behalf of the Olean facility and the USW jobs that have staffed the plant for decade, as well as the other Siemens Energy facilities across New York State.Schumer was joined by impacted members of the United Steelworkers and local officials.###

I will continue to fight for federal funding to keep our airports open and operational and to make sure Upstate New York has the help it needs to revive and thrive.”“As New York bounces back from the COVID pandemic, air travel and tourism will be a vital part of our economic recovery,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This federal funding will enable the Buffalo Niagara International Airport and the Watertown International Airport to invest in infrastructure and make much needed safety improvements.

Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today announced in federal funding for mental health treatment and research centers throughout New York state through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). The senators heralded the news of the funding, saying it comes at a critical time for New Yorkers during the COVID pandemic, which has exacerbated the national mental health crisis.“No one should have to fight the battle against mental illness alone,” said Senator Schumer. “As New Yorkers, we are stronger when we are together, and today’s federal funding will work to rally community resources surrounding mental health care and research. Those facing mental health battles need our support now more than ever, and I’m proud to deliver this SAMHSA funding that will bring community support for our most vulnerable residents.”“The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened a nationwide mental health crisis,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This federal funding will help ensure that New Yorkers struggling with mental health and addiction have ongoing access to comprehensive, integrated care. I will continue fighting for resources for mental health and addiction treatment centers throughout New York State and make sure that New Yorkers who need care can get it.”The funding announced today comes from the Community Mental Health Block Grant and will help provide necessary mental health resources for communities by supporting mental health research and fortifying mental health and substance abuse treatment services. Schumer has been a staunch advocate for mental health services in Upstate New York, including for Liberty Resources in Central New York, which received funding today. The senator visited Liberty Resources in 2019 to launch a three-pronged plan to combat the devastating uptick of suicide deaths in Central New York, and wrote a letter of support for the organization earlier this year. Liberty Resources serves Onondaga, Monroe, Oswego and Madison Counties and with the funding announced today, expects to be able to serve an additional 500 community members.“Liberty Resources is grateful to be the recipient of the Federal Community Mental Health Center Grant to support Mental Health and Substance Abuse services in our communities throughout CNY and Rochester NY,” said Carl Coyle, CEO Liberty Resources, Inc.  “My deepest gratitude goes to Senator Schumer for providing the Senate leadership which made these grants available throughout our nation, in response to the significant stress on all Americans due to COVID.  With Suicide and overdose rates increasing significantly, this support is critically needed for treatment providers like Liberty Resources in meeting the increased demand for service in our local communities. This Grant will particularly strengthen our service delivery system in the over 48 schools and school Districts where our counselors provide desperately needed services to our youth and their families.”In April 2021, Senator Schumer visited Access: Supports for Living Mental Health and Substance Use Urgent Care to announce the $4 million he secured for the continuation of mental health and substance abuse services in the City of Newburgh. The senator has been a supporter of Access Mental Health and Substance Use Urgent Case since the inception of the facility  in December of 2018, securing $2 million so the facility could open in May of 2019.

Specifically, targeting Middletown, Newburgh, Kingston, Ellenville, and Wawarsing, this $2,108,134 proposal would greatly benefit over 2 million Hudson Valley residents struggling with mental health issues through a new Rapid Engagement and Community Health (REACH) team. As one of the largest Behavioral Health and Human Service providers in the Mid-Hudson, Access has created this innovative proposal to establish the REACH team. This Team will serve Orange and Ulster County residents with serious emotional disturbances, mental illnesses, and co-occurring disorders outside of its clinic’s four walls. The REACH team will support individuals living in the historically underserved and marginalized communities of Middletown, Newburgh, Kingston, Ellenville, and Wawarsing, with a specific focus on engaging with Latinx individuals to provide community-based care.The Access REACH team is critically important because adults living in poverty are almost 2 times more likely to experience serious mental illness and the average combined poverty rate in Middletown, Newburgh, Kingston, Ellenville, and Wawarsing is 20%, compared to 13% statewide. Moreover, according to a recent Mid-Hudson Community Health Assessment, 82.5% of people in Orange County and 68% of people in Ulster County are highly impacted by mental health issues. Mental health was also considered one of the top three most significant issues affecting health in both Ulster and Orange County. The REACH team will improve access to mental health services experienced by these communities. Through these funds, the REACH team will expand and enhance the existing capacity of the Access Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic Expansion grant sites in Middletown, Newburgh, and Kingston to meet their target communities’ growing Behavioral Health needs. Thank you for your consideration and please do not hesitate to reach out to my office with any questions.  Sincerely,###

Schumer today announced that following his direct advocacy he has secured $11,960,000 for the City of New Rochelle’s LINC: Safety, Mobility & Economic Opportunity project. Schumer, who personally spoke to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to advocate for this project during their first meeting, and subsequently raised the federal DOT funding request for this project with Secretary Buttigieg last month in a personal call, said this much-needed grant will convert Memorial Highway from a six lane highway to nowhere to a walkable, bike-able city street with open green space. Schumer explained the project would be especially vital to achieving equity in the city, as it would reconnect residents in central New Rochelle, especially in the city’s Lincoln Avenue neighborhood that has long suffered from the barriers created by the overbuilt and underutilized Memorial Highway, to community resources and job opportunities in New Rochelle’s downtown area. Funding is allocated through the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grant program.“Transforming this highway into a useable city street, filled with a park, bike paths, and streetscape improvements is a win-win-win for New Rochelle,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. “The federal government will finally help to advance equity for New Rochelle residents while transforming a dangerous highway into a vibrant public space. In tandem with recently secured wins from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that I helped negotiate, this will drive the local economy forward, create opportunities for good paying jobs, increase access to critical services, and reconnect communities.”Schumer added, “The pandemic has revealed the need for nature and safe outdoor transportation, like bike and walking trails, even in the heart of a city. Projects such as the ‘LINC’ will help cities like New Rochelle improve air quality and community livability, achieve equity and revitalize their regional economies. As Majority Leader, I'm proud that Secretary Buttigieg has heeded my calls to transform this highway to nowhere and prioritize this important investment in Westchester.”Schumer explained that Memorial Highway was originally proposed to connect I-95 to the Hutchinson River and Cross County Parkways. However, only the first phase of the antiquated highway project was ever built, leaving an overabundance of infrastructure that delivers traffic from Exit 16 of 1-95 to New Rochelle’s local community roadways. In short, Memorial Highway is overbuilt, underutilized, and unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists. Schumer said the current six-lane highway just stops at Lincoln Avenue, effectively a highway to nowhere. Fortunately, the funding announced today aims to tackle these problems, and will establish a holistic infrastructure system to connect key parts of central New Rochelle. This community, Schumer said, was physically, socio-economically, and psychologically separated from New Rochelle’s downtown area in 1958 when Memorial Highway bulldozed their neighborhood. The city estimates that roughly 25,000 residents currently live in the Lincoln Avenue neighborhood.Specifically, Schumer said that the LINC will convert three roadways from two-way to one-way operations in order to accommodate the traffic that currently utilizes the relic Memorial Highway, implement new signalization at key intersections, and construct the new bike and pedestrian areas on Memorial Highway, including on the Memorial Highway Overpass from the Cedar Street (Exit 16) ramps to the roundabout on Memorial Highway. These complete street improvements and the new bicycle, pedestrian, and open space on Memorial Highway announced today will better serve the residents in the Lincoln Avenue neighborhood and promote business and economic activity in New Rochelle as a whole.Schumer also noted the Memorial Highway is dangerous for residents and only carries a little over 16,000 motorists a day on average, but the congestion and delays have created headache after headache for residents and workers trying to access the city’s downtown area. The LINC was designed to reduce conflict between the different modes of transportation in the area. Schumer said New Rochelle has put in years of planning and building community support and now, with this new infusion of federal funding, those dreams can finally become a reality.  The ‘LINC’ project received $6 million from New York State last year as part of a $10 million package to improve downtown New Rochelle, and has had over $15.4 million in non-federal matching funds but Schumer said this massive federal funding was the final piece of the puzzle to make the project happen.Schumer has been a staunch advocate of the LINC, strongly supporting the project for over three years. The senator has directly raised its importance with Secretary Buttigieg. First last December, before he was Transportation Secretary, and he again reiterated his support to Buttigieg in a personal call last month. Schumer explained that this funding is provided by the U.S. DOT RAISE grant program, formerly known as BUILD or TIGER, which funds transportation projects of national and regional significance. This round of RAISE Grants, funded by FY21 appropriations, awards $1 billion in funding to communities nationwide.  In the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, this program received additional funding at $7.5 billion over five years. This is on top of other transportation and highway funding programs like the INFRA (Infrastructure for Rebuilding America) grant program, that funds transportation projects with a strong connection to improving freight operations, which is funded at $3.2 billion.Schumer said the recently passed bill also includes $13.5 billion for the highway and formula bridge funding, including $12.5 billion for a competitive bridge program that states and localities can apply to. For the first time, the bill also creates the Reconnecting Communities Pilot Program which provides $1 billion in competitive grants for planning and projects to remove, retrofit, or mitigate existing highways that were built through neighborhoods and created a barrier to mobility and economic development, an effort that Schumer is working to provide billions of dollars in additional federal investment for in the Build Back Better reconciliation bill.A copy of Schumer’s original letter to Secretary Buttigieg supporting the project appears below: Dear Secretary Buttigieg:Following our January meeting earlier this year, I am pleased to write in support of the grant application submitted by the City of New Rochelle to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s 2021 RAISE Transportation Discretionary Grants Program to construct the “LINC,” an innovative project that converts the overbuilt, underutilized and hazardous Memorial Highway into a safe, linear open space with bicycle facilities and pedestrian amenities.As mentioned during our meeting in early January of 2021, the LINC will help to achieve equity in the City of New Rochelle by enhancing safety and multi-modal transportation options for residents, and building stronger economic linkages between the Lincoln Avenue neighborhood and New Rochelle’s burgeoning downtown. Memorial Highway was originally proposed to connect I-95 to the Hutchinson River and Cross County Parkways. However, only the first phase of the antiquated highway project was ever built, leaving an overabundance of infrastructure that delivers traffic from Exit 16 of 1-95 to New Rochelle’s local community roadways. Memorial Highway is overbuilt, underutilized, and unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists. Moreover, those living in central New Rochelle, especially in the Lincoln Avenue Corridor neighborhood, have suffered because the highway has created barriers between their neighborhoods and the community resources and job opportunities in New Rochelle’s downtown area.The LINC aims to address these issues by reinvesting in the community and its existing infrastructure to spur new economic development, promote connectivity to jobs and resources, and enhance the character of these areas to improve the overall quality of life for residents and the City at large. Specifically, the LINC will convert three roadways from two-way to one-way operations in order to accommodate the traffic that currently utilizes Memorial Highway, implement new signalization at key intersections, and construct the new pike and pedestrian areas on Memorial Highway, including on the Memorial Highway Overpass from the Cedar Street (Exit 16) ramps to the roundabout on Memorial Highway. These complete street improvements and the new bicycle, pedestrian, and open space on Memorial Highway will better serve the residents in the Lincoln Avenue neighborhood and promote business and economic activity in New Rochelle as a whole.As you know, I’ve supported completion of the LINC for years and significant planning, community involvement, and investment in this project has already occurred. For example, in addition to contributing its own resources, New Rochelle secured $10 million from New York State in 2018 through the highly-competitive Downtown Revitalization Initiative program to implement projects that improve the Lincoln Avenue Corridor, including the LINC. However, as I mentioned during our January meeting, to improve equity and construct the best and most transformative project for this community, New Rochelle needs your partnership through this federal investment from the U.S. Department of Transportation. I applaud the City of New Rochelle for its foresight and strongly support their application.Thank you for your consideration. Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions.Sincerely, ###

Schumer, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney today announced the National Parks Service (NPS) has heeded their call and awarded the site designation as a National Historic Landmark. This designation will ensure the integral contributions the 93-acre site has made to advancing American ingenuity in mechanical engineering are preserved and shared with future generations to come.“Finally, after years of work, the West Point Foundry Preserve, the site of some of America’s most prevalent manufacturing at the start of the Industrial Revolution, is officially recognized for its immense historical significance and tremendous natural beauty,” said Senator Schumer. “I am proud to have fought for this designation as a National Historic Landmark in Putnam County and am thankful that new access to critical federal funding will help preserve this breathtaking destination for future generations.”“The West Point Foundry helped the U.S. become an industrial superpower in the 19th century, manufacturing everything from cannons for the Union Army to pipes for New York City’s water system,” said Senator Gillibrand. ”I am proud to have fought to preserve this historic New York treasure so that people from all over the country can continue to visit, learn about the site’s critical role in the Industrial Revolution, and enjoy the spectacular scenery of the Hudson Valley.”“I am proud to have fought for the West Point Foundry to be awarded as a National Historic Landmark, a designation long overdue given the Foundry’s groundbreaking work in transportation and manufacturing during America’s Industrial Revolution,” said Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney. “This incredible historic site is finally receiving the recognition and funding it deserves, and I can’t wait for more Americans to learn about this incredible piece of New York’s proud history.” ""Scenic Hudson is honored that the West Point Foundry Archeological Site has become a National Historic Landmark,” said Scenic Hudson President Ned Sullivan. “We protected and created West Point Foundry Preserve to ensure that the remains of this industrial powerhouse would always be available for visitors to learn about the important role it played in growing and reuniting our nation, and to provide an opportunity for future study. Scenic Hudson thanks Senators Schumer and Gillibrand and Rep. Maloney for their active, long-time support of this designation.”The representatives explained that the West Point Foundry Archaeological Site is located on a 93-acre nature preserve in Putnam County, New York—63 miles north of New York City. The site has a rich history as a former hub of mechanical innovation during the Industrial Revolution. Recognizing the need for American companies to control the production process of essential technology, the 19th century site in Cold Spring operated from 1818 to 1911 and was contracted after the War of 1812 to provide the U.S. government with cannons and ammunition, and later provided these vital supplies to the Union Army during the Civil War.  The delegation said that its groundbreaking development of the Parrott gun—lauded for its range and accuracy—captured the interest of President Abraham Lincoln and prompted a presidential visit in 1862.  Additionally, the representatives said that the foundry pioneered the creation of new methods of transportation, and manufactured some of the nation’s first locomotives and steamships, which helped to connect the nation’s countryside and waterways and transformed the United States’ economy. Amongst its many accomplishments, the foundry also produced machinery for the cotton and sugar industries and provided cast-iron pipes that supplied New York City's first water system.The delegation applauded Scenic Hudson, a Hudson Valley-based nonprofit and the steward of the foundry, along with several research organizations that have fostered significant archeological discoveries over the last 30 years that have helped to broaden the public's understanding of the technological advancements of the day, and the influence industrialization had on social and cultural transformations. The representatives further explained that the West Point Foundry continues to be a center of learning and exploration and was named a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). Today's designation of the foundry as a National Historic Landmark will support enhanced scholarly research and cement the Foundry as a go-to destination in the Hudson Valley.The delegation further explained that the NPS designation as a National Historic Landmark will have myriad benefits for the outdoor museum, as well as for Putnam County. Certain federal preservation grant programs place a priority on awarding funds to National Historic Landmarks. This funding can be used for maintenance and upkeep of the historic site. In addition, the representatives said the National Historic Landmark designation would help increase the name recognition of the West Point Foundry Preserve, bringing new tourists to the site and boosting the Putnam County economy as a result.  ###

Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has awarded $39,172,473 in COVID-19 relief funding to airports and counties across Upstate New York. These grants are funded by the American Rescue Plan Act to provide economic relief funds for costs related to operations, personnel, cleaning, sanitization, janitorial services, debt service payments, rent and minimum annual guarantees to airport concessions located at primary airports, and combating the spread of pathogens at the airport.“Air travel was among the most severely impacted industries amid the height of the pandemic, and is vital to the connectivity and success of the Upstate New York economy,” said Senator Schumer. “As Majority Leader, I am proud to deliver this funding through the American Rescue Plan, which I negotiated in the Senate, to provide much needed relief to these vital economic engines of our Upstate communities. Help is on the way that will put Upstate New York’s airports on the road to recovery and reach new heights.”“As air travel slowly returns to normal levels, this funding will help ensure that airports throughout the state have the resources they need to operate safely and bounce back despite the devastating toll of the pandemic,” said Senator Gillibrand. “I am proud to have voted for the American Rescue Plan to deliver this funding to some of the New York airports that need it most and I’ll keep fighting to provide federal resources to communities statewide.”A breakdown of the over $39 million going to Upstate New York airports can be found below:Airport Name Project Title COVID Relief Grant AmountAlbany InternationalLarge Concessions, Small Concessions$1,282,039Plattsburgh InternationalLarge Concessions, Small Concessions$107,515Syracuse Hancock InternationalLarge Concessions, Small Concessions$1,089,607Watertown InternationalGeneral ARPA$1,110,954Watertown InternationalLarge Concessions, Small Concessions$19,286Westchester CountyLarge Concessions, Small Concessions$747,059Stewart InternationalLarge Concessions, Small Concessions$229,665Buffalo Niagara InternationalGeneral ARPA$18,037,049Buffalo Niagara InternationalLarge Concessions, Small Concessions$2,106,785Niagara Falls InternationalGeneral ARPA$2,016,356Niagara Falls InternationalLarge Concessions, Small Concessions$104,573Frederick Douglass-Greater Rochester InternationalGeneral ARPA$10,967,641Frederick Douglass-Greater Rochester InternationalLarge Concessions, Small Concessions$1,093,695Greater BinghamtonLarge Concessions, Small Concessions$32,632Ithaca-Tompkins InternationalLarge Concessions, Small Concessions$93,596Elmira-Corning RegionalLarge Concessions, Small Concessions$134,021

Schumer today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded a $4,701,099 annual subsidy for American Airlines to continue operations at Watertown International Airport. Schumer said this funding provided through the Essential Air Service (EAS) program will fund 12 nonstop round trip flights per week from Watertown to Philadelphia International Airport from February 1, 2022, through January 31, 2024 using a 50-passenger Embraer ERJ-1 plane.“Air travel was among the most severely impacted industries amid the height of the pandemic, and this tremendous news for Watertown International Airport is a shot in the arm to the regional economy and clears the North Country economy for takeoff,” said Senator Schumer. “With this critical funding, Watertown International Airport will be able to ensure direct flights to Philadelphia for years to come. I’m proud of the role I played in securing this vital federal funding, and I will keep fighting to ensure that airports like Watertown’s have the resources they need to fully recover and better serve Upstate residents and businesses.”""This service is so important to our community it keeps our soldiers, families, friends, treatment of the sick, tourism and business all connected to where they need to be. This announcement will ensure American Airlines keeps our community connected to the national airspace system, for which we are grateful,"" said Grant Sussey, Manager of Watertown International Airport.Schumer has a long history fighting for the Watertown International Airport and expanding air services in Upstate New York. In 2015, Schumer secured $3,591,188 in federal funding to pay for a 1,000-foot extension of Taxiway A, which runs parallel to Runway 28, as well as a 1,000-foot extension to Runway 28 itself. The extension of the runway is what allowed larger planes to land during cold weather, thus permitting 50-seat jets, like the ones the ones used by American Airlines, to continue landing during the winter. In 2017, Schumer stood at Watertown International Airport to fight against drastic cuts from EAS program specifically so airports like Watertown could continue to take advantage of subsidies to better service their communities.The EAS program was developed after the airline industry was deregulated in 1978. Deregulation gave airlines the freedom to decide which markets to serve and how much to charge for that service. This led to a scarcity of air service in many communities across the country where operating costs were higher and populations were smaller and less dense. The EAS program was put in to place to guarantee air service to these underserved communities. EAS ensures commuter airlines across the country serve approximately 140 rural communities, including six communities in Upstate New York: Watertown, Jamestown, Massena, Ogdensburg, Plattsburgh, and Saranac Lake/Lake Placid.###

Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, today announced that FEMA has granted Individual Assistance to Orange County.On September 2, 2021, FEMA approved a disaster declaration for NYC, Long Island, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster, and Westchester counties. Individual Assistance, however, was approved initially for just Bronx, Kings, Nassau, Queens, Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk, Westchester, and later Dutchess County. Now, Orange County residents will be able to access critical additional resources for home repairs, such as repair or replacement of personal property, funds for moving and storage, or medical, dental, and childcare. Assistance can also include funds for temporary housing units, housing and driveway repairs, crisis counseling, unemployment assistance and legal services. Families without insurance coverage may also be eligible for aide covering some disaster expenses to help restore their homes or personal property.“Hurricane Ida devastated communities across New York, and Orange County suffered millions in damage to roads, businesses, and hundreds of homes. I am proud FEMA has heeded our call for this vital federal assistance to provide individuals the support they need to recover and rebuild stronger.,” said Senator Schumer. “This critical aid will help get Orange County families, businesses, and communities on the road to recovery. I will continue to fight tooth and nail to ensure families throughout the Hudson Valley have all the resources they need to build back from Ida stronger than before. ” “Given the scope and historic nature of Hurricane Ida, I strongly encourage all residents of Orange County to apply for the Individual Assistance Program,” said Senator Gillibrand. “I worked alongside Senator Schumer and our colleagues to unlock this emergency FEMA funding after Ida devastated homes and communities. This funding will go directly into the hands of Orange County residents and can make the difference in helping keep your family safe today and from future storms. If you need additional assistance, my office is here to help.”The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act authorizes the president to issue “major disaster” or “emergency” declarations before or after catastrophes occur. The decision to issue a disaster declaration is at the discretion of the president, and must be requested by the governor of the state. These declarations unlock federal aid through FEMA that is broken into two broad areas: Individual Assistance (IA) that aids families and individuals, and Public Assistance (PA) that is mainly for emergency work such as debris removal and permanent repairs to infrastructure. When assessing the degree of PA damage, FEMA considers six factors: estimated cost of the assistance, localized impact, insurance coverage, hazard mitigation, recent disaster, and programs of other federal assistance. Regarding the cost, FEMA has certain thresholds that have to be met to qualify for PA specific to the state and the counties in question. ###

Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today announced $4,414,376 for Syracuse University and $1,377,409 for Oneida County from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to cover costs associated with the University and County’s COVID responses. The funds reimburse each for expenses related to the purchase and distribution of medical supplies and materials including PPEs, enhanced cleaning/disinfecting facilities, dissemination of information to the public and guidance regarding COVID-19, HVAC systems, and other components of combatting the spread of COVID-19. This funding is provided at a 100% federal cost share, which Schumer fought hard to include for NY since the pandemic began.“Oneida County, Syracuse University, and so many other entities throughout New York heroically stepped up to fight the pandemic on the front lines, resulting in increased spending, while experiencing significant revenue losses, so I am proud to deliver this funding that will help Central NY prevent tax hikes, keep essential services running, and rebuild the local economy,” said Senator Schumer.  “Pandemic recovery begins by tackling the tremendous costs local government and our higher education institutions have incurred managing the crisis and keeping students and residents safe throughout the pandemic.”“Universities and local governments grappled with unprecedented challenges during the early days of the pandemic,” said Senator Gillibrand. “The investments Syracuse University and Oneida County made in PPE and other safety measures undoubtedly slowed the spread of the virus and helped save lives. This federal funding will reimburse those expenses and help these institutions to recover from the financial toll of COVID-19.

https://www.schumer.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/schumer-gillibrand-announce-300000-in-federal-funding-for-local-arts-organizations,"Today, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand announced $300,000 in federal funding for local arts agencies in Westchester and St. Lawrence counties. The funding was allocated through the National Endowment for the Arts as part of the American Rescue Plan and will be used to help local arts venues recover from the economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic. ArtsWestchester and the St. Lawrence County Arts Council will each receive $150,000 for subgranting within their own communities. “The arts are the beating heart of New York’s cultural life and a driving force in the economy; an investment in the arts is an investment in New York’s future, as a cultural capital of the world, tourist destination, and a vibrant place to live,” said Senator Schumer. “Our arts venues were among the hardest hit during the heights of the pandemic, and I am proud to deliver this critical funding which will help art venues in the Hudson Valley and North Country recover and thrive. I will continue to fight hard for programs that support our artists, foster creativity and supports venues as the critical cultural hubs that they are on Main Streets across the state.” “New York’s cultural institutions are world-renowned,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This funding will help ensure they have what they need to survive and thrive after the devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic.” “ArtsWestchester has supported artists throughout the pandemic with over $730K in grants and commissions,” said ArtsWestchester CEO Janet T. Langsam. “This major American Rescue Plan grant from the NEA will help us expand our support of the artist community through our Voices for Change grant program in 2022. Voices for Change grants will enable artists to develop and present new work that inspires and informs and may be a catalyst for action.

https://www.schumer.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/following-a-letter-and-direct-meeting-with-canadian-prime-minister-trudeau-schumer-announces-canada-will-begin-process-to-remove-burdensome-and-costly-testing-requirements-for-vaccinated-new-yorkers_-,"Senator Fought For Months To Reopen U.S.-Canadian Border, Which Recently Advanced; But The Overly Stringent Testing Policy Was Harming Economic Flow Between Nations Schumer Advocated Directly To PM Trudeau To Remove Expensive, Burdensome Testing Requirements For Vaccinated American Travelers Canada Will Remove The COVID-19 Testing Requirement For Canadians Who Spend Less Than 72 Hours In The U.S. And Begin Working On Easing The Burden For North Bound Americans Schumer: Families, Shoppers, Sports Fans, Businesses Will Now Be Able To Travel More Easily Across The Border Just In Time For The Holidays! After a personal meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer today announced that Canada will now remove the stringent molecular COVID-19 testing requirement for Canadians who spend less than 72 hours in the U.S. and importantly will begin working on easing the testing requirement burden for vaccinated Americans traveling to Canada.Schumer said that Canada’s policy stated that vaccinated travelers crossing the border to enter Canada must present a negative pre-arrival molecular coronavirus test no more than 72 hours before their arrival at the border, but that this created an extreme economic hardship and burden for vaccinated folks seeking to travel. Now, after Schumer spoke directly with Prime Minister Trudeau, he says Canada will first lift the testing requirements for Canadians entering the U.S. and then begin work on easing the overly expensive and cumbersome pre-arrival molecular coronavirus test for vaccinated New Yorkers and Americans traveling to Canada.“Canada and the United States share an interest in safe and sure reopening of the border to vaccinated travelers. It hurts both our great nations’ economies when fully-vaccinated individuals face costly and cumbersome hurdles,” said Senator Schumer. “Following my letter with fellow senators and direct conversation with Prime Minister Trudeau, I am pleased Canada is taking action to improve the border testing policy— in a safe way based on science, data and common sense — to allow for safe and more steady border travel by fully vaccinated travelers just in time for the holidays.”Schumer explained that the currently required molecular coronavirus test, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, are expensive and burdensome and can cost between $100-$300 for individuals looking to travel over the border. In addition, Schumer said that these tests are often not easily accessible, with some having to drive hours out of their way to get an accepted test just to travel, which greatly impeded the kind of short-term travel, for the fully vaccinated, that is the lifeblood of communities on both sides of the border. Schumer also noted that while some travelers may have access to free or discounted tests, the timing of test results can make traveling extremely difficult.Earlier this week Senator Schumer joined Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Mike Crapo (R-ID) in a joint letter asking the Canadian government to help address the challenges created by COVID-19 testing requirements that could slow travel between the U.S. and Canada.A copy of the bipartisan letter Senator Schumer sent with his colleagues appears below:Dear Minister Joly:As the northern U.S. border opens to vaccinated travelers and tourism this week, we commend the Canadian government for its early and consistent efforts to fully reopen the U.S.-Canada border. While there is much to celebrate, we ask that the Canadian government help address the challenges created by coronavirus (COVID-19) testing requirements that could slow travel between the U.S. and Canada.We have heard from constituents that the testing protocols required by the Canadian government to enter the country will make it very costly for individuals to travel between our two nations. Currently, the Canadian government requires vaccinated travelers entering the country to take a pre-arrival molecular COVID-19 test, which can be costly. This expense could discourage tourism and will be prohibitively expensive for individuals who regularly travel across our northern border, including those in Minnesota, Maine, Idaho, and New York. While some travelers may have access to free or discounted tests, the timing of test results will prove challenging to navigate. We applaud the steps Canada has taken to ease cross border travel restrictions and urge the Canadian government to now remove testing requirements for vaccinated travelers and to engage with U.S. authorities regarding any concerns. It is important for both of our nations’ economies that fully vaccinated individuals are able to travel between Canada and the U.S. with ease.Thank you for your attention to this important issue. ###

Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today announced $4,512,600 for the Loretto Health & Rehabilitation and $3,035,960 for the Samaritan Medical Center from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to cover costs associated with emergency protective measures taken for their COVID responses. The funds reimburse each for expenses related to providing COVID-19 laboratory testing and testing supplies, used to test their employees ensuring that individuals did not spread the virus to staff, patients, or the local community as they provided direct care and response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This funding is provided at a 100% federal cost share, which Schumer fought hard to include for NY since the pandemic began.“Samaritan Medical Center in Watertown, Loretto in Syracuse, and so many other entities throughout New York heroically stepped up by increasing spending, while experiencing significant revenue loss, and working ceaselessly to help New York beat back the virus. I am proud to deliver this vital federal support to help these essential medical facilities recover and continue to keep our communities safe,” said Senator Schumer.  “Upstate New York and its hospitals have been amongst the hardest hit in the nation, and with this funding, the continuing frontline fight being waged by our health care system and its incredible workforce will receive the dollars they need, and so very much deserve, to keep saving lives.”“Health care providers have lost billions of dollars during the pandemic due to spiking costs and slashed revenues,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This federal support will help ensure that Samaritan Medical Center and Loretto can maintain staffing levels, provide PPE, and continue to keep our Watertown and Syracuse communities safe as we encounter and fight new variants of COVID-19. I’ll keep working to help New York medical facilities offset operating costs so that they can continue to provide quality care to every New Yorker.” ###

Schumer today announced the federal government has heeded his call and that Wyoming County Community Hospital has received $1,836,381 from the next round of the Provider Relief Fund (PRF) created by the CARES Act.  Earlier this month Wyoming County declared a state of emergency in an effort to fight back against a rise in COVID-19 cases and variants like Omicron. Schumer said that this new funding will help Wyoming County Community Hospital combat the spread of COVID-19, cover rising costs, and ensure they have the resources to keep the community safe.“Western New York hospitals are on the frontlines battling the many variants of COVID, I saw firsthand the tremendous need for assistance in my visit to Wyoming County last week and promised I would fight to get this money out quickly. Now, I am proud to deliver over $1.8 million in federal assistance for the Wyoming County Community Hospital to help them continue their essential work to keep our community safe,” said Senator Schumer. “As majority leader, I am proud to have championed multiple COVID-19 relief bills including the American Rescue Plan which provided these pandemic relief funds and I will continue to fight to ensure our hospitals and communities have all the help they need to stop the spread and meet the rising demand as we enter the winter months.”Joseph McTernan, CEO of the Wyoming County Community Health System  said, “We are extremely grateful to Senator Schumer for his advocacy in helping secure this funding for WCCH. With COVID infection rates again spiking in our community, we need all hands on deck to both care for the increasing number of patients being admitted for care while addressing the burden of increased costs required to provide this care. We appreciate Senator Schumer’s support for significantly impacted hospitals like WCCH to access this critical relief funding as we continue to navigate the pandemic and serve the community.”Senator Schumer has delivered over $13.5 billion in grant funding to NY hospitals and providers through the Provider Relief Fund alone with billions more still awaiting to be disbursed. In addition, the Senator has secured tens of billions of dollars in much-needed relief including through various legislation and programs that delivered low-cost loans to providers, staved off potentially disastrous federal cuts to Medicare payments and increased payments to the New York Medicaid program that have helped NYS from instituting drastic cuts in provider reimbursements and consumer benefits. In the April 2020 CARES Act, Schumer led the charge in Congress to create the Provider Relief Fund (PRF) - managed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) - with to provide funding to healthcare providers and hospitals caring for patients with COVID-19 and who suffered high expenses and lost revenues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Although initially funded at $100 billion, Schumer led the charge in Congress further to successfully add an additional $86.5 billion to the Provider Relief Fund (PRF) throughout the last year through the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enactment Act, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 and the American Rescue Plan.A copy of Schumer’s original letter to HHS appears below:Dear Secretary Becerra,I write to request that the Department of Health and Humans Services (HHS) take into consideration the uptick in COVID-19 cases in certain areas of the country such as Western New York and the Finger Lakes Region when calculating the payments to providers that will be made in the upcoming General Distribution from the Provider Relief Fund (PRF). Hospitals and providers in this area, such as Wyoming County Community Hospital, are working day and night to care for patients amid intense financial pressures and need this funding in order to deal with the increase in COVID-19 cases that are crowding their hospital beds. I also ask that these funds be made swiftly; New York providers – especially those in Upstate New York – cannot be made to wait for this direly needed relief.As you well know, New York has suffered huge losses during the course of this pandemic. While a robust vaccination and testing program has kept the state from reliving the worst of the pandemic’s early days, parts of the state continue to experience high levels of coronavirus caseloads. As of December 10th, 2021, the three counties in New York with the highest daily average number COVID-19 cases per 100,000 are all found in Western New York: Orleans (103), Wyoming (103), Genesee (100). The caseloads in these counties and other areas of New York have increased to such a high level, that 32 hospitals across the state report having 10% or less of available bed capacity open to admit new patients. Due to these critical conditions, New York State has mandated that these hospitals suspend elective procedures until bed capacity improves. The combination of high costs associated with treating COVID-19 patients and the loss of high-revenue-producing elective procedures is damaging the financial health of hospitals such as Wyoming County Community Hospital and highlighted the need for more federal support through programs like the Provider Relief Fund.In the April 2020 CARES Act, Congress created the PRF with an initial $100 billion in support for providers caring for patients with COVID-19 and who suffered high expenses and lost revenues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Congress further supplemented the fund with an additional $86.5 billion over the next year through the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enactment Act, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 and the American Rescue Plan.As of December 10th, 2021, your Department has sent out over $130 billion in funding from the PRF across three phases of General Distributions and eight targeted allocations, the most recent being the $8.5 billion in American Rescue Plan’s Rural payments. These General Distributions were made using various formulas based on revenues and losses reported in past years’ Medicare and Medicaid cost reporting, tax filings and other financial information. The targeted allocations were based on a wider variety of factors including in some cases the level of COVID-19 admissions at a hospital provider.In September 2021, HHS announced that up to $17 billion would be made available in a new PRF General Distribution and solicited applications from providers across the country for this funding. The information collected in these applications to develop the formula that will calculate these General Distribution payments once again only considered past tax filings, cost reporting data and other financial information. It does not consider the rising levels of COVID-19 in hard-hit areas such as Upstate New York.In light of the ongoing increase in COVID-19 cases, I ask that your Department refer to its past practices at the height of the pandemic and incorporate data into the General Distribution formula that captures the enormous burdens placed on providers who are treating patients and saving lives in areas with high rates of COVID-19 cases. I also call on the Department to make these determinations swiftly and distribute the funds as soon as possible. Providers like Wyoming County Community Hospital need these funds now, and communities like those in Western New York cannot afford to wait any longer.I thank you and your Department for your excellent service during this crisis.Sincerely, ###

The funding was allocated by the Department of the Treasury through the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund) and includes both financial assistance and technical assistance awards to support the services offered by CDFIs. The senators said the funding will be used to invest in the capacity and capital programs offered by CDFIs, empowering them to grow, achieve organizational sustainability, and support low-income and distressed communities by contributing to their revitalization and expanding access to capital and other critical assistance for disadvantaged small businesses.“The CDFI Fund is a vital stream of federal investment that supports financial services to New York’s most vulnerable communities and expands access to capital and support for disadvantaged small businesses,” said Senator Schumer. “I have made it a high priority to fund the CDFI program and deliver this critical assistance to New York to help to uplift our most vulnerable neighborhoods, businesses, and families who are still struggling from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and boost recovery efforts across the state. I will continue to fight to protect critical investments like these for our communities and make sure New York gets the federal investment it needs to fully recover and come back stronger.”“This critical CDFI funding will support New York’s underserved communities, low-income neighborhoods, and small businesses,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This significant federal investment is great news for New York State and will put over $16 million back into the businesses and communities that need it most. I will keep fighting in the Senate for the resources needed to stimulate local businesses, bolster support for our communities, and create sustainable jobs.”The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI) provides small businesses and community development projects with capital investment unavailable in their local economies. The program funds projects that work to revitalize low-income and underserved communities. Some CDFIs focus their programs on an immediate region of service while others are national in the scope of their work, including projects and investments in New York.A breakdown of the funding appears below: OrganizationCity/StateAwardAccompany Capital, Inc.New York, NY$676,530Alternatives Venture Fund Inc.                                                        Ithaca, NY$125,000BOC Capital CorpBrooklyn, NY$701,530Brooklyn Alliance Capital IncBrooklyn, NY$125,000Brooklyn Cooperative Federal Credit UnionBrooklyn, NY$476,530CheckSpring Community CorporationBronx, NY$676,530Community Development Venture Capital AllianceNew York, NY$701,530Disability Fund, Inc.Rockville Centre, NY$1,090,000Equitable Facilities FundNew York, NY$125,000Finest Federal Credit UnionNew York, NY$125,000Grameen America, Inc.New York, NY$1,046,530Habitat for Humanity NYC Fund, Inc.New York, NY$125,000Harlem Business Alliance, Inc.New York, NY$125,000Launch New York, Inc.Buffalo, NY$225,000Local Initiatives Support CorporationNew York, NY$3,440,000Lower East Side Peoples Federal Credit UnionNew York, NY$476,530National Federation of Community Development Credit UnionsNew York, NY$625,000Neighborhood Trust Federal Credit UnionNew York, NY$676,530New York University FCUNew York, NY$701,530Nonprofit Finance FundNew York, NY$1,201,530Oswego County FCUOswego, NY$590,000Renaissance Economic Development CorporationNew York, NY$701,530Syracuse Cooperative Federal Credit UnionSyracuse, NY$125,000The Urban Empowerment FundNew York, NY$125,000The Working World, Inc. dba Seed CommonsNew York, NY$525,000USAlliance Federal Credit UnionRye, NY$125,000Utica Neighborhood Housing Services, IncUtica, NY$200,000Seneca Nation of Indians Federal Credit UnionIrving, NY$150,000TOTAL:$16,006,830  ###
