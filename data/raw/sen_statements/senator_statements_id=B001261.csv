In addition, it provides regulatory certainty and expedites permitting of key projects.“Important infrastructure, highway, and energy projects across the country are being strangled by the red tape coming out of the Biden administration,” said Sen. Barrasso. “Road and bridge safety projects that take months to build are now taking years to permit. Energy projects are being hijacked by open-ended and far-reaching ‘climate change’ reviews. We need to focus on making the permitting process easier, not harder. Our legislation makes key reforms that will help energy and infrastructure projects get done better, faster, cheaper, and smarter.”“Critical infrastructure and energy projects in Wyoming, as well as across the country, face a constant uphill battle when trying to bring projects online under the Biden Administration. The onslaught of overly burdensome environmental regulations and red tape have caused unnecessary delays and, in many cases, brought projects to a grinding halt,” said Sen. Lummis. “I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing this commonsense permitting reform bill to expedite approval of essential projects.”Full text of the legislation can be found here.A section by section summary of the legislation can be found here.###Permalink: https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/barrasso-lummis-support-comprehensive-permitting-reform-legislation"

But that’s exactly what the Biden administration’s new turbo-charged environmental regulations would do if left in place.”Earlier this year, Senator Barrasso joined U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) in introducing the resolution of disapproval, along with all 50 Senate Republicans. The resolution passed the Senate today with bipartisan support, 50-47.“People in Wyoming are hurting and can’t keep up with rising energy costs. The last thing they need is Washington making it harder to produce affordable American energy,” Barrasso said. “We need relief from the environmental extremists running this administration. Making American energy more expensive in the middle of an energy crisis is the absolute worst thing President Biden can do.”Under this rule, permitting for new energy projects would virtually come to a halt, making the review process for oil and gas pipelines and energy infrastructure projects even more of a nightmare. It would force federal agencies to prioritize climate politics over economic progress.“Democrats want to make it harder to produce energy here in America,” Barrasso said. “Republicans want to make it cheaper, better, and faster to get critical energy infrastructure done to unleash American energy and move our economy forward.”The resolution now heads to the U.S. House of Representatives for consideration and a vote.###Permalink: https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/barrasso-votes-to-stop-biden-s-disastrous-nepa-regulations"

This criteria change would make it more likely for the Air National Guard in Wyoming and Nevada, which have MAFFS missions, to be selected by the Air Force to upgrade their aging C-130H fleets with more capable C-130Js.Having C-130Js will have a substantial impact on readiness and firefighting capabilities in Wyoming, Nevada, and other states across the West facing the risks of constant wildfires.“With the ongoing threat of wildfires across the Rocky Mountain West, having access to C-130J aircraft in Wyoming is more critical than ever,” said Senator Barrasso. “The C-130J air tanker is one of the best tools we have to quickly and efficiently suppress wildfires. Our bipartisan legislation will require the Air Force to use the Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System mission as a C-130J basing requirement. By expanding access to this vital air tanker, we ensure Wyoming and other western states have every advantage possible when fighting wildfires.”“Western states like Nevada are facing more severe and frequent wildfires, forcing the Nevada Air National Guard to fly in some of the hottest temperatures, highest elevations, and most challenging mountainous environments in the country,” said Senator Rosen. “I’m introducing this bipartisan legislation to make it more likely for the Nevada Air National Guard to receive the aircraft they need to battle ever-worsening wildfires out West.”###Permalink: https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/barrasso-rosen-introduce-legislation-to-allocate-better-fire-fighting-aircraft-to-the-west"

Every state has been impacted,” Barrasso said.Barrasso called on President Biden to finally visit the southern border in person and work with Border Patrol to give them the resources they need to secure the border.“Yet the Democrats and Joe Biden turn their back, look the other way, refuse to see the tragedy they are bringing to our country as a result of their policies,” Barrasso said. “And Joe Biden still hasn’t been here. He actually hasn’t been to the border since 2008, and that was just a drive-by.”“I would say to the President of the United States: Show up right here. Talk to these border agents. Listen to them. They know what we need to do to secure the border. You have an obligation and a responsibility to do that and start today,” Barrasso said.Click here for YouTube video of Sen.

Liz Cheney, all R-Wyo., sent a letter  to Department of the Interior (DOI) Secretary Haaland blasting DOI for the lack of transparency in its recent, massive acquisition of land in Natrona and Carbon Counties.  In the letter, the delegation notes how the administration didn’t involve the public, local and state officials in the process and failed to consider the impacts of lost revenue on local communities.  The delegation specifically urges DOI to neutralize the Bureau of Land Management’s expansion of the federal footprint in Wyoming by identifying equivalent disposal opportunities elsewhere in the state. They also call for the reinstatement of a previous DOI policy requiring local and state support before the federal government can acquire more land.  “However, because the federal government already owns and controls nearly half of Wyoming’s lands, we question the BLM’s need to purchase and acquire vast amounts of additional lands in our state—especially if such acquisitions are not accompanied by equivalent federal land disposals,” the delegation wrote. “Also, we are troubled that there appears to have been no coordination or communication between BLM and state and local officials prior to the purchase and acquisition, and that no notice was given prior to the June 2 announcement.”  Click here for a copy of the letter.  June 23, 2022 Dear Secretary Haaland, On June 2, 2022, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) announced its largest Wyoming land purchase in history, a 35,670-acre acquisition of private property spanning Carbon and Natrona counties. The BLM purchased this land using $21 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). No prior notice was given to local, state, or federal officials, stakeholders, or Wyoming citizens.  We steadfastly respect private property rights, and the rights of individual landowners to sell to willing buyers. We also understand the desire to increase access to our public lands so that all Americans can enjoy them. However, because the federal government already owns and controls nearly half of Wyoming’s lands, we question the BLM’s need to purchase and acquire vast amounts of additional lands in our state—especially if such acquisitions are not accompanied by equivalent federal land disposals. Also, we are troubled that there appears to have been no coordination or communication between BLM and state and local officials prior to the purchase and acquisition, and that no notice was given prior to the June 2 announcement. We supported former Secretary Bernhardt’s requirement in Secretary’s Order 3388 for any federal acquisitions made using LWCF funds to be supported by the affected Governor and local county or county government-equivalent.  While federally-owned lands can offer opportunities such as recreation, tourism, and wildlife habitat, they can also yield costly drawbacks. For instance, when the federal government owns land in a county, the county cannot collect property tax on that acreage and such losses need to be offset by additional federal spending through the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) Program. In addition, in spite of major recent investments, federal land management agencies continue to struggle to adequately address significant maintenance needs. Consequently, additional federal acquisitions only serve to add to this backlog, further diminishing land management agencies’ ability to effectively manage lands and assets.  We are also troubled by this Administration’s policies regarding management of public lands. The so-called 30 by 30 initiative, though ill-defined, appears to be intended to grow the federal footprint and expand federal control over western lands. In fact, in its announcement of the land acquisition, BLM stated that the project supports the Administration’s initiative “to conserve 30 percent of the nation’s lands and waters by 2030,” further confirming fears that 30 by 30 will be ‘achieved’ through land acquisitions. In Wyoming, we know that private landowners and local officials are the best stewards for lands within our state. Federal ownership of land has not, and never will be, equivalent to conservation. I would urge both the Department and the Bureau to make decisions based upon what’s best for the land, not what might be in the Administration’s political interests.  For the above-mentioned reasons, we urge you to neutralize BLM’s recent expansion of the federal footprint in Wyoming by identifying equivalent disposal opportunities elsewhere in the State. We further urge you to reinstate former Secretary Bernhardt’s policy to ensure local and state approval prior to federal land acquisitions. Finally, in cases where determinations have been made to purchase and acquire new lands, we implore you to provide better notice to relevant officials, stakeholders, and citizens, and quickly and adequately counteract losses to local revenues.###Permalink: https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/wy-delegation-blasts-blm-for-secretive-land-acquisition-in-wyoming"

As a senator for Wyoming, I know the meaning of the Second Amendment. I will not vote for any legislation that would jeopardize the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. My focus has been on mental health, school safety, and better enforcement of our current laws. This legislation goes beyond that,” said Sen. Barrasso. “What happened in Uvalde, Buffalo, and other communities across the country is heartbreaking. We want our children to be safe in school. We want parents to feel safe sending their kids to school. I will continue working in a bipartisan way to address our nation’s mental health crisis and to make schools safer.”“The Uvalde shooting was tragic and my heart goes out to all of the family members impacted by that horrific event. I was hopeful the Senate would act to prevent these kinds of tragedies in the future by addressing mental health issues and ways to make our schools safer, something I would wholeheartedly support. However, this legislation includes measures that infringe on the Second Amendment rights of lawfully abiding gun owners in Wyoming – something I will always oppose,” said Sen. Lummis.Both Sens. Barrasso and Lummis are committed to ensuring schools are safe and secure. Earlier this month, Sens. Barrasso and Lummis cosponsored the Safe Schools Act, which would allow local education agencies to repurpose unused COVID relief funds to harden schools.                                                                                          ###Permalink: https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/barrasso-lummis-stand-up-for-second-amendment-rights"

Liz Cheney, all R-Wyo., sent a letter to the Department of Transportation requesting timely assistance to help Yellowstone National Park and its gateway communities repair the damage caused by recent historic and unprecedented flooding.In the letter, the delegation specifically calls on the Biden administration to provide emergency relief funds to help begin the immediate repair of critical infrastructure needed to restore park operations.“The timely and efficient delivery of funds is imperative to restoring park operations and helping gateway communities. We urge you to use all of your current authorities and funding to help National Park Service address this disaster,” the delegation wrote. “Your ability to quickly and effectively respond to the infrastructure and disaster-response needs of the Park Service will have an immense impact on Yellowstone, its millions of annual visitors, and the gateway communities whose economies depend on the park.”Click here for a copy of the letter.June 17, 2022Dear Secretary Buttigieg,Yellowstone National Park, the nation’s first National Park which attracts over four million visitors annually, has received historic and unprecedented flooding. During the week of June 12, severe rainfall produced historic floodwaters and rockslides, causing significant damage to vital infrastructure in and around the park, including roads and bridges. This damage has created substantial interruptions to park operations that will continue to occur until repairs can be made.The timely and efficient delivery of funds is imperative to restoring park operations and helping gateway communities. We urge you to use all of your current authorities and funding to help National Park Service address this disaster.We request that the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provide Emergency Relief funds to help begin emergency repairs. In the near term, we ask the FHWA to immediately provide ample sums of its “quick release” Emergency Relief funds in order to fulfill the Park Service’s initial needs. Once such funding has been provided, we ask that FHWA continue to deliver sufficient emergency funding to Yellowstone National Park on an as-needed basis for critical emergency repairs and resiliency improvements. In particular, the Emergency Relief for Federally Owned Roads Program (ERFO)— which assists the National Park Service with the repair or reconstruction of federal roads and infrastructure with severe damage from natural disasters or from catastrophic failure— should be utilized to the fullest extent needed.As Yellowstone’s infrastructure is rebuilt, we ask that you consider any future funding requests from Federal, State, and local partners to help repair damaged infrastructure and boost resiliency to any future natural disasters. This includes any potential applications through the Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, Efficient, and Cost-saving Transportation (PROTECT) program or the Nationally Significant Multimodal Freight & Highway Projects program (known as the INFRA program).Your ability to quickly and effectively respond to the infrastructure and disaster-response needs of the Park Service will have an immense impact on Yellowstone, its millions of annual visitors, and the gateway communities whose economies depend on the park.  ###Permalink: https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/wy-delegation-works-to-secure-emergency-federal-assistance-for-yellowstone-national-park-wyoming"

These savings are still facing federal taxes despite significantly diminished value imposed by historic rates of inflation.The Middle-Class Savings and Investment Act will help American families, retirees, ranchers and farmers as inflation outpaces any interest earned or gains accrued by their savings through targeted tax relief.“The reckless policies of the Biden administration have led to 40-year high inflation that is eating away at the savings of middle-class families, retirees, ranchers and farmers,” said Senator Barrasso. “Historically high gas prices, food prices, and housing costs are emptying the wallets of people in Wyoming and across the country. The Middle-Class Savings and Investment Act helps Americans combat inflation by keeping Uncle Sam out of their pockets.”“The reckless spending, backwards energy policy and overall economic mismanagement of this administration has led to 40-year high inflation. Unlike other plans, like gas tax rebates or increased taxes on businesses, our legislation will not further fan the fires of inflation,” said Senator Grassley. “Middle class families, retirees, small businesses and farmers have watched as their savings erode in value while still facing taxes on gains that may not even keep pace with inflation.

Senator Barrasso discussed this issue with Secretary Becerra earlier this year at a Senate Committee on Finance hearing.“As the American people return to normalcy, workers, families, frontline health care providers, and a range of other stakeholders need transparency and certainty regarding the path forward,” the Senators wrote. “This unpredictable patchwork of mandates and questionable authorities will continue to erode the public’s confidence in government health agencies. For frontline health care providers and patients, the administration’s erratic approach to transitioning beyond a perpetual state of pandemic emergency could prove particularly problematic.”In addition to Senator Barrasso, the letter was signed by U.S. Sens. Boozman (R-AR), Braun (R-IN), Burr (R-NC), Capito (R-WV), Cassidy (R-LA), Cornyn (R-TX), Crapo (R-ID), Daines (R-MT), Ernst (R-IA), Fischer (R-NE), Grassley (R-IA), Inhofe (R-OK), Lankford (R-OK), Lummis (R-WY), Marshall (R-KS), Paul (R-KY), Portman (R-OH), Risch (R-ID), Rubio (R-FL), Sasse (R-NE), Rick Scott (R-FL), Tim Scott (R-SC), Sullivan (R-AK), Thune (R-SD), and Young (R-IN).The full text of the letter can be found here and below.Dear Secretary Becerra,The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in coordination with other federal agencies, must provide clear and consistent information on a cohesive plan for transitioning beyond the emergency policies put in place over the course of the past two years in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the American people return to normalcy, workers, families, frontline health care providers, and a range of other stakeholders need transparency and certainty regarding the path forward.Furthermore, without comprehensive answers to the myriad of crucial questions surrounding the end of the public health emergency (PHE), Congress will lack the clarity and information needed to inform any productive discussion on potential phase-outs, extensions, terminations, or modifications for temporary flexibility and relief measures. We write to urge the Department and its sub-agencies to supply policymakers with the thorough responses, materials, and proactive engagement that the current situation and its serious implications demand.To this point, the contradictory and often inexplicable actions taken by HHS, along with its sub-agencies and other federal departments, have produced widespread confusion, volatility, and, in some cases, outright chaos. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for instance, announced on April 1, 2022 that it would end the public health authority under Title 42, with officials citing the pandemic’s waning threat. As a result, experts expect millions of illegal immigrants to overwhelm our southern border. Less than two weeks later, however, your department extended its COVID-19 PHE determination, raising profound doubts as to the actual intent behind the termination of the Title 42 order. The CDC also triggered similar questions and concerns when it extended an onerous mask mandate for public transportation on April 13, 2022, days before the mandate was set to expire. The Biden administration continues to fight for the mandate even after a federal judge ruled that it was unlawful and exceeded the authority of CDC.This unpredictable patchwork of mandates and questionable authorities will continue to erode the public’s confidence in government health agencies. For frontline health care providers and patients, the administration’s erratic approach to transitioning beyond a perpetual state of pandemic emergency could prove particularly problematic. The lack of clear guidance and deliberative planning on the path forward make it impossible for these dedicated professionals to understand how the administration will bring the PHE to an orderly conclusion. Moreover, while some emergency policies should undoubtedly end as we work to return to normalcy and conserve taxpayer resources, other provisions advanced under the PHE determination, such as certain flexibilities in care delivery, could help to inform policymaking decisions well beyond the end of the emergency period.To that end, we write requesting information related to the utilization and scope of blanket waivers implemented by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) since the January 31, 2020 PHE declaration. We respectfully ask you provide answers to the following in a thorough and expedient manner.1. Please provide a comprehensive, chronological list of the blanket waivers implemented by CMS for the Medicare, Medicaid, and Children’s Health Insurance (CHIP) programs that were in effect as of June 1, 2022. For each flexibility, please provide:     a. A brief description of the policy;     b. Its associated statutory authority;     c. Whether CMS considers the policy to be contingent upon the existence of a PHE declaration;     d. Effective date of implementation;     e. Per Section 1135(d) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1320b-5(d)), a copy of the original written notice to Congress for each authority      used, if applicable; and     f. The original regulatory citation in rulemakings, transmittals, rulings, guidance, or other relevant agency documents.2. Similarly, please provide a comprehensive, chronological list of blanket waivers implemented by CMS for the Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs during some portion of the PHE that were no longer in effect as of June 1, 2022. For these flexibilities, please provide:     a. A brief description of the policy;     b. Its associated statutory authority;     c. Effective date of implementation and termination;     d. Justification for termination;     e. Per Section 1135(d) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1320b-5(d)), a copy of the original written notice to Congress for each authority      used, if applicable; and     f. Original regulatory citation in rulemakings, transmittals, rulings, guidance, or other relevant agency documents.3. The PHE under Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. § 247d) terminates after 90 days of its most recent renewal or at the discretion of the Secretary. Given this timeline, has CMS developed plans or actions it intends to take to ensure stakeholders, including providers and patients, are aware of the expiration of these flexibilities?     a. If yes, please describe these plans in detail.     b. If not, what is CMS’s justification for why it has not done so?4. Are there concrete steps CMS plans to take to ensure a smooth termination of PHE-related waivers and flexibilities absent Congressional action on extending such policies? If so, please describe in detail.5. For any blanket waivers that, in CMS’s view, are not contingent upon a PHE declaration, how will CMS determine whether to continue, phase out, terminate, or modify the relevant policies after the termination of the PHE declaration?6. Section 1135(f) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1320b-5(f)) requires the Secretary to issue a report within one year of the PHE ending about the approaches it used to implement emergency waivers. Has CMS specified the metrics and methodology it plans to use in evaluating these waivers?     a. Until this report is published, please identify the most substantial waivers set to expire upon the PHE’s termination with regard to:          i. Economic significance;          ii. Anticipated number of patients affected; and          iii. Anticipated number of providers affected.This information will assist us in conducting administrative oversight and ensuring program integrity. Further, it will allow us to gain critical insight as to what is most effective when it comes to easing provider burden, improving beneficiary outcomes, and controlling program costs in a post-PHE world. Above all, providers and patients will stand to benefit from greater predictability and foresight into expected program changes in the coming weeks and months.Once again, thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.###Permalink: https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/barrasso-leads-letter-to-hhs-secretary-becerra-on-transitioning-from-the-covid-19-public-health-emergency"

Barrasso’s remarks.On High Gas Prices Across the Country:“Things have gotten worse since the last time you testified before this Committee.“Inflation is at a 40-year high. It is impacting Americans with higher prices across the board.“When President Biden took office, the price of a gallon of gas was $2.38. Now it is almost $5.“This past Memorial Day was a very expensive for people to travel.“In my home state of Wyoming in rural areas, people who volunteer to drive for ‘Meals on Wheels’ to deliver meals to shut-ins, have had to stop volunteering.“Not because they don’t have the time or the commitment or the open heart, they don’t have the money for the gas.“That is the number one issue affecting the American people.“A few weeks ago, we had the Interior Secretary testifying before the Energy Committee. I asked her if she thought that gas prices were too high.“She did not think it was an easy question. She couldn’t come up with an answer. Of course they are too high. But I ask you, do you think gas prices too high?Secretary Yellen: “Absolutely.”“Thank you. The people of Wyoming, the vast majority of Americans, agree with you on that point. The question is what are we going to do about it.“Well in your Fiscal Year 2023 Budget and Revenue proposals, as part of the proposed tax hikes, you specifically target U.S. energy production with tax hikes.“And on top of your tax hikes, the administration is doing everything it can to end oil and natural gas exploration and production on federal lands.“Just last week, the administration announced a sue-and-settle agreement with environmental extremists, which calls into question millions of acres of oil and natural gas leases in the West, including 2,000 leases in my home state of Wyoming.“Some of these leases are from 2015 all the way up to the end of the last administration.“The president had his op-ed in the Wall Street Journal talked about gas prices and said, ‘we need to take every practical step to make things more affordable…’“But it seems to me these tax hikes and other decisions like this are not going to help and are actually going to make matters worse.“Making it more expensive to produce American energy would simply lead to higher prices for consumers.“And once that energy is produced, it needs to be transported to refineries and eventually gas stations.“Well, pipelines are an important piece of the transportation, but on CNBC last week you specifically suggested pipelines don’t matter.“On one hand both you and the president say gas prices are too high – to which I agree – but on the other you are targeting American energy with taxes, and that is going to result in higher costs for Americans.“Since you agree the prices are too high, can you please explain the inconsistencies with the policies of the Department of Treasury and the administration?”Follow-up:“I would point out that in addition to the leases, you actually need the permission to drill and this administration has blocked all of that.“And this sue-and-settle agreement by the administration last week is taking many of those acres that you just described, and freezing those so they cannot be used.“And with $5 gas, what we see today, is the president calling on using the Defense Production Act, not to go after this, but to build solar panels. And that seems to me the wrong place to be using that act.”On Getting Inflation Wrong:“I would just point out, finally, that yesterday's USA Today, front-page story, picture Madam Secretary of you and the President of the United States, yesterday's USA Today, headline: Small risk of inflation swelled to a global threat. Underneath: White House waved off economist warnings.“And they quote you from ABC March of 2021. Is there a risk of inflation? You responded: ‘I think there's a small risk’- this is with regard to signing the American Rescue Plan - you say ‘And I think it's manageable.’“Given that, it makes me wonder why Americans should put any confidence in your pronouncements and decisions and recommendations today.”###

A federal court recently approved settlement agreements between the Department of the Interior and allied environmental activist groups that will add extensive, bureaucratic review to nearly 4 million acres of oil and natural gas leases across the West (Wyoming, Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, and Utah).“Oil and gas leasing on federal lands is essential to American energy production. President Biden has attacked leasing at every turn while begging for more oil from Iran, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. The Biden administration’s goal is to eliminate oil and gas leasing on federal lands. This means even higher energy prices and greater American dependence on foreign oil. Joe Biden continues to lie to the American people.

Funding despots isn’t in the national interest. Supporting American energy is.”###Permalink: https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/barrasso-buy-american-energy-not-energy-from-tyrants"

Democrats once again declared their support for unlimited, on-demand abortions up until the moment of birth. The Democrats’ radical bill would have even forced Wyoming taxpayers to fund abortions nationwide regardless of their personal beliefs.“Legalizing abortion on demand, for any reason, at any time, is wrong. I will continue to oppose policies that indiscriminately end the lives of unborn children.“We must make sure every child in this nation has an opportunity to succeed.

It has been two months.“The food aid has still not been delivered to Ukraine. In fact, none of the money has even been spent.“And since we have already committed to this two months ago, why hasn’t USAID been able to get the food assistance to the people of Ukraine?”Follow-up:“Another issue facing the quick delivery of critical food to those in need is shipping.“U.S. law requires at least half of the vessels carrying government authorized food aid on U.S. vessels.“I understand there are only four U.S. flagged ships the U.S. Government can use to ship the food aid. Not one of the four ships is available.“It has been estimated it could take an entire year to get the food to Ukraine. In the case of an emergency like this, I know the President may waive the requirement.“Since the Food for Peace program is run by USAID, have you requested a Presidential waiver in order to address this issue?”Click here to watch Sen.

https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ContentRecord_id=642F0342-B758-4414-A579-B35B9451BC26,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators John Barrasso (R-WY) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) introduced bipartisan legislation to expedite the payment of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits to individuals with terminal illnesses by eliminating the five-month waiting period.“The last thing Americans facing end-of-life decisions should be concerned with is navigating Washington red tape,” said Senator Barrasso. “We need to make sure Americans and their loved ones facing significant hardships get help when they need it the most. Our bipartisan bill will ensure people with terminal illnesses receive disability benefits in a timely manner while still preserving the integrity of the system.”“When Americans face terminal illness, they should be able to focus on their health instead of how they’ll pay the bills,” said Senator Brown. “Social Security Disability Insurance is a lifeline for individuals who can’t work because they are too sick. This bill would ensure that terminally ill patients can spend their final months without the added worry of knowing if or when they’ll receive benefits.”In addition to Barrasso and Brown, the bill is cosponsored by Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Chris Coons (D-DE), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and Jack Reed (D-RI).Background:The Expedited Disability Insurance Payments for Terminally Ill Individuals Act expedites the payment of SSDI benefits to individuals who are unlikely to live long enough to receive any benefits under the current five-month waiting period. Under the legislation, eligible individuals begin receiving benefits in the first month. The breakdown of the benefit payments is as follows:How to Qualify for Expedited Payments:The bill eliminates the five-month waiting period for any person deemed terminally ill. Terminally ill is defined as a medical prognosis of six months or less in life expectancy. To prevent fraud and abuse, at least two physicians, who are unrelated and not in the same physician group practice, must certify the individual is terminally ill.Additional Requirements:The bill requires an annual report from the commissioner and the inspector general of the Social Security Administration on the number of people applying for and receiving the expedited SSDI benefits, as well as the costs of administering it. After four years, the bill requires a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluating the changes to the SSDI program and providing recommendations on ways to improve upon it. The bill sunsets these benefit changes after five years on January 1, 2028, giving Congress time to review and potentially reauthorize these changes to the program.###Permalink: https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/barrasso-brown-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-expedite-social-security-benefits-for-terminally-ill"

You have obviously dealt with issues relating to energy and you’ve heard a lot from the members of the Republican side today. That energy – the way Russia uses energy – is a weapon and the impact it has brought to Ukraine.“Senator Rounds asked a question on energy, and you stated that ‘we need to accelerate transition to renewables’ and you said, ‘you can’t weaponize the sun, can’t weaponize the wind.’“But you also can’t run a modern economy on sunshine and whether it’s a windy day or not.“I will say, from the first days in office, the Biden administration has failed prioritize energy security. Which I have always said is part of our national security.“Under your leadership, the State Department is looking to cut deals with dictators in order to access more energy resources.“The State Department is in negotiations to remove sanctions on Iran’s energy sector as part of the Iran nuclear deal.“State Department officials also traveled to Venezuela to meet with Maduro to discuss removing sanctions to access additional crude oil.“You personally called on OPEC + to increase production to ‘stabilize global energy markets, to make sure that there remains an abundant supply of energy around the world.’“The State Department then went to Qatar and other foreign countries to ask them export more liquefied natural gas to Europe.“All of this is happening at the same time the administration you serve on has made it harder to produce American energy. I heard about it again this week back home in Wyoming.“Energy security is critically important. Our adversaries would love to see us more dependent upon them to meet our own energy needs at home in America.“We should not be removing energy sanctions on brutal dictators. It is unacceptable to bankroll the terrorist activities of Iran. It is a mistake to go to Venezuela and ask for more energy.“It is dangerous to rely on Russia for energy resources – oil, gas, coal, and uranium. We need to increase production of American energy resources.“Our nation has plenty of energy to power our nation and to provide our allies and friends with a stable energy supply.“Can you explain why the administration is more focused on buying energy from our enemies than finding ways to increase American energy exports and production here?”Click here to watch Sen. Barrasso’s remarks on relying on dictators for energy.On the Crisis at the Southern Border:“Let me move to the crisis at the southern border. Last month, 220,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended at the US-Mexico border.“In 2021, after President Biden was sworn into office, there were 1.9 million apprehensions. We are currently on pace for over 2 million this year.“President Biden tasked the vice president with addressing the crisis at the southern border. The president is talking about removing Title 42 because apparently COVID is behind us.“Although since you started testifying this morning, there has been news reports that Senator Wyden, Senator Murphy from this committee, and the vice president are all right now with COVID.“During the vice president’s visit to Guatemala last year, Vice President Kamala Harris sent a message to illegal immigrants attempting to enter the United States.“She stated, ‘I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border: Do not come, do not come.’“She went on to say, ‘I believe if you come to our border, you will be turned back.’“Do you agree with the those statements by the vice president that if you come you will be turned back?”Follow up:“That’s not happening. And it’s not going to happen. And that is how you go from more illegal immigrants coming into the country in the first 14 months of President Biden in office than the previous four years of President Trump in the White House.“So now we are at a point where we are facing a crisis that the administration appears to be sending a different message with revoking Title 42.“It’s a critical border control tool. As you mentioned, for public health – to protect the public. What we are going to see is a massive surge.“The head of Homeland Security from this administration said they are not prepared. The head of Homeland Security from President Obama’s term said we are not prepare to handle what’s coming this way.“So, Elizabeth Warren explained on CNN this weekend, she said, ‘the Biden administration is putting plans in place to deal with people who are asking for amnesty and relief at the border.’“Can you please describe the plans the Biden administration is putting in place, that Senator Warren alluded to, to deal with the surge of migrants attempting to enter our country?”Click here to watch Sen.

Barrasso’s remarks.On Strategies to End the Closure of Rural Hospitals:“Senator Warner before talked about rural hospitals and I want to continue on that because as you know, I practiced medicine in Wyoming for over 20 years. We’ve discussed previously ensuring patients in rural America have access health care is a personal priority of mine to make sure people get what they need in rural communities.“Rural hospitals have really been on the frontlines of the pandemic. The facilities provided essential care when their communities needed them the most.“Despite their best efforts, many rural hospitals continue to remain under threat. According to the University of North Carolina, 19 rural hospitals closed in 2020 and 138 have closed since 2010.“The closure of a rural hospital means people have to drive much longer distances to receive essential health care. In a medical emergency when seconds count, driving these long distances, and most certainly in the dead of winter, can have deadly consequences.“And when a rural hospital closes, it really has a significant impact on both the health and the economy of the local community. When a rural hospital closes, it is much harder to attract and maintain businesses, teachers, doctors, all sorts of things that impact a community.“So, I am concerned your budget does not contain a comprehensive strategy for halting rural hospital closures and building a sustainable rural health care delivery system. Can you discuss with me please how the department is going to address this critical issue of rural hospitals?”On Changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP After Public Health Emergency Ends:“The Department of Health and Human Services implemented several emergency waivers for the Medicare and Medicaid programs in response to the COVID-19 situation.“Some of the waivers granted patients more flexibility, enhanced access to telehealth. Others have ensured providers can do their jobs with less red tape and with more financial certainty. All those things are positive.“The world today is very different than when the virus first hit our shores. Cases, deaths, and hospitalizations are right now, much, much closer to pandemic lows. This is why in Wyoming and most of America life has returned to normal.“I think it is why we must plan for the end of the public health emergency. For us here in Congress, that means we need to ensure providers and patients don’t unexpectedly have the rug pulled out from under them after these flexibilities that I think have been helpful in Medicare and Medicaid end.“So, will you commit to providing detailed and specific information to Congress on those emergency flexibilities that you did use in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs as a result of the pandemic?”Follow-up:“Will you provide detailed information on emergency waivers that your department believes Congress should extend or make permanent beyond the public health emergency?“Additionally, has your department specified plans to ensure providers and patients are aware of changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs when the public health emergency ends?”###

Barrasso’s remarks on the admin’s trade agenda.Excerpts from Senator Barrasso’s remarks:“When we last met to discuss President Biden’s trade agenda, I raised some concerns about a number of issues.“It included U.S. Intellectual Property Rights Protections, opening new markets to Wyoming's beef, soda ash and energy, unfair Chinese trade practices, human rights violations, carbon border adjustments, World Trade Organization (WTO) reform, and trade enforcement as well.“After more than a year, the administration failed to address any of these concerns that I have.“Instead of protecting American intellectual property for COVID vaccines, the administration worked vigorously at the WTO to give this intellectual property away. We’ve had that interaction, you and I, in this committee room about that.“Instead of aggressively seeking new markets for American goods, President Biden has allowed our nation to fall behind.“Last year the trade deficit increased to an all-time high. From day one, the president made it clear that he wasn't really interested in negotiating new free trade agreements and unfortunately he's kept his word.“Instead of prioritizing energy production at home so we can lower prices and increase exports to our friends, the president remains focused on shutting down U.S. energy production and exporting a wide array of liberal labor, social, and environmental policies instead.“While America sits on the sidelines, China clearly is winning in this confrontation. This year China signed the largest trade deal in history.“The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the RCP, encompasses one third of global GDP, 15 Indo-Pacific countries, and 53 percent of the world’s exports. China understands the importance of not only market access, but also securing market share.“So, what is the Biden administration’s solution? An Indo-Pacific Economic Framework that fails to provide market access or increase market share for U.S. producers.“It’s a series of pillars or modules that countries in the region may or may not voluntarily join. It’s also not clear to me how the framework will help us counter our adversaries and our competitors, including China.“My home state of Wyoming understands and appreciates that trade has been very important for us historically and presently.“We need to work with our allies to exchange goods and services across resilient, reliable supply chains. We must lower tariff barriers, trade barriers. We must provide relief for families facing skyrocketing prices, supply constraints, and a global pandemic.“Wyoming wants to strengthen our economy and create jobs, and the trade agenda falls way short of that.“Given your wealth of experience in international trade, can you explain how an agenda that exports progressive ideas instead of American made goods and services is going to help our country keep pace with China?”“I want to know how we recover the market share that we have already lost without aggressively pursuing market access for U.S. producers?”###

The Starter-K Act of 2022 creates starter retirement plans that streamline regulations and lower costs for small businesses and start-ups, resulting in more access to easy retirement savings. Employees of participating small businesses are automatically enrolled, meaning easier retirement savings up to $6,000 per year.“Small businesses are the biggest employers in so many communities in Wyoming and around the country. They deserve the opportunity to provide their employees with better options to save more for retirement,” said Senator Barrasso. “Our bipartisan bill ensures that small businesses can access streamlined plans without complex regulations. This will help more hard-working Americans save money and achieve a more secure financial future.”“Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, providing millions of jobs for Americans nationwide. But far too often, businesses cannot afford to provide their workers with retirement plans, leaving many Americans without a sound financial future,” said Senator Carper. “I’m proud to cosponsor this legislation that would make it simpler and more cost effective for small businesses to provide workers with employer-sponsored retirement plans. I look forward to working with Senator Barrasso on this important issue to help more Americans save for retirement and achieve more secure financial futures.”“The nation’s retirement savings gap is almost exclusively found among small businesses, many of which cite administrative concerns and cost as primary reasons they don’t offer currently access to a retirement savings plan at work,” said Brian Graff, CEO of the American Retirement Association. “As they look to meet the challenges of the ‘Great Resignation,’ the ‘Starter K’ provides both a simplified structure and real tax incentives for hundreds of thousands of small businesses to provide for the first time this option to their workforce. We enthusiastically support this legislation, and the opportunity it presents for millions of hard-working Americans.”The Starter-K Act of 2022 creates “starter” defined contribution plans (DC) under Sections 401(k) and 403(b).###Permalink: https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/barrasso-carper-introduce-the-starter-k-act-of-2022-to-provide-retirement-security-to-more-americans"

It spends too much, borrows too much, and taxes too much. All at a time when Americans are struggling to make ends meet under 40-year record high inflation.  “President Biden wants to spend more taxpayer dollars on his green energy schemes instead of increasing American energy production to solve the energy crisis he created. The president’s priorities could not be more out of touch with families in Wyoming and across the country.  “This budget is dead on arrival. Republicans will focus on what Americans care about most: national security, energy security, and economic security. That means tackling inflation, unleashing American energy production, and keeping Americans safe.”###Permalink: https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/barrasso-biden-budget-is-another-pipe-dream-of-climate-extremism"
https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ContentRecord_id=9270DA0E-3B0B-4CDE-B6FA-7D69E9B0A902,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator John Barrasso (R-WY), ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, was joined by Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Roger Marshall (R-KS) and Kevin Cramer (R-ND) in introducing legislation to ban imports of Russian uranium.“The time is now to permanently remove all Russian energy from the American marketplace,” said Senator Barrasso. “We know Vladimir Putin uses this money to help fund his brutal and unprovoked war in Ukraine. While banning imports of Russian oil, gas and coal is an important step, it cannot be the last. Banning Russian uranium imports will further defund Russia’s war machine, help revive American uranium production, and increase our national security.”“It is absolutely imperative that we cut off all Russian imports, including uranium. Every dollar we send to Russia is a dollar used to continue to attack innocent people in Ukraine. Wyoming has more than enough uranium to fill this gap, and we can mine it in a more environmentally friendly and safe way,” said Senator Lummis.“Imports from Russia and its allies, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, account for nearly half of the uranium powering the United States’ nuclear plants. This high level of dependence on foreign uranium was threatening our national interest and national security before Russia invaded Ukraine, now it’s simply unacceptable. This is a country that has repeatedly shown a willingness to weaponize their energy exports for geopolitical advantage, and have used those profits to finance their aggressive and unprovoked war against the sovereign nation of Ukraine. Enough is enough – energy independence means energy independence and that must include uranium,” said Senator Marshall.“Uranium is an important energy source and yet another example of how the U.S. needs to shore up our critical supply chains. Unfortunately, rather than producing and re-establishing our domestic uranium enrichment capacity, we have relegated our leadership and the revenue profits to Russia and its allies. Our bill is an impetus to change by banning the import of uranium from Russia and cutting off another avenue which funds Putin’s unwarranted and unprovoked violent war on Ukraine,” said Senator Cramer.“Our uranium import dependence is a case study in how our vital domestic minerals supply chains have atrophied to levels that result in a dire national security risk,” said Rich Nolan, President and CEO, National Mining Association. “We are home to the world’s largest fleet of nuclear power plants, significant uranium reserves, and yet we import virtually all of the uranium we use – half of which comes from Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Aggressive action must be taken to address this vulnerability and immediately reinvest in American-sourced, essential mined materials produced under world-leading environmental and labor standards. We applaud Senator Barrasso for introducing this important legislation to immediately ban the import of Russian uranium.”“Russia has cultivated American reliance on Russian nuclear fuel for some time, posing a dangerous threat to our energy and national security that has taken on new urgency,” said Scott Melbye, President of the Uranium Producers of America and Executive Vice President of Uranium Energy Corp. “We can no longer tolerate this nuclear fuel dependence or the flow of U.S. dollars for uranium purchases that prop up the Putin regime. The U.S. has ample uranium resources and the capacity to produce them at the highest global standards. The domestic uranium industry stands ready to work with U.S. utilities and other Western uranium suppliers to ensure every single domestic reactor will be able to maintain operations as the U.S. economy increasingly relies on clean nuclear power.”Read the legislation here.Background:On December 1, 2021, during the Opening Plenary of the American Nuclear Society’s Winter Meeting, Barrasso warned against reliance on Russia to fuel advanced nuclear reactors and called for the Department of Energy to take immediate action to ensure a domestic nuclear fuel supply.On March 25, 2021, the Senate Energy Committee held a hearing that highlighted opportunities to strengthen U.S. competitiveness in nuclear energy, including by reinvigorating our domestic nuclear fuel supply chain.On December 21, 2020, Congress passed a government funding bill that included key provisions from Barrasso’s bipartisan bill to extend and expand limits on Russian uranium imports. It also included $75 million in funding for a national uranium reserve.On September 14, 2020, Barrasso released a statement on the Department of Commerce’s preliminary deal to limit Russian uranium imports through 2040. The Department of Commerce previously found the Russian Federation was undercutting the uranium market, which harms America’s uranium producers.On May 20, 2020, Barrasso and Sens. Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Mike Braun (R-IN), Tom Udall (D-NM), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Tom Cotton (R-AR), and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) sent a letter to Department of Commerce Assistant Secretary Jeffrey Kessler calling on the department to extend the Russian Suspension Agreement (RSA), as recommended by the Nuclear Fuel Working Group (NFWG).On July 13, 2019, President Trump established the NFWG following his final decision regarding the Section 232 investigation. The NFWG was tasked with giving recommendations to the president on how to reinvigorate domestic nuclear fuel production. ###Permalink: https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/barrasso-leads-bill-to-ban-russian-uranium-imports"

Barrasso’s comments on designating Russia a state sponsor of terrorism.On Russia Being Involved in the Iran Nuclear Deal:“One thing we visited about last night in the closed session, I want to go to an open session now, and that is Russia’s involvement with the Iranian nuclear deal and the negotiations there. It does seem, as I mentioned, to me that we would be dealing with Russia as somewhat of a partner in coming up with an Iran deal?“At the same time what we see is this brutal, terrorist, murderer Vladimir Putin killing people. I have a lot of problems with that decision regularly.“I see the Russian envoy recently bragged about how much they helped Iran get a much more than they were expecting in this Iranian deal with the United States and the envoy stated, ‘realistically speaking, Iran got more than frankly I expected, others expected.’“So, that’s from us. The United States. The people on this side of the aisle are not for this Iran deal at all, I think it’s a mistake for our nation and our nation’s security.“Reports indicate Russia worked to secure Iran’s rights for nuclear energy and to remove sanctions.“How much money is Iran going to get from these proposed sanctions relief as part of the Biden Administration Iran deal that they are cutting now while Russia is in the middle of attacking Ukraine?”Click here to watch Sen. Barrasso’s comments on the Iran nuclear deal.On Maintaining a Robust NATO Presence in the Black Sea:“In terms of the Black Sea, as we had a chance to look at some maps last night and we think about an overview of the Black Sea, I think about what NATO did very successfully with the Baltic Air Policing mission to safeguard the integrity of the NATO Alliance members a number of years ago in terms of air space.“I’m wondering if that can serve as a model for efforts to maintain a robust NATO presence in the Black Sea? What are your view on NATO establishing a Black Sea maritime patrol mission, a regular rotational maritime presence in the Black Sea?”Click here to watch Sen. Barrasso’s comments on NATO’s presence in the Black Sea.On Protecting American Energy Security:“In terms of energy security, and the decision made by the president today [to ban Russian oil], which I agree with, I think the energy to replace what we got from Russia ought to be coming from the United States.“I think it’s a mistake to go and ask Iran for more energy.“It’s a mistake to go to Venezuela for more energy, which seems to be what this administration is doing: moving from one dictator, thug, to another.“Can I get your thoughts on that?Follow Up:“I appreciate your comments that energy prices were high prior to all of this and that to me is a direct result of the policies of this administration.“As John Kerry, former Secretary of State said, ‘he hoped what was happening in Russia and in Ukraine did not distract from his climate agenda.’“I think that is a very terrible mistake to be the position of the United States.”Click here to watch Sen.

John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, both R-Wyo., released the following statements after voting to support bipartisan postal reform legislation. The Senate passed the Postal Service Reform Act of 2022 on Tuesday by a vote of 79 to 19.“In Wyoming, our rural communities depend on the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to keep our communities running strong,” Senator Barrasso said. “While this reform bill is far from perfect, it gives USPS the resources it needs to keep our post offices open and operating at full speed. Most importantly, this bill requires the Postal Service to maintain its standard of six-day delivery. This is critical for seniors and people all across Wyoming who rely on Saturday delivery for medications and other vital packages.”“People across Wyoming, especially our most rural residents, rely on the postal service for everyday necessities, and I’m confident that this bill will address some of the challenges they have been facing, particularly in terms of reliability and speed of service,” Senator Lummis said. “This package is far from perfect, and unfortunately, Senate Democrat leadership did not allow for amendments to fix the most egregious parts of the bill, but it is not only the best opportunity we have to vote on some of these postal reforms, it is the only opportunity. We have to choose between two options: the current system that requires bailouts, or a system that will give USPS the chance to improve their own fiscal solvency.”Key Provisions Included in H.R. 3076 – Postal Service Reform Act of 2022:6-Day DeliveryThe bill requires the U.S. Postal Service to maintain its standard of delivering at least six days a week. Six-day delivery will provide protections for our seniors, veterans, and patients by ensuring the delivery of prescription medicine and other time-sensitive packages.Elimination of Retiree Healthcare Prefunding MandateThe bill eliminates the onerous pre-funding requirement that has plagued the Postal Service financially. This reform would create savings for the Postal Service over the next ten years.Non-Postal ServicesThe bill allows agreements between USPS and state, local and tribal governments to offer non-postal services such as issuing fishing and hunting licenses.Rural Newspaper SustainabilityThis bill allows rural newspapers to increase the amount of newspaper publications mailed “within-county” to non-subscribers at the same rate as for subscribers.Integrating Parcels and Packages The bill increases efficiency in the Postal Service by requiring an integrated network of delivery for parcels and packages.                                                                                             ###Permalink: https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/barrasso-lummis-vote-to-support-wyoming-s-post-offices"

John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, both R-Wyo., joined U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT), and 33 Republican colleagues, in a letter to President Biden requesting an accounting of how the federal government has allocated trillions in taxpayer funds to combat COVID-19.“Recent news reports indicate the Administration is poised to request an additional $30 billion from Congress for its response to COVID-19,” the senators wrote. “While we have supported historic, bipartisan measures in the United States Senate to provide unprecedented investments in vaccines, therapeutics, and testing, it is not yet clear why additional funding is needed.”“All told, the nearly $6 trillion in spending on COVID-19 is the single greatest expenditure of public funds on one effort in the history of the nation. However, since passage of the American Rescue Plan in February, questions are mounting about where exactly the additional money has gone,” the senators continued.The full text of the letter can be found here and below.Dear Mr. President: Recent news reports indicate the Administration is poised to request an additional $30 billion from Congress for its response to COVID-19. While we have supported historic, bipartisan measures in the United States Senate to provide unprecedented investments in vaccines, therapeutics, and testing, it is not yet clear why additional funding is needed. Since March 2020, the federal government has borrowed trillions of dollars to combat the virus and provide relief to families and businesses. By March 11, 2021, the day you signed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act into law, Congress had already approved over $3.8 trillion in COVD-19 relief. All told, the nearly $6 trillion in spending on COVID-19 is the single greatest expenditure of public funds on one effort in the history of the nation. However, since passage of the American Rescue Plan in February, questions are mounting about where exactly the additional money has gone. A recent investigative report from the Washington Post headlined, “’Immense fraud’ creates immense task for Washington as it tries to tighten scrutiny of $6 trillion in emergency coronavirus spending” details the federal government’s shocking failure to provide the American public with a faithful accounting of how it has spent its money. “Nearly two years later, however, the stimulus data is voluminous yet vexing — for the public and the government alike. The spending portal does not offer a real-time, detailed view as to the way cities, states, schools, hospitals and others actually have deployed broad swaths of the cash they received. In education, for example, federal records show more than $81 billion set aside for school districts in response to the pandemic. Yet the information is 90 days old in some cases and offers no insight as to what those communities actually did once they obtained the grants.” “By 2021, Biden’s top aides intensified the work to improve the oversight process, particularly after the passage of the American Rescue Plan last March. Yet the efforts failed to satisfy lawmakers, federal watchdogs, health professionals and ethics experts, a dozen of whom said in interviews that they have struggled to answer the most basic questions — including how much money has been spent, and how, in critical areas such as testing.” (emphasis added) Before we would consider supporting an additional $30 billion for COVID-19 relief, Congress must receive a full accounting of how the government has already spent the first $6 trillion. In an effort to better understand your reported request for supplemental appropriations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we respectfully ask the Administration to answer the following questions: 1. When does the Administration plan to request an additional $30 billion in COVID-19 relief funding, and if it does so, what would be the purpose of the request? 2. As of March 3, 2022, how much of the funding made available under the American Rescue Plan remains unspent, unobligated, or undisbursed? 3. As of March 3, 2022, how much of the funding under the American Rescue Plan has been obligated, but not disbursed for more than 6 months? 4. How much money has the government spent to date on vaccines and testing? Please provide a specific list of these expenditures and accompanying metrics used to evaluate their effectiveness. 5. Of the $350 billion made available under the American Rescue Plan to state and local governments, how much has been used to date for vaccines and testing? Please provide a specific list of these expenditures and accompanying metrics used to evaluate their effectiveness. 6. Does the Administration have plans to make available real-time data about all COVID-19 spending to the public? We strongly believe Americans should continue to take precautionary measures to protect against the pandemic, and it must be an urgent priority that the trillions of taxpayer dollars already appropriated are being spent effectively.  ###Permalink: https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/barrasso-lummis-join-effort-to-hold-white-house-accountable-for-trillions-in-covid-19-spending"

From inflation, to crime, to the wide-open border, Joe Biden offered little in the way of credible solutions. The president is quick to blame everyone else for the problems his policies have created. Tonight’s speech was no exception.“Families in Wyoming are worse off than they were a year ago. Inflation is at a forty-year high. Gas prices are up more than a dollar a gallon since the president was sworn in. Crime in the cities is breaking records. More than two million people illegally entered our country last year.  “Now we see Putin’s Russia intent on restarting the Cold War after Joe Biden showed weakness in Afghanistan. The price of his weakness was American lives. In Wyoming, we lost our own Rylee McCollum, a U.S. Marine who died protecting others in the deadly and disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.“Time after time, President Biden has shown that he is asleep at the switch. The president missed an opportunity tonight to change course. He should have started by ending his war on American energy – a move that would help Americans dealing with skyrocketing costs, and help our allies escape their dependence on Russian energy.  “Tonight, Americans heard more of the same failed ideas and tired liberal talking points. They deserve better. I’ll continue to stand up for families in Wyoming, and fight against Biden’s radical, dangerous, failed policies.” ###Permalink: https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/barrasso-on-biden-s-state-of-the-union-address-americans-deserve-better"

Barrasso’s remarks.Barrasso’s Energy Security Cooperation with Allied Partners in Europe (ESCAPE) Act, would expedite the export of American liquefied natural gas (LNG) to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries and defense allies.“Today, Senate Democrats blocked an opportunity to stand up to Putin, help our European allies, and strengthen America’s energy security. They said no to a bill that our European allies have asked for to help them escape Russia’s energy trap.“Putin is responsible for the death and destruction in his wake. He must be held accountable. One sledgehammer we can use against Putin is American energy resources. Reducing the amount of Russian energy going to Europe would hurt Russia’s economy. It’s time for Senate Democrats to get on board.“Russia’s actions against Ukraine emphasize how important it is for America to be energy independent. Russia is Europe’s main energy supplier. The European Union receives over 40 percent of its gas imports from Russia. With natural gas prices increasing and oil surpassing $100 a barrel, more of our allies’ money will be lining the pockets of Putin.“America must give our friends and allies an alternative to Vladimir Putin’s energy supply. We are much better off selling energy to our friends than having to buy it from our enemies. The United States – especially Wyoming – has abundant natural gas supplies. We just need to be allowed to produce it.“Our national security is increased by reducing the potential leverage Russia holds over our allies. It is time for Congress to provide our NATO allies and defense treaty partners a better energy option. The Senate can start by passing the ESCAPE Act now.”###

No matter how hard he tries, he will not be able to hide the fact that America is in crisis.It’s not just one crisis, either: a war in Europe, the worst inflation in 40 years, the worst violent crime in 25 years, the highest gas prices in 7 years, the most illegal border crossings ever recorded, and the deadly, disgraceful surrender in Afghanistan. Joe Biden created each one of these crises, and they have led to another crisis: a complete lack of credibility from the bully pulpit.Tuesday's speech will be overshadowed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Hundreds of innocent Ukrainians are dead. Joe Biden probably won’t mention tonight how he failed to impose sanctions on Vladimir Putin’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline just months after taking office, and blocked sanctions again while Vladimir Putin moved troops to the Ukrainian border.Joe Biden will praise his own sanctions of Russia, yet, in reality, they have been too little, too late. He has intentionally avoided sanctioning Vladimir Putin’s energy industry, which is the cash cow funding the invasion and propping up the entire regime.Joe Biden will probably tell the American people that energy prices are going up because of the war in Ukraine. He will also blame coronavirus, China, and big corporations. In other words, he will blame everyone but himself for America’s historic inflation.The truth is that Joe Biden has not just poured fuel on the fire of inflation—he has been a pyromaniac, taking inflation to a 40-year high. Last March he signed the single largest spending bill in American history. He put two trillion dollars on America’s credit card and flooded the country with government cash. Since then, prices have gone up faster than wages.Joe Biden has tried again and again to talk his way out of the problem, and he will try it again tonight. For months he told us inflation would be ""transitory."" In December he said inflation had ""peaked.""He was dead wrong on both of these claims and the American people are reminded of it every time they go to the gas station or the grocery store. It is no wonder Joe Biden’s approval rating on the number one concern of the American people is just 31 percent.Tuesday Joe Biden will likely tell us that we need to give him trillions and trillions more to spend. Yet this is exactly what got us into this inflation crisis in the first place. More spending means more taxes, more debt, and ultimately more inflation. No matter what the President says tonight, the American people are saying, no, thank you.Joe Biden will have to mention the crime wave sweeping Democrat cities. America has recently experienced the most dramatic increase in murder in American history. Last year 16 cities broke records for homicides, all of them run by Democrats. These cities include major urban areas like Atlanta, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia.Democrat politicians have stoked hostility against police officers—a hostility that has led to record-high retirements as well as record-high killings of police officers in 2021.Yet Tuesday Joe Biden won’t talk about the real roots of crime. He will say nothing about left-wing prosecutors and letting criminals go free. He won’t talk about how his party made its motto ""Defund the Police."" He won’t talk about how he nominated radical liberals to high positions of the Justice Department. Instead he is going to push for Congress to attack our Second Amendment rights.He couldn’t be more wrong. Responsible legal gun ownership is fully protected by the Constitution and provides protections for citizens in their own homes.Tuesday Joe Biden will likely avoid talking about the crisis on our Southern Border, which is the worst in American history. Two million illegal immigrants have been apprehended by border patrol since Joe Biden became president. On his watch, immigration enforcement inside our borders has ground to a halt. Immigration agents are averaging fewer than one arrest per month because their hands are tied by Joe Biden’s open borders policies.American families are the ones paying the price for this radical agenda as Mexican drug cartels flood across the border with heroin and fentanyl.Tuesday I will listen carefully to what the President has to say. The American people don’t want to listen to a fairy tale.Joe Biden can brag and bluster all he wants Tuesday, yet the American people know better. They will respond—loudly and clearly—in November.John Barrasso, a Republican, represents Wyoming in the U.S. Senate, and is a medical doctor.###Permalink: https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/barrasso-fox-news-op-ed-biden-s-state-of-the-union-speech-cannot-hide-the-crises-he-created"

The bill provides the critical support Ukraine needs to defend itself and deter Russian aggression today, while imposing real costs on the Kremlin for its ongoing and potential future aggression against Ukraine.NYET also includes a key provision from Barrasso’s ESCAPE Act that expedites the export of American natural gas to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies.“The best way to deter Russia from invading Ukraine is to impose biting sanctions now, not after an invasion,” said Barrasso. “Since the Biden administration refuses to take immediate action, Senate Republicans have stepped up with a bill that will make Putin think twice. It cancels the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, places tough economic sanctions on Russia and expedites American energy exports to our allies. We also make sure Ukraine has the lethal military equipment they need to defend themselves against Russian aggression. Ukraine cannot afford to wait and our bill gives them the help they desperately need now.”The NYET Act:Imposes real costs on Russia:Supports Ukraine before, during, and after a Russian escalation:Counters Russian malign influence and aggression throughout Europe:Text of the NYET Act can be found here.###Permalink: https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/2/barrasso-joins-majority-of-republican-colleagues-in-introducing-russia-sanctions-legislation"

As a result, Americans are hurting as they face sky-high prices for gas, groceries, and energy.Click here to watch Sen. Barrasso's remarks. Excerpts from Senator Barrasso’s remarks:“I come to the floor today to talk about our economy. Right now, inflation is at a record high.“At the same time, what we are seeing that Joe Biden’s approval rating by the people all across this country is at a record low. And there is a connection.“This morning, the Majority Leader came to the floor of the Senate and said the Democrats were going to talk about inflation at their policy lunch today, February 15, 2022.“Thirteen months after Joe Biden took office. Democrats have been in power for almost 13 months. They control the White House, they control the Senate, they control the House of Representatives.“Ten months into this inflation crisis, what they are doing is putting forward gimmicks. Not solutions.“They want to get past the upcoming election. They don’t want to get to long term solutions for our nation.“On Thursday, the world found out that prices in the United States had risen at their fastest pace in 40 years.“And of course, that was the same day that Joe Biden’s approval rating dropped to 40 percent.“The American people are getting squeezed financially. They are feeling the pain and they are furious with President Biden.“Since Joe Biden became President, wages have gone up slower than prices. Prices have gone up faster than wages. People can’t keep up. It’s hard to even stay even.“As a result, the American family today can afford a lot less than they could the day Joe Biden took office.“Over the last year, inflation outpaced wages by over $1,400. That’s over $100 a month differential.“Who gets hurt the worst when your wages fall behind the increase in costs of Joe Biden’s economy?“Well, it’s families who are struggling. It’s young couples, it’s people living on a fixed income. It’s people trying to go to work every day to put bread on the table.“In other words, the people that are hurt the most are the people who can afford it the least. They’re feeling the pain in paying the price every time they go the grocery store and every time they go to the gas pump.“The biggest prices increases have occurred in energy. CNBC reports that one in five American families can't afford to pay the energy bill over the past year.“The same number roughly kept their homes at an uncomfortable and unhealthy temperature because they can't afford the cost of energy to heat it.“Many have had to choose whether they were going to heat or to eat. Gas prices have gone up by over a dollar a gallon since Joe Biden became president.“American energy production still is not to the level that it was before the pandemic. So we’re still producing 1.2 million fewer barrels of oil each day than we were before the pandemic.“Not producing it here. But, by the way, Vladimir Putin is selling five million barrels a day of crude oil in the international markets.“This is a direct result of the anti-American energy policies of Joe Biden and his entire administration and the Democrat Party in this country.“People understand simple supply and demand. When supply goes down, and the demand stays the same or goes up, prices go up as well.“This is also what’s happened with America’s workforce. Democrats created the worst labor shortage in American history.“We’ve broken records for unfilled jobs in five of the last 12 months. So, when did it start?“It started in March of this past year, when Democrats passed their $2 trillion spending bill, which was not paid for, added to the debt, and the bill gave a bonus payment for people to stay home from work.“People were getting paid more to not go to work than they were able to make had they gone to work.“What happened when the bonuses ran out? Joe Biden imposed a national vaccine mandate. Saying, if you don’t get the vaccine, you lose your job.“The vaccine mandate took a sledgehammer to the American workforce.“According to one survey, half of American small businesses, couldn't find enough workers in just this past December.“You drive around Wyoming, you will see help wanted signs all around my home state. What has happened when you have fewer workers, it meant empty shelves and higher prices.“Supply goes down, prices go up. Now the opposite is also true. That's what we've seen with the value of the dollar.“Last March, Democrats flooded the country with government cash. Now the dollar in many people's wallets and pocketbooks doesn't go as far as it did before.“Democrats passed the largest single spending bill in American history. Put $2 trillion on the nation's credit card.“Republicans warned do not do this, it will cause inflation. Democrats didn't listen.“Every single Democrat in this Senate voted for it. Every single Democrat voted for it. Every single Republican voted against it. And Joe Biden signed it.“Since then prices have gone up faster than wages.“First, they said it was going to be temporary and astonishingly in July, Joe Biden said inflation was expected. He kind of bragged that he'd seen it coming all along.“But if he'd seen it coming along, why didn't he do something about it?“All that this president has done is put jet fuel on the fire of inflation.“He told us inflation would be transitory. And he said month after month after month after month.“He can’t say it anymore. Oh, no. Inflation is here and people are paying the price and feeling the pain. Last week's inflation report should be a blaring siren to the Democrats in Washington.“And I'm so happy to hear the majority leader this morning saying finally today at lunch, February 15th, 2022, that the Democrats were going to start talking about inflation out their policy lunch today.“They should all be suffering from significant indigestion. This is a crisis and Democrats are doing nothing about it.“Democrats borrowed trillions of dollars. This year, this week, Democrats in the house are talking about getting rid of the debt ceiling completely.“Spend more, talking about a blank check, unlimited borrowing, trillions and trillions, more in spending.“So only being higher and higher inflation. Inflation will not go away on its own.“Democrats need to stop the reckless spending. They need to stop the nationwide mandates. They need to stop shutting down American energy.“The American people cannot afford any more records like the ones the Joe Biden is setting right now.”###

There’s no relief in sight.

It’s been a year of crisis.From coronavirus to crime, there are serious challenges facing our country. The southern border is wide open, and our enemies around the world see weakness as the administration carelessly pulled out of Afghanistan. Most worrying to Americans, inflation is making it harder and harder to maintain quality of life.Faced with these crises, President Biden has been asleep at the switch. His White House wasted months pushing for a reckless tax-and-spending spree in Congress. Their wish list would have burdened our economy with massive debt and massive tax hikes. When that failed, Democrats started pushing for a federal takeover of elections. This massive power grab rigs the rules for permanent one-party rule – Democrat rule.The American people don’t want this. They want solutions. Recent polling shows the economy continues to be Americans’ number one concern. Democrats in Washington are so out of touch that their number one priority, federalizing elections, doesn’t even register one percentage point as a concern among Americans.Our first job in Congress is to get this 40-year high inflation under control. Last March the Democrats put $2 trillion on the credit card, and ever since we’ve seen prices shoot up. We have to stop the unnecessary, big-government spending. That’s the first step back to the pre-pandemic economy, the best economy of my lifetime.People are also worried about coronavirus cases, which have hit record highs. Despite trillions of dollars in government spending on coronavirus relief, people still can’t get tested, still can’t get treatments, and still don’t have clear public health guidance. It’s an embarrassment.Republicans are demanding accountability for the money that was spent. Congress needs to ensure that funding prioritizes testing and treatments, not giveaways to left wing special interests and teachers’ union bosses.The crisis on the southern border has never been worse. We’re talking two million illegal immigrants over the last twelve months. This is a national security crisis as well as a humanitarian and public health crisis. President Biden flung the border open on his first day in office, stopping all deportations for 100 days and ending the Remain in Mexico policy. He not just stopped building the wall; he started to take down the wall.Many of the president’s actions have been overturned in court, but the administration seems determined to keep the border open. Some of those entering our country illegally are criminals, gang members, and drug smugglers. Fentanyl overdoses have become the top cause of death among adults ages 18-45.This must stop. We have to stand with our Border Patrol, who told me clearly that the way to end this crisis is to finish the wall and enforce our laws, including the Remain in Mexico policy. It’s a simple prescription, if President Biden would take it.Around the world, our enemies need to see strength, not statements. Our men and women in uniform were served poorly by the political decision the White House made to rashly pull out of Afghanistan. We lost more than a dozen service members as a result, including Wyoming’s own Rylee McCollum. The White House needs to start investing in our military and forget their woke agenda. Building back our armed forces is the only thing Russia, China, Iran and North Korea pay attention to.The situation is no better in our inner cities, where crime is out of control. Last year 16 cities broke records for homicides, all of them run by Democrats. That includes major urban areas like Atlanta, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia. Democrats have been calling to ""defund the police,"" and the results are exactly as predicted. Democrats continue to demonize police officers. This stokes a hostility that has led to record-high retirements as well as record-high killings of police officers in the past 12 months. It’s time the White House started backing the blue. Republicans are committed to safe communities, and we’ll have our police officers’ backs, as they have ours.The issues facing our country require immediate action. The American people are asking for solutions. Republicans in Congress are offering them. There are elections this November, and the American people will make their voice heard.John Barrasso represents Wyoming in the United States Senate, and is a medical doctor.###Permalink: https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/1/barrasso-op-ed-biden-s-first-year-was-a-year-marked-by-crises"

Joe Biden came into office and he promised he was going to unite the country.“And he said he was going to put COVID behind us. So what happened? The country is massively divided as a result of President Biden and he's left behind all of the major issues that the American people care about.“Of course, number one is inflation. So what happened? Well on day number one, he killed the Keystone XL pipeline, attacked oil, gas, and coal and made us more dependent on foreign sources of energy.“And as a result, people today are paying a dollar more a gallon for gasoline, than they were the day that Joe Biden became president of the United States.“They then did a so-called COVID relief bill, $2 trillion added to spending, added to the debt, which brought about inflation. We said it was going to happen. They said, it'd be transitory.“They said for eight months in a row was going to be transitory. It's not been transitory.‘We are now at a 40-year high of inflation in the United States. People are paying more for gas, for goods, for groceries, and a result that they've had to change the way they shop, the way they eat, the way they drive.“This has impacted people. And the other part of this so-called COVID relief bill, which was supposed to go for COVID relief for testing and treatments and things like that.“This administration was woefully unprepared, when the Omicron variant arrived. It was a scavenger hunt for testing, long lines, empty shelves.“That's what the administration brought. One of the things that didn't come up in the press conference yesterday, was crime in the cities.“And we have murder rates skyrocketing across the country at the same time that the Democrats continue to call to defund the police.“No one yesterday at the press conference, asked the president about going to the Southern border. With so many executive orders, he just opened the Southern border to the point that two million illegal immigrants have come into this country since he's been president, and we're talking about criminals, drug dealers, the gang members.“They never address the issue that fentanyl is now the number one killer in the United States and people between the ages of 18 and 45-- that should have come up yesterday and another area, which the president has failed.“And then there is Afghanistan, for which the president did not apologize. On one day in August, we had the greatest loss of military lives in combat in the last decade. The president failed to protect our troops and failed to protect the Americans that were left behind after all of the troops left. And the president called it an extraordinary success.“Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff called it a strategic failure. So today our friends don't trust us. Our enemies don't fear us.“And the president's only solution seems to pass another $5 trillion bill, his so-called build back better bill, his reckless tax and spending bill, which I know is going to make inflation worse.“And then of course, he goes after ballots and states and tries to have Washington take over elections. And if you're not for them on those things, you're either a racist or a traitor. Probably both.“We have a president who is weak, who's overwhelmed, and who is ineffective. And I look at this and to me that ends up as Biden's year of failure.”###
