https://www.smith.senate.gov/following-calls-senator-smith-biden-administration-expands-eligibility-head-start-program,"WASHINGTON – Following calls from U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-MN), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) today announced that it is expanding Head Start Program eligibility to help more families in Minnesota and across the country access affordable, high-quality early education services.“For over half a century, Head Start programs in Minnesota and across the country have provided vital early childhood care and education to children from low-income households,” said Senator Smith. “Complex red-tape and outdated requirements have created unnecessary barriers to access. I’m pleased the Biden administration acted so quickly in response to our request to simplify eligibility for this program. This new, simplified eligibility is a great move that will allow more families to benefit from high-quality, affordable early childhood care and education.”“The Department of Health and Human Services’ announcement that they will add SNAP to the categorical eligibility list for Early Head Start and Head Start will allow families much easier access to programs in the state of Minnesota and across the nation,” said Kraig Gratke, Executive Director of the Minnesota Head Start Association. “Programs that we know serve the highest risk population with services that stabilize families and get children ready for school and to be lifelong learners.  When I shared the announcement with programs there was an immediate response of gratitude for those that did the work to make this happen, excitement over streamlining the Head Start enrollment process for families, and one of promise for those families who are now eligible to get into programs. A special thank you to Senator Smith and her team for listening when we shared our thoughts on this and for making it happen.   “This change reinforces the key position programs play in the lives of children and families and will no doubt go a long way in supporting both the compassionate customer service for which Head Start is so well-known and the Head Start staff responsible for processing applications and prioritizing those with the highest need first,” said Yasmina Vinci, Executive Director of the National Head Start Association. Last week, Senator Smith joined a group of her colleagues in calling for this action, which expands eligibility for the program to include families that receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Click here to read the letter. Throughout her time in the Senate, Smith has led efforts to expand access to childcare and early education. Last year, Smith and Sen. Warren led the successful push for $50 billion for childcare in COVID-19 relief, including $40 billion in the American Rescue Plan.  She has also supported a host of bills to expand access to childcare and Head Start including the Child Care Supply Improvement Act, which she authored, that would provide assistance for childcare facilities, support childcare providers in areas related to safety and quality, help providers navigate important health and safety requirements, and support childcare businesses. The bill would also support states and tribes in improving the administration of childcare programs and would help determine how best to use resources in order to support communities in Minnesota and across the country.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senator-tina-smith-colleagues-call-biden-administration-expand-access-head-start,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-MN) joined a group of her colleagues calling on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to expand and streamline eligibility for the Head Start program.  Expanded and simplified access would help ensure that more families in Minnesota and across the country are able to access affordable, high-quality childcare, education and health services and reduce administrative burden for programs.  Along with Senator Smith, the letter was signed by Senators Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), Tim Kaine (D-VA), and Bernie Sanders (I-VT).“We write to ask the Department of Health and Human Services to expand access to affordable, high-quality early childhood education by using your existing authority to ensure that more young children and families are eligible for Head Start programs,” the Senators wrote to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra.  The Senators continued, “For more than 55 years, Head Start programs across the country have provided vital early childhood education to children from low-income households. Additionally, Head Start programs provide wraparound support to parents and entire families, including health, wellness, and nutrition services. However, many families who could benefit from Head Start’s vital services earn slightly above the federal poverty level (FPL) and may be ineligible.” The Senators are urging Secretary Becerra to expand eligibility for the program to include families that receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).“Minnesota Head Start programs support adding WIC and SNAP to the list of things that comprise categorical eligibility for Head Start programs.  The addition of WIC/SNAP will provide programs the flexibility to serve families that are at the highest risk that may have no other avenue to get into programs.  These are single working parents with very young children who have limited resources, not just in terms of finances, but in terms of family and access.  They often don’t qualify for TANF/MFIP due to work history.  These are grandparents caring for their grandchildren full time.  Adding WIC/SNAP will help close some of the gaps in the current eligibility criteria thusly removing barriers for children and families to get into programs,” said Kraig Gratke, Executive Director of the Minnesota Head Start Association. “We are very excited to see Senator Smith working to make this happen, so the families in Minnesota and across the country, can get into Head Start programs that can stabilize families and help them move forward.”“It is clear that the eligibility criteria have become increasingly detached from the needs of children and families across the nation. Adding SNAP and WIC to the categorical eligibility list is a simple and swift action we can take to mitigate the increasing barriers that children and families face,” said National Head Start Association Executive Director, Yasmina Vinci.Throughout her time in the Senate, Smith has led efforts to expand access to childcare and early education. Last year, Smith and Warren led the successful push for $50 billion for childcare in COVID-19 relief, including $40 billion in the American Rescue Plan.  She has also supported a host of bills to expand access to childcare and Head Start including the Child Care Supply Improvement Act, which she authored, that would provide assistance for childcare facilities, support childcare providers in areas related to safety and quality, help providers navigate important health and safety requirements, and support childcare businesses.

For more than 55 years, Head Start programs across the country have provided vital early childhood education to children from low-income households. Additionally, Head Start programs provide wraparound support to parents and entire families, including health, wellness, and nutrition services. However, many families who could benefit from Head Start’s vital services earn slightly above the federal poverty level (FPL) and may be ineligible. Currently, families are eligible for Head Start programs when they meet up to 100 percent of the Department FPL, and 35 percent of slots can be designated for children and families earning up to 130 percent of the FPL. The FPL is equivalent to $27,750 for a family of four. Additionally, Section 645 [42 U.S.C. 9840] of the Head Start Act makes children eligible when their families receive certain public assistance, as defined by the Department. Under current Head Start requirements, this so-called “categorical eligibility” applies to families that receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), but does not include other public assistance programs used by some of our country’s most high-need families.We ask the Department to expand Head Start’s public assistance categorical eligibility to include children in families that participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) programs. Adding SNAP and WIC will also underscore the critical links between nutrition support and early childhood education, and help connect pregnant WIC recipients to Early Head Start services at a critical and vulnerable juncture in their lives. We hope that the Department will make this change so that more high-need families and their young children can more easily access critical Head Start programs across the country. Thank you for your consideration.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/klobuchar-smith-urge-us-department-agriculture-help-minnesota-farmers-respond-avian-flu-outbreak,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Tina Smith (D-MN), both members of the Senate Agriculture Committee, urged the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) helps Minnesota farmers respond to the recent avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak.“We write with concern about the rapid spread of the H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) virus that has been confirmed in 19 commercial turkey flocks and 2 backyard flocks in 11 counties across Minnesota, already killing over a million birds,” the lawmakers wrote to Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack. “As the number one turkey producing state in the country, we are extremely concerned about the potential impact to the poultry industry should this outbreak of HPAI continue to spread.”“In order to contain the virus and minimize economic disruptions to Minnesota farmers and rural communities, we respectfully urge the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to allow for flexibility when farmers receive the devastating news that they have an infected flock,” the senators continued. “Being able to quickly contain infected birds to stop the spread of the virus and responsibly restock barns that are within a control zone are critical steps in helping this important sector of Minnesota’s agricultural economy.”Klobuchar has long worked to provide Minnesota farmers with the resources to weather livestock diseases and economic disruptions. During the 2015 outbreak, Klobuchar led bipartisan efforts to ensure USDA had the resources necessary to fight the outbreak and compensate farmers for lost birds. In 2018, she and Smith successfully pushed to include a provision within the Farm Bill that created an animal disease and disaster response grant program to help fund projects to address risks to animal health, livestock export markets, and industry economic stability.Smith has also led efforts to protect Minnesota farmers from livestock illness, environmental, and financial troubles. After livestock producers were hit hard by drought, Smith worked with Klobuchar to press the Farm Service Agency (FSA) to expand relief and authorize emergency haying and grazing. The two Senators also successfully secured federal relief funds for farmers and livestock producers impacted by the pandemic. Smith has pushed for a host of legislation to protect farmers, including the bipartisan Securing All Livestock Equitably (SALE) Act, which she co-sponsored, to help ensure farmers and livestock dealers get fair, competitive prices.The full text of the letter is available HERE and below:Dear Secretary Vilsack:We write with concern about the rapid spread of the H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) virus that has been confirmed in 19 commercial turkey flocks and 2 backyard flocks in 11 counties across Minnesota, already killing over a million birds.These are the first positive HPAI cases in Minnesota since the 2015 outbreak that killed 9 million birds and resulted in nearly $650 million in economic losses. As the number one turkey producing state in the country, we are extremely concerned about the potential impact to the poultry industry should this outbreak of HPAI continue to spread.In order to contain the virus and minimize economic disruptions to Minnesota farmers and rural communities, we respectfully urge the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to allow for flexibility when farmers receive the devastating news that they have an infected flock. Being able to quickly contain infected birds to stop the spread of the virus and responsibly restock barns that are within a control zone are critical steps in helping this important sector of Minnesota’s agricultural economy.The 2015 outbreak—the largest poultry health disaster in U.S. history—had a catastrophic impact on Minnesota poultry producers and processors, who make up about 6 percent of the state’s agricultural economy. Since that time, the 2018 Farm Bill authorized a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) grant program to fund forward-looking disease prevention activities, laboratory capacity for surveillance and diagnostics, and rapid response capabilities. Those resources, combined with the experience gained from that earlier outbreak, have better prepared and informed the initial on-the-ground efforts since testing confirmed the recent positive cases. The new Minnesota Poultry Testing Laboratory that opened in 2016 has played a critical role in enhancing the ability to quickly diagnose and confirm positive cases in order to prevent the spread of the virus. Yet Minnesota poultry farmers and rural communities are rightfully sensitive to the threat that this HPAI outbreak poses to their businesses and our country’s agricultural economy. That is why we respectfully ask that you take the following actions to assist them during this outbreak.First, we ask that APHIS provide flexibility when farmers with positive tests seek approval to quickly contain infected birds and restock barns with new animals. Second, we ask for continued vigilance and cooperation with state and local partners on testing, surveillance, and prevention activities to ensure that this outbreak does not continue to spread and cause additional economic damage.Lastly, APHIS should be proactive in negotiating with our trading partners to ensure open trade access is maintained for non-infected poultry flocks through regionalization agreements. We greatly appreciate USDA’s rapid response to this emergency and the cooperative working relationship that has been established between federal and state officials. We stand ready to work with you and your staff on these timely actions that will help contain this outbreak and minimize disruptions to Minnesota’s farmers and rural communities.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/senator-tina-smith-over-150-members-congress-call-biden-administration-make-urgent-investments,"WASHINGTON [4.7.22]– Last night, Senator Tina Smith (D-MN) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) led more than 150 members of Congress in urging President Biden to address the on-going childcare crisis and expressed support for federal legislation that lowers the cost of child care for families, expands access to pre-K, and invests in the early childhood workforce and infrastructure.The letter, co-led by Representatives Katherine Clark (D-MA-5), Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR-1), Jamaal Bowman (D-NY-16), Katie Porter (D-CA-45), and Michelle “Mikie” Sherrill (D-NJ-11), called for urgent passage of President Bidens’ plan to reduce child care costs for families down to 7 percent of their annual income, provide universal pre-K to all 3 and 4-year-olds, and invest in the early childhood workforce and its infrastructure. The letter was signed by 122 Members of the House of Representatives and 33 Senators.“Addressing our nation’s child care crisis remains essential to boosting labor force participation among mothers, helping lower everyday expenses for families and child care providers who are facing higher costs due to inflation, and ensuring all children access the benefits of quality child care that support positive physical and brain development,” wrote the lawmakers in their letter to President Biden. “As you know, the high costs of child care and the difficulty of finding quality, affordable child care are challenges facing too many families across the country.”“Now is the time to make additional comprehensive, long-term investments in affordable, high-quality child care to build on the critical but largely short-term investments made through the American Rescue Plan. It is clear that child care and early learning investments are an integral part of our nation’s strategy for supporting a robust economy, lowering costs for families, and ensuring the long-term success of our children. With your leadership and support, we are ready to make these investments a reality.”Throughout her time in the Senate, Smith has led efforts to expand access to childcare. Last year, Smith and Warren led the successful push for $50 billion for childcare in COVID-19 relief, including $40 billion in the American Rescue Plan. She has also supported a host of bills to expand access to childcare including the Child Care Supply Improvement Act, which she authored, that would provide assistance for childcare facilities, support childcare providers in areas related to safety and quality, help providers navigate important health and safety requirements, and support childcare businesses. The bill would also support states and tribes in improving the administration of childcare programs and would help determine how best to use resources in order to support communities in Minnesota and across the country.You can find the full text of the letter here:Dear President Biden:We write to thank you for your commitment to cutting the cost and increasing the supply of high-quality child care for families across the country. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to exacerbate shortages, with parents unable to find child care and businesses struggling to find workers, contributing to supply chain bottlenecks and inflation. Addressing our nation’s child care crisis remains essential to boosting labor force participation among mothers, helping lower everyday expenses for families and child care providers who are facing higher costs due to inflation, and ensuring all children access the benefits of quality child care that support positive physical and brain development. We stand ready to work with you to enact legislation through reconciliation that ensures middle-class and working families do not spend more than 7 percent of their income on child care, expands access to pre-K, and invests in the early childhood workforce and infrastructure.As you know, the high costs of child care and the difficulty of finding quality, affordable child care are challenges facing too many families across the country. The annual price of center-based child care for an infant exceeds the annual cost of in-state tuition at a public four-year university in every region of the country.  In addition to overwhelming costs, approximately 460,000 families are without reliable child care because the child care sector has lost nearly 1 in 9 jobs since the start of the pandemic.  Low industry wages are driving these challenges, with the average child care worker earning a median hourly wage of $12.24, and nearly 25 percent of child care workers requiring another job just to afford basic needs.   Now is the time to make additional comprehensive, long-term investments in affordable, high-quality child care to build on the critical but largely short-term investments made through the American Rescue Plan. Relief funding has served as a critical tool for stabilizing child care programs and preventing widespread permanent program closures during the pandemic. However, a recent survey of early childhood educators found that 75 percent of respondents expect that the end of stabilization grants will have a negative effect on their programs.  Notably, 89 percent of respondents familiar with the House-passed provisions to ensure that working families do not spend more than 7 percent of their income on child care and that child care workers earn a living wage believe those investments will secure the future of their programs, while experts predict that families stand to save thousands of dollars a year. It is clear that child care and early learning investments are an integral part of our nation’s strategy for supporting a robust economy, lowering costs for families, and ensuring the long-term success of our children.  Lowering the cost of child care will allow working families to allocate money to other pressing family needs. Increasing child care industry wages and access to training will help with the recruitment and retention of child care professionals, creating and supporting millions of jobs for women, especially women of color.   Improving access to child care will help working parents rejoin the workforce. One study found that, as of May 2021, the pandemic forced more than 1 in 3 female caregivers to reduce their hours or leave the workforce, which the majority of women said they could not afford to do.  Experts predict that approximately 1 million more workers would be in the labor force today if the labor participation rate of mothers with young children could be raised to match the participation rate of women with school-age children.  With your leadership and support, we are ready to make these investments a reality. Thank you for your attention to this matter and we look forward to working together to enact legislation that supports America’s children, economy, and early learning and child care programs.

Tins Smith (D-MN), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), and Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY-12), led colleagues—including Rep. Peter Welch and Rep. Jan Schakowsky—in introducing a package of legislation targeting business practices pharmaceutical companies use to suppress competition, maintain market monopolies, and keep drug prices high.The legislative reforms follow the Oversight Committee’s three-year investigation into pharmaceutical pricing and business practices that exposed pharmaceutical company practices to suppress competition from lower-priced generics and biosimilars and make drug prices unaffordable for many Americans.  “There is no good reason Americans should be paying more than any country in the world for their prescription drugs.” said Sen. Smith. “This bill would prevent large pharmaceutical companies from using anti-competitive tactics that keep prices high for families struggling to pay for life saving drugs.  I will keep pushing to make sure this commonsense legislation gets across the finish line.”“The House Oversight Committee and I have partnered for years to expose how the American people are being ripped off by drug companies who use taxpayer-funded research to develop lifesaving prescription drugs.  We have seen how these drug companies then turn around and charge exorbitant prices for these drugs when people need them the most, without ever having to disclose what they actually spend on research and development.  Today, Chairwoman Maloney, Senator Smith and I are introducing new bills to finally put an end to these practices,” said Sen. Stabenow.“In 2022, no one should be making the hard choice of paying for needed medications or paying the rent.  Unfortunately, one in four Americans has trouble affording their medications,” said Chairwoman Maloney.  “In my Committee’s investigation, we found that Big Pharma manipulates our health care system to suppress competition and increase profits.  These three bills target Big Pharma’s manipulative practices in order to strengthen competition, promote innovation, and increase transparency into research and development costs—all of which will help make drugs more affordable.”    “Families in Vermont and across the United States struggle to afford their prescriptions as Big Pharma continues to manipulate the market to make more money,” said Rep. Welch.  “These bills all work to curb the pharmaceutical industry’s exploitative pricing and reduce costs for families.  I appreciate the work done by the Oversight Committee and my colleagues, all of whom agree that Big Pharma’s price gouging needs to end.  We will continue to keep the pressure up to make sure that no American goes without the life-saving medication they need because of a price they cannot afford.”“Big Pharma likes to repeat that they invest more in research and development than any other part of the drug manufacturing process.  That is a lie.  We know from the House Oversight and Reform Committee’s years-long investigation that the top 14 drug companies spent $56 billion more on stock buybacks, dividends for investors, and CEO pay than on R&D in the last five years,” said Rep.

Specifically, the investments will help communities across Minnesota expand transit services, modernize their fleets, and conduct necessary repairs. “Public transit infrastructure investments help reduce traffic and make it easier for Minnesotans to get to school, work, and other destinations,” said Klobuchar. “This federal funding will support the expansion of services and modernization of transit infrastructure, making a real difference in communities across our state. Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Minnesotans will be better able to safely and reliably access public transportation.” “Each day, transit systems connect Minnesotans to their jobs, schools, grocery stores and countless other opportunities – all while reducing traffic congestion and reducing pollution,” said Smith. “These investments – from new, modern buses to expanded service – will help connect Minnesota communities large and small.”The historic transit investments provided through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will significantly increase funding for several key grant programs that support:The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which Klobuchar and Smith supported, was enacted in November and makes the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history.

https://www.smith.senate.gov/klobuchar-smith-announce-federal-funding-lower-utility-costs-transition-clean-energy-hennepin,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [04/07/22]—Today, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith (both D-Minn.) announced that Duluth and areas in Hennepin County – including Minneapolis – were selected as part of a new federal program to help local governments create a path towards clean energy.The program will provide direct support from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to develop community-wide action plans that address local air pollution, energy resilience, utility costs and energy burdens, and provide long-term jobs. This new program – the Communities Local Energy Action Program (Communities LEAP) – will also provide technical assistance for communities to secure funding from other federal programs, such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. “Investments in clean energy are a true win-win – strengthening our economy while addressing the growing threat of climate change,” said Klobuchar. “As we work to transition to a clean energy economy, this funding will be critical to helping communities across Minnesota reliably access clean, low-cost energy.”“I always say that when it comes to transitioning to a clean energy economy, we can lead or follow—and I think we should lead,” said Sen. Smith. “Transitioning to a clean energy economy isn’t just essential to reduce air pollution and combat climate change; it’s a huge economic opportunity for local communities in Minnesota and across the country. This new program will help Duluth, Hennepin County and Minneapolis take charge of their clean energy future while lowering energy costs for Minnesotans.” “We are grateful to be in partnership with the Department of Energy and the Local Energy Program,” said Jamez Staples, President & CEO of Renewable Energy Partners. “It is our intent to use the technical assistance to advance workforce equity and resilience for underserved communities in Minneapolis.” More information about the new program and selected communities is available here.  About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/klobuchar-smith-secure-significant-federal-funding-expand-college-access-american-indian-and-alaska,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Tina Smith (D-MN) secured $500,000 in federal funding to expand a program at Saint Paul College focused on providing academic and social support to American Indian and Alaska Native students. Specifically, the funding will help grow the Four Directions Pathway program at Saint Paul College. The program is designed to promote college access and success for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) students through a culturally relevant lens. In 2020, AI/AN communities in Minnesota saw a degree attainment rate of 27.5%, a figure well below the state’s 70% attainment goal. Improving access to education for these communities will help to ensure a skilled workforce in the local economy and bolster the state’s vitality.“All students deserve the chance to pursue higher education, but too often and for too long, Native American students have faced barriers in their transition to college,” said Sen. Klobuchar. “This funding will be critical to improving access to postsecondary education for Native American students and closing the opportunity gap that our tribal communities face.”“This federal funding will help Native students access and excel in higher education while strengthening our local workforce – a win-win,” said Sen. Smith. “I am proud of our work to secure this funding, which will promote college access and success for Native students and help build a strong, diverse workforce in and around St. Paul.” “We are grateful for the support of Senators Klobuchar and Smith. This congressionally-directed funding will make an immediate impact on the Four Directions Pathway initiative which is designed to aid in the success of the American Indian and indigenous communities in Minnesota by developing culturally responsive supports for students and families from high school through college,” said Deidra Peaslee, President of Saint Paul College. “We appreciate our local partners, including the Saint Paul Public Schools (SPPS) Indian Education Program, American Indian Family Center (AIFC), City of Saint Paul Right Track, and MIGIZI. Together, we will work to close the education gap for native students in Minnesota.”Klobuchar and Smith have been actively involved in securing this federal funding for projects benefiting communities across the state through a process called “Congressionally Directed Spending” (CDS). During the CDS process, Klobuchar and Smith have considered project proposals and advocated for funding in close coordination with leaders from across the state.Projects are expected to receive funding over the next several months.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"

These funds will support the communities of the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, and Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa.“This federal funding will have a real impact for Minnesota’s Tribal Nations. From supporting small businesses and entrepreneurs to strengthening public safety infrastructure and increasing energy efficiency, these projects will address key issues impacting our Native communities on a daily basis. I am proud to have worked with Tribal leaders from across the state to secure the resources for these projects, and I look forward to seeing all the good they will do,” said Senator Klobuchar.“Minnesota’s Tribal Nations have so much cultural and economic significance across our state. This funding will have a substantial impact in supporting these communities,” said Senator Smith. “Each of these projects will create tangible changes in Native peoples’ lives ­– whether it’s creating safer communities by investing in Tribal law enforcement, supporting new Native businesses, or ensuring a community center is equipped with the utilities necessary to continue bringing people together.”Fond du Lac Law Enforcement and Emergency Management Building
They will receive $2,742,000 to construct a new law enforcement and emergency management building. This funding will help expand office space, storage and garage space and will add conference space to conduct regional meetings for their cross jurisdictional work.“The Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa is incredibly pleased to learn our congressionally directed project for a Law Enforcement and Emergency Management building in the amount of $2,740,000 is making its way to the President to be signed into law.

https://www.smith.senate.gov/sens-smith-cotton-and-reps-craig-mullin-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-boost-us-pharmaceutical,"WASHINGTON [4.5.22]– Today, Senators Tina Smith (D-MN), Tom Cotton (R-AR), and Representatives Angie Craig (D-MN) and Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) introduced bipartisan legislation to reduce dependence on foreign pharmaceutical manufacturing and boost production in the U.S.    The pandemic has exposed our nation’s dependence on other countries for essential prescription drugs.  Seventy-two percent of key pharmaceutical ingredients come from overseas, threatening the security of the supply chain and leading to shortages of essential prescription drugs. In fact, 29 of the 40 critical drugs for COVID-19 patients were in shortage at the start of the pandemic.  The American Made Pharmaceuticals Act would reduce our dependence on foreign countries for these pharmaceuticals by boosting production here at home. The legislation would create federal incentives to onshore manufacturing of essential medicine, while taking steps to shore up links in the supply chain. “We know that depending on foreign countries for key resources – whether it’s oil or medicine – leaves us vulnerable to global supply chain shocks and shortages,” said Sen. Smith. “This bipartisan legislation would reduce our dependence on foreign pharmaceutical manufacturing and help boost production here at home. I look forward to getting this bill across the finish line so we can relieve prescription drug shortages and build more resilient supply chains.” “The Chinese Communist Party threatened to cut off America’s access to vital drugs during the pandemic.” said Sen. Cotton. “It’s time to bolster onshore manufacturing of pharmaceuticals to ensure Americans never have to rely on China for lifesaving medicine.”“The United States cannot solely rely on overseas manufacturers for our lifesaving drugs and critical medical supplies.” said Rep. Craig. “It’s long past time we invested in our own manufacturing capabilities, which will help to create good-paying jobs and lessen our dependence on foreign competitors. I’m proud to  help introduce this bipartisan legislation with my colleagues and look forward to supporting future efforts to shore up our pharmaceutical supply chain and incentivize domestic manufacturing.”“This is commonsense legislation,” said Rep. Mullin. “There is no reason the United States should continue their reliance on foreign countries when we’re capable of boosting production here at home. This bill will create more opportunities in America for good paying jobs, and it will lessen the chance of drug shortages due to supply chain issues like the ones we have experienced over the past year.”“Coherus is proud to have our manufacturing here with American workers and we aim to continue American manufacturing with our future products, which is why we fully support U.S. Senators Tina Smith and Tom Cotton introducing the American Made Pharmaceuticals Act,” said Denny Lanfear, CEO and President, Coherus BioSciences “The passage of The American Made Pharmaceuticals Act will help create manufacturing jobs and ensure surety of supply in the United States so that we can continue to bring safe, high quality, and lifesaving medicines to millions of Americans.” “Global conflicts expose that we are overly reliant on foreign sources for life-saving drugs and treatments,” said David Sanders, Executive Director, Securing America’s Medicine and Supply (SAMS) “We fully support The American Made Pharmaceuticals Act. Our country needs more U.S. and ally-based capacity, from vaccines and generics to complex biologics and biosimilars. Senators Tina Smith and Tom Cotton are leading their colleagues by recognizing and rewarding pharmaceutical manufacturing here. Medicare, and other government programs, should recognize and reward high quality products made here.” “Amneal applauds Senators Smith and Cotton and Representatives Craig and Mullin on their strong efforts to support pharmaceutical manufacturing here in the United States,” said Chirag Patel, President & Co-CEO of Amneal Pharmaceuticals.  “U.S.-based manufacturing has been a core focus for Amneal, and we support fully Congressional action that encourages domestic manufacturing and re-shoring of production for these critical medicines, which will create security of supply for America’s citizens and the businesses that have invested in the U.S.”  Specifically, The American Made Pharmaceuticals Act would:About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"

While it is important to take short-term measures to shield Americans from the energy burden brought on by Putin’s price hike, it has become painfully clear that true energy independence will never come from more fossil energy production.“We appreciate President Biden’s commitment to fighting inflation and cutting energy costs for American families. Building electrification is one of the most practical actions to lower costs for American families, create jobs, improve air quality, and address the climate crisis. “We urge the Biden Administration to take action to ramp up American manufacturing and adoption of electric appliances like heat pumps and work with the Senate to steer transformative investments in clean energy across the finish line. “We will continue working closely with the Biden Administration to confront the climate crisis and to follow through on the President’s commitment today to achieve true and lasting American energy independence.”About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/sen-smith-senate-colleagues-call-regulators-focus-lending-main-street,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [03/31/22]— U.S. Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) joined her colleagues in a letter to the Federal Reserve Board, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, urging them to work with banks and credit unions to ensure small businesses have access to safe and sound credit as Main Street recovers from COVID-19.“Recent research by the Federal Reserve System found that less than one-third of small businesses that applied for traditional financing in 2021 received all the funding they sought compared to recent years,” wrote the lawmakers. “…Banks are choosing to lend to bigger firms, and smaller businesses are suffering the consequences in an already restrictive environment.”The lawmakers also highlighted racial and gender disparities in small business lending. “About 14% of Black and Asian business owners, and 19% of Hispanic business owners, received all the financing they sought in 2021, compared to 34% of white small business owners. The COVID-19 pandemic has only worsened pre-existing inequalities in our economy for businesses owned by entrepreneurs from historically underserved communities,” they wrote. “A driving force behind the nation’s economy, businesses owned by people of color, women, and veterans need access to financing opportunities by banks and credit unions.”U.S. Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Mark Warner (D-VA), and Brian Schatz (D-HI) also signed the letter.A copy of the letter is available here and below.Dear Chair Pro Tempore Powell, Acting Chair Gruenberg, Chair Harper, and Acting Comptroller Hsu:As small businesses across the U.S. work toward economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, access to financing is vital to continuing the current rate of small business growth. As new business formation continues, we must ensure small businesses are receiving the credit they need.  As such, we write to encourage your agencies to work with banks and credit unions in their communities to offer safe and sound financing access to small businesses.Recent research by the Federal Reserve System found that less than one-third of small businesses that applied for traditional financing in 2021 received all the funding they sought compared to recent years. Additionally, the research also found that more than half of firms were in fair or poor financial condition at the time of the survey, and nearly all firms faced at least one operational or financial challenge in the prior 12 months. The difficulty small businesses are experiencing in getting access to financing is a significant concern for the economy as small businesses comprise 99.9% of U.S. businesses and employ 46.8% of U.S. employees.Many small businesses have not recovered to pre-pandemic levels in terms of revenue and employment, and this is especially true for small businesses owned by people of color. Research by the Federal Reserve Bank found racial differences in financing sought among small business owners. About 14% of Black and Asian business owners, and 19% of Hispanic business owners, received all the financing they sought in 2021, compared to 34% of white small business owners. The COVID-19 pandemic has only worsened pre-existing inequalities in our economy for businesses owned by entrepreneurs from historically underserved communities. A driving force behind the nation’s economy, businesses owned by people of color, women, and veterans need access to financing opportunities by banks and credit unions.Banks are choosing to lend to bigger firms, and smaller businesses are suffering the consequences in an already restrictive environment. The data reported by the Federal Reserve Banks show that underwriting standards for commercial clients are diverging primarily based on business size. In a separate survey conducted by the Fed earlier this year, senior loan officers reported easing standards for large and medium-sized businesses than for smaller ones.The strong deposit growth at banks and credit unions should be used to support increased lending opportunities to small businesses by banks and credit unions in their communities. The latest financial performance data released by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) shows total assets in federally insured credit unions rose by $215.8 billion, or 11.7 percent, to $2.06 trillion over the year ending in the fourth quarter of 2021, and insured shares and deposits grew $166.8 billion, or 11.4 percent, to $1.63 trillion. Likewise, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) total assets on insured commercial banks and savings institutions rose by $1.9 trillion, or 8.5 percent, to $23.7 trillion over the year ending in the fourth quarter of 2021, and insured deposits grew $1.9 trillion, or 10.5 percent, to 19.7 trillion.As new business formation rose to record highs in 2021, there is a clear and important economic need for small business to have access to financing. Numbers released by the U.S. Census Bureau found that 5.4 million new business applications were filed in 2021, exceeding the record set in 2020 of 4.4 million.We urge the banking agencies to work with banks and credit unions to encourage more lending to small businesses in a safe and sound way. We look forward to continuing to work with you to ensure small businesses across the U.S. are receiving access to financing to continue to rebuild their Main Street communities. About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senator-tina-smith-colleagues-urge-biden-administration-extend-student-loan-payment-pause-and,"Washington, D.C. – United States Tina Smith (D-Minn.) joined nearly 100 members of Congress in a letter to President Biden urging the administration to extend the pause on federally held student loan payments until at least the end of the year, and urged the administration to provide meaningful student debt cancellation.“Given the fast-approaching deadline for borrowers to resume payments, your administration must act as quickly as possible to extend the pause and make clear to the American public your intention to cancel a meaningful amount of student debt. We look forward to supporting your administration in getting it done,” wrote the lawmakers. The payment pause has been a significant investment throughout the pandemic, providing essential relief to millions of families during the economic and public health crisis, and saving borrowers an average of $393 per month. Borrowers have greatly benefited from the ongoing payment pause, taking the opportunity to pay down other debt, relieve financial pressures from lost jobs or decreased earnings, and support their families’ needs. Restarting repayment will financially destabilize many borrowers, and will cause hardship for many who cannot afford repayment. Most borrowers are not financially prepared to shoulder another bill as they face rising costs for necessities like food and gas.Black students in particular borrow more to attend college, borrow more often while they are in school, and have a harder time paying their debt off than their white peers. They are more than three times as likely to go into default within four years on their federal loans as white borrowers  – and face wage garnishment, tax refund withholding, and federal benefit offset. Latino borrowers are more likely to struggle in repaying their loans and have some of the lowest post-education earnings among all racial or ethnic groups. For example, even when controlling for educational attainment, Latinos with bachelor’s degrees earn 21% less than their white peers do. When looking at disparities in default, twenty percent of Latino borrowers defaulted on their student loans compared to 13% of white borrowers six years after starting college. On top of that, communities of color have also had higher rates of illness and death from COVID-19 throughout the pandemic.“Canceling student debt is one of the most powerful ways to address racial and economic equity issues. The student loan system mirrors many of the inequalities that plague American society and widens the racial wealth gap,” wrote the lawmakers. “Student debt cancellation must be one of the key actions in your comprehensive approach to advance equity as our nation works to rebuild a stronger and more equitable economy.”You can find the full text of the letter here.

https://www.smith.senate.gov/sen-smith-senate-colleagues-urge-key-federal-agency-address-medical-debt,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) joined her colleagues in a letter to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Director Rohit Chopra highlighting the growing medical debt burden faced by consumers.Specifically, the letter urges the CFPB to address the growing medical debt burden faced by U.S. consumers, and establish an ombudsman position for consumer medical debt. The ombudsman would help resolve consumer complaints and ensure compliance with federal directives, like the ban on surprise medical bills. An ombudsman could also monitor the changes announced last week by Equifax, Experian, and Transunion to ensure that the proposed change to medical debt credit reporting are uniformly and universally implemented. With consumers holding $88 billion in medical debt, the Senators argue we are at a crisis point which requires special attention by the consumer watchdog.“Incurring medical debt can result in a host of adverse long-term effects for consumers like garnished wages or property liens. The effects of medical debt can extend beyond financial issues, creating a negative impact on mental and physical health. Medical debt collections can result in litigation, and in some concerning situations, those unable to pay have been sent to jail, marking the return of debtors’ prisons to our country,” wrote Sen. Smith and her colleagues.They went on, “In order to curtail the considerable adverse effects faced by consumers holding medical debt burdens, we respectfully ask that the CFPB consider using its authority to stem unfair medical debt collection practices and ease the strain felt by consumers, through both additional research and the creation of a medical debt ombudsman position.”Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Jack Reed (D-RI) also signed the letter.A copy of the letter is available here and below.Dear Director Chopra:We write to encourage the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to use its authority to address the growing medical debt burden faced by U.S. consumers, including by creating an ombudsman position for consumer medical debt. Accessing medical care is a necessity that has resulted in too many Americans facing overwhelming bills, harassment from debt collectors, and the long-term effects of negative credit actions.As highlighted in the CFPB’s recent report, Medical Debt Burden in the United States, there is $88 billion in medical debt on consumer credit records, and that staggering number is likely lower than the total amount of medical debt in collections. Medical debt is currently the most common debt collection tradeline on credit records, and that debt burden is not evenly held. Low-income individuals, Black and Hispanic households, veterans, young adults, and older Americans are more likely to have medical debt and struggle to pay it off.  This debt burden exacerbates the racial wealth gap and cyclical poverty and places undue strain on already vulnerable populations.Incurring medical debt can result in a host of adverse long-term effects for consumers like garnished wages or property liens. The effects of medical debt can extend beyond financial issues, creating a negative impact on mental and physical health. Medical debt collections can result in litigation, and in some concerning situations, those unable to pay have been sent to jail, marking the return of debtors’ prisons to our country.During this once-in-a-generation pandemic, we’ve seen business entities take on a larger role in servicing vulnerable populations, often focusing on increasing profit and their bottom line over ensuring the health and wellness of American families. In the past, hospitals and nursing homes were generally non-profit entities or owned by healthcare providers. This recent trend in private equity investing in a larger portion of the healthcare market is troubling given reports that many patients see surprise medical bills after visiting a private-equity owned institution. In many cases, private-equity owned health care providers charge higher rates for the same services, deliver lower quality care – often with less staff, and maintain higher operating margins; we are concerned in the increased presence of private equity in healthcare is contributing to the growing medical debt burden.In order to curtail the considerable adverse effects faced by consumers holding medical debt burdens, we respectfully ask that the CFPB consider using its authority to stem unfair medical debt collection practices and ease the strain felt by consumers, through both additional research and the creation of a medical debt ombudsman position. Additional research is needed to understand the full scope of issues surrounding the medical debt burden in the United States. We suggest further examining medical debt collection practices, particularly the steps taken before bills are sent into collection and the number of Americans jailed for inability to pay medical bills. It would be helpful to know the number of people against whom legal action is taken, including court summons, wage garnishments, liens, etc. The CFPB should also research the size of the debt selling market for medical bills, including information on the number and size of the debt buyers and the health entities most likely to sell medical debt. We also suggest further research into how consumers incur medical debt. We would like to better understand how private-equity owned institutions collect medical debt and report it to credit reporting companies, whether private equity companies have played a role in increasing medical debt accumulation across the board, and how private-equity owned revenue cycle management companies collect medical debt.Finally, we encourage the CFPB to consider creating an ombudsman position for medical debt similar to the ombudsman position created to ensure student loan servicers complied with federal and state laws. This position could help to facilitate consumer complaint resolution and compliance with federal directives, like the recently implemented federal ban on surprise medical bills. An ombudsman can also monitor the changes announced earlier this month by Equifax, Experian, and Transunion, to ensure that the proposed change to medical debt credit reporting are uniformly and universally implemented.We appreciate your prompt attention to this issue and look forward to working with you to protect consumers and patients from harboring this growing medical debt burden.Sincerely, About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"

[03/24/22]—U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) announced $400,000 in federal funding for the East Central Regional Development Commission (ECRDC). These funds were made available by the ‘Revolving Loan Fund’ provided by the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act, which Senator Smith helped pass last year.“The American Rescue Plan Act continues to make significant impacts for small businesses and entrepreneurs across Minnesota,” said Sen. Smith. “The last two years have been incredibly challenging but our economy is recovering. This fund will create 50 new jobs and save 50 existing jobs – ensuring 100 people will continue to be able to support themselves and their families.” Since becoming law, the ARP Act has delivered historic economic relief to families, businesses, schools, and health care providers. The ECRDC supports small businesses and entrepreneurs in East Central Minnesota by initiating projects and programs to find solutions to regional problems and by providing technical assistance and connecting people to available resources. This funding will stimulate much-needed economic recovery as the region is healing from the COVID-19 pandemic.  “Our Commission is eager to establish this new ARPA-funded revolving loan program and get these much-needed dollars out to our region’s small businesses and entrepreneurs to further strengthen and diversify the economy in east-central Minnesota,” said Ben Montzka, Chairman of the East Central Regional Development Commission.

Accurate, thorough education about Native peoples benefits all students, Native and non-Native alike. Unfortunately, the education most students receive regarding Native histories and cultures is woefully inadequate. For example, nearly half of Americans say that what they were taught in schools about Native Americans was inaccurate and in most K-12 classrooms, students are not taught about Native peoples at all post-1900. Furthermore, teachers rate “history of Native American peoples” and “pre-Columbian American history and culture” as two of the worst subjects in terms of coverage and accuracy. These glaring educational deficiencies allow negative stereotypes and misconceptions to take hold and persist.This legislation is endorsed by: National Congress of American Indians, National Indian Education Association, National Indian Child Welfare Association, American Indian Higher Education Consortium, Center for Native American Youth at the Aspen Institute, American Federation of Teachers, National Education Association, National Association of Secondary School Principals, National Association of Elementary School Principals“It is unacceptable that so many Americans are under and misinformed about Native peoples and their history,” said Senator Smith. “Teachers and Native groups around the country have been sounding the alarm and pushing for action on this issue for years, and it’s time we listened. This legislation would help develop accurate and thorough curriculum for our schools so that harmful misconceptions and stereotypes do not persist.” “For far too long, students in the United States have been taught an incomplete and inaccurate education about the experience of Native American peoples,” said Diana Cournoyer, Executive Director of the National Indian Education Association (NIEA). “It is the federal government’s treaty-based trust responsibility to own the relocation, termination, and other discriminatory and genocidal policies, including the Indian Boarding School era which were designed to strip American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children of their indigenous identities, language, and culture. This bill is the first step in the government’s duty to improve the representation of Native American peoples, their histories, and their contributions, as well as the unique relationship between Native Nations and the Federal Government. We look forward to working with Senator Smith’s office to bring this bill into law.”Deficiencies in our education system are a top driver of false narratives about Native peoples. Senator Smith’s legislation, the Native Histories and Cultures Education Act, would help states improve primary and secondary education about Native histories and cultures in North America by:This legislation is inspired by an initiative in Minnesota, led by the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community, which aims to improve how the state’s schools teach Indigenous history.

https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senators-tina-smith-elizabeth-warren-sherrod-brown-press-largest-managers-online-degree-programs,"WASHINGTON, [1.18.22] – United States Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) wrote to the eight largest Online Program Management (OPM) companies — 2U, Academic Partnerships, Pearson, Wiley, Bisk, Kaplan, Grand Canyon, and Zovio — that administer online degree programs for many colleges and universities, raising concerns about their business practices and tuition-sharing arrangements that incentivize aggressive recruitment tactics and may be contributing to rising student debt loads. “We continue to have concerns about the impact of OPM partnerships on rising student debt loads. The responses to our previous letters confirmed that OPMs often have tuition-sharing arrangements with universities, which commit an ongoing percentage of tuition revenue to the OPM to finance the start-up and ongoing costs of operating online degree programs. OPMs often receive 50% or more of students’ tuition. These agreements may create a disincentive to lower costs,” wrote Senator Smith and her colleagues.The Senators first questioned OPM companies business practices in January 2020. Since then, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the need and demand for online education. OPM partnerships are growing quickly and becoming integral to university finances and operations. In January of 2020, OPM companies had nearly 200 partnerships with universities and hundreds of thousands of students. By the end of 2021, experts estimate that colleges and universities had 367 OPM partnerships, and some institutions now rely on OPMs for 40-50% of their total enrollment.The tuition-sharing model also creates incentives for aggressive recruitment tactics. One OPM contract required it to contact prospective students at least 13 times a day, for ten days in a row. This raises questions about the extent to which federal resources are being spent on marketing, recruitment, and profit; and whether OPM arrangements, which are based on guidance issued by the Department of Education in 2011, violate the incentive compensation ban in the Higher Education Act. The Senators asked for a response to their set of detailed questions about the scale and logistics of OPM operations and tuition-sharing agreements, the demographics of students they serve, the types of programs they manage, tuition, the breakdown of their expenditures, and their use of federal aid dollars by no later than January 28, 2022.Text of Letters (PDF)  |  Responses to 2020 Letters (PDF)About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senators-amy-klobuchar-and-tina-smith-announce-funding-address-health-and-safety-hazards-housing,"WASHINGTON, [1.18.22] – Today, U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith (both D-Minnesota) announced new funding for programs that will allow Minneapolis and Hennepin County to eliminate housing-related hazards. Programs in Minneapolis and Hennepin County will receive $2 million each.“In Minnesota, we know how important it is to have a safe, warm place to sleep every night,” said Sen. Klobuchar. “This funding will help address health and safety hazards that are too frequently ignored, putting Minnesota families at risk. I’ll keep working to support these vital programs and ensure hazards are examined and repaired in a timely manner.” “Housing-related hazards, from indoor air quality and radon to fire and falling hazards, are often overlooked while their solutions are often underfunded,” said Sen. Smith. “I have long advocated for solutions to remove and repair health hazards, particularly in Minnesota’s most vulnerable communities. These programs are a tremendous step in the right direction towards addressing these issues for Minnesota families.”“Home is a place of refuge, especially in challenging times like these,” said Marion Greene, Chair of the Hennepin County Board of Commissioners. “This is an exciting opportunity for Hennepin County to grow our work making sure all people are safe in their homes. Moreover, communities of color are disproportionately harmed by home health hazards like mold, radon, and lead paint. This grant will help Hennepin County target households who need this help the most, reducing racial disparities in health and housing. We are glad to have federal partners invest in this work.”“On behalf of the Minneapolis Health Department, we are grateful and excited to receive this award,” said Minneapolis Health Department Commissioner Heidi Ritchie. “The grant will allow us to make critical repairs and improvements in at least 120 homes in neighborhoods that are both disproportionately impacted and traditionally marginalized. Our Lead and Healthy Homes team has recognized that COVID has dramatically increased the amount of time people spend in their homes, meaning it is more important than ever to make homes safe for children and families in our community.”Senator Klobuchar is a vocal advocate for increasing our nation’s affordable housing supply. In March of 2021, she introduced the bipartisan Housing Supply and Affordability Act with Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio). This legislation would create a new grant program that would provide funding to help localities develop and implement comprehensive housing policy plans.Since coming to the Senate, Senator Smith has been a leader on health and safety in housing, and she is the Chair of the Housing, Transportation, and Community Development Subcommittee. Last July, she led a subcommittee hearing on issues surrounding healthy housing.The funding announced today, available through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)’s Healthy Homes Production Grant Program, will enable Minneapolis and Hennepin Counties to address multiple childhood diseases and injuries in the home by focusing on housing-related hazards in a coordinated fashion, rather than addressing a single hazard at a time. These grants are an important tool to ensure underserved communities can mitigate the impacts of unhealthy housing, preserve affordable housing moving forward, and ensure that future generations can reach their full potential.Below are highlights on the funding and plans for each jurisdiction:Minneapolis:Hennepin:About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senators-tina-smith-susan-collins-cory-booker-and-lisa-murkowski-introduce-bipartisan,"WASHINGTON, [1.14.22] – Last night, U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minnesota), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Cory Booker (D-New Jersey), and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) introduced bipartisan legislation to reinforce and expand our public health workforce amidst significant shortages. Their legislation, the Strengthening the Public Health Workforce Act, would help restore the public health workforce at the state, local, and Tribal level to support the COVID-19 response effort. These measures are particularly urgent given the current state of our public health sector; according to CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, there is a nationwide shortage of 80,000 public health professionals.This bill is endorsed by the National Association of County and City Officials (NACCHO), the Minnesota Local Public Health Association, and the Association of Minnesota Counties.“Improving the health of our nation and our economy depends on a robust public health workforce,” said Sen. Smith. “The pandemic has stretched public health departments thin in Minnesota and across the country, leaving us less prepared to address the COVID-19 pandemic and future public health emergencies. This bipartisan legislation would help rebuild our public health capacity, mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and future pandemics, and provide much needed relief to health care workers who have shouldered the burden of understaffing throughout the pandemic.” “Our nation’s public health workers are the true heroes of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the severe shortage of these skilled professionals has taken a toll,” said Sen. Collins. “As we continue to respond to this persistent pandemic, it is imperative that we take steps to alleviate the many burdens on our public health infrastructure and support the development and expansion of this workforce so that we are better prepared for the next crisis. Reauthorizing and strengthening the bipartisan Public Health Workforce Loan Repayment program would help attract more young people to the field, support our state and local health departments, and preserve access to critical activities like testing and contact tracing.”“As we seek to build a more resilient health care infrastructure and continue our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we must address the public health workforce shortage occurring across America,” said Sen. Booker. “Local and state health departments have lost nearly a quarter of their workforce since 2008 and many more public health workers are set to retire in the coming years. To address this shortage, I am proud to introduce this bipartisan bill that would fund an education loan repayment program to attract and retain more of these essential workers, which in turn, will help improve the health and safety of our communities.”“As we continue to see COVID-19 cases surge, a robust public health workforce is as important as ever,” said Sen. Murkowski. “Unfortunately, states across the country are facing real challenges in hiring and retaining healthcare workers—an issue that we must work to address. Ensuring that we have the healthcare workers we need in all areas of Alaska—urban and rural—remains my priority. I’m proud to join Senators Collins and Smith in introducing this legislation to create better incentives for Americans to join the public health workforce. By opening up doors for loan repayment assistance, expanding eligibility requirements, and ensuring greater equity among geographic regions, we can help ensure all Americans have greater access to the care they need and deserve.”“COVID-19 has underscored the critical role public health workers play throughout our state and nation,” said Tarryl Clark, Association of Minnesota Counties Health and Human Services Chair and Stearns County Commissioner. “From assisting with quarantine measures to delivering vaccines and serving as the intake for many of our community questions, public health workers have proven themselves to be an invaluable and dependable resource during the most trying times. The Association of Minnesota Counties thanks Senator Smith for her leadership in introducing legislation that will provide critical support for local health departments and ensure that we can rely on a future public health workforce. ” “As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our public health staff have worked around the clock to ensure the health and wellbeing of our communities,” said Sarah Grosshuesch, Local Public Health Association of Minnesota Chair and Wright County Public Health Director. “Providing loan forgiveness for public health workers will ensure we have a robust public health workforce to provide these critical public health prevention services into the future. The Local Public Health Association of Minnesota is proud to support this legislation and appreciates the leadership of Senator Smith.” “The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the vital role local health departments play in keeping their communities safe and healthy.” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, MBA, CEO, National Association of County and City Health Officials. “But a decade of disinvestment and the multi-year pandemic response has stretched health departments thin. The public health workforce needs attention now – not only to get us through the pandemic, but to address other critical public health challenges in our communities. That is why we are so grateful to Senators Smith, Collins, Booker, and Murkowski for reintroducing this legislation. A federal Public Health Workforce Loan Repayment program would be a vital incentive to help recruit and retain talented professionals to work in local, state, and tribal health departments, and represents an important investment in strengthening health department capacity in the years to come,” Since 2008, local and state health departments have lost nearly a quarter (23 percent) of their workforce, representing over 50,000 jobs across the country.  Public health departments also face a looming retirement crisis, with almost a quarter of health department staff currently eligible for retirement and 55 percent of local public health professionals already over age 45.  It is projected that nearly half of the public health workforce is considering leaving their organization in the next five years.  Furthermore, COVID-19 may exacerbate workforce shortages, as over half of public health workers surveyed reported experiencing poor mental health due to the demands of responding to the pandemic.Recognizing these challenges, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) established the Public Health Workforce Loan Repayment Program to help bolster public health capacity and reduce workforce shortages.  The program provides education loan repayment assistance to eligible individuals in exchange for work in a public health department.  While the Public Health Workforce Loan Repayment Program was authorized from 2010 to 2015, it has never been funded or implemented.  As a result, public health departments have not been able to benefit from this targeted loan repayment incentive, and they continue to face workforce shortages.Senators Smith, Collins, Booker, and Murkowski’s bipartisan Strengthening the Public Health Workforce Act would reauthorize and improve the Public Health Workforce Loan Repayment Program to help expand the public health workforce at the state, local, and Tribal level and support the COVID-19 response effort.  Specifically, the Strengthening the Public Health Workforce Act: About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senators-tina-smith-john-kennedy-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-boost-rural-small-businesses,"WASHINGTON, [1.13.22] – Today, U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and John Kennedy (R-La.) introduced bipartisan legislation that would help grow rural small businesses and their local economies.“Access to capital is essential to the economic health and growth of rural communities in Minnesota and across the country,” said Sen. Smith. “Rural small businesses often face disproportionate obstacles when trying to secure capital to develop and grow their businesses. This legislation would help rural small businesses overcome these hurdles and strengthen our rural economies.” “Louisiana’s small business owners create jobs and strengthen rural economies,” said Sen. Kennedy. “This bill takes a key step in overcoming the hurdles small businesses face in getting the capital they need to pay their bills, make payroll and meet needs in their communities.” Access to capital is critical for starting and expanding rural small businesses, which often face a disproportionate number of obstacles when seeking capital investment. This bipartisan legislation, the Expanding Access to Capital for Rural Job Creators Act, would require a key federal agency to submit annual reports on the unique challenges small businesses in rural areas face when trying to secure capital. The report would outline roadblocks and identify solutions to ensure rural small businesses, and the local economies they support, are able to develop and grow.Text of the Expanding Access to Capital for Rural Job Creators Act is available here.

[01/07/22]—Today, U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) led a letter urging the Biden Administration to ensure easy access to rapid COVID-19 tests for Americans across the country.In a letter Friday, the Senators pressed the Biden Administration to take needed steps to streamline access to at-home testing. The letter comes after the Biden Administration announced additional actions to combat COVID-19, including through rapid COVID-19 tests.“As you work to draft guidance to allow Americans with private health insurance to be reimbursed for rapid, at-home COVID-19 tests, we urge you to take steps to make this process as seamless as possible for individual patients,” the Senators wrote. “Rapid tests are a critical tool in slowing the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. As the nation continues to battle the spread of the Delta variant and confronts the spread of the more infectious Omicron variant, easy access to free rapid COVID-19 tests will be even more important.”  The letter was also signed by Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). You can read the Senators’ letter here or below:Dear Secretary Becerra:Thank you for your continued leadership to combat the spread of the Omicron variant and a new winter strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.[1]  We appreciate your continued work to improve the federal response to COVID-19 and your plan’s prioritization of expanded access to free at-home COVID-19 testing.  As you work to draft guidance to allow Americans with private health insurance to be reimbursed for rapid, at-home COVID-19 tests, we urge you to take steps to make this process as seamless as possible for individual patients.   Rapid tests are a critical tool in slowing the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.  These tests can help people learn if they have COVID-19, and are critical to informing when they should stay home to protect themselves and others.  Furthermore, rapid tests can identify 98 percent of cases in which a person is still infectious with COVID-19.  As the nation continues to battle the spread of the Delta variant and confronts the spread of the more infectious Omicron variant, easy access to free rapid COVID-19 tests will be even more important.  We appreciate that the Administration recognizes the importance of making tests more accessible, including the recent announcement that the federal government will purchase 500 million rapid COVID-19 tests and distribute them for free to Americans who order them online.  We look forward to receiving additional information about this initiative in a forthcoming briefing with the White House COVID-19 Response Team.In addition, we appreciate that the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury will issue sub-regulatory guidance to allow individuals who purchase over-the-counter (OTC) rapid COVID-19 tests to seek reimbursement from their private health insurance plans.  Finally, we applaud the Administration’s announcement that the federal government will provide 50 million rapid COVID-19 tests to people without health insurance through community health centers, rural health clinics, and other community sites.  These points of access will be critical for individuals who do not have access to reliable, high-speed internet.    As you move to draft new regulations and implement policies to expand access to rapid COVID-19 tests, we seek answers to the following questions.  We ask for your responses by January 13, 2022.  Thank you again for your work to expand access to rapid COVID-19 tests and to lead us out of the COVID-19 pandemic.  We look forward to reviewing your responses to our questions.

https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senators-tina-smith-and-mike-crapo-announce-big-win-dairy-farmers-after-leading-bipartisan-push,"WASHINGTON, [1.6.22] – Today, U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minnesota) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) announced a major victory for U.S. dairy farmers after spearheading Congressional efforts to hold Canada accountable for violations of a key trade agreement.   “For nearly two years, Senator Crapo and I have been leading the charge to crack down on Canada’s illegal trade practices that are hurting U.S. dairy farmers,” said Sen. Smith. “This is a historic win for dairies in Minnesota and across the country, who will finally be able to sell U.S. products to Canadian buyers without unjustified restrictions.”“Enforcing our trade agreements to open our dairy markets will feed our neighbors and create jobs at home,” said Sen. Crapo.  “This is a huge victory in tearing down further barriers for Idaho’s and the nation’s dairies.  This decision will further unlock the promises of the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement and meet the needs of our 21st Century producers.”In August 2020, Sens. Smith and Crapo led a bipartisan letter with 25 Senators identifying dairy-related provisions that were not being upheld in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). In their letter, the Senators asked the U.S. government to use USMCA’s enforcement measures to ensure full compliance from Canada and Mexico with the trade deal.Now, a USMCA panel has ruled in favor of the U.S., agreeing that Canada is breaching its commitments. Specifically, the panel ruled that Canada is reserving most of the in-quota quantity in its dairy tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) for the exclusive use of Canadian processors, a breach of the USMCA that Senators Smith and Crapo raised in their letter. This historic win is an important step to eliminating unjustified trade restrictions on American dairy products, and will ensure that the U.S. dairy industry and its workers get the full benefit of the USMCA to market and sell U.S. products to Canadian consumers.

Smith’s remarks as prepared for delivery below:Floor Speech: On the Anniversary of January 6th AttackJanuary 6, 2022M.  President –I rise today with my colleagues to commemorate the first anniversary January 6 – the attack on our Capitol and the attempted coup to overturn our democracy.I’ve thought a lot about this day over the past year.  I speak today because I think it’s important that we are clear about what happened on January 6, how it connects to what has happened since, and what needs to happen next.(Let us be clear.)  On January 6 there was a violent attack on the United States Capitol, led by insurrectionists whose explicit goal was to overthrow the free and fair election of President Biden.  The attack happened because former President Trump and his allies encouraged his supporters to come to Washington.  He told them falsely that the election had been stolen.  He incited them to violence, and then he sat and watched while the Capitol was attacked.  These are the facts – there was no attempt to hide it.  It was plain as that wintery January day.I am sure all of us in this room have vivid memories of what happened on that day: moments of crisis leave a deep imprint.  And for us this violence happened in our workplace while we were here doing our jobs.  The Capitol on January 6 was full of members of Congress, national political leaders of both parties, and a Vice President that the former President had exhorted his angry mob to hunt down.It was also full of journalists, custodians, and cafeteria workers.  In this Chamber were our colleagues the clerks, floor staff, parliamentarians, and stenographers who work here hour after hour, making this place work.  Public servants – thrown into violent chaos and danger by the former President.And law enforcement.  Let’s remember that January 6 was the one of the worst days for injuries to law enforcement since 9/11, as a violent mob bludgeoned, crushed, wounded and killed.That’s what happened.  And no amount of whitewashing will change it.It also happened, when we all came back into this Chamber to finish our jobs and certify the people’s votes, that some Republicans, spoke the truth about the terrible tragedy of the day.  Senator McConnell said, quote, “the mob was fed lies.  They were provoked by the President and other powerful people.” Lindsey Graham (point to his seat) declared, in reference to the disgraced former President, quote, “count me out.  Enough is enough.” For a moment, it seemed like we would unify in condemning the political violence incited by a president who had betrayed our fundamental constitutional principles.  But later that night Senator Cruz, Senator Hawley, and six other Senators voted to overturn our free and fair election result, continuing down this reckless path.Within days, Republican party leaders and right wing media outlets began turning away from the facts of January 6.  Former President Trump was impeached for his seditious actions, but his hold on the Republican party is so strong that only seven Republican Senators voted to convict.  Republicans continue to promote the big lie that Trump won the election.  They claim that the people who stormed the Capitol with zip ties and bludgeons were tourists.  They’ve attempted to portray these violent insurgents as martyrs rather than domestic terrorists.  This is why, today, 58% percent of Republicans believe falsely that the election was stolen from President Trump.The insurrection and coup attempt on January 6th, 2021 was unsuccessful.  But the fight continues in state legislatures across the country, and they are prevailing.  According to the Brennan Center, in 2021, 19 states passed laws restricting Americans voting rights and giving partisan officials – Republicans – unprecedented control over the certification of election results.  Their plan is right out there in plain view.  Step one is to make it harder for some people to vote.  Step two is to give partisans at the local level the power to ignore and overturn the people’s votes.  This is a coordinated strategy connected directly to the events of January 6 and it is the path to overturning our democracy, if we allow it.We can’t allow it.  Through the January 6 Commission, and through the Department of Justice, we need to hold accountable those responsible for these crimes – including those at the top.And we need to pass the Freedom to Vote Act, which provides for basic standards for free and fair elections, and fulfills the fundamental promise of our nation – that in our democratic republic, the people decide.  Not a single Republican Senator is willing to join us Democrats, which is a tragedy.  Colleagues, I implore you – we can’t let Republicans hide behind Senate rules and block us from taking this common sense step to protect our democracy.  In a democracy, a majority of the people decide.  That’s how it works in township meetings, in City Halls and County Board meetings, and in state legislatures, and that’s how it should work in the United States Senate.  We Senators have the power to protect our democracy, we have no excuse not to use it.On January 6, I woke up early, and wrote down a few thoughts before I headed to the Capitol.  I had been sworn into office – the third time in three years – just a few days before.  My husband Archie had been with me for the swearing in, and he’d headed home to Minnesota with the anxious question, “Are you going to be okay?”  For sure, I told him – the United States Capitol is one of the safest places in the country.Here’s what I wrote:  “Today is a remarkable day.  This morning I’m filled with optimism.  Georgians turned out in record numbers to elect Reverend Warnock, pastor of Dr.  King’s home church.  And it looks very likely that Jon Ossoff will be victorious, giving Democrats a majority in the Senate.  For me, this means the work that Minnesotans sent me to Washington to do can actually get done.  We will get through this day.  I truly believe our democracy is resilient and can withstand this desperate coup attempt.  But it’s a reminder of how hard we have to fight for our core principles, that no one is above the law and that in a democracy the people decide.”Little did I know.  But my optimism still holds, and my faith that we can be worthy of the promise laid out in our constitution, “We the people of the United States, in order to secure a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity.”Thank you.  I yield the floor.  About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senator-tina-smith-leads-senate-hearing-expanding-economic-development-underserved-communities,"WASHINGTON, [1.5.22] – Today, U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minnesota) chaired a productive hearing focused on addressing the economic challenges and disparities in underserved communities. The hearing covered two bipartisan bills authored by Sen. Smith, which would expand financial services and capital investment in communities of color, Tribal lands, and rural communities. Senators heard from a number of witnesses who shared how Sen. Smith’s legislation would make a difference for community development. Witnesses included: “Unequal access to capital and financial services is a key driver of economic disparity in rural areas, communities of color, and Indigenous communities,” said Sen. Smith. “Today’s hearing has moved us one step closer to passing my bipartisan legislation, which will help  address these inequities and jumpstart economic development in Minnesota and around the country.”“We support the Bond Guarantee Program Improvement Act, that was introduced yesterday thanks to Senators Smith and Rounds,” said John Holdsclaw, President of the Coalition of Community Development Financial Institutions “The permanent extension and other improvements contained in that legislation have the potential to further revitalization in distressed communities.”The Subcommittee hearing on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development covered two of Senator Smith’s bills, both of which are co-sponsored by Mike Rounds (R-South Dakota). Both would strengthen and expand Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), which play a critical role in bringing capital and financial services to a wide range of underserved communities – from urban areas to small towns and rural communities to Tribal lands.The first bill, the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program Improvement Act, will expand and make permanent a successful program that allows CDFIs to access long-term, stable funding. You can find more about the legislation here. The second bill, the Native American Rural Homeownership Improvement Act, would help Native families living in rural areas achieve home ownership by expanding a program that supports access to mortgages for Native Americans. You can find more about the legislation here. Read Senator Smith’s full opening statement below:HTCD Subcommittee: Exploring How Community Development Financial Institutions Support Underserved CommunitiesGood morning. I call the Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development to order. Today we’re going to take a look at Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs). Our hearing will explore how the federal government can help support their innovative work, and how we can work together to address some of the challenges faced by underserved communities when it comes to accessing capital and the financial system. The COVID-19 pandemic has not been the great equalizer. It has laid bare the disparities in our society. And too often, it is Black, Brown, and Indigenous families who have faced the most significant burdens. But, the economic disparities didn’t start during the pandemic. According to the Federal Reserve, as of 2019, a typical Black family’s net worth was just 15% of a typical white family’s worth. A typical Hispanic family’s net worth was about 19% of a white family’s. And the typical net worth for Native American families is also just a fraction of that of a typical white family. While there are many causes of this great inequity, one factor is a lack of access to capital and to financial services – for people of color, Indigenous communities, and in small towns and rural places. When the CDFI Fund – the federal agency that oversees CDFI programs – was established in 1994, there were about 80 CDFIs. Today, there are more than 1,000 CDFIs, many with innovative models that weren’t even imagined when the CDFI Fund was first established. And they’ve played a critical role in bringing capital and financial services to a wide range of underserved communities – from urban areas to small towns and rural places to Tribal lands. For instance, in Minnesota: With their successful track record of reaching underserved communities, Congress has looked to CDFIs as effective community development organizations to implement programs. Let me share a few examples. In 2000, Congress enacted the New Markets Tax Credit, which provides tax incentives to allow CDFIs to work on economic development projects in economically distressed areas. That program has proven successful, and I’m glad to be a supporter of bipartisan legislation from Sen. Cardin and Sen. Blunt to update and expand that tax credit. During the Great Recession, Sen. Menendez authored legislation to establish the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program. The Bond Guarantee Program provides a stable, long-term source of capital for CDFIs, without any subsidy from taxpayers. Earlier this week, Sen. Rounds and I introduced legislation to make that program permanent and adjust some of its loan requirements to make it more accessible to smaller CDFIs who might want to participate. I’m looking forward to hearing from our witnesses about how our legislation will make a difference for community development. In 2020, Congress set aside $25 billion of PPP lending for CDFIs to distribute because CDFIs had relationships in many communities that banks and credit unions weren’t able to reach. CDFIs made more than 100,000 PPP loans in the first months of that program, and that effort was critical in helping thousands of small businesses stay afloat. In addition, in the bipartisan, year-end funding package we enacted at the end of 2020, Congress made a historic investment in CDFIs and minority depository institutions, providing rapid relief grants. As a result of that program, 27 Minnesota CDFIs received grants totally $38 million – funds that will be invested in our state to support new lending and services. Sen. Warner played an important role in getting this investment enacted, and I know many of us supported his work on it. I’m looking forward to hearing from our witnesses about how that funding is making a difference in their communities. Before I turn to Sen. Rounds, I’d like to thank him for being such a good partner in planning this hearing. I know we have a shared interest in building strong communities, and especially in supporting economic development and access to capital for the Indigenous communities in our states that are often uniquely challenged. As I mentioned before, yesterday, we joined together to introduce legislation to update the CDFI Bond Guarantee program to make it more reliable and to help smaller CDFIs access this long-term, stable source of funding that operates without a taxpayer subsidy. And we also have legislation together to support access to mortgages for Native Americans in a partnership between CDFIs and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  I’m hopeful that today’s hearing will help us identify additional areas where we can work together and pave a path to advancing these important bills to bring much-needed capital to parts of our country that need it. #About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senators-tina-smith-and-mike-rounds-introduce-bipartisan-bill-spur-economic-development,"WASHINGTON, [1.4.22] – Today, U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minnesota) and Mike Rounds (R-South Dakota) introduced legislation to jumpstart economic development in economically distressed areas and address disparities in access to capital for underserved communities. The bill would strengthen and expand Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI), which play a critical role in bringing capital and financial services to a wide range of underserved communities – from urban areas to small towns and rural communities to Tribal lands.“Unequal access to capital and financial services is a key driver of economic disparity in rural areas, communities of color, and Indigenous communities,” said Sen. Smith. “This legislation will jumpstart economic development in these communities by expanding and enhancing a program with a track record of effective capital investment and community development.”“Our bipartisan legislation creates greater opportunity for development in South Dakota, particularly in tribal communities,” said Rounds. “This bill will make much-needed changes to the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program and will directly address issues we’ve heard in our discussions with stakeholders in South Dakota.”Their legislation—called the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program Improvement Act, named for Community Development Financial Institutions–will make the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program permanent, while making it more reliable and accessible to smaller CDFIs. This legislation will expand and improve a successful program that operates without a taxpayer subsidy and allows CDFIs to access long-term, stable funding.The CDFI Bond Guarantee Program was enacted in 2010 to provide long-term, low-cost capital to CDFIs, which use the funding for economic development activities in underserved communities.  The program’s authorization lapsed in 2014, but it has been extended on a year-by-year basis in annual appropriations bills.  Under current program rules, borrowers must have a loan size of at least $100 million – which means that the program can only be used for relatively large projects.  The CDFI Bond Guarantee Program Improvement Act will permanently authorize the program, to provide certainty to borrowers and lenders. It will also reduce the minimum loan size to $25 million, to allow smaller CDFI to utilize the program and to support more community development projects.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senator-tina-smith-and-us-representative-angie-craig-announce-plan-strengthen-meat-and-poultry,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [1.4.22] – Today, U.S. Senator Tina Smith and Representative Angie Craig (both D-Minn.) announced new plans to create a more competitive, fair, and resilient meat and poultry sector. These initiatives will help secure better earnings for producers while ensuring more choices and affordable prices for consumers. The funding for this plan is available through the American Rescue Plan, which Senator Smith and Rep. Craig helped pass earlier this year. “Just a handful of large companies have come to dominate the meat and poultry processing industry, which means higher prices for consumers and shrinking earnings for producers,” said Sen. Smith, a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry. “Throughout my time in the Senate, I have advocated for solutions to support Minnesota farmers facing fewer processing options and Minnesota families stuck paying higher prices due to this lack of competition. I applaud these new programs, which will make the meat and poultry industry more fair, dynamic and competitive.”“For far too long, a handful of major meat processors have dominated the market, controlling prices and limiting options for American consumers while reducing profits for family farmers and producers,” said Representative Angie Craig. “Alongside members of both parties, I have long urged the Biden Administration to take immediate action to bolster competition and build greater resiliency in the American food supply chain. I am grateful that the White House is taking immediate steps to support small and regional processors in Minnesota and across the country – which will support farmers and ranchers, help to lower costs for hardworking American families and foster economic growth in rural America.”The Department of Agriculture (USDA) will dedicate $1 billion in American Rescue Plan funds to expand independent meat and poultry processing capacity. This new processing capacity will help address issues stemming from a hyper-concentrated market.  Four large meat-packing companies control 85 percent of the beef market. In poultry, the top four processing firms control 54 percent of the market. And in pork, the top four processing firms control about 70 percent of the market. The meatpackers and processors buy from farmers and sell to retailers like grocery stores, making them a key bottleneck in the food supply chain.When dominant middlemen control so much of the supply chain, they can increase their own profits at the expense of both farmers—who make less—and consumers—who pay more. Most farmers now have little or no choice of buyer for their product and little leverage to negotiate, causing their share of every dollar spent on food to decline. And, when too few companies control such a large portion of the market, our food supply chains are susceptible to shocks. When COVID-19 or other disasters such as fires or cyberattacks shutter a plant, many ranchers have no other place to take their animals. Our overreliance on just a handful of giant processors leaves us all vulnerable, with any disruptions at these bottlenecks rippling throughout our food system.More information about the programs can be found here.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senators-smith-and-cassidys-bipartisan-amendment-address-global-covid-19-vaccine-access-signed,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [01/03/22]— U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.)’s bipartisan amendment to improve global vaccine access was signed into law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act last week. The bipartisan amendment will analyze the United States government’s capabilities to retrieve soon to expire COVID-19 vaccine doses and send them to countries abroad. These efforts will help to address supply chain barriers to efficient global vaccine distribution and provide another opportunity for the United States to be a leader in building global capacity to distribute COVID-19 vaccines.The amendment is also co-sponsored in the Senate by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).“Expanding worldwide access to COVID-19 vaccines is central to ending the pandemic,” said Sen. Smith. “This amendment will take important steps towards slowing the spread of this virus, allowing the United States to improve COVID-19 vaccine access for low- and middle-income countries, and leading the world out of the COVID-19 pandemic.”“Increasing global access to the COVID vaccine is vital to U.S. economic and national security,” said Dr. Cassidy. “Our amendment ensures the United States is at the forefront of global vaccine distribution and supply.” The bipartisan amendment would:Ensuring global access to COVID-19 vaccine doses will stop the spread of COVID and its variants, helping to restore global economic output.You can read the full text of the amendment here.

https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senator-tina-smith-named-chair-rural-development-and-energy-panel-senate-agriculture-committee,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [3/15/21]—Today, U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) announced that she has been named Chair of the Rural Development and Energy Subcommittee, which is tasked with overseeing many U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development programs, including the Rural Housing Service, and programs relating to facilities, utilities, loans, and renewable energy. In addition to her role as Chair, Sen. Smith will also serve on the Livestock, Dairy, Poultry, Local Food Systems, and Food Safety and Security Subcommittee, and the Commodities, Risk Management, and Trade Subcommittee, as part of her role on the Senate Agriculture Committee.“By traveling to rural and Tribal areas across Minnesota, I know that in order for these communities to create jobs and strengthen rural communities, we need to support infrastructure,” said Sen. Smith. “As Chair of the Rural Development and Energy Subcommittee, I will keep working to strengthen clean energy and clean energy jobs, access to affordable electricity and water systems, and advocate for funding that supports rural businesses and rural affordable housing, boosts local development, and promotes trade that benefits rural areas. I’m also looking forward to the work my colleagues and I will do on the Livestock, Dairy, Poultry, Local Food Systems, and Food and Safety Subcommittee, and the Commodities, Risk Management, and Trade Subcommittee, so that we can support farmers and producers nationwide.”When she first joined the Senate in 2018, Sen. Smith fought for and secured a spot on the Senate Agriculture Committee because ag is the backbone of Minnesota’s economy. All Minnesotans are impacted by the Farm Bill, and Sen. Smith heard from Minnesotans with backgrounds in farming, rural development, rural health, and nutrition to make sure that all voices were reflected in the final 5-year bill that passed in 2018 after she joined the Ag Committee. That legislation included many provisions that Sen. Smith authored and championed, including improvement to the dairy safety-net program, the legislative roadmap for the energy title, and improvement to USDA conservation programs. It also included many provisions that benefit Minnesota’s native communities and new American communities, like permanent funding for beginning and traditionally under-served farmer outreach programs.Sen. Smith has heard from farmers about the high cost of health care, including access to health care providers and access to mental health care resources, which is why Sen. Smith championed the creation of the rural health liaison at the USDA as well as funding for local mental health resources and to expand access to stress reduction and suicide prevention programs.She also believes it’s important to invest more in Greater Minnesota, and with her leadership post on the Rural Development and Energy Subcommittee, she will keep working to expand access to broadband and better infrastructure. Thousands of Minnesotans are employed in the ethanol and biodiesel industry, selling corn and soybeans to biofuel facilities boosts the incomes of farmers around the state. Biofuels are good for energy security, for our environment, and for our economy, which is why Sen. Smith will keep advocating for a strong Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) program. More broadly, rural areas have a huge opportunity to benefit economically and in terms of good jobs from the clean energy transition, including wind, solar, and other energy sources.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"

[3/10/21]— U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) today backed a Biden Administration decision to stop enforcing a Department of Labor rule from 2020 that discouraged retirement plan managers from considering factors like climate change and racial justice in their investment decisions. She said the move will remove unnecessary regulatory burdens and give investment managers flexibility to offer investment options that take into account environmental, social and governmental (ESG) criteria when deciding where to invest. “As workers and retirees increasingly ask that their retirement plans take issues of racial equity and climate change into account in their investment decisions, I believe it’s important to avoid putting in place burdensome and unnecessary rules that will prevent investment managers from meeting the demands of workers and retirees,” said Sen. Smith, who led Senate opposition to the rule last year. “I commend today’s action by the Department of Labor to begin reversing a misguided, Trump Administration rule.  Today is an important step towards providing flexibility for retirement plans to meet the demands of participants and beneficiaries in their investment decisions.”In 2020, Sen. Smith, a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, joined forces with Several Senate colleagues in opposition to the Trump-era rule.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senators-smith-murkowski-introduce-bipartisan-bill-improve-access-rural-health-care-new,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [5/5/21]–Today, U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) introduced bipartisan legislation that would help ensure that new and expecting moms living in rural communities get the care they need.More than half of rural counties nationwide lack hospitals with labor and birthing services, and the disparity in access to care and worse health outcomes disproportionally affects people of color. Rural counties with more Black residents are at greater risk of losing their labor and delivery services.“No matter where new and expecting moms live, they should be able to access quality health care. But right now, we know that too many women in rural areas don’t have a nearby hospital with birthing services,” said Sen. Smith, a member of the Senate Health Committee. “I’ve heard from Minnesotans who have to drive hours, sometimes in dangerous conditions like Minnesota blizzards, just to get to care at a hospital. In order to support all moms during this critical time in their families’ lives, we have to fix this problem.”“The significant disparities that exist in U.S. maternal mortality between urban and rural populations is particularly worrisome in Alaska as the majority of our communities are remote or isolated. I’m proud to reintroduce this bill with Senator Smith, which expands access to care for women in rural areas, provides grant funding to improve maternal outcomes, and invests in better data collection and telehealth services to improve health care quality and access to care. Every expecting mother deserves the best care available for herself and her baby, regardless of where they live,” said Sen. Murkowski.“The paucity of maternal health care in rural areas is concerning,” said Maureen Phipps, MD, MPH, FACOG, CEO of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). “Not being able to access comprehensive health care is a critical factor impacting health outcomes. With the introduction of the Rural MOMS Act, we move one step closer to ensuring that every pregnant person will be able receive quality prenatal, labor and delivery, and postpartum care, no matter their zip code. The Rural MOMS Act provides grants to connect patients with needed care, addresses inequities in birth outcomes among rural residents, expands telehealth services and provides training for clinicians to practice in rural community-based settings, among other measures. ACOG is proud to endorse the reintroduction of this bill and thanks Senators Tina Smith and Lisa Murkowski for their leadership in making sure pregnant people across the country are able to access the care they need.”“NRHA applauds Senator Tina Smith for her leadership in addressing the maternal mortality rate in rural America. Unfortunately, pregnant women and new mothers in rural America have a significantly higher chance of dying from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth than their urban counterparts. This critical legislation provides much needed investment in innovations in training and technology to offer greater maternal health and obstetric services in rural America,” said Alan Morgan, Chief Executive Officer of the National Rural Health Association.
“The National Birth Equity Collaborative applauds the reintroduction of the Rural MOMS Act! As an organization that creates solutions to optimize maternal and infant health, we know what’s needed: robust, inclusive legislation that centers the most marginalized, like rural women and pregnant people from the Frontier Area to the front porches of Mississippi and Montana. We are pleased that the Rural MOMS Act would offer grant funding to train medical residents and fellows on implicit bias while also reporting on the gaps in maternal health by race in rural communities with a particular focus on racial inequities for Black residents to address four-hundred years of systemic racism. We believe that this bifocal approach will help advance birth equity and enliven our vision that all Black mothers and babies thrive,” said Dr. Joia Crear Perry, Founder and President of the National Birth Equity Collaborative.The Rural MOMS Act—first introduced by Sens. Smith and Murkowski in 2019–would: · Improve rural maternal and obstetric care data by directing the CDC to coordinate efforts with respect to maternal mortality and morbidity, to report on women’s health conditions according to sociocultural and geographic contexts, and to emphasize research on pregnancy-related deaths;· Award new rural obstetric network grants to establish regional innovation networks to improve maternal mortality and morbidity as well as birth outcomes;· Expand existing federal telehealth grant programs to include birth and postpartum services as part of telehealth networks and to allow federal funding to be used for ultrasound machines, fetal monitoring equipment, and other pregnancy-related technology;· Establish a new rural maternal and obstetric care training demonstration to support training for family medicine physicians, obstetricians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, midwives, doulas, and other professionals to provide maternal care services in rural community-based settings; and· Report on maternal care in rural areas to identify the locations of gaps in maternity care, disparities in maternal health in rural areas by race and ethnicity, recommendations to standardize data collection on maternal mortality and morbidity, and activities to improve maternal care in rural areas.This legislation is cosponsored by Sens. Angus King (I-Maine), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.).The Rural MOMS Act is endorsed by the Association of Maternal & Child Health Programs (AMCHP), Every Mother Counts, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the National Birth Equity Collaborative, March of Dimes, the Nurse-Family Partnership and the National Rural Health Association.  About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"

https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senators-tina-smith-amy-klobuchar-patty-murray-push-relief-exclave-communities-including,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [4/29/21]—Today, U.S. Senators Tina Smith and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), along with Senator Patty Murray (D-Wash.), introduced legislation that would provide relief to Minnesotans in the Northwest Angle and Washingtonians in Point Roberts that have been hurt by COVID-19 travel restrictions between the United States and Canada. Their Remote Recreational Small Business Interruption Program Act would provide forgivable loans to small businesses in exclaves of the contiguous United States near the Canadian border.In order to safely reach the Northwest Angle, Americans must travel through Canadian territory by automobile at a border crossing. The alternative route is a 40-mile boat trip across Lake of the Woods. Sens. Smith and Senator Klobuchar have urged cooperation between the U.S. and Canadian governments to find solutions to allow limited and safe travel along the northern border for those who live and work in border communities.US-Canada border restrictions have put Angle businesses in a particularly difficult position because most U.S. citizens can’t reach the Angle by land. This has effectively barred tourists from the exclave. Even as many other businesses across Minnesota have been able to at least partially reopen, Angle businesses remain largely closed because of the border situation. “We need to support all Minnesotans and Americans during this health and economic crisis, and that includes Northwest Angle businesses and families,” said Sen. Smith. “I’ve pressed both the Canadian government and the U.S. State Department about the burdensome travel restrictions in place, and this legislation is another way to stand up for the people who live and work in the Northwest Angle and help them weather this crisis.”“Due to pandemic travel restrictions, the Northwest Angle has been effectively cut off from the rest of Minnesota, inflicting hardship on those who have been separated from their homes, businesses, and loved ones. Northwest Angle small businesses need assistance to stay afloat, and this legislation will help them weather this pandemic and get through to the other side,” said Sen. Klobuchar.“Small business owners continue to face serious challenges as a result of the U.S./Canada border closure, including in my home state of Washington,” said Sen. Murray. “This has a direct impact on tourism and the economies of these communities. This legislation will help provide the economic support needed to help these small businesses keep their lights on and their employees on payroll.”Under the bill, forgivable loans would be available for up to 75% of last year’s revenue, if a business’s revenue dropped by at least half during the second quarter of 2020. Loan forgiveness would be reduced by amount received under the PPP or other federal loan forgiveness programs.You can access bill text here.

https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senator-tina-smith-introduces-bipartisan-bills-help-students-families-make-financially-sound,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [04/29/2021]—U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) introduced three bipartisan bills to help students and their families better understand the cost of college to avoid sticker shock, find the best value, and learn about student loans.The Net Price Calculator Improvement Act improves net price calculators to help students understand higher education costs and financial aid figures before they apply. The Understanding the True Cost of College Act creates a universal financial aid award letter so students can easily compare financial aid packages between schools. The Know Before You Owe Federal Student Loan Act makes loan counseling an annual requirement before new loans are disbursed—rather than just for first-time borrowers—and lets students decide exactly how much to borrow rather than having the maximum possible amount be the default. In addition to Sen. Smith, Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) also led the introduction of the three bills. “We need to equip students and their families with better information about the costs of college from the initial college search to when they receive financial aid offers. But right now, they’re often met with inconsistent and incomplete information,” said Sen. Smith. “My bipartisan bills with Sens. Grassley and Ernst would help fix this problem. That includes improved net price calculators so students and families have individualized estimates of college costs and financial aid figures before they decide where to apply. We’ve got a plan to create a universal financial aid offer so students can easily compare financial aid packages between schools. And we’ve introduced a bill to improve loan counseling. These resources will help students make one of the biggest financial decisions of their lives—how to pay for college.”“It’s almost impossible for students to compare college costs until they’ve applied and received their financial aid offer. And when the financial aid offer they receive from one school differs from another school, students have a very hard time determining which school is the most economical choice. Then students often do not realize that the loan amounts offered may be well in excess of what the student needs or can afford to repay. This is critical information students and their families need as they make one of the most expensive decisions of their lives,” said Sen. Grassley. “These bipartisan bills will empower students with more information. These bills would help take the mystery out of college costs and ensure that students know what they’re getting themselves into before they get in over their heads.”“As tuition costs and fees at colleges continue to skyrocket, Iowans and Americans across the country are paying the price and taking on more and more student loan debt. We need to address this problem in multiple ways, including creating more transparency in the process and giving students and their families the opportunity to compare costs and make more informed choices about their higher education. As a mother, I know how important it is for our kids to have the best opportunities to learn, grow, and succeed, including considering higher education, and these bills will help ensure Iowans have all the information available to make the best decision for their futures,” said Sen. Ernst.A summary of the Net Price Calculator Improvement Act is available here

https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senator-tina-smiths-statement-president-bidens-joint-address-congress,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [4/28/21]—This evening, U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) released the following statement in response to President Biden’s Joint Address to Congress:“First, I want to thank Chad Dunkley for being my virtual guest at President Biden’s Joint Address to Congress. Chad serves as CEO of New Horizon Academy, a family-owned company in Minnesota that has been serving young kids for 50 years. New Horizon Academy is one of the many childcare providers that the American Rescue Plan will help. While I wish Chad could have been here in-person, it was an honor for him to be my guest. “More than a year ago, Chad and I connected in the early days of the pandemic about the crisis Minnesota childcare providers and families were facing. Childcare faced huge challenges before the pandemic, but was pushed to the brink and in some cases over the edge. Hearing his story and the experiences in Minnesota inspired me to tackle this and work with partners in congress to deliver historic funding to help stabilize this essential sector.   “I have heard time and again from so many Minnesotans about the need for affordable, high-quality childcare because we know early education is fundamental for families, and for our economy. So I’m glad that President Biden unveiled his American Families Plan today, and spoke tonight about how it would make the significant investments we so badly need. In addition to childcare and early education, President Biden touched on the progress we’ve made when it comes to combating the coronavirus pandemic, and the progress we still need to make on police reform, gun safety, and tackling climate change. Tonight, President Biden again showed that the Biden-Harris White House believes in government that fights for all families and working people, not just a few at the top. I look forward to continuing to partner on this work, and expanding opportunity for Minnesotans and all Americans.”About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senator-tina-smiths-statement-passing-vice-president-walter-mondale,"Today, U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) released the following statement on the passing of Vice President Walter Mondale:“I loved Walter Mondale and I’m not the only one. Mondale was a giant not only because of the positions he held—Minnesota Attorney General, U.S. Senator, Vice President, Democratic Presidential Candidate and Ambassador—but because of the work that he did.  He provided his strong, compassionate, clear, and fearless voice to the world for over six decades, and he never stopped. Whether it was working with Marian Wright Edelman to lift children out of poverty, fighting to repair the damage of housing discrimination with the Fair Housing Act, or persistently pushing us to protect precious places like the St. Croix River and our beloved Boundary Waters, he charted an unwavering path. He was also a true friend, full of lively questions, incisive and hysterically funny commentary, advice offered with his unique dry wit, birthdays remembered and lunches shared, preferably with onion rings. He deeply loved all his family with the best gift a father can give, unconditional love, expressed with classic Mondale understatement:  “Keep up the good work.” I am bereft and so grateful to have known him. May his memory be a blessing and a reminder to do good work and love life.”Sen. Smith also shared this statement here on her official Senate Facebook page.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senator-tina-smith-introduces-bipartisan-legislation-help-farms-adopt-conservation-climate,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [04/19/21]—U.S. Senator Tina Smith recently introduced bipartisan legislation to help farmers adopt conservation and climate practices to sustain their farms, boost bottom lines and protect the environment. The Conservation and Innovative Climate Partnership Act, led by Sen. Smith and Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) would create a USDA competitive grant program to help farmers make these improvements. Sen. Smith said that universities will provide farmers who are participating in the grant program with individualized advice to help them meet their conservation goals. This unique partnership creates an opportunity for new research and ideas to be applied to farming operations. “Strong farm programs that encourage conservation and climate practices will help farmers maintain sustainable and productive operations well into the future,” said Sen. Smith. “They will also help us reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change. This bill connects farmers with the information and resources they need to take action.”“Hoosier farms feed our families and are integral to our supply chains. Every farmer faces unique decisions in their farm management, and pressure from the federal government to cut carbon emissions can place stress on the good work already underway,” said Sen. Young. “My Conservation and Innovative Climate Partnership Act gives farmers access to the latest tools and research in order to be successful while keeping American soil productive and healthy.”Conservation and climate practices enhance farms’ resiliency and bottom lines by advancing soil health and water quality. They can also help fight climate change. For example, CO2 emissions could be reduced by nearly 150 million metric tons per year if US farmers adopted cover crops on 25% of cropland and conservation tillage on all tillable acres.You can read bill text here.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"

[4/21/21]—Today, U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) released the following statement after the verdict was announced in the Derek Chauvin trial:“Convicting Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd is a moment of accountability, and also a moment to recommit ourselves to the movement for racial justice his tragic murder sparked.“Millions of people took to the streets because we couldn’t look away from the reality of George Floyd’s murder and we could see change had to come. I can’t stop thinking about all the Black and Brown people denied their civil rights and denied their lives, where there was no accountability.“Last week a reporter interviewing me referred to Minnesota as ‘the Jim Crow of the North.’ Devastating. He was talking about the deep and persistent inequities in housing, health care, policing and the criminal justice system, and economic opportunity that people of color experience in my state.“These inequities exist, not only in Minnesota, but all across our country. And we can change them.“What if this verdict is the beginning of a transformation in public safety for Minnesota and our country, where we move past the warrior model of policing and toward a model of truly protecting and serving?“What if we rethink public safety so that Black and Brown people, and all people, truly feel safe and protected in their homes, neighborhoods and communities?“This is the work ahead of all of us.”About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senator-tina-smiths-bipartisan-bill-help-lower-prescription-drug-costs-be-signed-law,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [4/15/21]—U.S. Senator Tina Smith’s (D-Minn.) bipartisan legislation to help lower prescription drug costs is headed to the President’s desk to be signed into law after passing the House on Wednesday, and passing the Senate in March.The Ensuring Innovation Act, led by Sen. Smith and Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), will stop pharmaceutical manufacturers from claiming new innovations when they make insignificant modifications to their products in order to extend their monopolies and keep drug prices high for consumers.Right now, pharmaceutical companies engage in “evergreening,” which allows them to extend their patents for five years when they make minor, insignificant changes to a drug. The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) tried to end the practice by only granting these patent exclusivities to drugs that truly have a new chemical entity, but a district court decision invalidated the agency’s ability to block this practice. The Ensuring Innovation Act would ensure the FDA has the ability to curb this practice.“We need to stand up for Americans who are struggling to afford life-saving prescription drugs. This is especially important as we navigate the public health and economic crisis of COVID-19,” said Sen. Smith. “The House passage of our bipartisan Ensuring Innovation Act is important progress in the fight to make medications more effective and drive down costs for consumers. The next step is for President Biden to sign this into law. ” “We must lower prescription drug costs. We can do this by increasing competition and closing loopholes which prevent generics from reaching the marketplace. This bill does both,” said Dr. Cassidy. “It’s good for your health. It’s good for your wallet. It’s a good piece of legislation.” About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senator-tina-smith-presses-us-state-department-address-canadian-border-restrictions-hurting,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [4/7/21]—U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) has repeatedly pressed Canadian officials on issues affecting the Minnesota’s Northwest Angle—which cannot be accessed by land without traveling briefly through Canada—and today, Sen. Smith is urging the U.S. State Department to address new Canadian restrictions that are hurting Minnesotans who own homes and businesses in the Northwest Angle.Currently, due to border restrictions recently enacted by Canada, Angle residents, tourists and business owners are required to present a negative PCR COVID-19 test in order to travel through Canada to the Angle. But with limited PCR testing available in rural areas, Sen. Smith says that these restrictions, which apply regardless of an individual’s vaccination status, must be addressed.“Minnesota’s Northwest Angle cannot be accessed by land without traveling briefly through Canada. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Canadian Government has severely restricted cross-border travel, and the uniform policy that treats all cross-border travel equally creates major problems for exclaves like the Northwest Angle,” wrote Sen. Smith in her letter to Secretary of State Tony Blinken. “The effect of these policies is to prohibit Americans from traveling to their homes, and they have starved tourism reliant business owners of their customer base.

These Americans are beset by the constantly changing, inconsistently applied border policies of the Canadian Government.Minnesota’s Northwest Angle cannot be accessed by land without traveling briefly through Canada. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Canadian Government has severely restricted cross-border travel, and the uniform policy that treats all cross-border travel equally creates major problems for exclaves like the Northwest Angle. The effect of these policies is to prohibit Americans from traveling to their homes, and they have starved tourism reliant business owners of their customer base. By ignoring the unique circumstance of this community, Canadian officials have placed undue hardship on American citizens.The most recent problem to arise follows new restrictions recently enacted by the Canadian Government, which require Angle residents to present a negative PCR COVID-19 test in order to transit through Manitoba to the Angle. A trip to the nearest community for groceries or a medical appointment is no longer routine. Access to timely PCR testing is limited in rural areas, and it is infeasible in this situation to rely on mail or parcel services, which would mean a multi-day delay in returning home. These restrictions apply regardless of an individual’s vaccination status.I have pressed Canadian officials repeatedly on issues affecting the Northwest Angle over the last year, and I urge you to work with your Canadian counterparts to devise a solution that addresses the needs of border exclave communities, and the Northwest Angle specifically.Sincerely,

https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senators-tina-smith-john-hoeven-reintroduce-bill-improve-financial-stability-electric-coops,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [03/26/21]—U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and John Hoeven (R-N.D.) reintroduced a bipartisan bill to help stabilize the finances of the nation’s rural electric cooperatives and rural broadband providers. The Flexible Financing for Rural America Act would make it possible for rural electric cooperatives and telecommunications providers to refinance their Rural Utilities Service (RUS) debt at lower interest rates. A House companion was introduced by Reps. Tom O’Halleran (D-Ariz.) and Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.). Sens. Smith and Hoeven said that this could help rural cooperatives and businesses better manage cash-flow, invest in rural communities, and pass savings on to customers.“Rural electric cooperatives are critical to economic success in small towns and rural areas across Minnesota,” said Sen. Smith. “We ought to support them so they can continue to boost our infrastructure, all while supporting jobs and improving Minnesotans’ quality of life. I successfully pushed to make rural electric cooperatives eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program during the pandemic. And my bipartisan RURAL Act was signed into law to fix a mistake in the 2017 tax law that put the tax-exempt status of cooperatives at risk if they received government grants to expand broadband or recover from a disaster. Now, I’m focused on making sure electric cooperatives are able to refinance their Rural Utilities Service debt at lower interest rates.”“Our legislation provides the opportunity for electric and telecommunication cooperatives to refinance their Rural Utilities Service debt at current market rates without penalty,” said Sen. Hoeven. “This is about reinvesting in our rural communities, passing savings on to consumers and further supporting efforts to continue overcoming challenges from COVID-19. Families and businesses living and working in rural communities across North Dakota and the country depend on these cooperatives and the critical services they provide.”“It’s crucial that we address the needs of our long-overlooked rural communities, who too often encounter barriers in accessing quality, affordable utilities,” said Rep. O’Halleran. “Our Flexible Financing for Rural America Act will extend a lifeline to hundreds of electric cooperatives serving rural families and businesses.” “In our ever-growing connected society, the need to expand rural broadband in Missouri and across America continues to be one of my top priorities in Congress,” said Rep. Hartzler. “Nearly 30 percent of rural Missourians still lack vital access to highspeed internet. The bipartisan Flexible Financing for Rural America Act will jumpstart these communities, allowing them the same essential telecommunications resources urban areas routinely enjoy in our digital age. I am proud to see strong support for our legislation and its potential benefits for Fourth District families, schools, farms, healthcare providers, and businesses.”“Rural electric cooperatives provide vital electricity service across Minnesota,” said Darrick Moe, CEO of the Minnesota Rural Electric Association. “They loan funds from the federal Rural Utilities Service (RUS) to make that happen, and pay those loans back with interest.  Typically loans can be adjusted when interest rates fall, but the interest rates on these RUS loans are effectively frozen due to penalties that get imposed for refinancing.  Senator Smith is introducing a bill, with broad bipartisan support, to remove this barrier. This is a common sense fix that will help keep power bills affordable and help cooperatives as they support their local communities. Senator Smith’s leadership in this area is appreciated.”  Darrick Moe, Minnesota Rural Electric Association, CEO.“Small, community-based broadband providers have answered the call to keep their neighbors connected in the face of a global pandemic and the economic challenges that have followed,” said Shirley Bloomfield, CEO, NTCA-The Rural Broadband Association. “Allowing providers who use RUS loans to take advantage of low interest rates is a commonsense step that will make a big impact and give providers the flexibility to continue to support their communities as they recover from the pandemic. On behalf of NTCA’s members, I thank Senators Smith and Hoeven and Representatives O’Halleran and Hartzler for reintroducing the Flexible Financing for Rural America Act.” In addition to Sens. Smith and Hoeven, the Flexible Financing for Rural America Act is supported by Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.). About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"

Klobuchar and Smith said that AAPIs were targeted in nearly 3,800 hate incidents across the country since last March, according to this report. “As we see a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans, we are again reminded that these crimes inflict trauma not just on individual victims but on entire communities,” said Sen. Klobuchar. “We must condemn this hateful rhetoric and violence and ensure that the perpetrators are held accountable.”“We need to join together and stand up against racist hate crimes towards Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders,” said Sen. Smith. “This means speaking out against dangerous anti-Asian rhetoric related to COVID-19 that has contributed to the sharp rise of these events.

https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senators-smith-capito-lead-bipartisan-senate-effort-reduce-greenhouse-emissions-carbon-capture,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [3/25/21]—Today, U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) will be leading a bipartisan group of senators in introducing legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Their bill would make tax credits that encourage carbon capture projects more available and easier to use.The bipartisan Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage Tax Credit Amendments Act is also supported by Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa). This legislation would make improvements to ensure that carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) credits are utilized to their full potential to create manufacturing, construction, and engineering jobs and prevent carbon dioxide emissions. “The science is clear—climate change is real, it’s caused by humans, and we need urgent action to address it. Our bill works toward that goal by working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” said Sen. Smith. “Carbon capture and storage is a crucial technology for reducing emissions from biofuels, steel, and other industries important to Minnesota. Climate scientists tell us that if we are to avoid the worst of the climate crises, we will absolutely need direct air capture to pull excess carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, and this bill provides increased support for that emerging type of carbon capture. You can see from the Senate coalition supporting this legislation that what’s good for our environment and good for our economy is bipartisan, as it should be.”“The United States has an opportunity to be a leader when it comes to carbon capture technologies, and this legislation will help us achieve that goal,” Senator Capito, Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, said. “Not only will it help us protect our coal and natural gas industries, which are so critical to states like West Virginia, but this legislation promotes domestic energy production and reducing our power and manufacturing sector emissions. I’m proud to reintroduce this bipartisan legislation that will make a big difference in putting American innovation to work growing our economy and combatting climate change in a responsible way, regardless of the current economic circumstances.” “Our bipartisan bill will incentivize innovation in promising carbon capture technologies. We’re hopeful that removing carbon from the atmosphere can be part of the solution for holding warming below the 1.5 degree C threshold, but we need to accelerate the pace of innovation to get there,” said Sen. Whitehouse.“North Dakota is leading the way in the development of clean, reliable energy by investing and applying carbon capture and use technologies to lignite, oil, and ethanol facilities. By extending and expanding access to carbon capture tax credits, our bipartisan bill would allow innovators in our state to increase their investments, further research the technologies, and ultimately lower emissions,” said Sen. Cramer. “If our shared goal really is providing reliable energy while protecting the environment, Congress should pass our legislation and the Biden Administration should support it.”“Every pathway to a net-zero emissions economy will rely on carbon removal and storage. That’s why scaling up direct air capture is going to be critical for solving the climate crisis,” said Sen. Schatz. “Our bipartisan bill will create new incentives to develop these technologies, create good-paying jobs, and get more of these projects off the ground.” “The 45Q and 48A tax credits are an essential part of our efforts to advance the development of CCUS technologies, which will enable our nation to continue utilizing all of our abundant energy resources while also reducing emissions,” said Sen. Hoeven. “Our legislation will enhance these important incentives, making them more effective and accessible as CCUS is developed and implemented. This is about supporting good-paying jobs, making our nation energy secure and maintaining our baseload power sources to ensure the reliability and affordability of the electric grid.”“Carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) is one of the most critical technologies to combat climate change globally. As we transition to a cleaner energy future, increased investment in CCUS and carbon removal technologies will reduce emissions, keep our energy affordable and reliable, and ensure our continued climate leadership. Enhancing the 45Q and 48A tax credits will encourage increased commercialization of CCUS and Direct Air Capture technologies across the nation while supporting clean energy, infrastructure, and manufacturing jobs across the country, including in traditional energy producing communities like those in West Virginia. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure this legislation becomes law,” said Sen. Manchin, Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “The best way to make American energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, is through innovation, not government regulation or taxation,” said Sen. Barrasso. “Our bipartisan bill will do just that without raising costs for Americans. Carbon capture and storage technology will help reduce carbon emissions and create new jobs in Wyoming at the same time. It will also promote the long term use of Wyoming’s traditional energy resources, while helping America remain the world’s energy leader.”“It’s clear that accelerated deployment of carbon capture, utilization, and storage is crucial for reaching mid-century climate goals and would create thousands of jobs and help maintain American competitiveness in the process,” said Sen. Coons. “I’m proud to join Senators Smith and Capito in introducing the Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage Tax Credit Amendments Act that would make important reforms to the 45Q and 48A tax credits, enhancing the ability of these federal incentives to spur development of new CCUS projects. Together with the bipartisan SCALE Act I authored, this bill will further drive the adoption of CCUS in the United States.”“Caring for our environment and preserving American jobs and energy sources doesn’t have to be mutually exclusive. This bipartisan bill helps to encourage innovation that can support American manufacturing and energy production while helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” Sen. Grassley said.“Carbon capture, utilization, and storage will play an important role in our efforts to combat climate change. This legislation will empower Americans to innovate and employ the latest technologies to protect our planet while creating good-paying, American jobs. I’ll continue working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass commonsense climate legislation,” said Sen. Luján. “Through commonsense incentives and innovation, we can work together to protect our environment and promote clean energy without heavy-handed government mandates. This bipartisan bill will help reduce carbon dioxide emissions while creating good-paying jobs for Iowans, and all Americans,” said Sen. Ernst.What Labor Unions, Environmental Groups, Think Tanks, Trade Groups & Non-Governmental Organizations Say About the Bipartisan Legislation:“Carbon capture and direct air capture technologies are critical for protecting and creating good manufacturing jobs as the nation and the globe work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage Tax Credit Amendments Act includes increased credit values for direct air capture projects and an extended commence construction deadline. This will enable the large-scale deployment of carbon management technologies, which, particularly in industrial facilities, will help retain and create high-wage jobs,” said Tom Conway, International President of United Steelworkers.“The 45Q tax credit furthers carbon capture deployment at a critical moment when there’s strong, bi-partisan leadership advocating this technology and a swell of public support for policies that lower emissions while preserving and creating jobs and economic benefits. We are hopeful this legislation is one of many measures we can rely on in the near-term to create and sustain family-supporting jobs as we achieve net-zero emissions,” said James Slevin, President of the Utility Workers Union of America.“We are at an exciting moment where we can meet the challenge of climate change by creating a future with cleaner air and better energy choices. And we can do it while bringing new jobs to the table. The 45Q tax credit is an important tool that will support the deployment of technologies that capture and safely and securely store carbon. We applaud the bipartisan commitment to creating the right incentives to support the transition to a clean economy,” said Jason Albritton, Director of Climate and Energy Policy at The Nature Conservancy.“Carbon capture is critical to tackling climate change, and 45Q is the most important carbon capture incentive in the world. This extremely important legislation optimizes 45Q it by extending the commence construction deadline and allowing compatibility with the 48A incentive — providing direct pay option for both. By introducing new 45Q values for direct air capture, it also reflects the importance of tailoring 45Q to different applications of carbon capture, removal, and storage technologies, as not all of them are at the same stage of deployment, and their costs vary as well. Together with the SCALE Act, this legislation forms a must-pass policy package for the large-scale deployment of carbon capture, removal, and storage for a net-zero US,” said Lee Beck, CCUS Policy Innovation Director at Clean Air Task Force.“The 45Q Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage Tax Credit Amendments Act provides smart, targeted legislative updates in support of technologies that will be crucial to meeting our climate goals. The economic challenges created by the pandemic make extending the 45Q tax credit and making direct cash payments available to project developers vital steps to advancing these technologies. These steps, along with an expansion of the Direct Air Capture credit, will boost the long-term competitiveness of domestic industries and enable those industries and the communities they operate in to thrive in a low-carbon future,” said Bob Perciasepe, President of C2ES.“BPC Action supports the Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage Tax Credit Amendments Act introduced by Sens. Smith (D-MN) and Capito (R-WV),” said Michele Stockwell, Executive Director of BPC Action. “The legislation is an important update to the 45Q tax credit which is critical for financing carbon capture technologies, including direct air capture, and will support American industries to create important new clean energy jobs. Leveraging American innovation in carbon capture and removal will be an important element of the economic recovery while reducing emissions.”“As our nation moves to decarbonize the transportation sector and achieve clean energy and climate goals, real-world data continue to prove the important role that biofuels play,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. “Not only do biofuels like ethanol significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector, but more and more ethanol producers are looking towards capturing CO2 from the production process and storing it underground or using it for other commercial applications, including dry ice production for COVID-19 vaccination storage.  “To achieve the full potential of carbon capture to support domestic energy and industrial production, protect and create jobs that pay family-sustaining wages, and achieve net-zero emissions by midcentury, we need a suite of federal policies that enhance and build on the federal Section 45Q tax credit. The Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage Tax Credit Amendments Act helps meet this urgent need,” said Carbon Capture Coalition Director Brad Crabtree.“CURC congratulates Senators Tina Smith (D-MN), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and their Senate colleagues on the introduction of the 45Q Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage Tax Credit Amendments Act,” said CURC Executive Director Shannon Angielski. “To aid ongoing economic recovery efforts, the U.S. needs to invest in the energy system and infrastructure of the future. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies have a critical role to play in that future, contributing to the decarbonization of the electric power and industrial sectors while maintaining affordable, dispatchable power generation and creating good-paying jobs. Enhancing the Section 45Q and 48A tax credits are critical to stimulate the deployment of CCUS technologies. CURC commends Senators Smith and Capito for their leadership to bolster these tax credits to allow project developers and private investors to access their benefits, an effort that has bipartisan and bicameral support.”“America’s electric cooperatives thank Senator Smith and Senator Capito for leading a bipartisan effort to provide new approaches to financing technology at coal power plants that ensure they produce reliable, affordable power while further protecting the environment,” said NRECA CEO Jim Matheson. “By combining these important tax incentives and adopting a direct payment model for cooperatives, Congress can support innovative carbon capture and storage projects that will be a necessary option for low-carbon energy.”“Congress took a major step forward on climate in 2018 by establishing a federal tax incentive for carbon capture, use, and storage, but we need to do more to help get these critical projects off the ground to address the climate crisis,” said Shannon Heyck-Williams, director of climate and energy policy at the National Wildlife Federation. “The bipartisan 45Q Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage Tax Credit Amendments Act—like its House counterpart, the ACCESS 45Q Act—would extend the life and value of this credit and make it more flexible so its benefits can be realized and this climate-critical technology can be deployed in industries across the country.” “The Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage Tax Credit Amendments Act provides long-needed improvements to the existing 45Q and 48A tax credits to provide for much needed decarbonization incentives, while supporting workers across the country. Members of Congress in both parties recognize that achieving U.S. climate goals requires steep reductions in atmospheric CO2. That entails capturing emissions from point sources like biorefineries and cement kilns before they are emitted, along with CO2 molecules already in the atmosphere. Studies show that even partial deployment of the carbon capture and storage plants required to meet our climate goals could create over 61,000 American jobs through 2035,” said Christina DeConcini, Director of Government Affairs, World Resources Institute.The CCUS Tax Credit Amendments Act would:1) Extend “commence construction” by five years. The credits would be available to projects that begin by the end of 2030.2) Allow for direct payment of the carbon capture credits. This is urgently needed for the majority of project developers who otherwise lack sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the credits.3) Increase support for direct air capture (DAC) of CO2 from the atmosphere. This is key to the decarbonization of the heavy industry and manufacturing sectors and also allows us to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere after it has been released.4) Allow the 45Q credit to offset tax obligations due to the Base Erosion Avoidance Tax (BEAT). This bill will grant the same tax treatment to carbon capture, direct air capture and carbon utilization projects as is currently offered to wind and solar projects.5) Revise 48A credit to make it work for CCUS retrofits. This bill includes modifications to the 48A tax credit aligned with the recent Carbon Capture Modernization Act.You can access a summary of the bill here and full text of the bill here.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senators-klobuchar-smith-announce-100-million-federal-investment-build-improve-electric,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [03/25/21]—U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith (D-Minn.) announced a federal rural electric loan package totaling more than $100 million to build and improve electric infrastructure in Minnesota.Minnkota Power Cooperative will receive a $80,560,000 loan to fund improvement projects. Minnkota Power is headquartered in Grand Forks, and provides wholesale electric power to 11 distribution cooperatives serving nearly 137,000 households in eastern North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota. Minnesota Valley Cooperative Light and Power will receive a $22,817,000 loan to connect 132 consumers. This loan will also help expand smart grid technologies and build and improve 137 miles of line. “When we invest in electric infrastructure, we invest in opportunity for all Minnesotans,” said Sen. Klobuchar. “In 2021, everyone should have access to reliable electricity, regardless of their zip code.

Senator Tina Smith
March 24, 2021M. President –In a year with so much heartbreak, grief, and death, it almost escaped notice that we had gone a year without a mass shooting in a public place. But now we face a grim reminder of our American reality. In the space of a week, two separate mass shootings stole the lives of 18 people.  And just weeks ago we suffered a mass shooting at a health clinic in Minnesota.So here we are, once again, thrust into a familiar cycle of collective grief, frustration, and fury. Our hearts break for the families and loved ones of those whose lives were stolen. Our voices cry out for change to end the scourge of gun violence in this country. And our anger grows as our voices are ignored, and we are told by Republican leaders that there is nothing we can do to protect American lives from gun violence.  Colleagues, it is our JOB to protect American lives.Today, I want to share with you the voice of Veronique de la Rosa. Her son Noah, just six years old, was murdered in his classroom at Sandy Hook Elementary. She delivered this eulogy for her son at his 2012 funeral. I am going to read it in its entirety so that it can be included in the Congressional record and can serve as a reminder of the human toll our gun culture has taken: The sky is crying, and the flags are at half-mast. It is a sad, sad day. But it is also your day, Noah, my little man. I will miss your forceful and purposeful little steps stomping through our house. I will miss your perpetual smile, the twinkle in your dark blue eyes, framed by eyelashes that would be the envy of any lady in this room.Most of all, I will miss your visions of your future. You wanted to be a doctor, a soldier, a taco factory manager. It was your favorite food, and no doubt you wanted to ensure that the world kept producing tacos. You were a little boy whose life force had all the gravitational pull of a celestial body. You were light and love, mischief and pranks. You adored your family with every fiber of your 6-year-old being. We are all of us elevated in our humanity by having known you. A little maverick, who didn’t always want to do his schoolwork or clean up his toys, when practicing his ninja moves or Super Mario on the Wii seemed far more important. Noah, you will not pass through this way again. I can only believe that you were planted on Earth to bloom in heaven. Take flight, my boy. Soar. You now have the wings you always wanted. Go to that peaceful valley that we will all one day come to know. I will join you someday. Not today. I still have lots of mommy love to give to Danielle, Michael, Sophia and Arielle. Until then, your melody will linger in our hearts forever. Momma loves you, little man. Veronique should not have had to eulogize Noah, her six year old son. One of twenty children killed at Sandy Hook. I ask my Republican colleagues to think of her when they suggest families exaggerate their anguish for crude political gain. Just yesterday, one of my Republican colleagues dismissed this grief as “theater.”  No. This is life and death.  So I am angry.  I am angry because I know we have the power to stop this violence, and yet our Republican colleagues stand in the way, they refuse to work with us, and they continue to put the demands of the NRA above the demands of the people we are elected to serve – that we stop this horrific gun violence, that we protect the people we were elected to serve.We need universal background checks. We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We need to end this cycle.We need Republicans in Congress to find the strength and humanity to take action.M.

https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-sens-smith-young-renew-bipartisan-push-improve-public-health-preparedness-coordinated-one-health,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [3/18/21]—Today, U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.) are continuing their bipartisan work to improve public health preparedness by ensuring federal agencies advance a “One Health” approach—the idea that human and animal health are linked, and that they should be studied together—to prevent and respond to disease outbreaks.We know from the current COVID-19 pandemic—with CDC confirmation that the virus originally came from an animal—that it is vital to make sure our nation is prepared for the future. The Advancing Emergency Preparedness Through One Health Act would improve coordination among those studying animal and human health by requiring the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Agriculture Department (USDA), and the Department of Interior (Interior) to adopt a One Health framework with other agencies. U.S. Representatives Kurt Schrader (D-OR 5) and Dusty Johnson (R-SD) introduced bipartisan companion legislation in the House today.“We sadly are all too familiar with how outbreaks take a real toll on families and our economy. I’ve pushed adopting a ‘One Health’ approach since I served as Minnesota Lieutenant Governor, and now I’m continuing that work in the Senate while we all navigate combatting COVID-19,” said Sen. Smith, a member of both the Senate Health and Ag Committees. “We need to recognize the connection between human, animal and environmental health so future preparedness efforts meet the needs of all people, all ages, and in all communities.”“The COVID-19 pandemic illustrates how we must focus our efforts on better understanding the connection between animal and human health,” said Sen. Young. “Instituting a One Health framework at the federal level will help us to improve our knowledge of diseases like COVID-19 so we can best prevent, prepare, and respond to future pandemics and outbreaks.” “Over the last year, we have all experienced firsthand the strong correlation between animal health and human health,” said Rep. Kurt Schrader, the only veterinarian currently serving in the United States Congress. “This unique relationship has often been overlooked in how we work across government agencies to address these shared diseases. Beyond the current pandemic, rabies, salmonella, West Nile Virus, and avian flu are all examples of diseases that we see in animals before they are passed onto humans, and can be fatal in both. This bill is an important step to improve preparedness, coordination, and communication between veterinarians who work with animals every day and federal agencies who respond to health outbreaks.”“COVID-19 has further revealed the strong correlation between human health and animal health. A ‘One Health’ approach will ensure America is better prepared to combat disease outbreaks before they become widespread amongst species,” said Rep. Dusty Johnson.“The global COVID-19 pandemic is a devastating example of why this legislation is so critically important. In order to successfully deal with threats like this in the future, we must take an integrated approach to solving the public health and food security threats that are emerging at the intersection of humans, animals and the environment. Better coordination among the different agencies and secretariats involved in health and agriculture will help leverage their strengths and make them more effective,” said Dr. Andrew T. Maccabe, Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC) Chief Executive Officer. “As we have learned from COVID-19, influenza, Zika, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and many other infectious threats,  human, animal and environmental health are interconnected and One Health strategies are critical.  The Infectious Diseases Society of America supports this important legislation to strengthen our surveillance, research and workforce to better prevent, prepare for and respond to outbreaks,” said Barbara D. Alexander, MD, MHS, FIDSA; President, Infectious Diseases Society of America; Professor of Medicine and Pathology, Duke University School of Medicine.“COVID-19 has clearly demonstrated the need for our nation to take a One Health approach to disease outbreaks,” said Dr. Douglas Kratt, American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) President. “Animals, humans, and the environment are more interconnected than ever, and the bill reintroduced today is an important step to fully implementing One Health principles into our public health approach. The AVMA urges Congress to pass the Advancing Emergency Preparedness Through One Health Act so we can better prepare, detect, and respond to zoonotic diseases in the future.”“Local health department professionals understand that the health of people is connected to the health of animals and the environment and that a ‘one health’ approach is necessary to truly protect health. The Advancing Emergency Preparedness Through One Health Act acknowledges the critical role of partnerships between the local, state, and federal levels to develop a comprehensive One Health framework. We appreciate the leadership of all the policymakers who recognize the need for this approach in order to protect the public’s health,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, MBA, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO).The Advancing Emergency Preparedness One Health Act would:In addition to working to author and pass historic legislation to provide COVID-19 relief to families and businesses, Sen. Smith continues to hear from Minnesotans about the need to combat African Swine Fever, Chronic Wasting Disease and Lyme Disease. In Willmar, Minn. Sen. Smith met with livestock producers and veterinarians at the Minnesota Poultry Testing Laboratory and heard folks talk about the importance of identifying and monitoring emerging diseases. And more recently, Sen. Smith worked across party lines with Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) to get their bipartisan bill to improve research, prevention, diagnostics, and treatment for tick-borne diseases signed into law as part of a government funding package.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senator-tina-smith-presses-agriculture-secretary-tom-vilsack-uphold-commitment-end-historic-usda,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [3/17/21]—Today, U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) continued her push to ensure U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack upholds his commitment to ensure the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) ends the historic discriminatory practices that have not only robbed farmers of color across the country of needed services and assistance, but have also cost U.S. taxpayers more than $1.25 billion in past restitution payments.Sen. Smith, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said that when she questioned Sec. Vilsack at his confirmation hearing last month about past USDA discrimination, he signaled his strong intention to work both internally at the department and externally with the nation’s farmers of color to ensure all producers have full access to USDA services.   “As you and I discussed at your confirmation hearing in the Senate Agriculture Committee, farmers across the country are facing unprecedented challenges. The global pandemic has only heightened the economic pain our farm families feel after years of low farm prices, trade disruptions, volatile markets, and historic levels of farm debt.” Sen. Smith wrote to Vilsack Wednesday. “I want to reiterate the concerns I expressed that day about the financial well-being of our nation’s farmers of color, who have historically been excluded from fully accessing the USDA’s resources and support. I also share your expressed views that we have a lot of work to do to make good on the promise to fix this historic wrong.”Sen. Smith said she welcomed some of Sec. Vilsack’s and USDA’s initial efforts, including the nomination this week of Janie Simms Hipp, a citizen of the Chickasaw Tribal Nation, to serve as USDA General Counsel, as well as the appointment in February of South Dakotan Zach Ducheneaux to head the Farm Services Agency (FSA). Ducheneaux formerly ran the Inter-Tribal Ag Council.Beyond that, Sen. Smith said the recently-passed COVID-19 relief package included $4 billion for agriculture. She said she will work to target a portion of that funding to help beginning farmers and farmers of color navigate USDA forms and processes.  You can access text of Sen. Smith’s letter to Sec. Vilsack below:March 17, 2021The Honorable Thomas J.

The global pandemic has only heightened the economic pain our farm families feel after years of low farm prices, trade disruptions, volatile markets, and historic levels of farm debt. I want to reiterate the concerns I expressed that day about the financial well-being of our nation’s farmers of color, who have historically been excluded from fully accessing the USDA’s resources and support. I also share your expressed views that we have a lot of work to do to make good on the promise to fix this historic wrong.  As you take over leadership of the department, I look forward to working with you and other USDA officials on the steps you outlined at the hearing to ensure farmers of color have access to all the programs and benefits that are afforded to all producers.  As we address these historic problems, I want you to know that I will also use my seat on the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee to ensure that inequities that have existed in farm lending programs for many decades are ended. As you know, having access to these important financial tools are not only key to the success of farmers of color, but of all producers.I also want to renew my invitation for you to visit Minnesota to meet with the diverse group of producers who make up our important farm economy so that you can learn first-hand about their experiences and how the USDA can improve its customer service.I was heartened by your remarks at the hearing on your plans to ensure that all USDA programs are equitable. It will require constant effort over the coming years and I plan to work alongside you to get that important work finished.

https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senators-tina-smith-lisa-murkowski-introduce-bipartisan-bill-improve-access-tele-mental-health,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [3/16/21]—U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) introduced a bipartisan bill to help more Americans access tele-mental health care during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The Tele-Mental Health Improvement Act would address gaps in tele-mental health coverage that prevent Americans from receiving care. Sens. Smith and Murkowski said that expanding access to tele-mental health is important to address COVID-19’s negative effect on the mental health of Americans. Last year 45 percent of adults in the United States reported increased stress and worry due to the public health and economic implications of COVID-19. But right now a significant percent of commercial plans do not pay providers the same rate for tele-health visits as in-person visits. And only 1 in 4 enrollees in the fully-insured group market have a plan with tele-health provider parity requirements.  “It’s clear that we need to redouble our efforts to address the increased demand for tele-mental health services across America during COVID-19,” said Sen. Smith. “This bipartisan legislation will eliminate barriers that make it difficult to access this much needed care. I’m glad to be working with Sen. Murkowski on this and will focus on moving it forward.” “As we continue to address the impacts of COVID-19, another crisis has emerged – the crisis of mental health. I continue to hear from Alaskans that they are facing challenges with accessing or delivering services via telehealth. This includes Alaskans and Alaskan mental health providers that have been unable to continue existing relationships due to restrictions on telehealth coverage. This legislation ensures that ERISA health plans provide coverage for mental health services via telehealth for the duration of the COVID emergency,” said Sen. Murkowski. “The pandemic has made telehealth services an essential component of care. Americans must have access to mental health care services, no matter where they reside.” “Access to telehealth has been essential during the pandemic and APA is pleased that Sens. Smith and Murkowski have reintroduced the Telemental Health Improvement Act,” said American Psychiatric Association President Jeffrey Geller, M.D., M.P.H. “This legislation will ensure that patients can continue to receive vital services for mental health and substance use disorders, while maintaining safe physical distance during the pandemic and beyond.” “All of these provisions are essential, as many providers have found that during the crisis mental health and substance use disorder services are not covered through telehealth, or the reimbursement is lower than it is for in-person care, and there are often other hurdles in place that restrict access,” said the Mental Health Liaison Group. “This legislation will grant individuals experiencing mental health conditions and/or substance use disorders access to safe and timely care and will help mitigate some of the pandemic-related increases in deaths of despair due to suicides and overdoses.”Senators Smith and Murkowski’s bipartisan Tele-Mental Health Improvement Act would improve access to tele-mental health during the length of the COVID-19 public health emergency by:This legislation is endorsed by the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Minnesota, WithAll, The Emily Program, and over 65 members of the Mental Health Liaison Group, including the National Council for Behavioral Health, American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, and Eating Disorders Coalition for Research, Policy & Action. You can read a summary of the legislation here and bill text here.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senators-tina-smith-mike-rounds-introduce-bipartisan-native-american-rural-homeownership,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [6/24/21]—U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) are pressing bipartisan legislation to help Native families living in rural areas achieve homeownership.Right now, the homeownership rate for Native American households is around 54 percent, while the rate for white households is 72 percent. A study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis’ Center for Indian Country Development also found that Native households often face higher mortgage costs when seeking to buy a home, especially when those loans are made on reservation lands. Sens. Smith and Rounds want to leverage the deep community ties of Native Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) to expand access to affordable capital in Native communities and reduce barriers to homeownership.“I’ve had the great privilege of visiting and meeting with Tribal leaders from Minnesota to hear firsthand about how the affordable housing crisis impacts their communities. I’ve heard over and over again about how high mortgage costs and barriers to capital contribute to disparities in homeownership,” said Sen. Smith, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee and Chair of the Housing Subcommittee on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. “I’ve worked with Sen. Rounds on Native housing issues for several years, and I’m glad to have him as a partner on this effort to expand the role Native CDFIs can play in helping families find a safe, stable place to call home. Helping families achieve the dream of homeownership should always be bipartisan.”“For many Americans, home ownership is part of the American dream and a key step toward creating wealth,” said Sen. Rounds. “The USDA Rural Development’s Section 502 Direct Loan program provides home loan assistance to rural families with low or modest income, but this program was failing to reach tribal members in a meaningful way. In order to better serve Native American communities, the USDA launched a 502 lending pilot program in 2018 which partners with Native Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) to help Native American families realize that dream of home ownership. In South Dakota, nearly all the funds from this pilot program have been obligated and are in this process of being repaid. I am introducing legislation with Sen. Smith to permanently reauthorize this pilot program, so even more tribal families in South Dakota can access affordable home loans.”“NAIHC is excited to see efforts to expand the successful USDA relending pilot program that utilizes Native CDFIs to expand homeownership in tribal communities. NAIHC would like to thank Senator Smith, Senator Rounds and all of the cosponsors for their work on tribal housing issues and NAIHC stands ready to help support passage of the Native American Rural Homeownership Improvement Act,” said Adrian Stevens, Acting Chairman of the National American Indian Housing Council.“The 502 Relending Pilot in South Dakota has allowed Four Bands to unlock federal capital to help our clients buy and build the homes of their dreams.  This opportunity has created an unprecedented homeownership demand which is starting to stabilize wealth for generations to come,” said Lakota Vogel, Executive Director of Four Bands Community Fund.Sens. Smith and Rounds’ legislation—the Native American Rural Homeownership Improvement Act—expand an existing U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) pilot program, in which the USDA has partnered with Native Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) to leverage their deep ties in local communities and deploy loans to eligible Native borrowers. The bill, introduced this month, would authorize a national relending program so that Native CDFIs across the country can help increase access to affordable home loans in rural Native communities.You can learn more about the legislation—which is also supported by Sens. John Thune (R-S.D.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) —here and access text of the bill here.Earlier this year, Sen. Smith—in her first hearing as Chair of a key Senate housing panel—highlighted the urgent need for investment in housing for Native Americans in Minnesota and across the country. Sen. Smith, joined at the bipartisan hearing by the Subcommittee’s Ranking Member Sen. Rounds, promised to continue efforts to knock down the systemic barriers that have kept generations of Native Americans from having a safe, stable, and affordable place to live. With the introduction of their Native American Rural Homeownership Improvement Act, Sens. Smith and Rounds are making good on that promise.
Sens. Smith and Rounds’ bill is endorsed by the United Native American Housing Association, National American Indian Housing Council, Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), Native CDFI Network, National Rural Housing Coalition, National Low Income Housing Coalition, South Dakota Native Homeownership Coalition, Rural Community Assistance Corporation (RCAC), Housing Assistance Council, Opportunity Finance Network, Four Bands Community Fund, Mazaska Owecaso Otipi Financial, Great Plains Tribal Chairmen’s Association, National Congress of American Indians, Enterprise Community Partners and Oweesta Corporation.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"

Smith said that today’s testimony will help inform her as infrastructure talks continue. It is important to her that rural voices are included in policy discussions that come before the Senate. This includes conversations about fostering renewable energies as a rural development economic driver.You can watch the hearing footage here. “I start from the perspective that small towns and rural places are entrepreneurial, diverse, wonderful places to work and live and raise a family,” said Sen. Smith in her opening statement. “They produce our food and our energy. They are hubs of manufacturing, small business, education, health care, arts and culture. When I travel to rural communities across Minnesota, I find hardworking, passionate people who love their communities, and are focused on making them even better. My hope for this sub-committee is to highlight these contributions. The Rural Development and Energy sub-committee should lift up and promote the local ideas that are helping communities thrive. Some of the best opportunities and best ideas for building a strong rural economy are in clean energy. Renewable energy is rural energy.  The clean energy transition is the cornerstone to building and sustaining economic vitality in rural communities.” About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"

President,I rise today in celebration, because last night the Senate put us one step closer to finally making Juneteenth a federal holiday. Juneteenth is our nation’s oldest celebration of Emancipation, and it should have been established as a federal holiday long ago. I am so glad that yesterday the Senate passed our bill with Senator Markey, the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, by unanimous consent.The end of slavery in this country is a critical milestone in our history, and Juneteenth should be commemorated nationwide as a day of celebration, reflection, and rededication to the cause of racial justice in this country.I am forever grateful to the generations of activists who made this possible.

Ms. Lee – I’ve been so honored to support your moral cause here in the Senate, and I hope to celebrate Juneteenth as an official federal holiday with you soon.I also want to thank my colleagues – Senator Markey, and Senators Booker and Warnock for their leadership on these efforts, as well as Senator Cornyn and Representative Sheila Jackson Lee for their work to get this over the finish line. When it passed the Senate last night, we had over 60 bipartisan cosponsors, and I am grateful to all of them for their support.Commemorating Juneteenth as a federal holiday is an encouraging and deeply meaningful step – but we have much farther to go on the path towards justice. Let’s use this victory to build momentum for the systemic change we need – like protecting voting rights and safeguarding our democracy, passing meaningful policing and criminal justice reform, pursuing economic and environmental justice, and working towards a more just and equitable world.I know there will be times when that path seems impossibly long, because the scale of the injustice is overwhelming. When that happens, I will think of Ms. Opal Lee – of her long walk to Washington DC, and the joy in her voice when she heard the news that the Senate had taken one more step towards her dream of federally recognizing Juneteenth – and draw inspiration and strength from her example. I am proud to walk this path with her, and with all of you. Let’s keep going. Thank you, I yield the floor.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senators-amy-klobuchar-tina-smith-announce-nearly-1-million-federal-grant-provide-free-textbooks,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [06/14/2021]—U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith (D-Minn.) said today that a nearly $1 million grant will provide free textbooks to students studying teacher education at colleges and universities across Minnesota. The $978,332 grant has been awarded to the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system to support students at Southwest Minnesota State University, St. Cloud State University, Minnesota State University Mankato, Normandale Community College, Century College, and St. Cloud Technical and Community College. The grant aims to diversify the teacher workforce pipeline in Minnesota through eliminating textbook costs and lowering the cost of a teaching degree. The free textbooks will cut costs for all students, but will especially help economically disadvantaged students who may otherwise have trouble affording college and finishing their degree. “As we emerge from the pandemic and face a national teacher shortage, we must eliminate financial barriers for Minnesota’s future educators,” said Sen. Klobuchar. “This program directly responds to students’ financial needs while helping expand our education workforce – a win-win for students and our state.”“When I meet with college students, one thing they talk about is how pricey their textbooks are and how it’s tough to afford them. Sometimes textbooks are so expensive that students don’t purchase them at all, and try to make it work without the needed material,” said Smith. “Open textbooks can make a huge difference. This federal grant will save students money, help bring down the amount of debt that they graduate with, and help diversify our teacher workforce as students prepare to become educators.”“Minnesota State is thrilled to receive a federal open textbook pilot (OTP) grant of nearly $1 million which effectively expands our ongoing development of open educational resources and zero-textbook-cost (“Z”) degrees. With the OTP grant, Minnesota State can have a meaningful impact on the affordability of students pursuing teacher education.  I want to thank Minnesota’s congressional delegation for their leadership and support — this grant will help students across Minnesota for years to come,” said Minnesota State Chancellor Devinder Malhotra. This grant will provide textbooks for six core teacher education courses: Introduction to Education, Foundations of Instruction, Educational Technology, Introduction to Literacy, Introduction to Special Education, and Human Relations and Multicultural Education. It’s estimated that this project will save each teacher education student $500 per year on textbooks.Sen. Smith has successfully secured funding for the Open Textbooks Pilot program in prior appropriations bills with Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Angus King (I-Maine) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.). The Open Textbooks Pilot program is based on the Senators’ Affordable College Textbook Act—a competitive grant program to support the creation and expand the use of open college textbooks. The senators have secured $24 million over the lifetime of the pilot program.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/klobuchar-smith-colleagues-introduce-legislation-extend-tribal-broadband-application-deadline,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Tina Smith (D-MN) joined 13 colleagues in reintroducing the Extending Tribal Broadband Priority Act to expand the Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC’s) 2.5 GHz Rural Tribal Priority Window. This legislation will help Tribal nations apply for spectrum licenses for unassigned spectrum over their own lands – a critical step to expanding broadband access in their communities.   “In 2021, every family in America should have access to high-speed internet, regardless of their zip code,” said Klobuchar. “This legislation is key to eliminating barriers to broadband access for Native communities — an important step forward as we work to bridge the digital divide once and for all.”“We need to expand broadband in Tribal communities because it’s the infrastructure of the 21st century,” said Smith, Indian Affairs Committee member and Rural Development Subcommittee chair. “COVID-19 has made it abundantly clear that reliable internet is necessary for telehealth, distance learning, remote work and more. But right now only 65 percent of Americans living on Tribal lands have access to broadband. This bill aims to close the digital divide by helping Tribal Nations gain spectrum rights and deploy broadband over their Tribal lands. Passing this legislation is one of the many steps we must take to ensure Tribal sovereignty of this natural resource, and help more Tribal communities access affordable, reliable internet service.”The FCC created the 2.5 GHz Rural Tribal Priority Window in 2019 to provide Tribal nations with an opportunity to apply for spectrum licenses over their land. Even when the Window was still open, the FCC received numerous requests to extend the 2.5 GHz Rural Tribal Priority Window for application by no less than 180 days from the original deadline of August 3, 2020. The FCC refused to implement an extension and instead added a limited 30-day application period. The Window expired on September 2, 2020 before many Tribal nations and Native Hawaiian organizations were able to apply–in some cases due to the COVID-19 pandemic – and the FCC declined to extend the deadline any further, in opposition to multiple requests made by Tribal nations, Native Hawaiian organizations, telecommunications groups, and bipartisan Senate and House lawmakers.  The Extending Tribal Broadband Priority Act will require the FCC to open a new 2.5 GHz Rural Tribal Priority Window that lasts at least 180 days, to commence no later than 30 days after the bill is enacted. This bill will give Tribal nations and Native Hawaiian organizations an adequate amount of time to apply for spectrum licenses to deploy much-needed internet services on their lands. Today, the United States scores above the world average for connection rates to fixed broadband services for Americans living off Tribal lands at 92 percent, but only 65 percent of Americans living on Tribal lands have access to these wireless services. This leaves approximately 1.5 million people on reservations without access to basic wireless services. Because Tribal nations and Native Hawaiian organizations cannot access spectrum rights to deploy broadband and telephone networks over their Tribal lands, in some of the most geographically isolated areas in the country, Native Americans continue to suffer from lack of access to life-saving digital services and broadband access that many of us take for granted. This further places Tribal nations and Native Hawaiian organizations behind in the digital divide.The Extending Tribal Broadband Priority Act specifically:· Establishes a new 2.5 GHz Rural Tribal Priority Window;· Requires that the FCC open this new window no later than 30 days after the bill is enacted; and· Creates additional time for Tribal nations and Native Hawaiian organizations to apply for unassigned spectrum licenses over Tribal lands to deploy internet services. The bill has broad support, including from Access Now; AMERIND; AMERIND Critical Infrastructure; Center for Rural Strategies; National Congress of American Indians; National Consumer Law Center; National Hispanic Media Coalition; National Indian Education Association (NIEA); Native American Finance Officers Association (NAFOA); New America’s Open Technology Institute; Public Knowledge; Pueblo of Jemez; Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe; Schools, Health & Libraries Broadband (SHLB) Coalition; Southern California Tribal Chairmen’s Association; USET Sovereignty Protection Fund; and Gigi Sohn, Distinguished Fellow, Georgetown Law Institute for Technology, Law & Policy and Benton Senior Fellow & Public Advocate.This legislation is led by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and co-sponsored by Senators Angus King (I-ME), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), Bernard Sanders (I-VT.), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Gary Peters (D-MI), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Jacky Rosen (D-NV). “Indigenous lands are some of the least connected areas of the U.S., with nearly one-in-five reservation residents lacking reliable internet access at home. The COVID pandemic has highlighted the disparities between the internet haves and have-nots, and has amplified the harm caused by lack of internet access. Without the internet, it is so much harder to get vaccinated, find a job, access education, and more. This legislation would be a major step forward in closing the digital divide in Indigenous communities,” said Willmary Escoto, U.S. Policy Analyst at Access Now. “AMERIND endorses this important legislation for the FCC to establish a new Tribal Priority Window for those Tribal Nations that were unable to acquire a 2.5 GHz license in the prior window.  Tribes need the FCC to work directly with them to provide much needed access to more spectrum and the Extending Tribal Broadband Priority Act of 2021 will accomplish this in 2.5 GHz licensing.  Tribal Nations have been hit hard during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the lack of robust broadband networks has only exacerbated the effects of the long-standing Tribal digital divide on their households, schools, and economies.  Federal legislative efforts that will continue to keep important additional spectrum and broadband infrastructure needs in the forefront are needed throughout Indian Country,” said Geoffrey Blackwell, Chief Strategy Officer and General Counsel at AMERIND.“AMERIND Critical Infrastructure supports and endorses the Extending Tribal Broadband Priority Act of 2021, which directs the FCC to open a new Tribal Priority Window for those Tribes unable to apply during the original window.  The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have disproportionately impacted Tribal governments and Tribal communities, and this bill gives Tribes a fair and equal opportunity to apply for this once-in-a-generation opportunity to obtain a spectrum license,” said Irene Flannery, Director at AMERIND Critical Infrastructure. “Tribal spectrum access is critical to closing the digital divide in Indian Country,” said President Fawn Sharp of the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI). “NCAI’s membership, has longed supported increasing access to spectrum for tribal nations through resolutions: SD-15-037, ‘Urging the Federal Communications Commission to Improve Access to Spectrum Licenses for Tribal Nations’ and MKE-11-007, ‘In Support of a Tribal Priority for the Utilization of Spectrum on Tribal Lands.’ The FCC’s tribal priority window on the 2.5ghz spectrum presented a valuable opportunity in 2020 but unfortunately many eligible Tribal Nations were unable to apply due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We thank Senator Elizabeth Warren for her efforts to ensure Tribal Nations have access to spectrum over their lands by re-opening the FCC’s Tribal Priority Window.” “Tribes deserve a fair shot at this rare opportunity to expand internet access. They shouldn’t have to organize a Day of Action — in the middle of a pandemic, no less — simply to get the FCC to pay attention to a request for adequate time. Congress should pass a law to extend the Tribal Priority Window and give Tribes the respect they deserve,” said Joshua Stager, Deputy Director at New America’s Open Technology Institute.“Broadband is essential, but Tribes are disproportionately left without the ability to connect. Public Knowledge commends Sen. Warren for her work to help close the digital divide on Tribal lands. The FCC provided this laudable opportunity for Tribes to gain access to spectrum to help address the digital divide, but missed an opportunity to achieve that goal by failing to adequately extend the deadline for applying as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty days was not enough. This bill remedies that failure. We look forward to seeing Tribes utilize this spectrum to ensure connectivity for their communities,” said Jenna Leventoff, Senior Policy Counsel at Public Knowledge.“Spectrum over tribal lands, as any other resource, should be owned by the tribes to be used as determined & prioritized by them for the direct benefit of their tribal members,” said Pueblo of Jemez Department of Education. “The 2.5 GHz spectrum can be transformational for Tribal Nations – particularly those in remote areas that providers do not serve, as we’ve seen with the Havasupai Nation. We applaud Senator Warren for working to create additional opportunities for Tribes to access the spectrum on their lands. Passing the Extending Tribal Broadband Priority Act of 2021 would enable Tribal Nations across the country to deploy, own, and operate their own broadband networks, as is their sovereign right,” said John Windhausen, Schools, Health & Libraries Broadband (SHLB) Coalition.“Ownership of spectrum plays a critical role for Tribal Nations in the deployment of urgently needed broadband and other mobile communications services on Tribal lands. For decades, industry has dominated the purchasing of spectrum licenses over our homelands and has either failed to deploy communications services, or charges us exceedingly high service rates for unreliable connectivity. As our nation becomes ever more dependent upon connectivity, including to combat COVID-19 and to maintain our way of life amid lockdowns, the digital divide between Indian Country and other communities throughout America becomes even more stark. With the FCC refusing to honor its obligations to Indian Country, Congress must step up to ensure all Tribal Nations have the opportunity to access spectrum rights over our sovereign territories. USET SPF supports the Extending Tribal Broadband Priority Act, which would expand access to spectrum ownership across Indian Country,” said Chief Kirk Francis, President of the USET Sovereignty Protection Fund. “Senator Warren’s bill rights an egregious wrong of the Trump FCC – refusing to extend adequately the tribal priority window for prime 2.5 GHz spectrum.  Despite the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Indian Country, the FCC gave tribal entities an extension of just 30 days – not nearly enough time to prepare and submit an application to the FCC, especially during a pandemic. The bill creates a new tribal priority window, giving tribal entities a longer and just opportunity to gain access to the public airwaves on tribal land necessary for robust Internet access,” said Gigi Sohn, Distinguished Fellow, Georgetown Law Institute for Technology, Law & Policy/Benton Senior Fellow & Public Advocate. About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"

Tina Smith (D-Minn.) introduced bold legislation to tackle the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs. Sen. Smith’s Affordable Medications Act—supported by 13 of her Senate colleagues—would improve prescription drug transparency, access, innovation and competition to drive down costs for consumers and taxpayers. Sen. Smith, a member of the Senate Health Committee, said that her legislation will increase transparency for drug companies that are setting exorbitant prices and end the restriction that prevents the federal Medicare program from using its buying power to negotiate lower drug prices for its beneficiaries. The Affordable Medications Act will also promote innovation for new drugs and curb monopoly practices that keep prices high and prevent less expensive generics from coming to market.“Addressing the skyrocketing price of prescription drugs is long overdue,”  said Sen. Smith. “For far too long, pharmaceutical companies have been raking in staggering profits while many people in Minnesota and across the country struggle to pay for the medicine they need. My Affordable Medications Act will deliver bold improvements in prescription drug transparency, affordability, innovation and competition to address the root causes of this problem.” “Too many Americans still are forced to choose between paying for the medical treatments they need and other basic necessities,” said Margarida Jorge, Campaign Director for Lower Drug Prices Now. “The Affordable Medications Act is critical legislation that would hold pharmaceutical corporations — the most profitable industry in this country — accountable for rising drug prices, and allows Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices. Congress needs to take advantage of the opportunity they have right now to implement bold reforms that lower prescription drug prices and out-of-pocket costs for all Americans.”   Sen.

[05/27/21]—U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) continued her fight to improve mental health services for students by reintroducing legislation to strengthen school-based mental health services for students in kindergarten through 12th grade. The Mental Health Services for Students Act would help schools partner with local mental health providers to establish on-site mental health services for students. It would also provide training for school personnel on how to recognize, assist and refer students who may need mental health support.Sen. Smith—a member of the Senate Health and Education Committee—said that schools are an ideal setting to identify students who need mental health services and quickly connect them to help. These services are especially important now, as some students have experienced negative mental health symptoms such as loneliness, anxiety, grief and hopelessness during the pandemic.“Providing mental health services health to students at school—where they spend a significant portion of their time—helps them thrive,” said Sen. Smith. “It removes many barriers to access, such as trying to figure out how to leave school in the middle of the day, and promotes behavioral health equity. “There is an acute need for mental health services in schools for our youth,” Sen. Smith continued. “Even before the pandemic hit, young people were experiencing mental health conditions about as often as adults, and roughly 1 in 5 students were experiencing severe mental health issues. The fallout of COVID-19 has only exacerbated this issue.

[05/26/21]—U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) introduced legislation—along with Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.)—to expand access to mental health services for low-income families and children, the elderly and people living with disabilities. The Medicaid Bump Act would increase the federal reimbursement rate for mental and behavioral health care services under Medicaid. A House companion bill was introduced by U.S. Representatives Paul D. Tonko (D-NY-20) and David Trone (D-MD-6).  Right now, behavioral health providers—including adolescent and pediatric specialists—are often reimbursed by Medicaid at low rates. Furthermore, there is a shortage of behavioral health providers, particularly in rural and underserved communities. These barriers contribute to inequities in access to mental and behavioral health care services for thousands of Americans.“When I experienced depression, resources were there for me. But right now, too many people don’t have access to the mental or behavioral health care they need,” said Sen. Smith. “This bill will improve equity in access to mental and behavioral health care by helping low-income families, the elderly, and people living with disabilities access resources. I want anyone suffering from a mental health issue to know they are not alone. We can all help break the stigma by talking about it, and then we have to go to work to get people the services they need.”“The COVID-19 crisis has shown a spotlight on the urgent and continuing need to fund comprehensive community mental health and addiction services,” said Sen. Stabenow. “We should treat health care above the neck the same way we treat health care below the neck. Senator Smith and I introduced this bill to help close the gap in services and help people get the care they need.”“This past year has had a negative impact on people’s mental health. We’ve seen an increase in depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation,” said Sue Abderholden, Executive Director of NAMI MN, “Our mental health system does not have the resources to respond because of the low reimbursement rates for behavioral health providers. Increasing the federal Medicaid match will provide additional funds to our mental health system at a time when we are facing workforce shortages. These dollars will help attract more providers and expand services to meet the increased needs of our communities.”“We are in the midst of an unprecedented mental health crisis among our youth, not only in Minnesota, but nationwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has only worsened the situation,” said Dr. Marc Gorelick, President and CEO of Children’s Minnesota. “We need to champion the health needs of kids in our community by making sure that behavioral and mental health services are accessible to everyone, regardless of their insurance status. With Medicaid as the number one insurer of kids, this legislation will help ensure that all children receive the care they so desperately need.” Sen. Smith’s Medicaid Bump Act of 2021 would address these problems by creating a financial incentive to increase State Medicaid spending on behavioral health services. Specifically, this bill would:The Medicaid Bump Act of 2021 is supported by is supported by RI International, Inc., American Psychological Association, the Kennedy Forum, NAMI, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, National Association for Behavioral Healthcare, National Association for Children’s Behavioral Health, NAADAC: the Association for Addiction Professionals, International OCD Foundation, The Psychotherapy Action Network Advocacy, American Association on Health and Disability, Lakeshore Foundation, American Nurses Association, National Association of Social Workers, National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, National League for Nursing, NAMI MN, Children’s MN, Fraser, Minnesota Association of Community Health Centers, Minnesota Association of Community Mental Health Programs, Hennepin Healthcare, Northwestern Mental Health Center, and Allina Health.You can read a summary of the bill here.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"

[5/20/21]—This afternoon, U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) released the following statement in response to President Biden signing an executive order addressing climate-related financial risks. Among other things, the order directed the Department of Labor to review harmful limits imposed by the Trump Administration that prevented the consideration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors by workplace retirement plans. “I’m pleased to see President Biden is taking bold action to address climate risk to the financial system.  It’s critical that financial regulators and the federal budget take into account the risks of climate change.  In addition, I’m especially glad that the President is directing the Department of Labor to review burdensome and unnecessary rules imposed last year that limit employers from offering the sustainable investing options that many workers are seeking in their retirement plans.  Earlier today, I introduced legislation that complements the President’s actions.  My bill is aimed at making sure workplace retirement plans are able to offer sustainable investment options to workers across the country,” said Sen. Smith, a member of the Senate Banking Committee. “As I’ve said before, sustainable investment options are good for retirees and good for our environment—that’s a win-win. I’m glad President Biden understands that, and I’m pleased to be a partner in these efforts.”Prior to President Biden’s announcement, Sens. Smith (D-Minn.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and U.S. Representative Suzan DelBene (D-WA 1) on Thursday introduced legislation in the Senate and House to provide legal certainty to workplace retirement plans that choose to consider environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in their investment decisions or offer ESG investment options.You can access a summary of the bill—the Financial Factors in Selecting Retirement Plan Investment Act—here, text of the bill here, and read more about the legislation here.

https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senators-tina-smith-patty-murray-us-representative-suzan-delbene-unveil-legislation-support,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [5/20/21]—Today, U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and U.S. Representative Suzan DelBene (D-WA 1) introduced legislation in the Senate and House to provide legal certainty to workplace retirement plans that choose to consider environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in their investment decisions or offer ESG investment options.Despite considerable demand for sustainable investment options, relatively few workplace retirement plans, such as pensions and 401(k) plans, take sustainable investing principles into account in their investment decisions or provide sustainable investment options to workers. One of the primary issues hindering plans that want to offer sustainable investment options is an uncertain and regularly changing legal environment. Sustainable investing was further discouraged by a Department of Labor (DOL) rule under former President Trump that imposed new limits on the consideration of ESG factors by workplace retirement plans. With their Financial Factors in Selecting Retirement Plan Investment Act, Sens. Smith, Murray and Rep. DelBene want Congress to provide the legal certainty needed to reverse course and promote sustainable plans.“Sustainable investment options are good for retirees and good for our environment—that’s a win-win,” said Sen. Smith, a member of the Senate Banking Committee. “We’re putting forth this legislation because we know there’s a growing demand for sustainable investing, and because we believe Congress should act now to provide the legal certainty necessary to make sure workplace retirement plans are able to offer these options to workers across the country.”“Americans deserve a secure retirement and ESG investments are a key component in accomplishing that goal,” said Congresswoman DelBene. “This bill promises retirees a pathway not only to reach that secure retirement but a pathway to live in a world worth retiring in.”“Retirement security is all about planning for the future—and you can’t truly do that if you aren’t able to consider the environmental, social, and governance factors that will shape the future. Allowing this approach isn’t just common sense, it’s a win for workers, retirees, investors, businesses, communities, the environment, and more,” said Sen. Murray, chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. “That’s why Senator Smith, Congresswoman DelBene, and I are introducing legislation to make sure people are able to invest in a future that’s not only more financially secure for their family, but more just, diverse, and sustainable for everyone.”What Supporting Organizations Say About the Bill“SIFMA believes it is important for financial institutions to be able to consider all factors, including ESG factors, as part of an investment and risk management strategy. ESG factors should continue to be valid considerations for investment decisions – including for qualified default investment alternatives (QDIAs) and their components – so long as they are evaluated in a manner consistent with a prudent process. We strongly believe the focus should be on the prudence of the analysis, as opposed to the particulars of the investments. SIFMA commends Chair Murray and Senator Smith for their engagement on this important issue and look forward to working with the committee towards final passage,” said SIFMA President and CEO Kenneth E. Bentsen Jr.“The bill makes clear that environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria may be considered in ERISA-governed retirement plans and will end the policy pendulum of regulatory interpretations on this issue at the Department of Labor (DOL),” said Lisa Woll, CEO of US SIF: The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment.“ESG risk analysis is an important part of prudent investing. We support the Financial Factors in Selecting Retirement Plan Investments Act because it would help mainstream the use of this analysis as part of retirement plan investment selection, benefiting participants,” said Aron Szapiro, Head of Policy Research at Morningstar, Inc.“Retirement plan sponsors and participants deserve the freedom to choose the 401(k) investments that best suits their needs.  This legislation allows the ESG investments to be included on a 401(k) menu consistent with a normal fiduciary process without artificial and unnecessary barriers that are inconsistent with fundamental principles of ERISA,” said Brian Graff, Chief Executive Officer of the American Retirement Association.“CFA Institute is pleased to support the Financial Factors in Selecting Retirement Plan Investments Act. Integration of all material factors, including material ESG factors is an important part of the analytical and investment decision-making process, regardless of investment style, asset class, or investment approach; and one that extends to the exercise of shareholder rights and proxy voting. The legislation helps to address the confusion created by one of the Department of Labor rules (RIN 1210–AB95) finalized last year and clarifies that integrating ESG factors in the financial evaluation and management of plan investments can be consistent with ERISA fiduciary obligations.” said Kurt Schacht, Head of Advocacy, Americas, CFA Institute.“The Financial Factors in Selecting Retirement Plan Investments Act proposal would require fiduciaries to primarily consider investment returns, but also allow them to incorporate ESG factors both as a source of potential investment returns and as a tie-breaker when deciding between two otherwise equivalent investments. We believe this is an appropriate framework, as it allows fiduciaries to incorporate ESG factors into their investment decisions, including those that apply to the qualified default investment alternative (QDIA), while still prioritizing the obligation of fiduciaries to seek investment returns for beneficiaries,” said Catherine Reilly, Director of Retirement Solutions at Smart.You can access a letter of support from State Street Global Advisors here, a summary of the bill here and text of the bill here.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"

The Credit Union Employee and Member Safety Act of 2021 would simplify the expulsion process for credit union members who engage in unacceptable, sometimes dangerous behavior, while preventing unfair expulsions. Minnesota credit unions have shared stories of members who have robbed credit unions, smashed ATMs, and sexually harassed tellers. Despite this unacceptable behavior, it can be difficult for credit unions to expel these members. That is because current law requires the credit union to call a vote of membership to expel a member, even when the member has been in engaged in egregious conduct. Sens. Smith and Sasse’s bill would fix this problem by allowing federal credit unions to expel members for violations of credit union policies without requiring a vote of membership. The bill is based on bipartisan legislation that was passed unanimously by the Minnesota legislature several years ago. The Credit Union Employee and Member Safety Act of 2021 would apply the Minnesota legislation to federally chartered credit unions. “It’s unacceptable that Minnesota credit union employees have had to endure harassment, theft, or violence by members,” said Sen. Smith. “Right now, expelling members who seek to harm credit unions and their employees is a time consuming and burdensome process, leaving staff, members and the credit union itself at risk of further harm. The Minnesota legislature voted unanimously to fix this problem for state-chartered credit unions in 2018, and my bipartisan legislation would take what we’ve learned in Minnesota and apply it to credit unions that are federally chartered.”“Nebraska’s credit union employees should feel safe and comfortable clocking in every day and members should feel safe doing their banking,” said Sen. Sasse. “These employees perform important services across the state and ought to be able to do their jobs unimpeded. This bill provides a much needed update to the federal credit union charter and I am glad to have worked with Senator Smith on this bill.”“This bill is an important update of the federal credit union charter and prioritizes the safety of credit union members and the staff that serve them,” said Mark Cummins, President and CEO of the Minnesota Credit Union Network. “We appreciate Senator Smith’s commitment to strengthening the security of Minnesota credit unions.”“The safety and security of credit union employees and credit union members is paramount to Nebraska’s credit unions and therefore we strongly support the Credit Union Employee and Member Safety Act and urge its passage,” said Scott Sullivan, President and CEO of the Nebraska Credit Union League. “Nebraska credit unions thank our United States Senator Ben Sasse for his commitment to the safety of credit union employees and their members.” “NAFCU applauds Senators Tina Smith and Ben Sasse for introducing legislation that will bolster consumer protections at credit unions to defend their employees and their members from abusive, fraudulent, and criminal activity,” said Dan Berger, President and CEO of the National Association of Federal Credit Unions. “Ensuring credit unions have the ability to address illegal activity or threatening behavior at their institutions is paramount so they can continue to safely and soundly serve their members and local communities. NAFCU strongly supports this bipartisan bill, and we will continue to advocate for Congress to pass these important reforms.”  “We thank Sens. Smith and Sasse for their bipartisan bill that would modernize the Federal Credit Union Act to support staff and member safety,” said Jim Nussle, President and CEO of the Credit Union National Association. “We look forward to working with them to advance this bipartisan legislation so that we can bring credit union governance into the 21st century.”You can access bill text here.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senators-tina-smith-and-lindsey-graham-introduce-bipartisan-bill-help-students-develop-workforce,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [5/19/21]—Today, U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) introduced a bipartisan bill to help prepare young people for jobs and boost their economic potential. The Youth Workforce Readiness Act, also supported by Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), would create partnerships between afterschool providers and businesses to help students develop essential workforce readiness skills—like critical thinking and decision making—and learn about different career paths.Right now, many young people in Minnesota, South Carolina and across America are concerned about whether they have the skills necessary to secure a job in the future. This lack of adequate workforce readiness also leads to negative economic effects for employers, who often cite challenges in finding well-prepared talent as an obstacle to growth. The Youth Workforce Readiness Act would help solve this problem by supporting programs that allow youth to gain skills and connect them to real-life work experiences.“I hear from young people about their hopes for the future, which include contributing to their communities and getting good jobs. And I hear from employers that they need help getting connected to great employees. That’s where afterschool and out-of-school time providers can play a role in helping young people gain skills and make connections to mentors, opportunities and local employers,” said Sen. Smith, a member of the Senate Education Committee. “My bipartisan bill would help support youth success by teaching young people about different career paths and workforce readiness skills.”“Preparing our kids to successfully contribute to our economy helps keep America strong,” said Sen. Graham. “A well-educated, well-trained workforce is a key component to future economic development. This legislation is great news for South Carolina and an important investment in the future of our nation.”“Moving our economy forward begins with one of our greatest assets – our hard-working, resilient young people,” said Sen. Collins. “This bipartisan bill would create meaningful partnerships between afterschool providers and businesses to help young people strengthen critical skills, explore different career paths, and prepare for a lifetime of success.”“Young people deserve every opportunity to succeed, including more options to build workforce readiness,” said Sen. Wyden. “Allowing youngsters to gain critical thinking and decision making skills through partnerships with afterschool care providers and local businesses is a commonsense step to help bolster the economic success of the next generation. Not to mention local businesses will have their choice of the cream of the crop once the students enter the workforce. The Youth Workforce Readiness Act will help young Oregonians and youth around the country secure their bright futures.”“The Boys & Girls Clubs of the Twin Cities thanks Senator Smith for her commitment to changing the lives and future opportunities for the youth in our state and around the country,” said Terryl Brumm, CEO Boys & Girls Clubs of the Twin Cities. “This bill is an investment in a transformational and effective program model that will support achievement of essential skill-building starting at an early age when we at Boys & Girls Clubs know we can make a difference. Even throughout this pandemic, we’ve seen firsthand that providing a safe environment where young people are engaged and challenged to build and practice essential skills, ensures that they can reach their full potential and are well prepared to enter the workforce strengthening the economy today and into the future.”The Youth Workforce Readiness Act of 2021 will support programs that provide youth with:The House companion of the Youth Workforce Readiness Act of 2021 is led by Representatives Josh Harder (D-CA 10), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA 1), Mark Pocan (D-WI 02) and Lisa McClain (R-MI 10).You can read a summary of the bill here.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"

[5/17/21]—U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and U.S. Representative Angie Craig (D-MN 2) recently introduced companion legislation in the Senate and House to expand school-business partnerships, which would help ensure a future workforce that is trained for the jobs employers are creating.Many employers struggle to find qualified workers across several industries, including advanced manufacturing, agriculture, information technology and health care. According to workforce studies, almost two-thirds of the millions of jobs that will need to be filled in the U.S. will require at least some post-secondary education. Schools and employers are already building programs and partnerships like those outlined in Sen. Smith and Rep. Craig’s 21st Century Workforce Partnerships Act of 2021 to equip students with the skills needed to secure these jobs, but the lawmakers recognize that the need warrants greater federal investments to support these programs.“Workforce partnerships give students the opportunity to develop the skills they need for jobs that are available right now—often without taking on huge amounts of debt. For example: many good-paying jobs in areas like advanced manufacturing, agriculture, IT and health care don’t require an expensive 4-year degree.” said Sen. Smith, a member of the Senate Education Committee. “But what I’ve learned is that oftentimes, students aren’t aware of—or don’t have access to—local programs that provide the training these jobs require. Our bill aims to fix this issue by expanding partnerships between secondary schools, community and technical colleges and local businesses. We know these partnerships work, and our goal is to make sure they work for more Minnesotans and Americans.”
“Especially in the wake of the COVID-19 public health and economic crisis, which cost our nation millions of jobs, apprenticeship programs and manufacturing degrees are more important than ever – offering Minnesotans like my own son, Josh, the skills they need to land a good-paying job,” said Rep. Craig. “I’m proud to work with my friend and colleague, Senator Tina Smith, on this critical bill to expand partnerships between schools and local businesses to fill Minnesota’s job gap, set students up for success and build back better.”

Smith, Chair of the Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. “Emergency rental assistance has been a priority of mine since the beginning of the pandemic because we know that without a safe, affordable place to live, it’s nearly impossible to stay healthy and financially stable. We also know that COVID-19 has not been the great equalizer. It’s exacerbated the challenges that many low-income communities and communities of color already face. I look forward to working with Minnesota leaders to keep working to provide emergency housing assistance and address the affordable housing crisis.”“Our field partners have been a tremendous asset in helping Minnesota families work through the application for assistance,” said Minnesota Housing Commissioner Jennifer Leimaile Ho. “We’re grateful for their helping getting families the help they need, providing the peace of mind that their housing costs will be covered. We know property managers and owners are counting on us, too.” In December 2020, Sen. Smith  helped pass a bipartisan relief package that secured funding for RentHelpMN.  This program delivers rental assistance to people in Minnesota who are having trouble paying rent or utility bills due to the economic downfall from COVID-19. Sen. Smith says that said that an estimated 53,000 Minnesota households are behind on their rent by an average of almost $3,000.  The groups joining the discussion were American Indian Community Housing Organization, the Latino Economic Development Center, the New American Development Center, Pillsbury United Communities and the United Community Action Program.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senators-smith-murkowski-introduce-bipartisan-bill-expand-mental-health-care-workforce-areas,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [5/12/21]—Today, during Mental Health Awareness Month, U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) introduced their bipartisan legislation which would repay up to $250,000 in eligible student loan repayment for mental health professionals who work in mental health professional shortage areas. U.S. Representatives John Katko (R-NY 24) and Grace Napolitano (D-CA 32) introduced companion legislation in the House.Sen. Smith has shared her own mental health journey from the Senate floor—and again last week as part of Mental Health Awareness Month—in hopes of breaking the stigma around mental health and working to expand access so Americans get the help they need.“I’ve shared my own story with depression because I want anyone suffering from a mental health issue to know they are not alone. We can all help break the stigma around talking about this, but de-stigmatizing and de-mystifying mental illness is just the beginning. We have to make sure mental health resources are available to everyone,” said Sen. Smith, a member of the Senate Health Committee. “We need to pass our bipartisan bill to help close the holes in the net we build to catch people when they fall and need help.”“The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a drastic rise in mental health and substance use disorders. Already widespread and growing mental health workforce shortages are now being felt even more across the nation, with a disproportionate strain on rural communities. Over a third of Alaskan residents are living in a designated mental health provider shortage area—this is a cause for real concern,” said Sen. Murkowski. “Building on my long-standing efforts to help recruit and retain qualified health care professionals to serve in rural communities, I’m joining Senator Smith in introducing legislation to help expand the mental health workforce. Our hope is that providing loan forgiveness for those who are willing to help fill the gaps in underserved areas will help lead to a stronger, more effective mental health care system.”Right now, over 120 million Americans live in areas with a shortage of mental health professionals. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) estimates that by 2025, there will be a shortage of over 250,000 mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, mental health and substance abuse social workers, clinical and school psychologists, and school counselors.Sens. Smith and Murkowski recognize that this shortage is not felt equally across the country—rural communities are much more likely to have a shortage of mental health professionals than urban areas. People of color are also more likely to live in areas with mental health professional shortages and to report challenges accessing culturally competent care. Sens. Smith and Murkowski’s bipartisan bill aims to address this by expanding the mental health care workforce in areas with the greatest need.The Mental Health Professionals Workforce Shortage Loan Repayment Act would:• Repay up to $250,000 in eligible student loan repayment for mental health professionals who work in mental health professional shortage areas; and• Repay one-sixth of the individual’s eligible loans for each year of service.You can access a list of supporting organizations and a summary of the bill here.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"

These funds will address stormwater runoff pollution from land into the Great Lakes. “Lake Superior is the world’s largest fresh water lake, playing a critically-important role in our state’s character and economy by connecting Minnesota’s people and goods to the world,” said Smith. “These grants are important because they will help ensure the lake’s water quality remains healthy and vibrant by restoring vegetation near the lake, and reducing phosphorus runoff from nearby agricultural land. The grants could also fund projects to install green infrastructure in shoreline communities, such as permeable pavement. I’ll keep working to direct federal dollars towards restoration efforts on Lake Superior and its surrounding watersheds.”“The Great Lakes are a national treasure and vital to the economy and environment in Minnesota and our entire country,” said Klobuchar. “We are grateful that this funding is available thanks to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. As one of the vice-chairs of the Great Lakes Task Force, I look forward to continuing our important work to protect the Great Lakes for generations to come.”The GLRI Grants are broken into three categories:State and interstate agencies, federally recognized Indian tribes and tribal organizations, local governments, institutions of higher learning and non-profit organizations are eligible to apply for the GLRI grants. The deadline for applications to be submitted at Grants.gov is August 20, 2021. As one of the vice-chairs of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, Klobuchar is a leading advocate for the protection of the Great Lakes. She has worked to bolster pollution clean-up efforts in the Great Lakes, prevent diversions of Great Lakes water out of the region, and establish new water conservation and environmental protection standards in the Great Lakes area. Since its inception, the GLRI has tripled the successful cleanup and delisting of areas of concern throughout the country, reduced phosphorus runoff and the threat of harmful algal blooms, controlled and stopped the advancement of invasive species, and restored wildlife habitat over thousands of miles of rivers and waterways. Since 2010, the GLRI has provided more than $2.5 billion to fund 4,706 projects throughout the Great Lakes region.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/following-letter-klobuchar-smith-and-craig-usda-announces-additional-coronavirus-relief-funding,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Tina Smith (D-MN), members of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, and Representative Angie Craig (D-MN) announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will offer additional aid to agricultural producers and businesses as part of its Pandemic Assistance for Producers Initiative. This announcement follows a letter from the legislators calling on the agency to expedite relief payments to farmers, livestock producers, biofuel processors, and timber harvesters and haulers.“The coronavirus pandemic brought unprecedented challenges for the entire agriculture industry and many rural communities across Minnesota,” said Klobuchar. “Agricultural producers and businesses are the backbone of our economy, and we must ensure they have the resources they need to keep our supply chain strong and competitive. By getting this relief out in a timely manner, we are doing just that.”“Minnesota farmers, businesses, small towns and rural areas were all hit hard by the pandemic,” said Smith. “This funding will help farmers, ranchers, foresters, biofuel processors and businesses rebuild after facing more than a year of serious challenges during COVID. From addressing supply chain disruptions to market volatility, this funding is important to the rebuilding effort. I’ll keep working to direct much-needed federal relief to Minnesota communities.”“As we continue to recover from the COVID-19 public health and economic crisis, it’s absolutely vital that we give Minnesota’s agricultural producers the support they need to grow and succeed in 2021 and beyond,” said Craig. “I’m thrilled that these additional funds will soon be out the door – helping family farmers and businesses in rural America build a stronger and more resilient food system for years to come.”Within the next 60 days, the funding below will be distributed:Klobuchar and Smith have been leaders in supporting agricultural and rural communities throughout the pandemic. In April 2020, the Senators successfully called on the Trump administration to make farmers eligible for federal small business support. Additionally, in May 2020 they sent a letter to Leaders Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) urging them to consider including provisions to authorize programs and funding for the USDA to assist the domestic poultry industry in legislation addressing the impact of the pandemic. In September 2020, Klobuchar and Smith sent a letter asking the USDA to clarify why farmers were denied access to critical relief and the data being used to determine eligibility for Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP). And in December 2020, Klobuchar successfully pushed for relief for livestock producers to be included in the bipartisan year-end agreement before announcing in May that additional turkey growers who experienced pandemic-related revenue losses in 2020 were eligible to apply for payments through CFAP.Smith also introduced legislation to secure aid for independent turkey farmers who were left out of past COVID-19 relief packages. Despite suffering losses, independent turkey farmers were not given access to previous COVID-19 relief programs for agriculture. Sen. Smith directed the USDA to include independent turkey farmers in future aid programs. Smith also led a bipartisan push to help pork producers after the pandemic shut down meat processing plants and restaurants and dried up billions of dollars in demand for their products.Klobuchar has also been a leader in supporting biofuel producers. In May 2020, she introduced the Renewable Fuel Feedstock Reimbursement Act with Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) to support biofuel producers negatively affected by the pandemic. In December 2020, Klobuchar successfully included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act explicit authority to USDA to make relief payments to producers of advanced biofuel, biomass-based diesel, cellulosic biofuel, conventional biofuel, or renewable fuels with market losses due to the coronavirus pandemic, based on Klobuchar’s Renewable Fuel Feedstock Reimbursement Act with Grassley. In March 2021, she and Grassley led a letter urging Tom Vilsack, Secretary of the USDA, to use the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and other resources to aid the nation’s biofuel industry.Smith has also long fought for a strong RFS, both in Washington and during her time as Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota. In March 2020, as the coronavirus caused ethanol prices to drop to record lows, Smith pushed President Trump to support the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), pressure that helped lead to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) not to appeal a unanimous decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals concerning small refinery exemptions. Smith is also a cosponsor of the bipartisan Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senator-tina-smith-calls-supreme-court-decision-renewable-fuels-very-disappointing-potential,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [7/1/21]—U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) called the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent decision that makes it easier for oil refineries to get waivers to avoid meeting Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requirements “very disappointing,” saying it could set back efforts in rural America to recover from recent economic blows.The vote overturned a 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruling that cracked down on the abuse of small refinery economic hardship waivers. During the Trump Administration, the granting of these waivers spiked by over 300 percent, which led to a steep drop in corn used for ethanol production. “I want Minnesota’s rural communities, farmers, clean energy producers, and agribusinesses to thrive,” said Sen. Smith. “A strong Renewable Fuel Standard is key to jobs and economic development across rural America.  I’m very disappointed by the Supreme Court’s decision—it’s the last thing farm country needs, especially since we were just seeing communities recover after taking successive blows from COVID-19, low commodity prices, trade disruptions and inclement weather. I’m going to urge the Biden Administration to champion a strong RFS for America’s farmers and biofuels industry.”Sen. Smith has long fought for a strong RFS, both in Washington and during her time as Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota. In the Senate Sen. Smith pressed top energy and agriculture officials in the Trump Administration to end policies that reduce the amounts of corn-based ethanol and other renewable fuels that are blended into the nation’s gasoline supply. Sen. Smith also led a 2019 letter pressing then-EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler to stop abusing oil refinery waivers, pointing out that the granting of waivers had increased by 370 percent compared to the previous administration, with “small refinery” waivers going to large oil companies for the first time. Later, Sen. Smith joined several colleagues in submitting testimony for the Congressional Record calling for an end to waiver abuse. Sen. Smith and some of her colleagues sent a letter this year to EPA Administrator Regan asking him to uphold the Renewable Volume Obligations and not give exemptions to the blending requirements for small refineries. Sen. Smith is also a cosponsor of the bipartisan Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act. About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-sens-smith-cramer-reps-pallone-ruiz-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-increase-mental-behavioral,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [07/1/2021]—U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) and Representatives Frank Pallone (D-N.J.-06) and Raul Ruiz, M.D. (D-Calif.-36) introduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation to help Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities, Tribal health programs and urban Indian health organizations address mental and behavioral health needs in their communities.Right now, only 39 percent of IHS facilities provide 24-hour mental health crisis intervention services, and 10 percent of IHS facilities do not provide any crisis intervention services at all. A survey conducted by IHS found that Tribes rated the expansion of inpatient and outpatient mental health and substance abuse facilities as their number one priority. The Native Behavioral Health Access Improvement Act would address this problem by creating a Special Behavioral Health Program within IHS to provide flexible funds that can be used to develop culturally-appropriate methods and solutions aimed at prevention, treatment and recovery. “Before the pandemic, American Indians and Alaska Native communities were already disproportionately impacted by mental and behavioral health challenges due to historical trauma, discrimination, decades of underinvestment in Indian Health Service and more,” said Sen. Smith, member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. “COVID-19 has only exacerbated this problem. We need to make sure all Native communities, in Tribal and urban areas, have adequate resources to provide culturally-appropriate prevention, treatment and recovery care.  I want anyone suffering from a mental or behavioral health issue to know they are not alone. We can all help break the stigma by talking about it, and then we have to go to work to get people the services they need.” “Tribes have long worked to address mental and behavioral health issues in Native American communities, yet a majority of Indian Health Service facilities do not provide sufficient mental health services,” said Sen. Cramer. “Our bipartisan legislation would address this disparity by creating a program to give communities flexible funds so they can provide these important services in a tailored, effective way.”“Far too many tribal communities lack proper access to mental and behavioral health care services,” said Rep. Pallone, Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “Unfortunately, these disparities have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has dramatically increased the need for mental health care services across the country.  The Native Behavioral Health Access Improvement Act will provide tribal communities and care providers with the resources and support necessary to develop readily accessible and culturally appropriate mental health care services. I look forward to working with Senators Smith and Cramer and Congressman Ruiz to get this critical legislation passed and signed into law.”“Tribal communities across the nation face increasingly stark health disparities, and the federal government has a long way to go to improve health care and fulfill their trust responsibility to Native populations,” said Dr. Ruiz. “I am honored to work with Chairman Pallone to introduce this bipartisan legislation that will directly invest in a Tribal public health framework and create a special program to address the behavioral health crisis. I am determined to bring health equity to Tribes.”    “We are grateful for Senator Smith’s leadership and recognition of behavioral health needs among Native people,” said Francys Crevier, CEO of the National Council of Urban Indian Health. “This bipartisan legislation is essential for the 70% of Native people that reside in urban areas as access to high quality, culturally-competent behavioral health services have become even more critical over the last year with the pandemic’s devastating effects on Indian Country. We are thankful for the Senator’s inclusion of health care providers to Native people residing in urban areas in this vital program, which represents an important step towards addressing the behavioral health disparities in Indian Country. We look forward to continuing to work with the bipartisan cosponsors of this critical initiative.” “Tribal Nations and our citizens continue to face high rates of behavioral health issues, caused by myriad factors, including centuries of generational trauma resulting from colonization and hostile acts of the United States government,” said Chief Kirk Francis, President of the United South and Eastern Tribes Sovereignty Protection Fund (USET SPF). “And yet, we continue to lack substantial and sustained funding to address these challenges for current and future generations. As the collective trauma of living through the COVID-19 public health crisis only exacerbates and intensifies these issues, it is critical that Tribal Nations are equipped with the resources necessary to bring healing and recovery to our communities. USET SPF strongly supports the creation of a Special Behavioral Health Program for Indians and looks forward to working with the bill’s sponsors on ensuring that Tribal Nations will have full self-governance authority under the program, in accordance with trust and treaty obligations.”This legislation is also supported by Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Ben Ray Luján (R-N.M.), Sen. Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The Native Behavioral Health Access Improvement Act is endorsed by the National Indian Health Board (NIHB), National Council of Urban Indian Health (NCUIH), National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) and United South and Eastern Tribes, Inc.You can read a summary of the bill here and bill text here.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"

[6/29/21]—U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.) are leading a bipartisan group of their colleagues in calling on leaders of the Senate Health Committee—on which they serve—to continue the series of important and productive conversations on COVID-19 by holding a hearing to examine global vaccine production and distribution.“We are at a moment now when expanding worldwide access to vaccines is central to controlling this virus and dangerous variants. The pandemic is not over anywhere, until it is over everywhere, and global herd immunity is achieved,” wrote the senators to Chair Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Ranking Member Richard Burr (R-N.C.). “This is a moral and humanitarian issue also central to U.S. economic and security issues. We urge you to convene a hearing to examine global vaccine production and distribution, continuing this series of productive and important discussions on COVID-19.”Sens. Smith and Cassidy—along with Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska)—say that a public Senate Health Committee hearing should include federal officials, supply chain experts, and vaccine manufacturers to improve transparency of the global supply chain.In addition, a hearing could help determine how Congress and the Biden Administration should take steps to address any supply chain barriers to efficient global vaccine distribution. This is an opportunity for the United States to be a leader in building global capacity to manufacture and distribute COVID-19 vaccines.You can access the letter here or below:Dear Chair Murray and Ranking Member Burr:Thank you for your leadership in holding multiple hearings examining the federal response to COVID-19. These discussions have provided critical perspective and insight to address multiple aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are at a moment now when expanding worldwide access to vaccines is central to controlling this virus and dangerous variants. The pandemic is not over anywhere, until it is over everywhere, and global herd immunity is achieved. This is a moral and humanitarian issue also central to U.S. economic and security issues. We urge you to convene a hearing to examine global vaccine production and distribution, continuing this series of productive and important discussions on COVID-19.It is estimated that 11 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses are needed to vaccinate 70% of the global population and reach herd immunity.1 So far, only 2.62 billion doses have been administered globally. There is a need to ramp up COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing and distribution, but there is a lack of transparency about how best to expand the global supply of vaccines and address central issues, including global supply chains for vaccines and the materials needed to produce them. Furthermore, some countries simply lack the public health infrastructure to move vaccines into arms, much less manufacture them.To expand global supply, experts are recommending that the United States and other wealthy nations donate many more COVID-19 vaccines and additional funding to COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX). President Biden recently announced that his Administration will donate 583 million COVID-19 vaccines via COVAX and bilateral agreements. At its June meeting, the G-7 pledged to donate 870 million doses to developing countries in order to end the pandemic by 2022. These are significant and welcome developments.However, the United States and its global partners should take additional steps to expand global vaccine supply and distribution, and experts are offering advice the HELP Committee should discuss. For example, to ramp up the manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines, experts believe the United States should take a leadership role to expand access to raw materials necessary to produce COVID-19 vaccines, including by retrofitting, expanding, and constructing new manufacturing facilities. In addition, some recommend that the U.S. assist in transferring vaccine manufacturing technology so more countries can produce COVID-19 vaccines. Finally, policy experts recommend our nation should help develop or share the skilled workforce needed to manufacture these complex biological products.Aside from assessing the steps we should take, the HELP Committee should consider how to improve visibility into the global COVID-19 vaccine supply chain. Currently, there is a lack of transparency into the global governing structure for how supplies are distributed and no clear view into how decisions are made to put aside production of one life-saving drug for another. Specifically, there is little visibility into the President’s use of the Defense Production Act (DPA) to export raw materials to other countries and a lack of data on overall supply chain gaps. In addition, it is unclear whether federal agencies have sufficient funding and the authorizations they need to provide materials and technical assistance abroad, and whether they need additional direction from Congress to prioritize global COVID-19 vaccination efforts.A public hearing in the HELP Committee with federal officials, supply chain experts, and vaccine manufacturers can help improve transparency of the global supply chain. This hearing can also help us determine what specific steps Congress and the Biden Administration need to take in the short-term and long-term to address any supply chain barriers to efficient global vaccine distribution. Finally, this hearing can help us ascertain the role and opportunity the United States has in building global capacity to manufacture and distribute COVID-19 vaccines.We urge you to conduct a hearing on global COVID-19 vaccine distribution and stand ready to assist in any way possible to advance such a hearing. Thank you for your consideration of our request.Sincerely,About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-sen-tina-smith-us-rep-abigail-spanberger-push-improve-popular-effective-rural-energy-america,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [6/24/21]—Today, U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger (D-VA 7)—along with U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and Representative David G. Valadao (R-CA 21)—introduced legislation in both the Senate and House aimed at improving the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), which provides financial assistance to agricultural producers and rural business owners to install renewable energy systems and adopt energy efficiency measures.
 Sen. Smith and Rep. Spanberger, who each chair a subcommittee that oversees rural energy efficiency, said that in the last six years, REAP has leveraged over $300 million in public investment to stimulate more than ten times that amount in private investment, and has delivered over $4 billion in energy efficiency and renewable energy projects for rural America. Demand for the program chronically far outstrips available funds, and Sen. Smith and Rep. Spanberger understand that the REAP program can be an important tool for meeting climate goals.“Renewable energy is rural energy. The clean energy transition is key to improving and sustaining economic vitality in rural communities. We need new clean energy programs, but we also need to get more from our existing programs,” said Sen. Smith. “Take REAP for example. We know this is a popular and effective program, which is why I’m glad to partner with Rep. Spanberger to introduce this bill to improve and increase funding for REAP. The Energy Title of the Farm Bill incentivizes farmers to install renewable energy systems on their farms, and REAP is the flagship of the Energy Title. I’m also pushing for programs like REAP to play a part in the climate and infrastructure package that we must pass this summer.”“As Chair of the House Agriculture Committee’s Conservation and Forestry Subcommittee, I remain committed to finding new ways to protect the health of our land while also improving farmers’ bottom lines. In this moment marked by the rising threat of climate change and extreme weather conditions, we should take commonsense steps to provide family farms across our country with greater opportunities to build on their existing efforts to combat the climate crisis,” said Rep. Spanberger. “I’m proud to help lead this bipartisan, bicameral effort to strengthen support for our farmers and producers through the REAP program. The REAP Improvement Act would reduce the financial burdens faced by farmers, producers, and rural small businesses as they make smart investments in clean energy, energy storage, and other cutting-edge technologies — and it would significantly cut down the existing backlog of REAP projects at USDA. I would like to thank Senator Smith for her leadership on this issue in the U.S. Senate, and I look forward to making sure our rural producers and communities are not left behind as we build a healthier climate and invest in a strong economy in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.”“Farming and ranching communities should be supported and empowered to be on the front line of deploying clean, renewable energy and energy efficiency in our transition to a clean energy economy. This legislation will provide opportunities for New Mexico farmers and ranchers, including those experiencing drought, to make up for needed revenues,” said Sen. Luján. “I look forward to working with Senator Smith and Representative Spanberger to advance this legislation for our rural communities.”“As a lifelong dairy farmer, I believe we must act as responsible stewards of our environment, and the farming community is actively implementing technology to do just that,” said Rep. Valadao. “I’m proud to introduce the REAP Improvement Act with Representative Abigail Spanberger. This bill would  make significant reforms to improve USDA’s Rural Energy for America Program. This legislation would help more farmers and producers voluntarily take advantage of this program that helps them invest in clean energy and energy efficiency.”On Tuesday, Sen. Smith chaired a rural development subcommittee hearing where energy leaders from Minnesota and across the country discussed REAP and other opportunities to expand the nation’s use of renewable energy to create jobs and economic development in rural America. In 2018, Sen. Smith led the Agricultural Energy Programs Reauthorization Act, portions of which were incorporated into the Farm Bill, and she leads an annual Senate bipartisan appropriations request letter for the energy title programs, including REAP.Sen. Smith and Rep. Spanberger’s Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) improvement Act of 2021 would:You can access a summary of the legislation here and a section-by-section for the bill here.

https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-sens-smith-cassidy-say-fda-approval-first-generic-insulin-will-lower-prices-across-country,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [7/29/21]—U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.) have long pushed to bring lower-cost insulin to market, and today the senators highlighted the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval of the first generic insulin product that will rein in costs after years of significant increases. Wednesday’s approval by the FDA is due in part to Sens. Smith and Cassidy’s bipartisan bill—the Protecting Access to Biosimilars Act—enacted in 2019.“We know that high insulin prices are jeopardizing the financial security of Minnesotans and Americans, and forcing some into alarming, and at times fatal, rationing,” said Sen. Smith, a member of the Senate Health Committee and the Senate Diabetes Caucus. “For the millions of people in the United States who rely on insulin, the medication is not a choice; it’s a matter of survival. We introduced our bipartisan bill to promote competition and make sure lower-cost insulin comes to market sooner rather than later. And now, we are seeing that what we set out to do is happening. This is a win for all the people in Minnesota and across the country who raised their voices and said that patients should be able to afford the medication they need to live.”“There are heartbreaking stories of people forced to ration their expensive insulin who ultimately went into a diabetic coma or even died. We begin to address this by making insulin more affordable. Generic insulin will help make this happen. This is a great step forward for patients,” said Dr. Cassidy.In December of 2018, the FDA issued guidance for transitioning insulin from being classified as drugs to biosimilars—which are medical products that are almost an exact copy of a product originally manufactured by a brand-name company. The guidance provided a number of useful clarifications regarding the new drug approval pathway for biosimilar products, and issued clarification on the transition to prevent evergreening (when brand-name companies patent slight changes of old drugs and call them new drugs in order to control the market) and other tricks companies use to extend their exclusivity period.Sens. Smith and Cassidy’s legislation made sure this guidance stayed in place. And now, the FDA has determined that a lower-cost insulin product is biosimilar to another brand-name insulin product. This means that patients can purchase the lower-cost option without needing a separate prescription, similar to how pharmacies substitute generics for other, pricier prescription drugs.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senators-tina-smith-john-thune-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-allow-emergency-haying-during,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [7/28/21]—With severe and worsening drought causing Upper Midwest cattle producers to run out of hay for their herds, U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and John Thune (R-S.D.) introduced bipartisan legislation to allow future emergency haying on federal Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land. Right now, emergency haying on CRP land is not allowed until after the primary nesting season, which ends August 1 in Minnesota, South Dakota and North Dakota. The Senators’ CRP Flexibility Act would give the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) the tools to allow emergency haying on CRP acres before August 1 when certain conditions are met and in consultation with the state conservation experts. U.S. Reps. Angie Craig (D-MN 2) and Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) introduced a House companion bill. U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and four other Minnesota House members support the legislation.“Right now over 70 percent of Minnesota is experiencing a severe drought and it’s quickly worsening with the current hot weather,” said Sen. Smith. “This is devastating for our cattle producers, who are running out of hay to feed their herds. When severe droughts hit, the USDA should have the tools to allow farmers to access reserve land for haying. This will lessen the impact on the farm economy.”“Unfortunately, almost every acre of South Dakota is currently experiencing drought, and we need to make sure USDA has the flexibility to improve producers’ access to greatly needed forage for their livestock during these difficult times,” said Sen. Thune. “As a longtime supporter of the Conservation Reserve Program, I’m pleased to introduce this commonsense measure to help producers meet their forage needs during weather-related emergencies. This legislation would build on my effort to increase CRP enrollment, which significantly benefits conservation efforts and wildlife habitat in our state.” “Severe drought conditions in Minnesota and across the country are impacting farmers and ranchers who were just beginning to recover from the COVID-19 public health and economic crisis,” said Rep. Craig. “Today, I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing bipartisan, bicameral legislation to ensure USDA can create flexibility for farmers and ranchers, expand drought relief and protect our ag community during this difficult time.”“The drought across the upper Midwest has created incredibly difficult conditions for Minnesota’s farmers and livestock producers,” said Sen. Klobuchar. “By authorizing emergency haying of Conservation Reserve Program lands, we are taking an important step to help farmers and ranchers feed their herds throughout droughts.” Sens. Smith and Thune’s legislation is also co-sponsored by Sens. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.) and Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.). Rep. Craig and Johnson’s bill is also supported by Reps.

https://www.smith.senate.gov/us-senator-tina-smith-calls-major-league-baseball-private-equity-firm-end-offshoring-jobs-china,"WASHINGTON, D.C. [7/24/21]—U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) today told Major League Baseball (MLB) Commissioner Rob Manfred and the owner of the San Diego Padres that all Americans should be outraged by their plans to close a major employer in rural Caledonia, Minn. The closure is expected to eliminate approximately 80 jobs in the community, with many of them moving offshore to China. In a strongly worded letter Saturday, Sen. Smith demanded MLB and Siedler Equity Partners reverse their decision to close Miken Sports’ Caledonia manufacturing facility, a long-time employer that produces baseball helmets for the MLB and non-wood bats for other baseball and softball players across the country. Miken is jointly-owned by the MLB and Seidler Equity Partners. Seidler Equity Partners Co-Founder and Managing Director Peter Seidler also owns the San Diego Padres baseball team.“Caledonia has a population of about 2,800 and will face significant hardship from the loss of Miken’s jobs and community contributions,” Sen. Smith wrote. “Adding to my outrage is the fact that you will reportedly be moving Miken’s bat production to China, which flies in the face of MLB’s status as an iconic American sports league. I strongly urge you to reverse the planned closure of the Miken Sports production facility in Caledonia and instead commit to making long-term investments in the plant.”Sen. Smith pointed out that Major League teams, including the Padres, have benefited from billions in taxpayer stadium subsidies, and that MLB has long benefitted from an exemption from federal anti-trust law and from relaxed overtime rules.“In exchange for these taxpayer-funded benefits and special exemptions, Americans should be able to count on MLB to, at a minimum, avoid being complicit in the offshoring of U.S. jobs to China,” Sen. Smith wrote. “Unfortunately, MLB, in concert with Seidler Equity Partners, appears to be more focused on its bottom line than on honoring any commitments to American workers.”You can read Sen.

Marina del Rey, CA 90292Dear Commissioner Manfred, Mr. Seidler, Mr. Seidler, and Mr. Kutsenda,I write to express my outrage and concern about the impending closure of Miken Sports’s Caledonia, Minnesota facility.  The Caledonia plant produces baseball helmets for Major League Baseball (MLB) players, as well as non-wood bats for a variety of baseball and softball leagues.  The facility closure is expected to cause the layoffs of about 80 workers and the elimination of one of the largest employers in the small, rural city of Caledonia.  Caledonia has a population of about 2,800 and will face significant hardship from the loss of Miken’s jobs and community contributions.  Adding to my outrage is the fact that you will reportedly be moving Miken’s bat production to China, which flies in the face of MLB’s status as an iconic American sports league.  I strongly urge you to reverse the planned closure of the Miken Sports production facility in Caledonia and instead commit to making long-term investments in the plant.Major League Baseball and its teams, including the San Diego Padres, have benefitted from billions of dollars in state and local stadium subsidies, as well as federal tax breaks on stadium bonds.  Further, MLB has long benefitted from an exemption from federal anti-trust law, and recently lobbied for a special carve-out from federal overtime rules that was ultimately tucked in a 2018 government funding bill.  In exchange for these taxpayer-funded benefits and special exemptions, Americans should be able to count on MLB to, at a minimum, avoid being complicit in the offshoring of U.S. jobs to China.  Unfortunately, MLB, in concert with Seidler Equity Partners, appears to be more focused on its bottom line than on honoring any commitments to American workers.The closure of the Miken manufacturing plant will leave the Caledonia community without a key employer and economic contributor.  Further, it will erase a key point of pride for the local community, who are proud of Miken’s role producing the helmets that have been used by MLB players to stay safe for years.   Despite the dedication of Miken’s workers, you are closing the Caledonia plant in an apparent effort to squeeze an extra $4 million to $10 million in profit from your recent acquisition of another equipment manufacturer, Easton Diamond Sports, by offshoring bat production from Caledonia to Easton’s factory in China.  This type of transaction, in which wealthy private equity investors buy longstanding U.S. companies only to shut down American plants and move jobs overseas has left countless Midwest communities devastated while wealthy private equity investors – disconnected from the effects of their profit-driven decisions – reap a larger and larger share of our country’s income and wealth.  It’s time that this practice comes to an end.Americans should be outraged by your decision to close Miken’s Caledonia baseball and softball equipment plant and move jobs to China.  I urge you to promptly reverse this action. Sincerely,###About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"

I strongly encourage all those eligible to take advantage of this program.”“Minnesota livestock and poultry producers were hit hard when the pandemic dried up billions of dollars in demand for products,” said Smith. “The cost of humanely depopulating herds was another economic blow during an already difficult time. This funding heeds the bipartisan call I led to help producers who were forced to reduce population numbers. I encourage Minnesotans who are eligible for this funding to apply, and I’ll keep working to help Minnesota farmers and ranchers recover from the pandemic.”All livestock and poultry producers who suffered depopulation losses between March 31 and December 26, 2020 as a result of insufficient processing access are eligible to apply. Eligible producers will receive 80 percent of the cost of the livestock or poultry and the cost of depopulation and disposal.Klobuchar and Smith have been leaders in supporting agricultural and rural communities throughout the pandemic. In April 2020, the Senators worked to ensure farmers would be eligible for federal small business support and urged Leaders Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Charles Schumer (D-NY) to include provisions authorizing programs and funding for the USDA to assist the domestic poultry industry in any legislation to address the impact of the pandemic. The Senators also successfully pushed to include relief for livestock producers in the bipartisan coronavirus relief bill in December 2020. In May 2021, Klobuchar announced that turkey producers who experienced pandemic related losses would be eligible for additional relief through USDA programs. And when COVID-19 shut down plants and caused an animal welfare crisis due to overcrowding, Smith led a bipartisan Senate push to help pork producers humanely depopulate herds to prevent animal suffering.About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
https://www.smith.senate.gov/collins-smith-announce-200-million-now-available-help-loggers-timber-haulers-facing-covid-19,"Washington, D.C. — U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Tina Smith (D-MN) announced that $200 million is now available for logging and log hauling businesses that have been seriously impacted by the pandemic.  Eligible members of the logging industry can apply on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) website HERE.The funding was provided through the Loggers Relief Act, which Senators Collins and Smith co-authored last year.  They secured $200 million for logger relief in the final COVID-19 relief package that was signed into law in December.Following the bill’s passage, the Senators led efforts to push USDA to expedite the distribution of this funding.  In February, Senators Collins and Smith led a group of 9 of their colleagues in writing to Acting USDA Secretary Kevin Shea to urge him to swiftly disburse the logger relief funding.  Senator Collins also raised this issue at an Appropriations hearing with Secretary Vilsack last month.“Throughout Maine’s history, our forest products industry has supported good-paying jobs, driven local economies, and strengthened rural communities,” said Senator Collins.  “Loggers were already facing significant headwinds due to a changing 21st century economy and unfair trade practices, as well as the explosion at the Androscoggin Mill in Jay and the shutdown of the #9 paper machine and biomass boiler at Sappi in Westbrook.  COVID-19 only compounded these challenges.  That’s why I worked to secure $200 million in the COVID-19 emergency relief package to provide critical financial assistance to the skilled professionals who work in this industry to help them get through this difficult period.  I am pleased that, following our advocacy, this much-needed support for Maine’s family logging and log hauling businesses is now on the way.”“The timber industry in Minnesota and across the country was hurting even before the pandemic, and the COVID crisis reduced timber demand even further, forcing many loggers to shut down or greatly reduce operations,” said Senator Smith. “Simply put, Minnesota loggers told me they needed help, and we worked together to develop the Loggers Relief Act. This will help sustain jobs in an important industry. I know better days are ahead for the timber industry in Minnesota and across the country.” Paper mills drastically slashed output or shut down their operations altogether during the pandemic – which the American Loggers Council estimates caused a reduction of $1.83 billion (or 13 percent) in the value of logger-delivered wood. Timber harvesting and hauling businesses are eligible to apply for the $200 million available in relief funding if they experienced at least a 10 percent loss in revenue from January 1, 2020, through December 2020, as compared to the same timeframe in 2019. These direct payments will be equal to 10 percent of their gross revenue from 2019, with the funds to be used for operating expenses, including payroll. About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"

Smith’s measure to require public health programs and private insurers to cover the cost of coronavirus tests. The law also protects the uninsured from being charged. Despite the prohibition against testing charges, Americans are continuing to get surprise testing bills that can exceed thousands of dollars, she said.On Wednesday, Sen. Smith introduced her Stop COVID-19 Test Surprise Medical Bills Act to clarify that all testing should be covered, and providers should be stopped from billing or holding patients liable for the cost of a test regardless of their insurance status. “No American who needs a test should be stuck with a surprise bill when they get one. Testing is a key tool in our fight to end this pandemic. These surprise bills are not only costly, but they may discourage people from getting tested in the first place,” said Sen. Smith. “My bill clarifies that COVID-19 tests are free for everyone, and holds accountable those who are flouting the law by charging patients or price-gouging COVID-19 tests.”Sen. Smith said an analysis by the New York Times found that individuals are being charged up to $2,718 for “out-of-network” tests and related office visits, and 2.4 percent of COVID-19 tests result in some charges being passed on to patients. Senator Smith’s bill would address this problem by:About TinaServicesIssuesNewsContact"
