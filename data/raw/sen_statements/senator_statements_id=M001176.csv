http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-daines-introduce-legislation-providing-specialized-wildland-firefighting-training-to-civilian-conservation-center-students,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley along with Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) introduced the bipartisan Civilian Conservation Center Enhancement Act. This bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture and the Department of Interior to offer specialized training, specifically wildland firefighter training, to Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center students.“Every year, our wildfire risk grows as climate chaos intensifies the danger—and it’s scary to think that we might not have enough wildland firefighters to keep on top of this growing risk,” said Senator Merkley.“That’s where Civilian Conservation Centers can play such an important role in training new firefighters and helping get more folks into the hiring pipeline. In Oregon, these facilities not only make our communities safer by reducing the risk of wildfires, but also provide valuable job training for at-risk youth in rural areas. I look forward to working with Senator Daines to ensure these centers, students, and programs are supported to bolster public health and foster meaningful job opportunities.”“Montana Job Corps Centers help train and prepare young Montanans to enter the workforce,” said Senator Daines. “These centers play an irreplaceable role in our communities especially as the threat of wildfires grow and the forestry sector continues to face labor shortages. Expanding the forestry curriculum, supporting these centers, and ensuring students have a pipeline to long-term careers will help create more job opportunities for young Montanans and protect our communities.”This bipartisan bill would direct the agencies to offer specialized wildland firefighter training to students at Civilian Conservation Centers and create a pipeline into careers fighting fires and caring for our public lands. It would a set a goal for each federal agency to hire 300 students a year and provides a direct hire authority specific to CCC graduates to expedite that process. It would create a pilot program to use CCC student to address the lack of workforce housing for wildland firefighters.The legislation builds on the bipartisan momentum to increase the utilization of this program to address the concerning shortage of wildland firefighters at federal agencies. Senator Merkley and Senator Daines led a bipartisan letter last month urging Secretaries of the Department of Labor, Department of Agriculture, and Department of the Interior make great use of Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers (CCCs) as part of the solution to the shortage of wildland firefighters. The letter highlighted concerns about the current wildfire season and called attention to the need to meet wildland firefighter and wood products workforce development, recruitment, and retention challenges to better position this critical workforce to prevent and respond to wildfire events.In 2019, Senator Merkley and Senator Daines were leaders in a bipartisan effort to save the Job Corps CCC program when it was targeted for termination under the Trump administration.Final bill text can be found here.A one page summary of the bill can be found here.###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/in-the-news/senator-merkley-introduces-wildfire-smoke-mitigation-legislation,"U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley has introduced two bills intended
to mitigate the effects of wildfire smoke. Today, the Smoke-Ready Communities
Act and the Smoke Planning and Research Act received a hearing in front of the Environment and
Public Works committee.Dr. Cassandra Moseley, a U of O professor in the Institute
for a Sustainable Environment, spoke to the committee, saying “Wildfire smoke
is rapidly increasing public health risk, affecting not only rural communities
that are located near these fires, but increasingly in major urban centers
hundreds or even thousands of miles away. Households and individuals need to be
prepared to act quickly when smoke arrives, and yet many lack the information
about the practical steps they can take to keep themselves safe.”Moseley identified five ways the bills address public health
risk. Among them were looking into the root causes of wildfires, improving
smoke monitoring and forecasting, and creating clean air shelters."

These awards are intended to help states and tribes provide businesses with technical assistance to help develop and adopt practices to prevent or reduce pollution before it is created, while reducing business and liability costs.“When you turn on the tap or open your window, you deserve to know that the water and air aren’t going to compromise your health,” said Merkley. “This federal award will help provide financial support for crucial pollution prevention measures around Oregon. I look forward to seeing our businesses, families, and communities benefit from these projects.”“Clean air and clean water are essential for communities throughout Oregon to thrive,” Wyden said. “I’m gratified our state has secured this federal investment to prevent pollution and build an even stronger and healthier quality of life for Oregonians.”Oregon’s funded award will allow the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to deliver technical assistance on the following projects:The funds will also allow The Oregon DEQ to Conduct on-site, P2 technical assistance assessments in order to enhance Oregon’s EcoBiz certification program and support a regional green chemistry collaboration initiative.###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-joins-lujan-matsui-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-increase-digital-equity-inclusion-and-literacy,"Washington D.C. – Today, Oregon's U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley, joined Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and U.S. Representative Doris Matsui (D-Calif.) along with Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) to introduce the Digital Equity Foundation Act, legislation to establish a nonprofit foundation to leverage public and private investments to make progress closing the divide on digital equity, digital inclusion, and digital literacy. The Foundation will supplement the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and the Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC) work to award grants, support research, provide training and education, engage with stakeholders, collect data, and promote policies to improve digital equity outcomes. The Foundation will be run by a Board of experts specializing in the fields of digital equity, technology, and telecommunications, and will represent diverse communities throughout the U.S.Congressionally-established nonprofit foundations have had great success in supporting the missions of various government agencies, including NIH, FDA, and NPS, and provide a mechanism to leverage public-private partnerships and support innovation. As the NTIA works to implement the broadband programs in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and connect our country, the Digital Equity Foundation will be vital to ensuring the most vulnerable communities have the knowledge and skills to take full advantage of these new connections.“As our world rapidly shifts online, Americans must be equipped with the knowledge and skills to use technology properly and successfully,” said Senator Luján, Chair of the Subcommittee on Communications, Media, and Broadband. “That’s why I’m introducing legislation that creates a long-term solution to close the divide on digital equity by launching a nonprofit foundation to award funding, support research, and provide technology training and education to communities in need. Critically, this legislation also ensures the decision makers will consist of experts that reflect the diverse communities that are in need of these investments, who will work closely with federal agencies to support and uplift digital equity-focused programs.”“Regardless of age, zip code, or income level, Americans need to be able to get online. Yet for too long the digital divide has left millions of American families without a path to succeed in the 21st century economy,” said Congresswoman Matsui. “Closing the digital divide will require a comprehensive approach that addresses the many factors leaving families without internet access. By introducing the Digital Equity Foundation Act, we’re establishing a powerful new tool grounded in equity and laser focused on promoting economic mobility for communities in need. This legislation will jumpstart us down the road to lasting digital equity and inclusion nationwide.”“I have been a longtime supporter of digital equity and ensuring all individuals, families, and businesses have access to affordable and reliable internet and broadband services wherever they live,” said Senator Merkley. “The ongoing pandemic highlights just how important equitable access to internet and digital services are for all of our communities. This bill would mean better access to broadband and internet-enabled devices, and that means better, stronger, more connected communities.”“New Mexico students deserve a future that is as bright as they are. We can achieve that goal by creating equal access to broadband opportunities,” said Senator Heinrich. “Access to high-speed internet is also key to bringing telehealth services and economic development opportunities to rural communities. I’m proud that we secured major investments in the Infrastructure Law to help build out broadband infrastructure all across New Mexico, but we don’t have to stop there. That’s why I’m proud to cosponsor this legislation that would put together a Foundation for Digital Equity to continue seeking ways to make broadband access more equitable and affordable for every single American.”“The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that access to devices and internet connectivity is the cost of entry to participate in the modern economy and keep in touch with family and friends,” said Senator Markey. “Millions of people, however, still lack those essential tools. The Digital Equity Foundation Act is a critical step towards bridging this digital divide and ensuring that everyone has access to affordable information and communication technologies. I am proud to support this legislation.”“This measure will help communities across the country bridge the digital divide and close the homework gap. Access to dependable, affordable broadband and online services is essential to ensuring students, businesses, and families have the tools to succeed. Our legislation is an important step in addressing our nation’s disparities in broadband access and countering the connectivity gaps exacerbated by the pandemic,” said Senator Blumenthal.“We commend Senator Luján and Representative Matsui for recognizing that without sustained investments in digital adoption and inclusion efforts at the community level, the huge new investments in broadband infrastructure and affordability won’t close the digital divide. A Digital Equity Foundation dedicated to this work and, if possible, funded by future spectrum auctions, will provide a sustainable way to tackle this part of the digital divide,” said Michael Calabrese, Director, Wireless Future Project at New America, Open Technology Institute at New America.“Digital literacy, digital skills training, and access to devices -- these are some of the barriers to broadband adoption that Sen. Luján and Rep. Matsui’s Digital Equity Foundation Act of 2022 would address. This bill would use a portion of funds raised through spectrum auctions to fund resources at the local level to support schoolchildren, older adults, and others who need devices and training so that all generations have the essential tools to fully participate in our society. We thank Sen. Luján and Rep. Matsui for their leadership on this effort and look forward to working to get the Digital Equity Foundation Act of 2022 enacted this year,” said Greg Guice, Director of Government Affairs, Public Knowledge. This legislation is supported by The Schools, Health & Libraries Broadband (SHLB) Coalition; National Digital Inclusion Alliance; American Library Association; Public Knowledge; Open Technology Institute at New America; United Church of Christ Media Justice Ministry, Common Cause, and National Consumer Law Center; Center for Rural Strategies; Common Sense; and the National Hispanic Media Coalition.Full text of the bill is available HERE.

http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-merkley-tillis-team-up-with-reps-blunt-rochester-young-kim-introduce-the-bipartisan-national-nursing-workforce-center-act,"WASHINGTON – Today, Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley, along with Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC), teamed up with Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE-AL) and Congresswoman Young Kim (R-CA-39) to introduce the National Nursing Workforce Center Act. The bipartisan and bicameral National Nursing Workforce Center Act would establish a 3-year pilot program through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to support state-based nursing workforce centers. The legislation would also broaden HRSA’s authority to establish Health Workforce Research Centers on any program under the Public Health Service Act and give HRSA clear authority to establish a nursing focused research and technical assistance center under the Health Workforce Research Center Program.“As the husband of a nurse, I know just how important nurses are to patients, and how their support and advocacy can make a world of difference at some of the most difficult and joyous moments of people's lives,” said Senator Merkley. “This bill will help establish and support local nursing initiatives and workforce centers across the country—like the one we already have here in Oregon—to apply a local approach to the current nursing workforce crisis. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get this bipartisan bill passed.”“Nurses play a crucial role in providing accessible, high-quality care to Americans. Resolving existing nursing workforce challenges, which have been compounded by the pandemic, the increased demand for health care services, and the aging workforce, requires innovative approaches that support and strengthen every aspect of the nursing workforce pipeline,” said Senator Tillis. “I’m proud to co-introduce the bipartisan National Nursing Workforce Center Act that will enhance collaboration and coordination, enabling state and local experts to identify and address unique challenges to increase the resiliency of the nursing workforce.”“The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated a nation-wide shortage of healthcare workers including registered nurses. As an integral part of our healthcare system, we must do all we can to support the recruiting and retention of nurses across the country – the quality of care depends on it,” said Rep. Blunt Rochester. “That’s why I am proud to introduce the National Nursing Workforce Center Act, a bipartisan & bicameral piece of legislation that will create a pilot program to establish state-based nursing workforce centers to focus on the education and training of nurses. This legislation provides a tangible solution to the ongoing nurse shortage while supporting our current nursing workforce and I’m hopeful Congress will work to pass this legislation as quickly as possible.”“Our nurses went above and beyond to care for Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic and are now suffering from burnout, exhaustion and unsustainable schedules due to the nursing workforce shortage. Nurses play a vital role in protecting public health and deserve our full support,” said Rep. Young Kim. “The National Nursing Workforce Center Act will take important, targeted steps to help stabilize and strengthen our nursing workforce. I am proud to work with Rep. Blunt Rochester and Senators Tillis and Merkley on this bipartisan, bicameral effort and will always stand with our heroes in nursing and the patients they support.”“Nursing workforce centers, like the Oregon Center for Nursing, are critical to informing policy-makers, educators, and employers on nursing workforce issues specific to individual states. They provide on-the-ground expertise interpreting national and state-level nursing workforce data, and recommending specific solutions for local communities. The National Nursing Workforce Center Act will help states implement and strengthen nursing workforce centers, creating a rich tapestry of experts committed to making long-term, meaningful solutions to nursing workforce issues. The need for this act is essential, especially in these times of nursing workforce instability.” – Jana Bitton, MPA, Executive Director, Oregon Center for Nursing“The National Forum of State Nursing Workforce Centers is excited about the introduction of the National Nursing Workforce Center Act. This will provide critical funding to support and solidify the foundation of existing nursing workforce centers while providing funding for states without a center to create one. This act would provide technical assistance to smaller and new nursing workforce centers and build a strong network of experts on state-level nursing workforce issues and solutions.  Nursing workforce centers serve as hubs to advance nursing education, practice, leadership, and workforce development at state and local levels using data-driven approaches.” – Lanelle Weems, President, National Forum of State Nursing Workforce Centers“The Delaware Nurses Association applauds the development and introduction of the National Nursing Workforce Center Act of 2022. Our nation has experienced cyclical nursing workforce challenges for decades, none as pronounced and impactful as today’s challenges. Our nation’s nurses, and those served by us, need enhanced leadership and support to understand and transform our workforce challenges. Nurses remain the largest sector of the nation’s licensed health care workforce and the most trusted, as rated by Americans for over 20 years. The National Nursing Workforce Center Act of 2022 is a novel and innovative approach to creating new and better support for existing state nursing workforce centers that generate impact. With the structure and support provided by this legislation, state nursing workforce centers in the pilot program will be the collaborating, coordinating, leading and impactful entities in their states to stabilize, diversify and grow the nursing workforce.” – Christopher E. Otto, MSN, RN, CHFN, PCCN, CCRN, Executive Director, Delaware Nurses Association The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated a national shortage of registered nurses, making it critical that policymakers invest in all segments of the nursing workforce: from education and training to retention and leadership development. An important component of this is also having complete, national, standardized data to understand where public policy can help alleviate these shortages. An estimated 500,000 nurses plan to leave the bedside by the end of 2022—creating a shortage of 1.1 million nurses—just as the population of older people, who may require more medical services for complex medical conditions, begins to increase dramatically.The National Nursing Workforce Center Act would help address the shortage by:A one-pager of the bill can be found here.   ###"

University (OSU) will receive more than $180,000 in federal funds to research
and develop management strategies for the fusarium canker fungus killing
hops in Oregon, Washington and Idaho.“Since 98% of U.S.
hops are grown right here in the Pacific Northwest, Oregon State University’s
topnotch researchers are well-positioned to provide key insights into how to
manage the growing threat this fungus poses,” Wyden said. “I am gratified to see these dollars go
toward protecting hops production, as Oregon’s thriving hop production and
brewing industries are key players in our state’s job creation, economic growth
and tourism.” “If you like beer,
you should love this grant,” said Senator Merkley. “Oregon’s thriving hops industry supports
brewers large and small here in Oregon and across the nation and is a strong
driver of Oregon’s economy. I look forward to seeing how OSU uses this funding
to study the fungus that is threatening hop crops to help protect this vital
industry for our state and beyond.” A fungus called fusarium canker has been an
increasingly greater threat to hop production in Oregon, Idaho, and Washington,
which produce 98% of U.S. hops. OSU will use the $182,633
in federal funds to study the fungus in order to manage its spread in commercial
yards and propagative rootstock material. Researchers will work with hop
producers to reduce the fusarium canker threat for U.S. hop production
in the Pacific Northwest.

http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-joins-kaine-and-sanders-in-senate-resolution-in-support-of-brazilian-democracy-urging-free-fair-and-peaceful-elections-in-october,"WASHINGTON, D.C. —Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley joined Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA), the Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), along with Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to unveil a resolution supporting democratic institutions in Brazil. The introduction comes on the Independence Day of Brazil and amid efforts by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to preemptively reject Brazil’s national election results and sow mistrust and spread misinformation regarding next month’s presidential election in the country, where current polls project he will lose re-election.The resolution is being led in the U.S. House of Representatives by Representatives Jamie Raskin (MD-08), Raúl M. Grijalva (AZ-03), and Sara Jacobs (CA-53).“The United States and Brazil are two of the largest democracies in the Western Hemisphere. At a time when democracy is under attack in Brazil, America, and in countries around the world, we have a duty to stand up for peoples’ fundamental right to shape their futures by having a voice in their government, without fear of political violence or retribution,” said Senator Kaine. “This resolution sends a powerful message that Congress is committed to linking arms with the people of Brazil in that effort and that we will not be silent in the face of any attempts to undermine Brazil’s electoral system.”“It is absolutely imperative that the U.S. Senate make it clear through this resolution that we support democracy in Brazil,” said Senator Sanders. “It would be unacceptable for the United States to recognize a government that came to power undemocratically, and it would send a horrific message to the entire world. The United States should make it clear that we support the democratic process, and it’s important for the people of Brazil to know we’re on their side, on the side of democracy.”“A peaceful transfer of power is integral to a strong democracy,” said Senator Merkley. “But Brazil’s Independence Day celebrations today, amid tension and polarization, underscore just how fragile democracy is and the sustained efforts that are required to preserve it. The U.S. must condemn any and all attempts to incite political violence and intimidation to ensure Brazil’s electoral processes remain free and fair.”“This resolution recognizes the importance of strengthening democracy in Brazil. Our measure is a call to action to preserve Brazil’s democratic institutions,” said Blumenthal.“The fate of Brazil’s democracy, which is under daily attack by President Bolsonaro, and of U.S. relations with Brazil, will be decided in the upcoming election.  The Biden Administration must make it unequivocally clear that the costs of subverting a free and fair election will be immediate and severe,” said Senator Leahy.“As the people of Brazil prepare to vote this fall, right-wing forces are trying to undermine the integrity of the electoral system and poison the process with authoritarian rhetoric that echoes the violent incitement we heard in America before January 6,” said Congressman Raskin. “This bicameral resolution insists that the upcoming elections in Brazil be free and fair, transparent and peaceful. Democracy is under attack around the world, and we must vigorously defend it everywhere against autocracy, insurrection and disinformation.”“As Brazil’s elections approach, we continue to call on all individuals seeking office to uphold the values of democracy and endorse free, fair, credible, transparent and peaceful elections. Anything less is unacceptable,” said Congressman Grijalva.“The United States is stronger and safer when our values align with our support to foreign governments,” said Congresswoman Jacobs. “I’ve been increasingly alarmed by the rise of authoritarianism in the U.S., Brazil, and around the world that threatens human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. With Brazilians heading to the polls in less than a month to elect their new president, there are legitimate fears that President Jair Bolsonaro may refuse to step down if he loses. This bicameral resolution is critical and draws an important line: the United States should not formally recognize or provide military aid to an illegitimate government.”Brazilians have sounded the alarm over troubling signs of democratic backsliding in the country, including attacks from government officials on the country’s democratic institutions and rule of law; the kidnapping and murder of advocates and journalists; unfounded attacks on the country’s voting system; and a dramatic increase in violence directed at Brazilian political leaders.In response, the resolution urges the Government of Brazil to ensure that the upcoming presidential election is conducted in a free, fair, credible, transparent, and peaceful manner that enables all citizens of Brazil to exercise the right to vote. Additionally, the resolution calls for the United States Government to continue to speak out against efforts to incite political violence and undermine the electoral process in Brazil, and to review and reconsider its relationship with any government that comes to power in Brazil through undemocratic means.Full text of the resolution is available here.###"

I won’t stop fighting to ensure the state’s world-class agriculture sector has what it needs to continue to grow and thrive.”“Oregon’s farmers grow world-renowned crops, and this federal investment helps elevate that bounty of fruits, vegetables, nuts and more to even higher levels of success,” Wyden said. “I’m glad our state has earned these grants that support agriculture continuing to generate jobs throughout Oregon while producing nutritious and tasty food. And I’ll keep battling to secure similar federal resources that provide opportunities for state farmers to do what they do best – grow quality crops.”These SCBGP awards will be used to fund projects that support the specialty crop industry by enhancing food safety, investing in specialty crop research, including research to focus on conservation and environmental outcomes, developing new and improved seed varieties and specialty crops, and improving strategies for pest and disease control.A list of funded Oregon Department of Agriculture projects can be found below:###"

As the legal process moves forward, the Senators pressed the health insurance industry to abide by current law to provide medication and ancillary services without charge.“It has been brought to our attention that enrollees in your members’ health plans continue to be charged for necessary medications and ancillary services—including provider consultations and laboratory services—contrary to law and additional federal guidance issued by the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Treasury,” wrote the Senators. “We write to express our deep concern with these erroneous and unlawful charges, and to request additional information on steps that AHIP is taking to ensure that its members adhere to federal law and ensure the PrEP drugs and the full scope of PrEP ancillary services are offered without charge to enrollees.”A 2019 ruling by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) gave PrEP an “A” rating as prevention intervention for people at risk of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This ruling brought PrEP under section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, which requires insurance coverage for services or interventions that have been given an ““A” or “B” rating from the USPSTF.Subsequent guidance, published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in July 2021, further clarified their ruling. Noting that “plans and issuers must cover PrEP consistent with the USPSTF recommendation without cost sharing,” the ruling goes on to clarify that PrEP is not just the medication, but also all of its necessary related services including testing, screening, and provider visits. Despite this ruling and subsequent clarification, individuals are still being wrongly charged out-of-pocket expenses relating to their PrEP care.“In light of this clear guidance from CMS, we are alarmed by continual reports that patients are routinely billed, either for payment-in-full or for cost-sharing practices, related to medically-appropriate medications and essential services,” they continued. “These costs can be daunting. HIV advocates and clinical workers across the county have reported that many patients are unaware that they do not have to pay out-of-pocket for PrEP and ancillary services, assuming that many of these costs are simply necessary for being on PrEP medication.”The Senators’ letter highlights the inequities in PrEP uptake across communities at higher risk for HIV—including Black and Hispanic communities and transgender women—due to limited access to financial resources needed to cover costs of PrEP and associated medical visits and laboratory tests, among other factors.In light of these concerns, the lawmakers ask the following questions and request a response from AHIP within 30 days:1.)    What information or guidance is AHIP currently providing to support its members in ensuring that their health plans are compliant with federal regulations clarifying that PrEP and ancillary services should be available at no-cost to patients?2.)    What information and educational materials is AHIP recommending that its members supply to enrollees to ensure that patients know that PrEP, including its ancillary services, should be provided at no-cost to enrollees?3.)    How is AHIP working with laboratories and health care providers to ensure the accurate coding of appointments and services so that enrollees are not erroneously billed for these services?4.)    How is AHIP working with its partners to develop a full understanding of the scope of the issue, both in terms of the number of individuals impacted and the monetary impacts of erroneous bills?5.)    How is AHIP working with its members to resolve issues for beneficiaries who have been wrongfully charged for PrEP and associated services in an expeditious manner?The letter is supported by PrEP4ALL, the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, the Center for Health and Democracy, and NMAC.“Unfortunately we have documented dozens of cases of insurers still charging patients out-of-pocket fees for PrEP-related care, a year after CMS and the Department of Labor issued their guidance,” said Kenyon Farrow, Managing Director of Advocacy & Organizing with PrEP4ALL. “Ending the HIV epidemic will require us to ensure everyone with insurance be able to get PrEP services with no cost-sharing, as the rule intended. We applaud Sen. Merkley and Sen. Smith’s tireless advocacy on behalf of patients.”“We appreciate Senators Merkley and Smith’s leadership and all their colleagues desire to ensure that the preventative service provisions of the Affordable Care Act are properly implemented. Private insurers must provide PrEP drugs and associated services without patient cost-sharing. We are receiving too many complaints from PrEP users that this is not always happening. We trust with this letter insurers will ensure full compliance,” said Carl Schmid, Executive Director of the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute.“While appalling, it’s sadly not shocking to see Big Health Insurance wrongfully billing enrollees for medications and ancillary services as part of a PrEP regimen to prevent HIV, despite crystal clear guidance from the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury not to do so,” said Wendell Potter, President of the Center for Health and Democracy. “We’re grateful for the leadership of Senators Merkley and Smith for sending this letter, underscoring their understanding of the effectiveness of PrEP and their compassion for those at risk and their families.”Full text of the letter can be found here and follows below:Dear Mr. Eyles:We write today regarding recent reports of patients across the country receiving bills and charges from AHIP members for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drugs that prevent HIV, along with necessary ancillary services, as part of the PrEP regimen[1]. It has been brought to our attention that enrollees in your members’ health plans continue to be charged for necessary medications and ancillary services—including provider consultations and laboratory services—contrary to law and additional federal guidance issued by the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Treasury. We write to express our deep concern with these erroneous and unlawful charges, and to request additional information on steps that AHIP is taking to ensure that its members adhere to federal law and ensure the PrEP drugs and the full scope of PrEP ancillary services are offered without charge to enrollees.As you know, a 2019 ruling by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) gave PrEP an “A” rating as a prevention intervention for people at risk of HIV infection[2]. The Public Health Services Act (PHS Act) section 2713 states that non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered group or individual health insurance coverage must provide coverage for, and must not impose any cost-sharing requirements, for services or interventions that have been given an “A” or “B” rating by the USPSTF[3].While this statutory requirement for payers remains the law of the land, the requirement has been further clarified in additional federal guidance, including in those issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) [4]. Indeed, in a July 2021 document published by CMS, the agency noted that “plans and issuers must cover PrEP consistent with the USPSTF recommendation without cost-sharing…” In its recommendation, the USPTF cites guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), stating that PrEP is a comprehensive intervention comprised of antiretroviral medication in addition to essential support services.Indeed, CMS continued on to clarify that PrEP is not just the medication, but includes the full scope of essential medical services associated with the PrEP regimen, explicitly citing initial clinical assessments and ongoing monitoring of patients including HIV testing; hepatitis B and C testing; creatinine testing; sexually-transmitted infection (STI) testing and counseling, and other services essential to the efficacy of the PrEP regimen as outlined by the CDC guidelines for PrEP.In light of this clear guidance from CMS, we are alarmed by continual reports that patients are routinely billed, either for payment-in-full or for cost-sharing practices, related to medically-appropriate medications and essential services. These costs can be daunting. HIV advocates and clinical workers across the county have reported that many patients are unaware that they do not have to pay out-of-pocket for PrEP and ancillary services, assuming that many of these costs are simply necessary for being on PrEP medication. In some cases, these patients can pay over $1,000 per year when federal law states that they should pay nothing. Consumers who attempt to challenge these illegal cost sharing charges with their plans routinely find that claims are turned over to collections, causing anxiety and stress, and in many cases, prompting individuals to discontinue PrEP.The impact of these costs on patient access and public health more generally cannot be understated. Multiple academic studies have indicated that associated costs—including the costs of ancillary services—present a barrier to PrEP access in the United States[5], despite its incredible effectiveness of reducing the risk of HIV acquisition[6]. Inequities in PrEP uptake persist across communities at higher risk for HIV—including Black and Hispanic communities and transgender women—because of limited access to financial resources to cover costs of PrEP and associated medical visits and laboratory tests, among other factors[7].While we recognize that partnerships with laboratories and health care providers, including accurate billing and coding, may present challenges, the statutory language of the PHSA section 2713  is clear in indicating that issuers, and issuers alone, are legally required to be compliant with providing coverage for PrEP, including the full scope of necessary related services, without cost-sharing. In light of these concerns, and the role we request responses to the following questions within 30 days of receipt of this letter:Thank you again for your attention to this pressing matter impacting public health in our country.###[1] Sarah Varney, “HIV Preventive Care Is Supposed to Be Free in the US.

http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/in-the-news/oregon-mass-timber-coalition-lands-41m-to-boost-forest-products-industry,"The Oregon Mass Timber Coalition has been awarded $41.4 million in
federal grants to modernize and boost the forest products industry in Oregon.The money comes from the Build Back Better Regional
Challenge, which is funded through President Joe Biden's American Rescue Plan.
The capital is designed to catalyze Oregon's mass timber industry, which took root a
decade ago.More than $16 million of the funds are on their way to the
University of Oregon while $8 million is going to to Oregon State University
researchers. The universities jointly operate the TallWood Design Institute.Of the UO funds, $14.6 million will go toward the Oregon
Acoustic Research Laboratory, which will be a mass timber innovation hub at the
Port of Portland's marine Terminal 6, and $2 million will go towards affordable
housing prototyping using mass timber.Mass timber products include cross-laminated timber (CLT),
mass plywood panels (MPP) and glue-laminated timber (glulam). They are made by
fastening pieces of wood together to create strong panels and beams. The
products have gained popularity in the last decade as a sustainable
building-material alternative to steel and concrete.One example is the 9-acre mass timber roof that is being
installed at Portland International Airport. The mass plywood panels being used
were supplied by Freres Engineered Wood, formerly known as
Freres Lumber Co. Mass ply panels make up about 6% of the Lyons-based company's
revenue.Iain Macdonald, director of project partner TallWood Design
Institute, said Business Oregon, another project partner, has fielded out of
state and even international requests on locating mass timber manufacturing in
the state, but a large obstacle has been labor supply. Along with creating the
innovation hub, the funding will also help with efforts to expand the
workforce, which could help mitigate that roadblock and benefit regional
companies.""We hope that that will remove some of the barriers to
companies setting up shop in Oregon,"" Macdonald said.In addition to the TallWood Design Institute and Business
Oregon, other members of the Oregon Mass Timber Coalition are the Port of Portland,
the Oregon Department of Forestry and the Department of Land Conservation. The
coalition's mission is to generate economic development activity, including
jobs, through sustainable wood products that are grown and manufactured in
Oregon.""This federal investment shows how Oregon continues
leading the way in modernizing wood products, generating jobs and economic
opportunities in communities statewide,"" Oregon Senator Ron Wyden said in
a press release. ""I'm gratified that the Oregon Mass Timber Coalition has
earned these resources from the American Rescue Plan for fresh approaches to
our state’s signature timber industry. And I’ll keep fighting for similar
investments in Oregon to support these valuable new sources for jobs and
building materials.""""Mass timber is an exciting innovation with huge
untapped potential. Accelerating affordable housing production, providing good
jobs, sequestering carbon, and restoring forest health will provide immense
benefits for Oregonians as we seek to construct more energy efficient buildings
for the future using all tools available to us,"" Oregon Senator Jeff
Merkley said in a press release.
The Build Back Better Regional Challenge has awarded $1
billion in grants to 21 different projects across the country."

Cottage Grove by installing new landscaping, utilities improvements, and
updated ADA compliance features.$1.3 million in local funds will also be used for the
project and is expected to create 33 jobs, retain 27 jobs and generate $650,000
in private investment.""This federal investment will spark jobs for
Oregonians, help longstanding small businesses in downtown Cottage Grove and
generate opportunities for new small businesses in the city's historic
commercial district,"" said Senator Ron Wyden. ""I'm gratified the
American Rescue Plan I was proud to support is making a real difference on Main
Street in Cottage Grove.""
""So many communities across Oregon were greatly
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in ways big and small, and we need to keep looking
for creative paths forward to help them recover and grow, like this
revitalization plan for Cottage Grove,"" said Senator Jeff Merkley.
""The [Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration's]
funding going to the city’s historic downtown will enhance its economy and
create dozens of good-paying jobs. I am excited to see how the investments will
uplift Cottage Grove for years to come."""
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/in-the-news/oregon-members-of-congress-praise-student-loan-forgiveness,"Edited statements from Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, Sen. Ron Wyden
and Sen. Jeff Merkley about their reactions to President Joe Biden's Aug. 24
announcement about targeted forgiveness for student loans:Bonamici sits on the House higher education subcommittee and
has worked on the issue for years.Rep. Suzanne Bonamici:""The Biden administration's historic decision to
forgive up to $20,000 in student loan debt will transform the lives of millions
of hardworking Americans.""I applaud President Biden for taking bold action that
provides relief to borrowers who need it most - Pell Grant recipients and those
with debt but no degree. Pell Grant recipients are eligible for up to $20,000
of debt forgiveness; other non-Pell Grant borrowers are eligible for up to
$10,000 of forgiveness. The president's action will completely eliminate
student debt for millions of borrowers and reduce the outstanding balance for
millions more. Borrowers of color are more likely to qualify for Pell Grants,
so this relief is an important step toward addressing generational wealth
inequality.""The president's announcement is the most far-reaching
in a long list of actions taken by the Biden administration to support student
borrowers, reform the federal student loan system, and make our nation's
colleges and universities more affordable.""To date, this administration has approved $32 billion
in loan forgiveness for about 1.6 million borrowers nationwide who have worked
in public service, attended institutions engaged in fraudulent practices, and
more. Borrowers across Oregon are benefiting from this proactive approach to
addressing the student debt crisis. The Department of Education's Public
Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) waiver identified 2,050 Oregonians holding
$120.2 million in federal student loans for forgiveness. The department also approved
$102.5 million in loan forgiveness for an additional 8,650 Oregon borrowers who
were defrauded by the predatory and misleading tactics of Corinthian Colleges,
Inc. The department also provided forgiveness of outstanding student loan debt
held by 2,090 Oregon borrowers who attended the predatory institution ITT Tech
between 2005-2016. These three actions alone amount to nearly $260 million in
financial relief for Oregonians.""Congress must now pursue targeted policies that build
on the Biden administration's actions to support borrowers and address
long-term college affordability. I have introduced and am working to pass
several bills that will make college more affordable for students before,
during, and after their education, especially for the most vulnerable and
marginalized students.• My SIMPLE Act would make it easier for more borrowers to
access income-driven repayment plans to minimize their monthly student loan
payments upon completing their education. This will complement the Biden
administration's recent proposed rule to improve income-driven repayment.• My Opportunities for Success Act would make the federal
work study program more generous, target students with financial need, improve
access to meaningful career-related work experience for students, and provide
incentives to colleges that focus on the academic and professional success of
low-income students.• My Student Loan Borrower Safety Net Act would protect
borrowers with federal student loans following the end of the student loan
repayment pause by simplifying borrowers' ability to enroll in income-driven
repayment plans, increasing access to economic hardship support, improving
outreach to borrowers regarding the resumption of payments, and providing a
longer grace period for borrowers who miss a payment.• My Students and Young Consumers Empowerment Act would
leverage the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect student borrowers
and provide relevant and timely information about the student loan marketplace.• I also enthusiastically supported a historic increase to
the Pell grant in the fiscal year 2022 enacted budget and a proposed increase
in fiscal year 2023 budget.""I remain committed to working with Secretary Cardona
and my colleagues in Congress to provide all eligible borrowers with the relief
they need to thrive. And I look forward to continuing our work to improve
access to affordable, high-quality higher education.""Sen. Jeff Merkley:""As the son of blue-collar parents and the first in my
family to graduate from college, I know firsthand that affordability is a huge
factor in whether middle-class students believe there is a path for them to
pursue their dreams through higher education. And I know that for many
low-income students who graduate with enormous debt, that debt is a burden that
affects job opportunities, home ownership, starting a business, and plans for
marriage or for starting a family.""Thus, I strongly support President Biden's decision to
extend the pause on loan repayment and to cancel $10,000 of debt for the
majority of borrowers, and up to $20,000 for Pell grant recipients. This
decision will eliminate or reduce college debt for millions of Americans,
improving opportunities, and stimulating our economy. This is welcome news!""While I applaud this action, let's view it not as a
solution for college debt, but as a down payment on the solution, a catalyst
for further reforms. For every American child to have the opportunity to
thrive, we must make college an affordable option for all. I will continue to pursue
more sweeping reforms, from free community college tuition to legislation like
my Affordable Loans for Any Student Act that guarantees affordable, simple
income-based repayment plans for any federal loan borrower. Affordable college
for every student will produce a more prosperous future for all.""Sen. Ron Wyden, via Twitter:""Pursuing an education shouldn't land you in financial
handcuffs. This is great news for every American being forced to make hard
decisions between paying off their student loans and putting food on the table.
I'll continue pushing for student debt relief at every turn.""

Mass timber has the potential to substantially reduce carbon pollution compared to concrete and steel and is seismically resilient and fire resistant.The coalition is planning projects to research, prototype, and commercialize prefabricated mass timber housing systems. The proposed projects are primarily focused on creating a manufacturing facility, workforce education and training, and building facilities that support research and development. Together, these efforts will create good jobs and economic growth while addressing the shortage of affordable housing.“Mass timber is an exciting innovation with huge untapped potential. Accelerating affordable housing production, providing good jobs, sequestering carbon, and restoring forest health will provide immense benefits for Oregonians as we seek to construct more energy efficient buildings for the future using all tools available to us,” said Merkley. “I’m glad to see the federal government step up to support this quintessential Oregon project, bringing together a broad group of partners to address multiple challenges at once with an innovative solution that will support jobs in our woods, our timber mills, and our cities alike.”“This federal investment shows how Oregon continues leading the way in modernizing wood products, generating jobs and economic opportunities in communities statewide,” Wyden said. “I’m gratified that the Oregon Mass Timber Coalition has earned these resources from the American Rescue Plan for fresh approaches to our state’s signature timber industry. And I’ll keep fighting for similar investments in Oregon to support these valuable new sources for jobs, affordable housing and building materials.”These awards are intended to assist the Oregon Mass Timber Coalition in using mass timber to accelerate affordable housing production, provide good jobs, and restore forest health. The projects funded as part of this award include working with forest-dependent rural communities to grow access to wood fiber, facilitate a wood-based products workforce development program, provide resources to university R&D programs conducting design and prototyping of new construction materials, and assist state agencies in creating a favorable regulatory framework to accommodate modular mass timber homes in rural and wildlife-impacted communities.The BBBRC is an unprecedented competitive federal grant program that provides each regional coalition with significant investments to tackle a wide variety of projects – including entrepreneurial support, workforce development, infrastructure, and innovation – to drive inclusive economic growth.For a full list of BBBRC winners, click HERE.###"

http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/reflecting-on-the-anniversary-of-the-rohingya-genocide-merkley-colleagues-continue-push-for-additional-sanctions-and-international-intervention-to-resolve-humanitarian-crisis-in-burma,"Washington,
D.C. – Five years ago today, the Burmese military began their genocide against
the Rohingya. In marking this day of remembrance, Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff
Merkley, along with Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA),
Edward J. Markey (D-MA), and Gary Peters (D-MI), today, sent a letter to the
Department of Treasury and the Department of State urging the administration to
do more to help stem the Burmese military junta’s brutality, especially by
cutting off revenues from the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE). The
Senators call on the Biden administration to use sanctions to stem the flow of
over a billion dollars in revenue from MOGE to the junta, instead of to Burma’s
rightfully elected government and its people. In
their letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of State Antony
Blinken, the Senators highlighted the importance of both increased sanctions
and the need for cooperation from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) to resolve this crisis. The letter notes the importance of moving
beyond the Five Point Consensus: citing both the Malaysian Foreign Minister’s
declaration that it is time to update the Five Point Consensus and Cambodian
Prime Minister Hun Sen’s statement demanding Burma halt all executions going
forward or ASEAN would have to revisit the consensus. The
Senators detailed their concerns regarding Secretary Blinken’s meeting with
ASEAN foreign ministers last week, while Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov was in
Burma, reaffirming Russia’s support for the junta. Russia has clearly
demonstrated it will support violent authoritarian regimes in order to disrupt
U.S. alliances and interests. The Senators’ letter calls on the United States
to intervene more forcefully to prevent Russia from increasing its exports of
arms and replacement parts to the junta, which would allow them to continue an
air war against their own people.  Senator
Merkley has worked tirelessly to sound the alarm on the erosion of human rights
and democracy in Burma, having called for the imposition of MOGE sanctions
since April 2021. He has also led letters calling for multiple U.S.
administrations to recognize the genocide against the Rohingya in Burma as well
as for Burma’s neighbors, Thailand and Bangladesh, to build upon their existing
efforts to help Rohingya refugees and ameliorate the humanitarian crisis within
Burma.  Full
text of the letter can be found here and follows below: Dear
Secretary Yellen and Blinken, Five
years ago today, Burma’s military began committing genocide against the
country’s Rohingya population. Three and half years later, many of those same
actors were responsible for overthrowing the democratically elected government.
Since the coup on February 1, 2021, the military has killed over 2,000 people
and reversed years of progress on the path to democracy. The recent execution
of four pro-democracy activists following a sham judicial process is an
especially appalling manifestation of the Burmese junta’s brutality and a
clarion call for the international community to do more to curtail the junta’s
ability to operate with impunity. By violating international laws and norms,
the junta has foregone its right to be part of the international rules-based
order. The
Biden Administration has been a leader in galvanizing the international
community to respond to this crisis, but further U.S. leadership is needed. Now
is the time to implement stronger sanctions that will reduce the junta’s
revenues and cut off the access to foreign currency that it desperately needs
to purchase arms and sustain its machinery of repression. Following up on our
letter from April 2021, we write to once again urge you to impose further
sanctions on Burma, especially on the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE),
leverage diplomacy with regional partners to impose additional costs on Burma,
and mitigate the consequences of the authoritarian alliance solidifying between
Burma and Russia. With all of our like-minded partners taken aback about the
recent executions, the time is ripe for stronger action.  We
call on the Biden Administration to use sanctions to stop the junta from
seizing revenues from Burma’s energy sector, especially through MOGE, which
would help halt the flow of over a billion dollars in revenues that rightfully
belong to Burma’s elected government and to its people. This revenue represents
nearly half of the junta’s entire foreign currency income, meaning that MOGE
sanctions are one of the most significant actions the United States could take
to degrade the junta’s ability to operate. With reduced access to foreign
currency, it will be more difficult for the junta to purchase weapons and
import replacement parts for the fighter jets and helicopters it is using to
bomb homes and burn villages to the ground.  At
the same time, sanctions can be designed to limit humanitarian impacts. MOGE
sanctions need not shut down gas production – the Department of the Treasury
should include waivers to allow companies to continue operating gas fields –
but should halt payment streams by forcing banks to stop processing financial
transactions going to junta coffers. The junta has incentives to continue the
flow of gas even if it is not receiving full payments, and with gas continuing
to flow, concerns of energy disruption in Thailand are mitigated. Analysis
shows this was the exact impact of the European Union’s sanctions from
February. For the people of Burma, the dangers of allowing the junta to retain
access to this massive amount of cash far outweigh the potential impacts that
sanctions might have. We urge the Biden Administration to listen to the voices
of Burma’s pro-democracy movement and the National Unity Government and
sanction MOGE. The
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will play a critical role in
helping resolve this crisis, but it is time to move beyond the Five Point
Consensus. While a landmark step for the organization, it is clear that Min
Aung Hlaing never had any intention of implementing what he agreed to. Malaysia’s
Foreign Minister has already said that it is time to update the Five Point
Consensus, and Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Sen made a strong statement
demanding Burma halt all executions going forward or ASEAN would have to
revisit the consensus.  We
hope that Secretary Blinken’s engagement with ASEAN Foreign Ministers has laid
the groundwork for strong action by the organization. This begins with ASEAN
suspending Burma’s participation in all ASEAN meetings and inviting members of
the pro-democracy movement in an unofficial capacity instead. U.S. diplomacy,
in addition to affirming U.S. support for democracy and human rights, should
also focus on communicating the potential costs to ASEAN member states and
other regional partners of the junta’s actions in Burma, which threaten to
create a failed state on their borders that will threaten stability and inhibit
development for years.It
was striking that while Secretary Blinken was meeting ASEAN foreign ministers
last week, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov was in Burma reaffirming Russia’s
support for the junta. Russia has already demonstrated that it is a dastardly
international actor and will support violent authoritarian regimes in order to
disrupt U.S. alliances and interests. Russia is among the worst perpetrators of
transnational repression, and is happy to export weapons, surveillance
technology, and mercenaries so that authoritarians can suppress the rights of
their own people. We have seen the terrible results of such support in Syria,
and fear that Russia means to roll out the same playbook in Burma. The United
States cannot stand by and watch as Russia increases its exports of arms and
replacement parts to the junta, allowing them to continue an air war against
their own people. We urge you to explore ways to put pressure on Russia
diplomatically and financially to stem these ties.  We
thank you for your consideration of these issues. We are eager to work with you
to stem the violence and return Burma to the path to democracy.    Sincerely,

http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-statement-on-potus-student-loan-debt-cancellation-repayment-pause-extension,"Washington D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley issued the following statement after President Joe Biden’s announcement canceling $10,000 in student loan debt for non-Pell borrowers and $20,000 for Pell grant recipients who make less than $125,000 annually or families earning less than $250,000 per year, as well as an extended repayment freeze through December 31, 2022.“As the son of blue-collar parents and the first in my family to graduate from college, I know firsthand that affordability is a huge factor in whether middle class students believe there is a path for them to pursue their dreams through higher education. And I know that for many low-income students who graduate with enormous debt, that debt is a burden that affects job opportunities, home ownership, starting a business, and plans for marriage or for starting a family.“Thus, I strongly support President Biden’s decision to extend the pause on loan repayment and to cancel $10,000 of debt for the majority of borrowers, and up to $20,000 for Pell grant recipients. This decision will eliminate or reduce college debt for millions of Americans, improving opportunities, and stimulating our economy. This is welcome news!“While I applaud this action, let’s view it not as a solution for college debt, but as a down payment on the solution, a catalyst for further reforms. For every American child to have the opportunity to thrive, we must make college an affordable option for all. I will continue to pursue more sweeping reforms, from free community college tuition to legislation like my Affordable Loans for Any Student Act that guarantees affordable, simple income-based repayment plans for any federal loan borrower. Affordable college for every student will produce a more prosperous future for all.”###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-announce-major-investments-in-the-klamath-basin,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden today announced that the Department of the Interior (DOI) is investing nearly $26 million in the Klamath Basin through the first year of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The projects include nearly $16 million for ecosystem restoration and $10 million to expand the Klamath Falls National Fish Hatchery.The Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, will also fund an additional $2.2 million in grants to improve fish and wildlife habitat for coho salmon in the basin.This historic federal funding comes at a critical time in the Klamath Basin, as water deliveries for irrigation are ceasing amid another year of extreme drought. The investments mark a major step forward for federal agencies, state partners, Klamath Basin tribes, and agricultural producers who are working together to realize long-term solutions.“The Klamath Basin has fought to survive back-to-back summers of the worst drought in memory. From businesses and families to fish and wildlife, the impact of the drought throughout the basin is deep,” said Merkley, who serves as Chairman of the Interior Subcommittee on Appropriations which oversees funding for USFWS. “This funding is key to supporting priorities in the region that will make the water we have go further for the farmers, households, and ecosystems in the basin, including infrastructure improvements and habitat restoration. We still have a long way to go, but I am glad the Department of Interior is actively engaging in the basin and putting the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding to good use. It’s proof that when local leaders, state and federal partners, and tribes work collaboratively, we can make a real difference.”  “This federal investment comes as welcome news to help Oregonians in the Klamath Basin weather the historic drought that’s devastated the region,” Wyden said. “With no rain in immediate sight this summer, there’s obviously much more work to be done during this brutally tough water year.  But I’m gratified the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that I and Senator Merkley supported has generated these federal resources for species recovery and habitat restoration to make sure every precious drop of water goes as far as possible in the Basin. Today’s announcement provides a solid building block to continue working with the federal agencies and the state on a long-term, sustainable solution for farmers, Tribes and everybody in the community. I’m all in on being a part of that team until that solution is achieved.”Among today’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law investments impacting Oregon:In total, Chairman Merkley secured $162 million in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for habitat restoration efforts in the Klamath Basin. Today’s investments come in addition to $15 million in annual funding that Merkley secured for fiscal year 2022 to support ongoing activities in the basin that are based on priorities identified in the 2018 Sucker Summit that he convened.Together, Senators Merkley and Wyden are committed to supporting collaborative, community-generated solutions to this complex issue as they continue to urge for unity in the region.For a comprehensive list of the latest projects and investments in the Klamath Basin, click HERE.###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-press-for-answers-to-allegations-of-retaliation-against-inmates-at-federal-prison-in-sheridan,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley this week asked federal officials to respond to “significant and troubling” reports about retaliation against inmates at the federal prison in Sheridan, as well as significant delays in access to treatment and evaluation for defendants in the federal criminal justice system in Oregon and nationwide with mental health conditions.“We write today with deep concern about allegations of retaliation by guards against inmates at the federal correctional institution in Sheridan, Oregon (FCI Sheridan) and also about issues hurting the mental health of federal inmates nationwide,” Wyden and Merkley wrote federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Director Colette Peters, the former head of Oregon’s Department of Corrections. “We respectfully request an update about both of these significant and troubling issues.”Wyden and Merkley cited recent news reports about retaliation and violence at FCI Sheridan against inmates for speaking out about unaddressed medical needs; small cell confinement; and limited access to family and lawyers as a result of the pandemic.“Inmates’ claims of retaliation for speaking out include violence, targeted cell shake downs, and the tossing of personal items, such as medications,” Wyden and Merkley wrote. “The fact that these actions coincide with the inmates’ ongoing federal petition alleging conditions at FCI Sheridan violate their constitutional rights make these reports more troubling.”Wyden and Merkley asked the BOP to answer these questions about Sheridan:The senators also asked about reports they have received that a Special Operations Response Team (SORT) was brought in to FCI Sheridan. The requested the following information from the BOP:Wyden and Merkley also wrote in their letter about reports of significant delays in access to treatment and evaluation for defendants with mental health conditions in the federal criminal justice system in Oregon and nationwide. The senators noted that the Insanity Defense Reform Act requires the Department of Justice to “hospitalize [a] defendant for treatment in a suitable facility . . . for such a reasonable period of time, not to exceed four months, as is necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that in the foreseeable future he will attain the capacity to permit the proceedings to go forward.”In response to those concerns about “competency restoration” and the BOP’s responsibility to meet that requirement, Wyden and Merkley asked for answers to the following questions:Wyden and Merkley asked Peters for responses to all their questions by September 19, 2022.The senators’ entire letter is here.A web version of this release is here."
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/representative-cicilline-and-senator-merkley-lead-more-than-100-members-of-congress-in-amicus-brief-to-oppose-weakening-of-nondiscrimination-laws-in-303-creative-llc-v-elenis,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus Chair Rep. David N. Cicilline (RI-01) and Senator Jeff Merkley (OR) filed an amicus brief to defend nondiscrimination laws in the upcoming Supreme Court case, 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis. The brief was joined by 123 Representatives—including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and all of the Equality Caucus Co-Chairs and Vice Chairs—and 14 Senators. Although this case is a challenge to a Colorado nondiscrimination law, it potentially could be used to weaken public accommodations nondiscrimination laws more generally by providing a constitutional right to discriminate in certain instances against LGBTQ+ people and other marginalized groups. Last spring, Representative Cicilline and Senator Merkley teamed up to further equal rights for all by introducing the Equality Act in both Chambers of Congress.“Discrimination has no place in our society, yet this case is a reminder that despite the progress we have made there are still businesses out there that want to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people and other marginalized communities,” said Equality Caucus Chair Cicilline (RI-01). “The First Amendment is a key part of our Constitution, but it most certainly does not create a constitutional right for businesses open to the public to discrimination against LGBTQ+ and other people. For more than half a century, Congress has made clear that businesses that are open to the public should not be able to discriminate—as exemplified by the Civil Rights Act of 1964—and many states, including Colorado, have done the same. The Court must reject the dangerous arguments of the petitioners in this case and instead uphold the dignity and rights of LGBTQ+ and other marginalized people who only seek to receive the same rights, protections, and services as any other people.”“If your door is open for business in America, then it must be open to all. Full stop. No one deserves to have that door slammed on them simply because of who they are or whom they love,” said Senator Merkley (OR). “Denying products or services on the basis of personal views, opinions, or religion has no place in our country, and I promise I will never stop fighting for a more just and equal America.”303 Creative LLC v. Elenis was filed by a Colorado-based graphic designer who wants to make wedding websites in the future but does not want to create wedding websites for same-sex couples. Colorado law currently prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in public accommodations. The Colorado law does not dictate what services a business provides but rather requires that a service offered to the general public be offered to all prospective customers without discriminating based on protected characteristics such as race, religion, or sexual orientation. The graphic designer is arguing that this law violates her First Amendment rights and that she should be able to discriminate. A broad ruling for the graphic designer could not only provide a constitutional basis for discriminating against same-sex couples, but also for discriminating against all marginalized people currently protected by public accommodations nondiscrimination laws.Founded in 2008, the mission of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus is to promote equality for all, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. The Caucus, which is led by the nine openly LGBTQ+ members of the House of Representatives, is strongly committed to achieving the full enjoyment of human rights for LGBTQ+ people in the U.S. and around the world. ###"

U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley today announced a total of
$346,000 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
headed to three Oregon communities to upgrade facilities so they can
better serve families and increase access to essential medical services.""No matter your
zip code, every Oregonian should have easy access to the care they need,"" Wyden
said. ""This money will go a
long way in addressing hunger, keeping mental health care available and making
visits to the pharmacy easier in rural communities across our state.""“It is essential for
Oregonians in every corner of the state to have access to the resources they
need to be safe and healthy,” said Merkley. “This crucial funding will better equip Clatsop, Lane, and Union Counties
with the tools needed to address hunger and improve health in the community, by
updating existing food distribution facilities, making treatment facility
improvements, and ensuring easy and reliable access to pharmacies for our rural
communities.”The projects include:Clatsop Community Action, Clatsop County -- $237,900This Rural Development investment will be used to purchase
two new food distribution trucks, a new refrigerator and walk-in freezer, and
remodel the existing dry storage area. Clatsop Community Action's food
distribution facility is located in Warrenton, a small community in Clatsop
County, Oregon and they are organized to operate throughout the county. The
existing facility was built in 2010 and is in good condition, however,
increased demand for services resulting from the impacts of the pandemic have
made it necessary to increase both dry and cold food storage capacity. The
project will ensure that this rural area will have the storage equipment
required to enhance its food distribution capabilities to benefit county residents
for years to come.South Lane Mental Health, Lane County -- $58,200This Rural Development investment will be used to purchase a
covered gazebo, picnic tables and chairs to facilitate outdoor COVID safe
therapy sessions, HEPA air purifiers for offices to further protect clients and
clinicians and a new key fob system to increase security and the ability to
screen visitors for COVID. South Lane Mental Health has several care facilities
in the community of Cottage Grove. These facilities do not currently have an
air filtration system or outdoor meeting areas. These improvements are needed
to reduce the impact and spread of COVID by allowing for safer meeting spaces,
healthier air quality in offices and the ability to more safely screen for
symptoms upon entry into the facilities. Overall, this project will ensure that
this rural area will have the needed funds to purchase equipment and enhance
its capabilities to respond to COVID for the residents of Cottage Grove and the
surrounding area for years to come.Elgin Health District, Union County -- $49,900This Rural Development investment will be used to help
purchase equipment to start a tele pharmacy and enhance capabilities to respond
to COVID-19. The residents of Elgin have been without a pharmacy for 15 years
and must drive into La Grande, 20 miles away to get their prescriptions. The
Elgin Health District built the clinic in 2008 and currently offers medical,
dental and limited behavioral health services in rural Elgin, but it has no
pharmacy. The health care clinic will purchase and install tele pharmacy
equipment at the clinic location and at Grande Ronde Hospital in La Grande.
This project will ensure that this rural area will have the needed funds to
purchase tele pharmacy equipment and enhance its capabilities to provide
enhanced medical services to the residents of Elgin and the surrounding area
for years to come.

http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-announce-over-13-million-in-federal-awards-to-revamp-mcgilchrist-street-in-salem,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden today announced the City of Salem will be receiving $13,299,320 in Fiscal Year 22 Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability & Equity (RAISE) Grants to fund construction for the McGilchrist Complete Street Project.“McGilchrist Street already plays a crucial role for Salem transportation and infrastructure, and with a face-lift it can play an even bigger role,” said Merkley. “This investment will transform the current roadway into a safer street for bicyclists, pedestrians, and vehicles. I’m grateful this funding is headed to Salem to revamp this important road, foster economic development, and make the neighborhood safer.“I know firsthand how Salem has long needed this federal investment to improve and update McGilchrist Street so residents and commuters can have a safe and modern transportation artery,” Wyden said. “I’m gratified the years of teamwork with city officials have paid off with these federal funds that will help to generate economic development in Salem and provide bike and pedestrian options to share the road safely with vehicles.”McGilchrist Street is designated a major arterial in the Salem Transportation System Plan. McGilchrist Street is located in an older industrial area that has significant opportunities for infill development. The current condition of the road restricts investments and business development along the roadway. Additionally, the roadway lacks any infrastructure for pedestrians or bicyclists and its current condition cannot withstand Oregon’s wet weather.The City of Salem has been trying to fund this important transportation project for more than five years. This project will widen McGilchrist Street, add travel and turn lanes, construct bicycle lanes and sidewalks, install new traffic signals and streetlights, and improve drainage to prevent seasonal flooding.“For 15 years residents of Salem have been working to get this project funding. The impacts of this investment will be felt quickly as new developments are already beginning to take shape along McGilchrist St. Salem residents should be excited about improving commutes, bicycle and pedestrian safety, and the positive environmental impacts delivered by this project,” said Kristin Retherford, Salem Interim City Manager.###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-invites-epa-administrator-regan-to-oregon-tours-the-impacts-of-climate-chaos-on-communities,"PORTLAND, OR – At Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley’s invitation, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Michael S. Regan visited Oregon to see first-hand how communities in the state are handling climate chaos. Along with Oregon’s U.S. Senator Ron Wyden and Oregon Governor Kate Brown, Senator Merkley and Administrator Regan visited a community farm in Gresham to discuss the impacts of extreme heat, and announced new investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that will support toxics reduction in the Columbia River.“Oregon is facing very real impacts from climate chaos. You don’t need to look much farther than record-setting heat waves and the mega wildfires and droughts. This weekend, the Senate passed historic investments in the Inflation Reduction Act to transition to clean energy and create high-quality union jobs while we do it,” said Merkley, whose Good Jobs for 21st Century Energy Act provided the base for tax incentives for union jobs in clean energy projects. “Today’s visit shed light on how community farms are adapting to extreme heat, but they can’t keep up if we let climate chaos spiral out of control. That’s why bold climate action is so critical at this juncture in history. This will build on the success of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to invest in communities and regions and make a real impact in addressing climate chaos.”“Under the leadership of President Biden, EPA is taking decisive action to protect public health and the environment for Oregonians and people across the nation,” said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan. “Thanks to Senator Merkley’s leadership, we passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, investing billions in important work like the restoration of the Columbia River Basin, and we’re poised to make historic investments to combat the climate crisis through the Inflation Reduction Act, which will deliver relief to families dealing with the devastating impacts of our greatest climate challenges.”At Mudbone Grown Farm in Gresham, the leaders discussed the difficulties of farming in a changing climate, including extreme heat. During the walk through the farm, Senator Merkley and Administrator Regan observed the farm’s operations and the importance of planting trees in Metro neighborhoods that need it most to combat high temperatures.At Broughton Beach in Portland, Administrator Regan, Senators Merkley and Wyden, along with Tribal and State Leaders, announced a $79 million investment from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to protect and restore the Columbia River Basin. The announcement includes $6.9 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Clean Water Act grants to be awarded this year for projects to reduce toxics in fish and water and address climate impacts in communities throughout the Columbia River Basin. The work is taking place as part of the federal Columbia River Basin Restoration Program, which Merkley fought to create.“With the Senate passage of landmark climate legislation only days ago, today’s visit to Oregon by EPA’s top official is timely to discuss how this groundbreaking response dovetails with local efforts to reduce the climate crisis’ devastating heat impact on Oregon,” said Wyden, whose Clean Energy for America Act reforming the tax code to provide incentives to emissions reductions comprised the linchpin of the Inflation Reduction Act. “I’m glad Administrator Regan could see Oregonians’ work firsthand and gratified that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law I was proud to support will help reduce toxins in the Columbia River Basin.”“I’d like to thank Administrator Regan for his time in Oregon today to discuss the impacts that our communities are facing due to the climate crisis,” said Governor Brown. “Today’s discussions with community members, local government leaders, and community-based organizations reinforced the need for a collaborative approach to climate action. But we also need action at the federal level. I’d like to thank Senator Merkley and Senator Wyden for their work on the Senate passage of the Inflation Reduction Act—we are one step closer to significant investments that will further our work to reduce the impacts of climate change.”###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-colleagues-continue-push-for-robust-federal-response-to-monkeypox-public-health-emergency,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley led a group of 14 Senators in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) urging the Senators to include critical funding to address the monkeypox (MPV)/orthopoxvirus Public Health Emergency (PHE) in any forthcoming legislative package in the 117th Congress.“As of August 9, 2022, there have been over 9,492 confirmed MPV/orthopoxvirus cases in the United States from when the first case in the current outbreak was identified on May 18, 2022,” wrote the Senators. “The current outbreak in the United States is the largest in the world by case count in the current global outbreak—which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization—and the largest in the nation’s history.”In their letter, the Senators spotlight that the United States public health system remains on the frontlines in identifying MPV cases, informing Americans about access to vaccines and therapeutics, and connecting constituents to necessary medical care and resources. Yet this system continues to be strained by the COVID-19 pandemic and underfunded.“MPV testing efforts are currently encountering processing and collection barriers that have led to underreporting of cases and poor data to aid the federal government in directing necessary resources in an appropriate manner,” they continued. “Additionally, as both a prophylaxis and treatment, acquiring and administering vaccines swiftly is crucial to stemming the spread of MPV and protecting all communities across the United States. Finally, clinics and providers are facing additional barriers in clinical services supplies, education for providers to properly identify MPV, vaccines, testing supplies, contact tracing, and community outreach to bolster our public health response to MPV, and ensure that accurate and adequate information is reaching our constituents.”This letter comes less than a month after Merkley led 22 colleagues on a separate letter sounding the alarm on MPV vaccine access inequities.Joining Merkley on the letter are Senators Jack Reed (D-RI), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN).In reaction to the Senators’ letter, David C. Harvey, Executive Director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, said: “The nation’s sexual health clinics have been managing frontline testing, treatment, and vaccination for monkeypox without adequate resources, staffing, or supplies, blunting the impact of federal efforts to address the outbreak. The success of the national response hinges on whether these clinics get the resources they need to help patients access expanded testing, treatment, and vaccines.”“We are living in a time of unprecedented and overlapping health emergencies. We’ve learned that the lives of people and the well-being of our communities depends on a timely, effective and credible public health response that builds trust and equitably addresses the unique needs of different populations. To be effective, public health officials need adequate resources and we need the flexibility to deploy those resources nimbly as new threats emerge,"" said Patrick Allen, Director of the Oregon Health Authority.Full text of the letter can be found here and follows below:Dear Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell:We write today to express concern over the rising number of monkeypox virus (hereon referred to as MPV) cases in the United States, and to urge you to include funding to address this Public Health Emergency (PHE) in any forthcoming legislative package in the 117th Congress.As of August 9, 2022, there have been over 9,492 confirmed MPV/orthopoxvirus cases in the United States from when the first case in the current outbreak was identified on May 18, 2022. The current outbreak in the United States is the largest in the world by case count in the current global outbreak—which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization—and the largest in the nation’s history. As such, the outbreak was declared a national PHE by the Department of Health and Human Services on August 4, 2022. Nevertheless, we recognize that many experts have stated that the current number of cases is likely an undercount due to a gap in provider knowledge, limited access to information and testing, as well as social stigma that may increase reluctance to seek medical care.As the country continues to navigate the MPV PHE, the United States public health system remains on the frontlines in identifying MPV cases, informing Americans about access to vaccines and therapeutics, and connecting our constituents to necessary medical care and resources. A recent survey conducted by the National Coalition of STD Directors of more than 100 clinics nationwide—including Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), reproductive and sexual health clinics, and primary care providers—demonstrates that our country’s health professionals have the willingness and expertise to play a central role in the MPV response, and are already being called upon to do so. However, these care providers are in dire need of additional resources to scale an appropriate response and prevent the spread of the virus.1MPV testing efforts are currently encountering processing and collection barriers that have led to underreporting of cases and poor data to aid the federal government in directing necessary resources in an appropriate manner. Additionally, as both a prophylaxis and treatment, acquiring and administering vaccines swiftly is crucial to stemming the spread of MPV and protecting all communities across the United States. Finally, clinics and providers are facing additional barriers in clinical services supplies, education for providers to properly identify MPV, vaccines, testing supplies, contact tracing, and community outreach to bolster our public health response to MPV, and ensure that accurate and adequate information is reaching our constituents.We appreciate the work that Senators Leahy, Murray, and Coons have undertaken to develop and introduce an emergency supplemental funding bill to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other emerging disease that pose a significant threat to public health, and we ask you to include additional funding in any forthcoming legislative package to address the MPV PHE in our communities.Thank you for your attention and partnership in addressing this public health concern.###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-leads-colleagues-sounds-the-alarm-on-seafood-traceability-concerns,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley led colleagues in a letter to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Califf urging the FDA to retain and strengthen seafood traceability rules. Strengthening these rules will ensure Americans are consuming safe, legally caught, and honestly labeled seafood.Joining the letter are Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Alex Padilla (D-CA), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).“Seafood is a valuable source of protein and nutrients in our diet, and seafood fisheries and businesses support U.S. coastal communities. However, according to NOAA Fisheries, the United States imports 70% to 85% of our seafood,” wrote the Senators. “These imports pass through complex global supply chains, in which illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is widespread—depleting fish and other marine species, destroying ocean habitat, and enabling forced labor and human rights abuses around the world.”The Senators’ letter also highlights the issues caused by lack of transparency and inaccurate labeling of seafood products. Mislabeled products or products that are being passed off as one type of fish, but are something completely different, allow unsafe or illegally caught seafood to make its way into our supply chains.“[…] this practice of seafood mislabeling can cover up a broad array of potential contaminants, pathogens, and allergens,” they continued. “In the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), Congress directed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to identify a list of high-risk foods and establish recordkeeping requirements for these foods to protect public health.”The Senators cited the rule as proposed as a significant improvement over the status quo, but advocated for further changes that would strengthen the traceability of seafood. For example, the FDA should include all seafood products, not just some. In order to simplify compliance for businesses and ensure information can be shared across U.S. agencies for effective enforcement, the Senators suggested that the FDA could be more closely aligned with NOAA’s Seafood Import Monitoring Program. Additionally, the Senators said the proposed rule should implement more rigorous, electronic record keeping that can be easily reported to regulators.Lastly, the Senators called for the rule to ensure that consumers are provided with basic information about seafood, including the specific species, where it was caught, how it was caught, and whether it was farmed or caught wild.Full text of the letter can be found here and follows below:Dear Commissioner Califf:Seafood is a valuable source of protein and nutrients in our diet, and seafood fisheries and businesses support U.S. coastal communities.

http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-applauds-passage-of-inflation-reduction-act-today-is-a-big-day-for-america,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley released the following statement after the U.S. Senate passed the Inflation Reduction Act, historic legislation that will tackle the climate crisis, lower health care costs, and increase tax fairness, all while creating good-paying American jobs. For years, Merkley has been one of the Senate’s foremost advocates for bold climate action.“Today is a big day for America. For the first time, the U.S. Senate has passed major legislation to remake our energy system—and to do so while also lowering health care costs and creating good-paying, family wage jobs, all paid for by ensuring billionaires and big corporations pay their fair share in taxes.“We’re taking on Big Pharma to lower drug prices. This bill starts the process of negotiating prescription drug prices and caps out-of-pocket costs for prescriptions at $2,000 a year for seniors on Medicare. Additionally, it helps middle class families get affordable insurance coverage by extending key tax credits and preventing big cost increases that would have hit families this fall. This bill is a big win for affordable health care, and we need to keep building on it. American taxpayers contribute more than the citizens of any other nation in the world to research and development of drugs. They deserve the best prices in the world, not the worst.“We’re going to transition to clean energy and create high-quality union jobs while we do it. Year after year, I’ve seen my home state of Oregon and other states across the West decimated by mega wildfires and record droughts. In other parts of the country, we’ve seen superstorms, sea rise, and unprecedented flooding. Climate chaos is here, and we have to act now to save lives and livelihoods from catastrophe. This bill is the most significant piece of climate legislation ever passed through the U.S. Senate and finally puts us on a path to transition to clean and renewable energy. What’s more, this bill borrows from the strategy I laid out in my Good Jobs for 21st Century Energy Act to juice the creation of good, family-wage jobs as we’re transitioning to a greener future. This bill is a huge investment in a Made in America, union future for renewable energy in the United States. The bill is not perfect, and I particularly regret parts of it that encourage more climate-killing oil and gas infrastructure and that leave frontline communities vulnerable to the ensuing impacts. But overall, the bill does a lot to drive a fast transition from fossil to renewable energy, and that is a massive stride in the right direction.“We’re taking on big corporations to finally deliver tax fairness for working Americans. Many huge corporations like Amazon pay little to no federal taxes. That’s outrageous. It’s time for big corporations who’ve benefited from Americans’ investments in education, infrastructure, research and so much more to pay their fair share. The 15% minimum corporate tax in the Inflation Reduction Act stops big corporations from exploiting loopholes to evade taxes, and it taxes stock buybacks to incentivize companies to invest in workers and expansion—not just lining the pockets of CEOs and shareholders. This means that we can pay for historic climate investments without raising taxes by a single dime on working Americans—and to do it all while reducing the deficit by $300 billion to help bring down inflation. This is economic justice for real American families who are suffering.“It’s been a long road to get here—and our work most certainly doesn’t stop here—but today, Senate Democrats have delivered in a big way for the American people. In future years, I hope that we will be able to look back and see today’s vote as a major inflection point on climate action, both here in the United States and globally. Let’s keep moving forward and build on this work by putting our country on an emergency footing to combat the climate crisis—and let’s keep working to bring costs down for consumers, put workers over big corporations, and deliver a better future for all.”The U.S. House of Representatives is expected to pass the Inflation Reduction Act in the coming days, sending it to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law."

http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-join-colleagues-in-introduction-of-bill-to-protect-doctors-from-republicans-anti-abortion-attacks,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden joined Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Senator Alex Padilla (D-CA), and Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) in the introduction of the Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act—a bill to protect health care providers from Republicans’ attacks on reproductive freedoms and ensure they can safely provide abortion care in states where it is still legal, including Oregon. This week, Senators will take to the Senate floor to seek unanimous consent to pass the legislation.Republicans’ nonstop attacks against women’s reproductive freedom have long targeted doctors and care providers, with state laws like Texas’ SB8 allowing for anyone to bring a lawsuit against a health professional who provides abortion care. In the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, these attacks have only increased—with Republican state legislators drafting legislation that would make it a crime to perform an abortion on a state resident even in another state where abortion is legal. Abortion providers are already facing nonstop attacks from Republican politicians.The Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act will help protect against these attacks, ensuring that providers in states where abortion remains legal are shielded from any efforts to restrict their practice or create uncertainty about their legal liability.“The freedom to be in control of your own body is an essential freedom, and it’s so crucial that medical decisions be made by individuals and whomever they may choose to consult—not by extremist politicians,” said Merkley. “Today, we are in a struggle with an extremist minority that wants to control you, your body, and your life. This bill protects doctors and other professionals who provide reproductive health care, including abortions, and ensures patients can get care in a timely and safe manner. Quite frankly, this bill will save lives, and it’s essential that we get it passed.”“In the aftermath of the Supreme Court overturning the right to a safe and legal abortion, fanatics are now targeting  doctors and care providers just doing what they were trained to do -- providing life-saving reproductive health care,” said Wyden. “This bill would protect those providers from the extremists plotting to attack the right for patients to make decisions about their own bodies.”The Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act will ensure that providers in states where abortion remains legal are protected from any efforts to restrict their practice or create uncertainty about their legal liability. Specifically, the bill will:In addition to Senators Merkley, Wyden, Murray, Luján, Padilla, and Rosen, the legislation is also co-sponsored by Senators Schumer (D-NY), Bennet (D-CO), Markey (D-MA), Stabenow (D-MI), Heinrich (D-NM), Blumenthal (D-CT), Warren (D-MA), Smith (D-MN), Van Hollen (D-MD), Cardin (D-MD), Menendez (D-NJ), Klobuchar (D-MN), Murphy (D-CT), Reed (D-RI), Cortez Masto (D-NV), Whitehouse (D-RI), Hirono (D-HI), Sanders (I-VT), and Duckworth (D-IL).The bill has been endorsed by: Dr. Caitlin Bernard, Physicians for Reproductive Health, the National Women’s Law Center, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Catholics for Choice, the National Partnership for Women & Families, the Center for Reproductive Rights, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and the National Council of Jewish Women.Full text of the legislation can be found here.A one-page summary can be found here.###"

But this is only part of the solution. I’ll continue working to secure all the resources necessary to boost Oregon’s disaster prevention and recovery efforts in every corner of the state.”“Firefighters risking their lives to protect Oregon families, homes and small businesses deserve federal investment in tools like these that help them perform their jobs safely and effectively,” Wyden said. “These funds will equip these courageous firefighters with fresh strategies and regular training to prepare them to fight blazes that pop up anywhere in our state. That’s good news for Oregon in our firefighting prevention work, and I’ll keep battling to build on today’s announcement so our state has a robust response when disaster strikes.”This project is intended to test and validate the use of cameras and specialized software to automate fire pre-plan maps that will help fire departments know in advance building layouts, the location of critical objects supporting their effective response, and potential hazards. This system will provide geo-located imagery outdoors and indoors, supporting remote and frequent virtual training for department members on critical structures within a city. Once complete, it will also enable the department to obtain new information on structural changes on a regular basis to help improve on-demand pre-planning.###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-announce-another-93-million-in-bipartisan-infrastructure-funds-heading-to-oregon,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden today announced that a total of $93,862,114 in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds are headed to Oregon to meet the rising challenges of climate chaos. Funds are intended to address the growing costs of extreme weather events adversely impacting communities and fund resilient infrastructure projects benefiting every corner of the state.The funds, along with new guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), create the new Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, Efficient, and Cost-Saving Transportation (PROTECT) Formula Program. Eligible projects and states will have five years to make transportation infrastructure more resilient to future weather events and other natural disasters by focusing on resilience planning, making resilience improvements to existing transportation assets and evacuation routes, and addressing at-risk highway infrastructure.“All you need to do is step outside into the broiling heat or smoke-filled skies to know that the climate crisis is here, threatening our communities – not in some theoretical future, but right now,” said Merkley. “The bipartisan infrastructure law makes critical investments to help our communities deal with the burdens climate-related disasters can put on our infrastructure.  I’m glad to see some of those investments are coming home to Oregon today to create good jobs and stronger, more resilient infrastructure for Oregonians.”“In this first week of August when Oregon communities are threatened by searing heat and tinder dry conditions from drought, there’s no question in our state that resiliency to the climate crisis is a must for smart investment in transportation infrastructure,” Wyden said. “I’m gratified the bipartisan infrastructure law I was proud to support contains these key investments to respond to extreme weather in Oregon. As I fight this week to pass my clean energy legislation that will generate U.S. jobs with bold incentives, the resources announced today will play a key role in protecting infrastructure in Oregon from the ravages of the climate crisis.""Eligible resilience improvements can involve adapting existing transportation infrastructure or new construction to keep communities safe by bolstering infrastructure’s ability to withstand extreme weather events and other physical hazards that are becoming more common and intense. Eligible project choices may include the use of natural or green infrastructure to buffer future storm surges and provide flood protection, as well as aquatic ecosystem restoration. PROTECT projects can also help improve the resilience of transportation networks that serve traditionally underserved and underrepresented communities, particularly during natural disasters and evacuations.PROTECT builds on other USDOT actions to address the climate crisis and that support the Biden Administration’s whole-of-government approach to reducing greenhouse gas pollution by 2030. For more information about the new PROTECT Formula Program and guidance, please see FHWA's website and fact sheet. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law established both the PROTECT Formula and Discretionary Grant Programs. This guidance focuses on the PROTECT Formula Program.###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-announces-critical-investments-for-oregons-coastal-communities,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley announced he secured major investments for Oregon’s ports, waterways, and coastal, fishing, and tribal communities through FY23 Senate Appropriations bills.“As I hold a town hall in each of Oregon’s 36 counties every year, I hear from folks in every corner of the state about what matters most to them, including strengthening the sustainability, resiliency, and economy of our coastal communities,” Merkley said. “The funding bills I championed make significant, targeted investments in small ports and shipyards, boost Pacific salmon and steelhead recovery, and support our vital fishing industry, all while taking on the harmful impacts climate chaos is inflicting on our fragile, complex marine ecosystems. I will keep pushing to get this critical legislation across the finish line to benefit the health and economies of Oregon’s coastal communities.”Merkley is the only Oregon member of Congress from either chamber since Senator Mark Hatfield to serve on the Appropriations Committee, considered to be one of the most powerful on Capitol Hill. He joined the committee in 2013 so that Oregon would have a strong voice in decisions about the investments our nation should be making.Key elements for the Oregon Coast that Merkley fought for in the funding bills include:Small Ports and Army Corps Navigation: The program, which is vital source of funding to help Oregon ports pay for dredging and other necessary infrastructure projects, received over $355 million for deep-draft harbor and channel improvements, $15 million for inland waterways, $25 million for navigation maintenance, and $65 million for small, remote, or subsistence navigation.Small Shipyards: The bill provides $25 million for assistance to small shipyards. This program supports small shipyards by providing grants that can be used to purchase equipment or train employees.Salmon Recovery: The bill preserves $65 million for the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund. Created in 2000, this fund is a competitive grant program designed to address declining Pacific salmon and steelhead populations by supporting conservation efforts in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Alaska. The program is essential to preventing the extinction of the 28 listed salmon and steelhead species on the West Coast.Sea Grant Program: The program received a $14 million increase after Merkley led a bipartisan resolution in support of the investment. Funded at $90 million, the program, a priority for Oregon State University, uses targeted local investments to create economic growth, sustainable fisheries, and resilient coastal communities.Ocean and Coastal Management and Services: The bill provides a total of $308 million for Ocean and Coastal Management and Services within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This funding will fund critical coastal services and programs such as: Coastal Zone Management Grants, National Oceans and Coastal Security Fund, the Coral Reef Program, the National Estuarine Research Reserve System, and Sanctuaries and Marine Protected Areas.Pacific Shellfish: The bill includes $2.5 million in federal funding for cutting-edge research to improve the productivity, sustainability, and resiliency of the Pacific shellfish agricultural system. This research is critical to efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate chaos on the health and economies of Oregon’s coastal communities.Maritime Environmental and Technical Assistance Program: The bill includes $10 million to promote the research, demonstration, and development of emerging technologies, practices, and processes that improve maritime industrial environmental sustainability.Pacific Salmon Treaty: The bill includes $43 million for the Pacific States, Tribal Communities, and NOAA to continue activities in support of the obligations set forth in the renegotiated annex of the Pacific Salmon Treaty. The bill also provides $23 million for the operation and maintenance of Mitchell Act hatcheries, which are meant to produce salmon and steelhead in the Columbia River Basin for harvest and conservation purposes.Seafood Import Monitoring Program (SIMP): The bill provides a $4 million increase for the SIMP program. This program ensures illegal, unreported, and unregulated-caught and/or misrepresented seafood does not enter our marketplace.The next step for the bill is merging with a counterpart bill from the U.S. House of Representatives in order to be passed by both chambers and signed into law.###"

http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-usda-under-secretary-bonnie-celebrate-irrigation-milestone-in-central-oregon,"Sisters, OR – Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley welcomed USDA Under Secretary for Farm Production and Conservation Robert Bonnie to Central Oregon to celebrate the completion of a major modernization effort at Three Sisters Irrigation District (TSID).  The project utilized federal funding Merkley secured as a member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee.TSID’s 25-year effort to upgrade its water delivery system replaced over sixty miles of leaky open canals with pressurized piped water, sharply reducing the amount of water needed for irrigation and eliminating the need for electricity to power pumps. The final project in the modernization effort is the addition of a 300kW McKenzie Hydropower Facility—the district’s third hydropower plant—which will generate enough energy to power approximately 100 homes and produce revenue to the district that will help offset the modernization costs.Merkley and Bonnie were in Sisters to celebrate the ribbon cutting of the new hydroelectric facility along with a number of partners and stakeholders who came together to ensure an adequate, dependable water supply for the 129 farms and over 7,500 irrigated acres TSID serves.“Modernizing our irrigation systems is one of the best investments we can make to strengthen our resilience to climate chaos and drought,” Merkley said. “Central Oregon has led the way and Three Sisters Irrigation District is a prime example, replacing more than 60 miles of open ditches and canals with pipes. The result: elimination of massive water loss from leakage and evaporation; pressurized pipes that end expensive on-farm pumping; clean energy from in-pipe hydro turbines; and more water for farmers and our rivers. Many people came together to turn this district into one of the most modernized in Oregon. Thank you to everyone who was involved and for USDA Under Secretary Bonnie for his support. I was proud to show him how Oregon does water conservation right.”“USDA is proud to be a partner in modernizing Central Oregon’s water infrastructure,” Under Secretary Bonnie said. Oregon’s producers are valuable stewards of the land, and the implementation of the new pressurized piping system at Three Sisters will further aid them in that effort by preventing water leakage and greatly reducing energy usage. Over 60 miles of new piping means that the 129 farms in the Three Sisters Irrigation District will have to worry a lot less about the amount of water they’ll be able to pump. I also can’t underscore the importance of the McKenzie Hydropower Facility enough. It will add another 1 million kWh of renewable energy each year for homes in the area and will make Three Sisters a carbon neutral irrigation district. A great example of how rural communities, stakeholders, and governments can come together to address climate change. Like at Three Sisters, USDA will continue to support Rural America in maintaining their local economies and self-sufficiency.”Other improvements that now make TSID one of the most modernized of the 40 irrigation districts in Oregon include: piping the district’s 64 miles of canals, installation of a Farmers Screen horizontal fish screen, on-farm improvements, and the implementation of fish-friendly hydropower.“I want to thank Senator Merkley and Under Secretary Bonnie for joining us to celebrate the completion of over twenty years of modernization efforts. With support from federal, state, and local partners, TSID has piped 62 miles of canals, constructed three hydropower facilities, and installed a state-of-the-art fish screen. Because of these efforts, TSID is able to reliably deliver water to our patrons, provide water in-stream, and reduce our energy bills through clean renewable energy,” said Mark Thalacker, District Manager, Three Sister Irrigation District.“Achieving full modernization in this district is really a great example of how the backbone of our country – agriculture – is leading the way to demonstrate the value of collaborative efforts that deliver real outcomes. The success of Three Sisters is the result of water users, conservationists, organizations, agencies, and political representatives working together to realize win-win solutions for farms, food and fish. Not only is the district saving nearly 60cfs of water each year, they’re also now generating enough renewable energy to be considered a carbon neutral district. With more than 900 modernization projects identified across other irrigation districts in Oregon, we’re excited about the example Three Sisters has set for other districts to follow in pursuit of irrigation modernization,” said Julie O'Shea, Executive Director of the Farmers Conservation Alliance.""TSID and our Central Oregon irrigation districts are some of the most innovative in the Western U.S. It's fitting and an honor to have Senator Merkley - who has led the charge towards securing important federal watershed funding - and Under Secretary Robert Bonnie - who oversees implementation of these watershed programs - join us at this celebration,” said Dan Keppen, Executive Director of Family Farm Alliance.“There are no shortage of good ideas out there, but what’s often missing is the spark—the early capital to turn ideas into action. In the Deschutes Basin and the Three Sisters Irrigation District, Energy Trust’s investment in irrigation modernization has been transformative and we have been honored to play the role of the spark,” said Michael Colgrove, Executive Director of the Energy Trust of Oregon.“We are proud to have been a part of this long-term partnership to restore flows, ensure reliable water for agriculture, and generate renewable energy. In addition to flow restoration, the collaborative partnership with the Deschutes Land Trust, the Upper Deschutes Watershed Council and others brought in the land conservation, habitat restoration, and fish passage projects necessary to revive Whychus Creek as an ecological gem within a thriving agricultural community. This is truly a multi-benefit story, and we celebrate the continued efforts of FCA, NRCS, and our federal delegation to fund additional conservation in the Deschutes Basin,” said Kate Fitzpatrick, Executive Director of the Deschutes River Conservancy.  ### "
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-26-million-to-rural-airports-for-crucial-safety-updates-22,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley today announced that Oregon airports in John Day, Klamath Falls, Aurora, Newport, Florence, Hood River, Creswell and Eugene will receive a combined $2.6 million from the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Airport Improvement Grant (AIG) and Airport Improvement Program (AIP) programs for crucial safety improvements to runways, weather reporting, snow removal and more.“Oregonians and small businesses in rural parts of the state count on safe and reliable air service for their products,” Wyden said. “I am gratified to see these federal dollars go toward improving critical airport safety infrastructure that are often taken for granted when flying. Investing in airport infrastructure lays the groundwork for smaller airports to continue to support Oregon’s jobs and economic growth in a global market.” “Whether flying for recreation or business, we all rely on safe and reliable travel,” Merkley said. “I am happy to see this funding going to airports across the state for improvements to help boost their operations. This funding will allow these airports to continue supporting the economy and businesses of Oregon and the regions they serve.” These AIG and AIP grant funds will be distributed as follows:“This grant award comes just in time as it will be used to replace an aging runway deicing truck,” said Eugene Airport Director Cathryn Stephens, A.A.E. “Updating our snow removal equipment fleet will ensure we will be ready for winter weather events in the future. We appreciate our Congressional Delegation’s ongoing commitment to safety and operational efficiency at EUG.”“The Aurora airport is one of Oregon’s busiest airports, and this funding will allow us to begin the design work to preserve the existing pavements at Aurora for the next two decades. We are grateful for the consistent support of our congressional delegation in securing these needed funds,” said Betty Stansbury, Director at the Oregon Department of Aviation."
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-announces-major-investments-to-support-agriculture-andrural-communities-in-oregon,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley today announced he secured major investments in Oregon agriculture, rural housing, food assistance, and rural business priorities through the FY23 Senate Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies bill.“As I hold a town hall in each of Oregon’s 36 counties every year, I hear from folks in every corner of the state about what matters most to them, including ensuring our world-class agriculture sector has the support it needs to grow and thrive,” Merkley, who previously served as the top Democrat on the subcommittee that writes the bill, said. “The agriculture bill I championed includes significant investments for family farms, rural housing, food assistance, habitat restoration, and wildfire smoke recovery. The legislation also prioritizes making Oregon’s agriculture more resilient to the impacts of climate chaos to protect the livelihoods of our farmers, ranchers, and producers. I will keep pushing this critical legislation through the Appropriations process to benefit farms and families in every corner of the state.”Merkley is the only Oregon member of Congress from either chamber since Senator Mark Hatfield to serve on the Appropriations Committee, considered to be one of the most powerful on Capitol Hill. He joined the committee in 2013 so that Oregon would have a strong voice in decisions about the investments our nation should be making.Key elements in the agriculture funding legislation includes:Water Conservation and Habitat Restoration: The bill includes a $175 million, a $75 million increase, for the Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations. This funding used to replace open irrigation ditches with pipes is crucial for irrigation districts that need to improve water efficiency and conservation or otherwise improve fish and wildlife habitat. This program is providing critical funding for the collaborative processes underway across the state working to conserve water and keep Oregon’s family farms in business while improving the habitats of endangered species.Wine Grape Smoke Exposure Research: The unprecedented wildfire seasons of recent years have blanketed much of the state of Oregon with dense, hazardous smoke, which has significantly impacted Oregon’s wine grape harvest. To better understand the challenges facing Oregon’s wine growers, the bill includes $5 million for research into smoke-impacted grapes at Oregon State University (OSU) and other West Coast universities.Rural Energy Saving Program: The bill increases the funding available for the energy efficiency upgrades from $11.5 million to $13 million. The program, which provides funding to rural utilities and other companies to increase energy efficiency, was created by Senator Merkley when he was the top Democrat on the Agriculture subcommittee.Oregon Agricultural Research and Facilities Investment: The Agricultural Research Service received an increase of $161 million in funding for cutting-edge research to improve the productivity, sustainability, and health of the nation’s agricultural systems. In addition, Merkley was able to secure funding for key Oregon agriculture research programs, including funding for research on the Sudden Oak Death pathogen plaguing the south coast. Other research funding victories include research for alfalfa, barley, tree fruits, pear, wheat, hops, hemp, apple, shellfish, small fruits, seaweed, floriculture, nurseries, and rangeland ecology. The bill also includes funding for facilities improvements at the Corvallis, Burns, Pendleton ARS Stations.Western Rangeland Livestock: The bill includes $1.5 million for the Western Rangeland Precision Livestock center to develop precision-based nutrition strategies for rangeland-based livestock, as well as technology-based rangeland and livestock management strategies to optimize the health and productivity of Western rangeland-based livestock and the rangeland ecosystem. This funding will be split among land grant universities in Oregon, Montana, and Wisconsin.Rangeland Precision Livestock Management: The bill includes $3 million to promote economically efficient and environmentally responsive livestock production systems for the Western rangeland. The bill supports precision nutrition strategies for rangeland-based livestock as well as technology-based rangeland and livestock management strategies to optimize the health and productivity of Western rangeland ecosystem.Rural Housing: The bill includes $1.487 billion for rental assistance and $50 million for Rural Housing Service Vouchers, which will help address the urgent housing crisis facing Oregon’s rural communities.Rural Development: The bill includes funding for a number of USDA’s Rural Development programs, including rural housing and business development programs. These programs make billions of dollars of investments in rural America every year. Total funding for the Rural Development mission area is $4.4 billion, or a $401 million increase over fiscal year 2022.Summer EBT: The bill continues funding the Summer EBT program at $50 million. This program has provided much-needed nutrition for Oregon families during the summer months when schools are not in session.Food Corps: The bill provides an increase of $500,000 for Food and Agriculture Service Learning. This program helps improve education resources for healthy eating especially among children.Hemp: The bill provides $4 million for Agricultural Research Services to partner with institutions conducting biotech and genomics research to improve hemp genetic research and breeding with new techniques. Hemp has already quickly become one of Oregon’s leading cash crops, and many feel it has the potential to bring in more than $1 billion in sales to Oregon in the coming years with a fair and reasonable regulatory framework.The next step for the bill is merging with a counterpart bill from the U.S. House of Representatives in order to be passed by both chambers and signed into law.###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-announces-essential-investments-in-oregon-families,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley today announced critical investments in housing, health care, mental health, and education for Oregon families through FY23 Senate Appropriations bills.""At a time when working families are struggling with rising prices on everything from rent to prescription drugs to gas and groceries, it’s critical that our nation prioritizes quality, affordable health care, housing, and education—and that’s exactly what these new funding bills do,” Merkley said. “The legislation includes significant investments in federal programs that support affordable housing, health care, research, and education, which will have a big impact for families across Oregon. This bill delivers in a big way for our state and the nation, and I’ll keep pushing to ensure these critical investments become reality.”Merkley is the only Oregon member of Congress from either chamber since Senator Mark Hatfield to serve on the Appropriations Committee, considered to be one of the most powerful on Capitol Hill. He joined the committee in 2013 so that Oregon would have a strong voice in decisions about the investments our nation should be making.Key elements to benefit Oregon families that Merkley fought to include in the funding bills include:HousingAffordable Housing: As rural and urban communities across Oregon continue to experience housing crises, the bill includes an increase for affordable housing programs for some of Oregon’s most vulnerable people—low-income families, seniors, and people with disabilities, including $14.7 billion for housing unit specific rental assistance. The bill also protects funding for housing programs that benefit the elderly and people with disabilities.Fair Market Rents: Building on significant positive fair market rent changes due to Merkley’s language in the fiscal year 2018 bill, the bill sets a 90-day timeline for the Department of Housing and Urban Development to find better ways to measure the fair and accurate cost of a rental unit. This is a significant step forward in the battle to address the affordable housing crisis by ensuring that vouchers keep pace with the real cost of rent in competitive rental markets. Rural Housing: The Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) and Rural Capacity Building Program received $17 million and $6 million, respectively. SHOP provides funds for non-profit sweat-equity homebuilders, such as Habitat for Humanity, to cover land purchases and infrastructure costs. The Rural Capacity funds are intended to build the capacity of rural low-income housing non-profits by providing training, information, technical assistance, and financing.HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing: The program received an additional $85 million to provide rental assistance vouchers for homeless veterans, along with case management and clinical services. This increase will provide an estimated 7,460 new rent vouchers for veterans experiencing homelessness, and when combined with prior year appropriations and available unleased vouchers, has the potential to eliminate veteran homelessness based on the most recent complete data available.  These vouchers have been critical to reducing veterans' homelessness by 49 percent since 2010.Homeless Assistance and Prevention: The bill includes $3.55billion for Homeless Assistance Grants, a $340 million increase that will benefit organizations across Oregon. Within that appropriation, rapid rehousing programs for victims of domestic violence received an additional $53 million; homeless youth programs received $107 million; and Emergency Solutions Grants—particularly important to the Portland metro area—received $290million to support street outreach, emergency shelter, homelessness prevention, rapid re-housing assistance.HOME Investment Partnerships Program: The bill includes $1.725 billion for the program to provide states and localities with flexible resources to respond to their affordable housing challenges, including rental housing and paths to homeownership for low-income families.Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation: The program, also known as NeighborWorks America, received $170 million. The national nonprofit offers support for affordable housing and community development through public-private partnerships. President Trump’s proposal would have eliminated this program, crippling its six locations across Oregon.Community Development: the bipartisan bill includes $3.5 billion for the Community Development Block Grant Program. This program funds vital housing rehabilitation, supportive services, public improvements and economic development projects in communities across Oregon and the nation while encouraging local investment.Health Care Nursing: The bill includes $318 million to support nurses in Oregon and across the country. Merkley led 40 senators in a letter to the committee leaders to push for an increase in federal funding for nursing workforce development programs.Reproductive Health Care: The bill includes increases in funding for the full scope of reproductive health care programs, including nearly double funding for the Title X Family Planning Program and $130 million for teen pregnancy prevention. Child and Maternal Health: The bill includes $1.25 billion for programs to improve maternal and child health, including $496 million to combat this country’s maternal mortality crisis and $25 million in new funding to increase training and support for Certified Nurse Midwives with a focus on practitioners working in rural and underserved communities.Mental and Behavioral Health Care: The bill includes $1.42 billion for the Mental Health Block Grant to improve community mental health services in all 50 states. Oregon benefited from over $22 million in program funding in years prior. The bill includes an increase of $625 million for suicide prevention programs, including increased funding for the 9-8-8 and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.Medical Research: The bill includes a $2 billion increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health, totaling $48 billion in the fight against cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and other devastating diseases. The bill also includes funding to further research and provide a more comprehensive understanding of COVID-19, including susceptibility and long COVID.Community Health Centers: The bill includes $1.92 billion in funding to support ongoing efforts to increase accessibility of medical services through community health centers. These centers serve a vital role in ensuring access to primary care for underserved communities.Rebuilding our Public Health System: Bolstering our public health infrastructure is a matter of both public health and national security, and this bill includes a $2 billion increase for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to address the current COVID-19 pandemic and respond to future public health challenges. The bill also includes flexible funding for federal agencies to assess and respond to monkeypox virus (MPV) in Oregon and nationwide.Education Institute of Education Sciences: The bill includes $831million to support innovation, research, and evaluation in education, including evaluating strategies to combat learning loss from the COVID-19 pandemic. Merkley led 19 senators in a letter to the committee advocating for this investment.Migrant Education: The bill includes over $59 million for programs for migrant students and seasonal farmworkers. Through this program, higher education and non-profit organizations can receive funding to give migrant and seasonal farmworkers and their children the opportunity to attend higher education or earn their GED. Oregon State University, Chemeketa Community College, Portland Community College, Treasure Valley Community College, and community-based organizations in Oregon receive funds through this program.Accessible Education: The bill includes $15.3 billion, a $1.9 billion increase, for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) state grants program, including funding to assist states in providing a free, appropriate education for children with disabilities and provide support services for over 7.6 million students nationwide.Student Support: The bill includes $1.275 billion for TRIO, a suite of eight educational programs that supports students from first-generation college students and individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds; as the first person in his family to go to college, Merkley knows firsthand the value of this type of support and has been a fierce advocate for the funding. The bill also includes a $500 increase in the maximum Pell Grant award, the cornerstone of student financial aid, which would increase the total maximum Pell grant award to $7,395 for the 2023 – 2024 school year.Career Training: The bill includes $2.2 billion, a $155 million increase, for Career, Technical and Adult Education, which supports the workforce and economy by training young people to fill in-demand, twenty-first century jobs.Community Services Block Grants: The bill includes $770 million for the program which provides critical support for rural Oregon communities. Merkley led 30 senators in a letter to the committee pushing to preserve and increase funding for the program.Community Service: The bill funds AmeriCorps VISTA volunteers at $105 million; Senior Corps programs at $240 million; and State AmeriCorps grants at $492million.The next step for the bill is merging with a counterpart bill from the U.S. House of Representatives in order to be passed by both chambers and signed into law.###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-champion-critical-projects-for-oregon-communities-in-federal-funding-bills,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden today announced they secured funding for essential community projects across Oregon in the Fiscal Year 2023 Senate Appropriations bills. A total of 111 Oregon community-initiated projects were included in the FY23 federal funding bills that will help meet critical needs in every corner of the state, including investing in wildfire and drought resiliency, affordable housing, health care, education, and much more, while creating essential services and jobs.“No one knows the unique needs of communities across Oregon like the folks living and working in them,” said Merkley, who helped drive inclusion of Oregon projects as the only Oregon member of Congress from either chamber to serve on the Appropriations Committee since Senator Mark Hatfield.“I joined the Committee in 2013 to ensure Oregon has a strong voice in decisions about our nation’s investments. Community-initiated projects are an incredible example of this, because these local and regional projects were generated at the ground level by folks who are working to make their communities better. I am pleased to have worked with my colleagues on the committee and Senator Wyden to secure funding for 111 of these important homegrown projects, and we’ll keep pushing to get them across the finish line for Oregonians.”“Oregonians have consistently told me during more than 1,000 town halls in each of our 36 counties how federal investments should reflect their priorities to generate jobs in their communities, keep everybody safe and build an even stronger quality of life across the state,” Wyden said. “I’m gratified the teamwork with Oregonians who know their local priorities best has produced such promising federal investments to strengthen communities all across Oregon. Bottom line, our state’s communities are focused on coming together to forge Oregon Way solutions that build a better state just like these targeted investments, and I’ll keep battling to make sure these projects advance.”Both Senator Merkley and Senator Wyden hold a town hall in each Oregon county every year and work hard to ensure that local feedback informs every aspect of their work in Washington, D.C. This local feedback is directly reflected in the projects that were chosen for potential federal funding in this year’s bills.Because of Senator Merkley’s position on the powerful Appropriations Committee and key role pushing Oregon priorities in the drafting of the bills, and the collaborative way that Senator Merkley and Wyden work together to advocate for projects from Oregon, last year the two senators were able to secure more projects for their home state than any other senators besides Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.The 111 Oregon community-initiated projects were spread out among bills produced by the Appropriations subcommittees, including 20 projects in the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies subcommittee, of which Senator Merkley is Chair. The Senate bills next need to be merged with legislation produced by the House of Representatives, a process expected later in the year. The Senators will continue to advocate that the Oregon projects are included in the combined bill.The funds and projects secured by Senators Merkley and Wyden, broken down by region, are as follows: Oregon Coast:Click HERE for quotes from Oregon Coast community-initiated project recipients Metro: Click HERE for quotes from the metro area community-initiated project recipients Willamette Valley:Click HERE for quotes from Willamette Valley region community-initiated project recipientsMid-Columbia/Central Oregon:Click HERE for quotes from community-initiated project recipients in the Mid-Columbia and Central Oregon regions Eastern Oregon: Click HERE for quotes from Eastern Oregon community-initiated project recipients Southern Oregon:Click HERE for quotes from Southern Oregon community-initiated project recipients ###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-colleagues-reintroduce-legislation-to-fight-discrimination-from-financial-institutions-22,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley today joined colleagues to reintroduce legislation that prohibits banks and other financial institutions from discriminating in Oregon and nationwide on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.“It’s appalling that in the 21st century, Americans still experience discrimination while opening a bank account, applying for a mortgage, or simply setting foot inside a bank,” Wyden said. “The Fair Access to Financial Services Act will hold financial institutions accountable for their discriminatory actions and I am committed to getting this piece of legislation signed into law.”“It’s outrageous that in 2022 Americans are still facing discrimination in financial services,” Merkley said. “We know that financial institutions have engaged in racial profiling in everything from standing in a bank to mass denial of home refinancing applications only for Black applicants. The clear lack of equity for who can access full banking services is yet another contributor to wealth inequality in America. I will continue to work hard to get this legislation passed into law and protect all Americans from discrimination accessing banking services and in every area of their lives.”The Fair Access to Financial Services Act will ensure that all people receive equal treatment when trying to have access to services at financial institutions, and hold these institutions accountable for discriminatory practices.Many of the nation’s largest banks have come under fire recently for racial profiling and other discriminatory practices. JP Morgan Chase Bank is being sued for refusing to open a bank account for a Black customer late last year. Bank of America recently apologized to film director Ryan Coogler after wrongfully assuming he was a bank robber. Wells Fargo came under scrutiny earlier this year for denying more than half of all Black refinancing applicants in 2020. The legislation was led by U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. Alongside Wyden and Merkley, the bill was cosponsored by U.S. Senators Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., Bob Menendez, D-N.J., Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., Cory Booker, D-N.J., Tina Smith, D-Minn., Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Alex Padilla, D-Calif., Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., Ed Markey, D-Mass., Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M.The bill has been endorsed by the National Urban League, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the Center for Responsible Lending, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, UnidosUS, the National Consumer Law Center, and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.The bill text can be found here.A one pager of the bill is here.

http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-join-colleagues-in-urging-biden-administration-to-extend-pause-on-student-loan-payments,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden, ahead of the federal student loan payment pause set to expire at the end of next month, joined a bicameral letter led by Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), alongside Representatives Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.-14), Tony Cardenas (D-Calif.-29), and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.-07), in urging the Biden administration to extend the student loan payment pause beyond August 31, 2022. This effort comes following several news reports that the Biden administration has not made a final decision about whether to extend the student loan payment pause – a decision that will affect millions of student loan borrowers.“For over two years, the Department has provided critical flexibility to millions of federal student loan borrowers by pausing payments, as many have struggled during the COVID-19 pandemic. This much needed pause has helped many borrowers to keep a roof over their heads, secure childcare, and purchase food, health care, and medicine during the course of a pandemic responsible for the deaths of more than 1 million people in the U.S.,” wrote more than 100 lawmakers to President Joe Biden and Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “For the first time, many borrowers have had the opportunity to pay down debt, open a savings account, purchase a home, and save for retirement—none of which would have been possible without the payment pause.”The lawmakers emphasized how resuming student loan payments would force millions of borrowers to choose between paying their loans or putting a roof over their heads, food on the table, or paying for childcare and health care—while costs continue to rise and while yet another COVID-19 variant increases hospitalizations nationwide.“Despite significant decreases over the last month, gas prices are still high, and many borrowers still have to pay exorbitant amounts each week in order to commute to their jobs. Food prices remain high, as suppliers contend with ongoing supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine. We still have a significant childcare crisis throughout the country, which has caused already-high costs to spike to 40% of their pre-pandemic levels,” the lawmakers added. “Low-income borrowers, Black and Brown borrowers, and women borrowers still face severe financial hardships as COVID-19 continues to infect individuals throughout the country and exacerbate existing inequities.”The lawmakers concluded by pointing out how resuming student loan payments at this moment would further complicate administrative actions already underway at the U.S. Department of Education. All federal student loan borrowers are in limbo as they await upcoming actions from the Department of Education or their federal student loan servicer.Merkley and Wyden have long called on the Biden administration to extend the student loan payment pause and to deliver relief to student borrowers. In April, the Senators joined a letter calling on the Departments of Education and Justice to follow through on their pledge to improve the handling of student debt bankruptcy claims. Around the same time, the Senators also joined in calling on President Biden to extend the student loan payment pause and to provide meaningful relief to student borrowers.In addition to Merkley and Wyden, the letter is led by Senators Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Elizabethe Warren (D-Mass.), and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and joined by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).Joining Underwood, Cárdenas, and Pressley in the House in signing the letter are: Reps.

Despite repeated reports and surveys concerning whether borrowers will be able to pay,1 we understand the Administration is considering restarting student loan payments at the end of August.2 We write today to urge you to extend the pause on student loan payments, given the numerous economic issues facing borrowers across the nation, as well as administrative actions in process by the Department of Education.For over two years, the Department has provided critical flexibility to millions of federal student loan borrowers by pausing payments, as many have struggled during the COVID-19 pandemic. This much needed pause has helped many borrowers to keep a roof over their heads, secure childcare, and purchase food, health care, and medicine during the course of a pandemic responsible for the deaths of more than 1 million people in the U.S.3 For the first time, many borrowers have had the opportunity to pay down debt, open a savings account, purchase a home, and save for retirement—none of which would have been possible without the payment pause.4Resuming student loan payments would force millions of borrowers to choose between paying their federal student loans or putting a roof over their heads, food on the table, or paying for childcare and health care—while costs continue to rise and while yet another COVID-19 variant increases hospitalizations nationwide. Despite significant decreases over the last month, gas prices are still high, and many borrowers still have to pay exorbitant amounts each week in order to commute to their jobs.5 Food prices remain high, as suppliers contend with ongoing supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine.6 We still have a significant childcare crisis throughout the country, which has caused already-high costs to spike to 40% of their pre-pandemic levels.7 Low-income borrowers, Black and Brown borrowers, and women borrowers still face severe financial hardships as COVID-19 continues to infect individuals throughout the country and exacerbate existing inequities.8Moreover, resuming student loan payments at this moment would further complicate administrative actions already underway or contemplated by the Department—which could contribute to unnecessary confusion for borrowers in the upcoming months. Currently, many borrowers are in limbo as they await upcoming actions from the Department or their federal student loan servicer—either through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) waiver or through the one-time account adjustments announced by Ed on April 19, 2022 that would count past periods of forbearance or deferment.9Accordingly, we ask that the Administration continue to keep federal student loan payments paused.Sincerely,###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-welcome-federal-approval-of-oregons-state-meat-inspection-program-22,"Washington, D.C. –
U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley today welcomed approval by the United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA) of Oregon’s rules and regulations for a
state meat inspection program that meets USDA standards.The USDA
approval follows a letter
from Wyden and Merkley to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, as well as months
of follow-up and discussion, pressing for a review of the state meat inspection
program. The Oregon senators noted in their letter that large meat packing
facilities have been hurt by the pandemic and left unable to process livestock,
putting Oregon farmers and ranchers at risk of losing their businesses, and
families unable to have access to affordable food.“Today’s
announcement is great news for Oregon farmers and ranchers as well as for
Oregon consumers facing the uncertainty of supply chain disruptions driving up
the costs at the grocery store for our state’s world-renowned beef,” Wyden
said. “This USDA approval will open up
more processing options for our state’s hard-working agricultural producers,
 helping them to build on the strengths of their local small businesses
that generate jobs and economic activity in rural communities throughout
Oregon.”“This announcement
is great news for Oregonians,” said Senator Merkley. “This approval will help Oregon farmers and
ranchers process their livestock locally and provide affordable food to all
Oregonians. Our ranchers and farmers are vital to a strong economy in Oregon,
and I am happy to see that the USDA approved Oregon’s meat inspection program.”The agreement between the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection
Service and Oregon lets the state program inspect meat products produced for
shipment within the state. Under the cooperative agreement, the state
inspection program must develop, administer, and enforce requirements “at least
equal to” those imposed under the Federal Meat Inspection Act.”The approval of the
State of Oregon’s Meat Inspection program is nothing short of AMAZING for the
potential it brings for our farmers and ranchers across our state for
processing and increased economic opportunities within our state,” said
Lauren Henderson, Deputy Director for the Oregon Department of Agriculture. “This effort has been in the making for
several years and is a result of collaborative work between our federal
delegation, state and local officials, and our agricultural partners.“This is great news
for Oregon ranchers who will now have more options for selling their cattle
into markets. This is a great value add to beef raised in Oregon,” said
State Rep. Mark Owens (R-Crane). “During
COVID, it became evident that our meat processing infrastructure lacked the
flexibility we needed. We need to keep our rural ag producers in business, and
feed hungry Oregonians. I want to personally thank both our Senators for their
continued advocacy for rural Oregon communities.”  “I appreciate
Senators Wyden and Merkley for their assistance with USDA’s regulation and
rulemaking for Oregon’s State Meat Inspection Program,” said State
Representative David Brock Smith (R-Port Orford). “Having drafted the state bill back in the ‘17 Legislative Session,
Covid exposed the protein supply chain issues across the country. Working with
legislative leadership, I was able to redraft the bill and move HB
4206 during the first Special Session of 2020, which passed both chambers
unanimously. I’m grateful for Assistant Director Henderson and ODA staff for
all of their fantastic work as well as Rep. Owens and my colleagues for their
support. This will be a game changer for Oregon ranchers and assist them in
providing locally sourced beef, lamb and protein to consumers across the State
of Oregon,” “The signing today
between the USDA and the State of Oregon of the Cooperative Agreement for State
Meat Inspection is definitely a monumental positive milestone in the pursuit of
food security and sustainability for Oregonians,” said long-time Eastern Oregon rancher
Curtis Martin, board member and treasurer of the Oregon Beef Council. “This agreement is a critical step towards
locally sourced meat protein being more available to our great Oregon consumers
and customers. Oregon beef and meat producers raise the highest quality
protein, and this partnership will help provide the increased economy, transparency
from growers, plus reliability with sustainable pricing to
consumers. I tremendously appreciate Oregon's legislative team for
the long endurance it has taken to finally achieve this totally positive,
proactive agreement after decades of trying to make it happen. As an Oregon grassroots beef producer, I
extend my utmost, heartfelt thanks to the Oregon Department of Agriculture,
Senators Wyden and Merkley, their staff and all who persevered to see this
through. A great accomplishment,
for sure.”“I appreciate any
options to connect producers with consumers and introduce competitiveness into
the marketplace,” said third-generation Gilliam County rancher Tom
Rietmann. “Processing closer to our
ranches has a lower carbon footprint and it’s better for the cattle.  In
my situation, having more timely access to processing would have saved me
thousands of dollars this year. Better access to meat processing facilities is
a win-win for everyone.” ""This program
is a huge win, decades in the making,"" said Susannah Morgan, Oregon
Food Bank CEO. ""This program marks
a major milestone for community agriculture in Oregon, and will benefit
all Oregonians – most notably those among us facing hunger by addressing
climbing food prices and creating pathways for local producers to donate meat
to the Oregon Food Bank Network. By reducing systemic barriers and increasing
access to food, we can ensure our communities have the food they need to not
only survive but thrive.""

http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senate-passes-water-infrastructure-bill-critical-step-towards-modernizing-oregons-waterways-and-ports,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden today announced Senate passage of critical priorities for Oregon that were included in the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2022.“For much of Oregon, our coast and our rivers are the beating heart of our communities, and whether the ports, levees, dams, and other water infrastructure are up to snuff can dictate whether families and business thrive or are at risk from extreme weather events. That’s why I fought so hard to make sure this bill delivers for Oregon,” said Merkley, who serves on the committee that writes the bill. “The Senate’s WRDA supports Oregon’s 23 working ports – making sure they are properly maintained and continue to serve the families and businesses who depend on them for a living, while keeping workers and communities safe. The bill also authorizes investments in flood management – something that our nation will need even more as we continue to fight climate chaos and make our communities more resilient for the future.”“Modern water infrastructure throughout Oregon is vital to quality of life in communities statewide that rely on ports, levees and dams for jobs, economic activity, flood protection and more,” Wyden said. “This bill achieves those goals for Oregonians counting on these federal investments in communities large and small to build an even stronger and safer state along the Coast and waterways in every part of Oregon.”WRDA ‘22 also continues Merkley’s work to require the federal government to finally fulfill its promise to replace tribal housing that was displaced by the creation of the Dalles Dam in the 1950s.Some of the Oregon projects and policy initiatives in the bill include:Columbia River Tribal Housing Following the 2018 WRDA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) was required to create tribal housing for displaced tribal people of the Columbia River caused by the development of The Dalles Dam. The Corps responded to a 2018 congressional authorization by producing replacement village options that were not mutually acceptable to Columbia River treaty tribes. The 2022 WRDA would require the Corps to revise and then carry out the village development plan for Dalles Dam, Columbia River, Washington and Oregon to address the impacts to Indian villages and housing sites that resulted from construction of multiple dams by the Corps in the Columbia River Basin.Portland Metro Levee System - Authorization of Portland Metro Levee System Chief’s ReportAuthorization of the Army Corps of Engineers Portland Metro Levee System Chief’s Report will reduce flood risk and increase the resiliency and reliability of the 27-mile levee system along the Columbia River in the Portland metro area. The total cost of the project is $110, 498,000 and it has a benefit-to-cost ratio of 3.7 to 1.Ecosystem Restoration General Investigation Feasibility Study for the Mill Creek Levee Project on the Walla Walla RiverThe Army Corps of Engineers constructed the Milton-Freewater Levee project for flood control purposes in 1951. The project reduced the historic 5-mile floodplain width to approximately 200 feet and has since impacted ecological functions within the reach. To address these ecological impacts, a feasibility study is requested to identify actions to improve floodplain-riverine processes, stop channel incision, enhance fish passage and rearing habitat, and decrease surface water seepage while having no negative impacts and likely improving flood risk management.Nationwide Low-Head Dam InventoryLow-head dams are engineered structures built into and across stream and river channels for a variety of important purposes. In the 1800s, low head dams were constructed across rivers and streams nationwide to provide services such as diverting water for irrigation or municipal and industrial water uses. Others are in place to prevent erosion of embankments or to control flooding impacts. The structures are numerous and widespread. Nicknamed “drowning machines,” low-head dams have proven over time to be extremely hazardous to public safety, as well as having negative impacts on fish populations and ecosystems. The bill would establish a Nationwide Low-Head Dam Inventory and a State Low-Head Dam Inventory and Rehabilitation Program to be administered by the USACE in coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Bureau of Reclamation.Lane County Environmental Infrastructure (Sec. 219) AuthorizationThe bill adds Lane County to the list of eligible entities to receive Section 219 (Environmental Infrastructure) funding from the USACE. This authorization will allow Lane County to pursue critical USACE assistance and funding to support water supply and storage, treatment and distribution systems, and wastewater treatment systems.The Senate and House will now work to merge the bills.###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-announces-investments-to-protect-oregon-communities-and-forests-from-wildfires-modernize-water-infrastructure-and-strengthen-the-environment,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley today announced major investments to support Oregon communities, strengthen forest health, protect public lands and the environment, tackle climate chaos, boost important programs for tribes, and more through the FY23 Senate Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations bill.As the Chair of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, Merkley drafted this bill and ensured that priorities for communities in every corner of Oregon were included.“All Americans deserve clean air and water, healthy forests and ecosystems, and infrastructure that works for them, no matter where they live. As Chair of the Senate Interior Subcommittee on Appropriations, I am in the driver’s seat to help achieve this mission—and this bill delivers,” Merkley said. “The legislation I wrote, which is built on the input of Oregonians from across the state, funds programs that modernize our water systems, combat climate chaos, champion critical projects long-sought by our communities and tribes and so much more, all while creating good-paying jobs. And at a time when wildfires are an ever-growing threat to our state, this bill makes big investments in preventing and fighting dangerous megafires. I am excited to see how these investments will play a key role in strengthening our state for generations to come.”The Interior bill also includes funding to support wildfire management, as well as providing funding to support efforts to address the water crisis in the Klamath Basin. Key elements of the legislation that will impact Oregon include:Wildland Firefighting, Personnel and Preparedness: The bill provides a total of $4.4 billion for wildfire suppression, of which $2.55 billion is provided to the Wildfire Suppression Operations Reserve Fund and $450 million is provided as an emergency supplemental. This is $550 million (14 percent) more than fiscal year 2022. Since the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (Public Law 115-141), which authorized the Reserve Fund, the average annual cost of suppression has exceeded assumptions that informed the funding levels currently assumed in the Reserve Fund. Fiscal year 2021 was the most expensive year on record, for the first-time costs exceeding $4 billion, and fiscal year 2022 is tracking similar year-to-date expenditures. The additional $450 million in emergency supplemental funding was calculated based on actual average costs of firefighting in the 4 years since enactment of the Reserve Fund. This additional funding gives the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior an assured amount of funding to be used when regular appropriated funds are spent. The bill also increases funds for converting seasonal firefighters to full-time wildland fire positions at the U.S. Forest Service and Interior Department, and provides $514 million for hazardous fuels management across both agencies, a $100 million increase.Wildfire Smoke Mitigation: The bill provides $10 million, an increase of $6 million over FY22, for the EPA wildfire grant program Senator Merkley established last year to support local efforts to prepare for and protect against wildfire smoke hazards, for example by developing smoke mitigation and filtration plans for schools and community buildings.Forest Restoration: The bill builds on Senator Merkley’s priorities for the Forest Service, including $28 million for the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration (CFLR) program. This funding will allow the works five collaboratives across the state to continue: Northern Blues Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, Southern Blues Restoration Coalition Collaborative Landscape Restoration Project, Deschutes Collaborative Forest Project, Lakeview Collaborative Landscape Restoration Project, and Rogue Basin Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Project. The bill also provides $2 million to respond to requests from smaller local organizations that need financial assistance to collaborate on restoration projects.Outdoor Recreation: The bill continues significant investments in the outdoor recreational economy. The bill provides $124 million for Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management recreation and wilderness programs and $20 million to enhance trails on Forest Service lands. The bill also provides $11.5 million for the Rivers, Trains, and Conservation Assistance (RTCA) program at the National Park Service, which helps local communities plan and implement outdoor recreation projects, and provides $200 million through the Land and Water Conservation Fund State Conservation formula grants and $125 million for Outdoor Recreation Legacy competitive grants, which fund recreational projects at the state and local level.Climate Chaos: To bolster executive action to tackle the climate crisis, the bill includes $656 million, an increase of $231 million and more than 50% over FY22, for Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) climate and clean air programs. These funds will support EPA efforts to reduce the greenhouse gas pollution that is driving climate chaos. The increased funding will also support efforts to protect clean air and make major investments in expanded community-level air quality monitoring to better identify and address pollution hot spots.Environmental Justice: The bill provides $180 million for the EPA’s Environmental Justice program, an increase of $80 million from FY22’s already record levels. These resources will fund external grants for community-led initiatives as well as dramatically expand EPA’s ability to engage directly with communities to ensure they have a voice in EPA decision-making and have access to EPA programs, grants, and technical assistance to address environmental and public health challenges. The bill also fully funds the budget request for EPA’s enforcement and compliance programs by providing $436 million (an increase of $70 million over FY22) to better protect overburdened and vulnerable communities from illegal pollution.Environmental Protection Priorities: Senator Merkley included several environmental priorities in the bill that he has been championing for Oregonians, including: a directive to spend no less than $10 million for monarch butterfly conservation activities in FY23; language and funding pressing EPA to bolster its efforts to address plastics pollution, including updating minimum recycled content guidelines; and $163 million (an increase of $65 million) to fund the EPA’s toxic chemicals program, which is responsible for rulemakings to address asbestos among other chemicals.Water Infrastructure: The bill includes $75 million in critical water infrastructure loan programs under theWater Infrastructure Financing Innovation Authority (WIFIA) Act. Merkley authored the WIFIA program in 2012, working to ensure public drinking water and wastewater infrastructure are well-maintained to support public health and safety, strong local businesses, population growth, and clean rivers and aquifers. WIFIA was passed into law as part of the 2014 Water Resources Development Act. (WRDA). In total, the bill includes over $3.2 billion in loans and grants to support water infrastructure projects.Klamath Basin Water and Wildlife Conservation: As a key part of Senator Merkley’s continued efforts toward a long-term solution in the Klamath Basin, he included $20.6 million for water monitoring efforts and conservation, including fish and wildlife habitat restoration, which is a $5 million increase compared to last year.Saline Lakes: The bill provides $2 million to expand a U.S. Geological Survey water monitoring assessment effort for saline lakes in the Great Basin, like Lake Abert.Columbia River Treaty Fishing Access Sites: The bill provides $4.5 million for Columbia River In-Lieu Treaty Sites, including $1.3 million for fishing sites construction, to implement Senator Merkley’s Columbia River In-Lieu and Treaty Fishing Access Sites Improvement Act.Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF): The bill provides $900 million, as required by the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) for the LWCF. For over 50 years the program has been the main source of funding for federal land and water acquisitions. Acquiring and protecting public lands not only provides environmental and recreational benefits, but also creates jobs in the tourism, recreation, timber, fishing, and other natural resource sectors. This includes acquisitions at Pipe Fork-Port Orford Cedar Research Natural Area ($500,000), Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument ($1.2 million), and in the Umatilla National Forest ($10 million).National Parks and Monuments: Within the Great American Outdoors Act Legacy Restoration Fund, the bill allocates, $9.5 million to fund maintenance at Yaquina Head, $7 million to replace the boiler at Timberline Lodge, $400,000 to replace the roof at the Siuslaw Visitor Center, and $10 million to address deferred maintenance at National Forests across Oregon and the Pacific Northwest. The bill also includes $68.3 million for BLM’s National Conservation Lands and directs BLM to prioritize management planning for Cascade-Siskiyou—this account has historically been underfunded and additional resources will be used for many projects, including recreation and management planning for new, expanded, and restored monuments.Tribal Programs and Services: The bill includes $11.4 billion in critical funding for tribal communities across the country, and for the first time, $8 million to establish the Indian Reservation Drinking Water Program, which will address water infrastructure challenges like those faced by the Warm Springs reservation. The bill also provides an advance appropriation in FY24 for the Indian Health Service (IHS) to protect health care services funded by IHS to over 2.5 million Native Americans from future lapses in funding due to government shutdowns and unpredictable budget years. The bill also provides $8 million to expand tribal law enforcement programs to tribes that have historically been excluded from the programs, like The Klamath Tribes, the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde Reservation, Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians, and the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians.Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Act (FRIMA): The bill provides $5 million in new funding to implement FRIMA, for fish passage devices, fish screens and other related features to mitigate water diversion impacts on fisheries in Oregon, Washington, Montana, Idaho, and California. FRIMA is an important tool to conserve and restore native anadromous and resident fish populations in the Pacific Northwest. Funding for the program lapsed in 2015 and, for the first time since, the Interior bill proposes restoring funding.Monarch Butterflies: The bill includes a directive for the Fish and Wildlife Service to spend no less than $10 million for conservation activities for monarch butterflies and other pollinators. This funding will go to continue to support the outcomes from Senator Merkley’s Monarch Summit.Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT): The bill includes $515 million for the PILT program to fund vital services for rural communities, including public safety, social services, transportation and housing. This funding goes to Oregon counties that have large tracts of federal land.Community-Initiated Projects: In addition to the funding allotments above, Merkley wrote into the bill federal funding for specific conservation, water infrastructure, and other projects sought by communities across Oregon. Those funds and community-initiated projects, which he advocated for with Senator Ron Wyden, include:“Once again, Senators Merkley and Wyden have stepped up to help the Warm Springs Tribe address its ongoing water crisis. This legislation would allow the Tribe to dramatically improve reliable access to clean, running water to thousands of people living on the Warm Springs Reservation,” said Tribal Council Chairman, Jonathan Smith.“Talent Irrigation District would like to give our sincere thanks to Senators Merkley, Wyden and their staff for working diligently to have our Billings Siphon and Eastside Canal Project included in the bill,” said Mike Winters, Talent Irrigation District, President of the Board of Directors. “The project will replace aging infrastructure and the piping of the open canal will have a profound water savings due to reducing evaporation and leakage. This will be able to provide more water to our district patrons and provide water savings that will be directed toward enhancing streamflows in Bear Creek and ultimately the Rogue River.”“The funding of this water project is remarkable. I would like to thank Senator Merkley and Senator Wyden for considering the City of Burns for this critically needed water project,"" said Jerry Woodfin, Mayor of Burns.“Our existing water distribution pipelines are crumbling in some areas of the city due to much of it being approximately one hundred years old. Senator Merkley and Senator Wyden recognized the essential need to fund this water project. Both senators have proven what many already knew, that they genuinely care for the well-being of all Oregonians throughout this great state,"" said Daniel Brown, City Manager, City of Burns.“This Interior Appropriations bill provides many important investments for forest research,” said Dr. Tom DeLuca, Dean of the College of Forestry at Oregon State University. “OSU is particularly appreciative of the efforts of Senators Merkley and Wyden to secure funding for OSU to purchase and install forest monitoring equipment that supports the start-up of the Elliott State Research Forest. The Elliott State Research Forest has been established by the State of Oregon to serve as an enduring, publicly owned, world-class research forest to advance understanding related to forest health, climate resilience, carbon sequestration, biodiversity, water quality and quantity, and forest recreation.”“The Owyhee Irrigation District is excited and deeply grateful for the support shown by Senators Merkley and Wyden for this project. Piping the first mile of the Kingman lateral will save money and stabilize the embankment, ensuring irrigation delivery to 6,500 acres,” said Clancy Flynn, General Manager, Owyhee Irrigation District.""Senator Merkley and Senator Wyden understand small cities such as Carlton have limited financial resources to repair and replace failing infrastructure. Their support of our financial assistance request to help replace our 100-year-old failing sewer mainline, gives our families hope of relief from higher utility bills as well as a safer, more efficient, and stable infrastructure,"" said Linda Watkins, Mayor of City of Carlton.“The City of Grants Pass is particularly grateful to Senators Merkley and Wyden for putting our Water Treatment Plant Relocation Project forward on this bill.  The Water Treatment Plant Relocation project builds resilience from flood and seismic events, ensuring the residents and businesses of our community  are not without a fundamental life source: water. The funding will help mitigate recent service fee increases that have the greatest impact on the those in our community with the fewest financial resources.  The funding from this bill will explicitly go to design and construction preparation activities including much needed geotechnical borings, pipeline route work and other design related tasks needed to ensure the success of the project,” said Jason Canady, Public Works Director, City of Grants Pass.“City of Redmond proudly prioritizes safe and clean water as well as protecting its natural resources.  Being awarded funding in the Congressionally Directed Spending (CDS) portion of the Interior Appropriations bill enables us to accelerate needed investments in our water infrastructure and more efficiently meet the demands of our growing community,” said Mayor George Endicott. “This federal support, spearheaded by Oregon Senators Wyden and Merkley, ultimately eases the burden shouldered by water utility rate payers, and enhances needed water capacity for our community to grow and thrive well into the future.”“The condor is a symbol of what the Pacific Northwest can be; a promise based on restoration, on tribal ownership and leadership, on taking action to undo centuries of environmental harm. As one of only four condor breeding facilities in the country, the Oregon Zoo has for 19 years played a critical role in saving this species from the brink of extinction. This Interior Appropriations bill invests in the future of this iconic bird and its eventual restoration to its historic Oregon range. Senator Merkley and Senator Wyden’s work means that the Oregon Zoo will continue to be a leader in condor conservation,” said Lynn Peterson, Oregon Metro Council President.“This federal funding will help Morrow County move beyond the short term nitrate emergency and help us work towards longer term solutions.  The Senator’s support during the nitrate emergency has been so valuable.  This new source of significant funding will allow Morrow County to develop a standardized data and testing program to monitor rural wells and also study long term solutions to secure clean drinking water for rural residents. This is also an exciting time to partner with Umatilla County to finally move to implement solutions for the Lower Umatilla Basin Groundwater Management Area (LUNGWMA) around drinking water.  I look forward to working with our local, state and federal partners and appreciate the efforts of Senator Merkley, Senator Wyden and their staff,” said Melissa Lindsay, Morrow County Commissioner.“I really appreciate the respect the Senators have expressed and realization of the critical need for this project,” said Dan Dorran, Umatilla County Commissioner.""This vital funding support will help Falls City replace many of the old Asbestos Cement water lines that impact our public safety every time they break. Due to their old and brittle condition, we run the risk of contamination to the public each time they fail. In addition, being able to improve the intake system at the source will greatly extend the life of the sand filters and the Water Treatment Plant overall. Finally, the ability to improve our billing system through wireless metering, will help our limited staff manage our community’s customer accounts more efficiently,” said AJ Foscoli City Manager, Falls City.“These federal dollars are coming at a good time. The natural resources and people of the Santiam Canyon have suffered greatly in the wake of the 2020 wildfires. Using these funds to help build a trail that can be both enjoyed by locals and enhance recreational tourism in the region will continue to support this community's economic recovery. We thank our federal delegation for investing these dollars in the people of the Canyon,” said Commissioner Kevin Cameron.""Prairie City will truly benefit from this funding, and I can't thank Senators Merkley and Wyden enough for their support. Recent droughts and multiple forest fires have shown the importance of conserving water, the best way to conserve would be to eliminate wasting water by replacing the old pipes and meters,"" said Jim Hamsher, Mayor of Prairie City.“The Harney County Watershed Council works to improve watershed health for the benefit of our communities and the environment. Our Community Based Water Planning Collaborative is a partnership with the Oregon Water Resources Department and a range of stakeholders including agricultural producers and environmental groups. The Collaborative is working to create and implement a plan for our future water use and needs.  Learning over the last four years that our basin is over-appropriated for groundwater use and facing multiple years of drought have created a need for this guiding document. We thank Senator Merkley and Senator Wyden for the funding that will enable us to complete our plan,” said Karen Moon, Coordinator, Harney County Watershed Council.###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-announce-52-million-usda-seafood-purchasing-agreement-that-will-boost-oregons-seafood-industry,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden announced the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) approval of a $52 million purchase of Pacific Northwest seafood products. This purchase will support our State’s seafood industry which has been hit hard by COVID-19 and climate chaos.“Not only do our fisheries deliver incredible products all around the world, they have been the lifeblood of communities up and down Oregon’s coast for generations,” said Merkley, who led several Congressional pushes to ensure that the USDA included Pacific Northwest seafood processors in its important purchasing programs. “This announcement ensures Oregon’s coastal fishermen and seafood producers receive critical financial assistance needed to continue operating and providing services here in Oregon and beyond. I am elated the USDA has made the decision to extend their purchasing agreement—this is huge for Oregon’s coastal communities.”“Oregon’s globally renowned seafood industry generates jobs and builds stronger economies in towns stretching for hundreds of miles along the Oregon Coast,” Wyden said. “Today’s news providing vital federal aid to coastal fisheries and processors is a real shot in the arm for Oregon communities hit by the climate crisis and the pandemic’s financial fallout. I’m gratified the teamwork to secure this support has produced such well-deserved dividends for seafood jobs and activity in our state.”Senators Merkley and Wyden have been long-time advocates for fisheries in the Pacific Northwest and ensuring that the USDA include Pacific Northwest fisheries and seafood processors in critical purchasing programs. Last fall, the Senators secured $16.5 million in Pacific seafood purchases, and in April, Senators Merkley and Wyden led colleagues in a letter urging USDA to continue purchasing West Coast seafood.The $52 million will be distributed among three main seafood products, all of which are sourced from prevalent fisheries in the state of Oregon:“This announcement is a huge boost for our processors, our fishermen, our communities,” West Coast Seafood Processors Association Executive Director Lori Steele said. “We have been able to keep our doors open, our processing employees working, and nutritious, sustainable seafood flowing to the American public, thanks in part to the USDA’s purchases these last two years. We would like to thank our Senators, Congressmen and USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack for their ongoing support. These purchases will continue to help supplement and stabilize our fishing and processing crews and their families through the rest of the year.”Purchases will be made under the authority of Section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935, which supports the fishing sector and encourages the continued domestic consumption of locally caught seafood by diverting it from the normal channels of trade and commerce and into domestic food assistance programs. ###"

Markey (D-MA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and Jacky Rosen (D-NV).“Manufacturing the components and building the supply chains to power the transition to a clean energy economy will protect America’s national security, including averting the worst impacts of the climate crisis, while creating thousands of high-quality manufacturing jobs here in the United States,” wrote the lawmakers. “As the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent recovery have demonstrated, depending on foreign supplies chains for essential goods threatens America’s economic and national security. Issuing these Presidential Determinations to “accelerate domestic production of clean energy technologies” is an important step towards achieving this future. The House FY 2023 Energy and Water appropriations bill proposes a significant, $100 million, investment to meet this need.”Senator Merkley has been a longtime advocate for sourcing renewable energy domestically and ending U.S. dependence on foreign supply chains to strengthen and secure our national security. Without domestic renewable energy manufacturing, consumers are denied access to cost-effective, clean energy options. Depending on foreign manufacturers adds risks to power grids and slows the progress of domestic clean energy projects—projects that are critical to tackling climate chaos.“With these Presidential Determinations, President Biden provided the Department of Energy (DOE) with the authority to use the DPA to accelerate domestic production of key energy technologies including: solar; transformers and grid components; heat pumps; insulation; electrolyzers; fuel cells; and platinum group metals,” the lawmakers continued.Full text of the letter can be found here and follows below:Dear Chair Feinstein,We respectfully request that you support Presidential Determinations 2022-15 through 19, issued pursuant to Section 303 of the Defense Production Act (DPA), by including funding to the maximum extent possible in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Energy and Water Appropriations bill.Manufacturing the components and building the supply chains to power the transition to a clean energy economy will protect America’s national security, including averting the worst impacts of the climate crisis, while creating thousands of high-quality manufacturing jobs here in the United States.

Issuing these Presidential Determinations to “accelerate domestic production of clean energy technologies” is an important step towards achieving this future. The House FY 2023 Energy and Water appropriations bill proposes a significant, $100 million, investment to meet this need.As President Biden stated, a lack of domestic renewable energy manufacturing denies “consumers access to cost-cutting clean energy options, add(s) risks to our power grid, and stall(s) domestic clean energy construction projects that are critical to tackling the climate crisis.” With these Presidential Determinations, President Biden provided the Department of Energy (DOE) with the authority to use the DPA to accelerate domestic production of key energy technologies including: solar; transformers and grid components; heat pumps; insulation; electrolyzers; fuel cells; and platinum group metals.Not long ago the United States was the global leader in solar manufacturing but we have allowed China, which is investing heavily in its own manufacturing, to corner the market for solar modules and supply chain components. This has reduced American manufacturing capacity far below domestic solar demand, forcing us to rely on China for our solar needs, even as it is well documented that China is using unfair trade practices, including forced labor in parts of the country. The DPA can help American companies re-establish themselves as leaders in solar manufacturing, and other technologies, essential to the transition to clean energy but only if Congress provides DOE with adequate funds to utilize it.We urge you to support President Biden’s Presidential Determinations by appropriating funds to the maximum extent possible in the FY 2023 Energy and Water Appropriations bill so that DOE can effectively utilize the authorities that have been delegated to it under the DPA.Sincerely,###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-celebrates-essential-investments-in-semiconductor-manufacturing-domestic-supply-chain,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley issued the following statement celebrating the Senate passage of essential legislation to lower costs, boost innovation, and protect our national security with investments in semiconductor manufacturing and domestic supply chains.“Strengthening manufacturing in America is a win-win. If we don’t make things in America, we won’t have a middle class in America. Our modern economy is built on tiny chips, and we can grow the middle class and protect our national security with strong domestic supply chains. And since Oregon is the backbone of the American semiconductor industry, Oregon especially stands to gain from this bill.“The pandemic alone didn’t cause the chip shortage—it shed light on existing fault lines in our manufacturing infrastructure. We’ve learned the hard way how desperately we need these investments in American workers to produce chips here at home instead of sourcing chips made abroad. This bipartisan legislation passed by the Senate cements American competitiveness and ensures we stay at the forefront of innovation.“This legislation is also a critical step in competing with China, which is about revitalizing our ability to level the playing field. Today is only a first step and we cannot stop here. Congress must come back and pass other bipartisan provisions that ensure American values for human rights and democracy remain a centerpiece of our relationship with China.”###"

In light of these murders, the Senate must immediately pass the BURMA Act to impose further sanctions on the junta. In the meantime, the Biden Administration should use the tools it has in place now to impose additional sanctions – especially on military leaders who have not yet been held accountable, those who are responsible for the deaths of these democracy activists, and the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, which is providing revenue to the junta.“There are also diplomatic steps to take to fully isolate the Burmese regime. The United States and our partners must continue to further elevate the profile of the National Unity Government. And the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) should suspend or expel Burma from the group and not recognize any elections held by the junta under military rule.“A year and a half after the violent overthrow of Burma’s democracy, it is abundantly clear that the country’s military leadership is only growing more ruthless. We must stop this tragic trajectory before even more innocent lives are lost and pro-democracy voices silenced.”In 2017, Merkley led the first congressional delegation to Burma and Bangladesh to investigate the Rohingya genocide.###"

Menthol numbs the throat and mitigates the harshness of tobacco smoke, making menthol cigarettes more appealing to youth and people beginning to smoke.“By increasing youth smoking and making cessation more difficult, menthol cigarettes have magnified the public health harms of smoking. Between 1980 and 2018, menthol cigarettes were responsible for 10.1 million additional smokers and 378,000 premature deaths in the United States,” the senators wrote in a letter to FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf. “We applaud FDA for issuing these proposed rules and are pleased to see the agency using the regulatory authority that Congress gave it to reduce the death and disease caused by tobacco products.”  “This careful approach is why a broad coalition, including prominent civil rights and public health groups, support FDA action to remove menthol tobacco products from the market,” the senators continued. “We urge you to move promptly to consider public comments, finalize the rule, and implement it so that these life-savings requirements can take effect as soon as possible.”The letter was led by U.S. Senator Edward J.

http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-smith-river-national-recreation-area-expansion-into-oregon-clears-key-hurdle,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden today announced the Smith River National Recreation Area Expansion Act (Smith River NRA), legislation to expand the Smith River NRA, cleared a key hurdle by passing out of a Senate committee on a bipartisan vote. Expanding the Smith River NRA by 58,000 acres into Oregon would protect the diverse ecosystems of the rivers, streams, and adjacent lands of the North Fork Smith River watershed, and help boost the local fishing and recreation industries that many Oregonians rely on.“When we come together to protect our state’s natural wonders, we can create jobs, protect resources, grow our economy, and make sure future generations of Oregonians can enjoy our incredible public lands,” Merkley said. “Expanding the Smith River National Recreation Area is a commonsense win-win-win for our economy, adventurers across the Northwest, and those dedicated to preserving the ecosystems that make Oregon so special. I’m grateful to all of the local leaders, conservationists, and businesses who have been a part of this process so far, and I look forward to continuing to work together to get this bill signed into law.”""Our legislation has strong bipartisan support at home, and I'm proud to have to shepherded this important legislation, on which Senator Merkley and I partnered, through the Committee today,"" Wyden said. ""The Smith River watershed is home to an incredibly rich array of life and offers exceptional recreational activities. By expanding the Smith River Recreation Area, this bill will protect our state's natural treasures, generate recreation jobs and invest in our local economies for years to come.""In 1990, Congress enacted legislation to establish the Smith River NRA to protect the watershed, but the boundary stopped at the Oregon border, leaving the North Fork of the Smith River and its tributaries unprotected.The Smith River NRA expansion would permanently withdraw the land from new mining claims, helping to protect this sensitive area from proposed nickel strip mines, and protect 75 miles of scenic rivers, including Baldface Creek, Chrome Creek, and nearby streams. Additionally, the legislation would task the Forest Service with the preparation of an updated recreation plan identifying specific plans for the entire National Recreation Area, and produce a special study of streams, fens, wetlands, and potentially unstable and vulnerable aquatic habitat areas.The bill complements the Southwestern Oregon Watershed and Salmon Protection Act, which was introduced by the Senators earlier this year to protect the North Fork Smith River watershed and other Southwestern Oregon rivers and streams.""I am happy to offer strong support for Senator Merkley’s work to expand our beautiful Smith River Watershed as part of our fabulous Wild Rivers Coast,” said Court Boice, Curry County Commissioner. “The Kalmiopsis Wilderness and Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest are recognized as the most diverse, wild, unique, rugged and beautiful Landscapes in North America. This legislation will certainly help and is important for maintaining our pristine rivers and recovering the vibrancy of our salmon and steelhead runs.""“I thank Senator Merkley and support his efforts and legislation to expand the Smith River National Recreation Area in Oregon’s North Fork of the Smith River watershed,” said David Brock Smith, Oregon House Representative HD 01 (R-Port Orford). “The Smith River is an important watershed in Southern Oregon and Northern California, providing critical salmonid habitat, drinking water and recreational opportunities, and I will continue to be a strong state partner in supporting the Smith River, its tributaries and the watersheds of Southwest Oregon.”“Expanding the Smith River National Recreation Area and protecting the North Fork lands in Oregon is absolutely the right thing to do,” said Susan Jane Brown, Wildlands Program Director with the Western Environmental Law Center. “I’m grateful for Senator Merkley’s leadership and for the cooperation by many interests to advance this critically important legislation for one of our nation’s most spectacular wild rivers.”“The Oregon Chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers continues to stand with the sportsmen and women of Oregon for the protection of the wild lands and waters of the State,” said Justin Gindlesperger, SW Regional Director Oregon Chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. “The expansion of the Smith River National Recreation Area establishes an essential safeguard to the watershed of the Smith River so future generations can experience a remarkable and truly wild landscape here in Southern Oregon. We appreciate and fully support the effort to protect such a valuable resource.”“I’ve paddled the North Fork of the Smith in Oregon as well as Baldface Creek and can attest to their distinct values,” said Zach Collier, Owner/Outfitter of Northwest Rafting Company. ""We fully support any legislation that promotes the permanent protection of these rivers. The North Fork watershed is uniquely special to the world and should be protected as such.""“The Wild Rivers Coast and rivers like the Smith are legendary among anglers for their steelhead and salmon fisheries,” said Dean Finnerty, NW Regional Director, Angler’s Conservation Project, Trout Unlimited. “This region supports a robust sport fishing economy that is vitally important for many rural communities. Sen. Merkley’s bi-partisan Smith River National Recreation Area Expansion Act is a sensible and timely way to honor the sporting heritage of this region and to conserve the cold, clean, fish-filled waters that are the hallmark of this part of America.”“The Smith River deserves complete protection because state lines are arbitrary to a river,” said Will Volpert, Indigo Creek Outfitters. “Oregon is lucky to have a piece of the Smith, as it is truly one of the most majestic and beautiful river systems anywhere. It is a place like no other—with canyon colors beyond vibrant and a terrain that begs to be explored yet is rugged enough to hold most adventurers back. Every time I visit the Smith, it feels like I’m the first person to visit the river canyon in all of history—and that’s a pretty special feeling.”""Oregon's North Fork Smith watershed is a botanical treasure and should have always been a part of the Smith River National Recreation Area,"" said Joseph Vaile, Climate Director of the Klamath-Siskiyou Wildlands Center. ""We thank Senator Merkley for introducing this legislation that will also designate many of the North Fork Smith River's cold-water tributaries as Wild & Scenic. Anyone who has had a chance to explore the remote, primitive backcountry of Oregon's North Fork Smith headwaters knows that it is one of the most spectacular rivers in the world.""“The upper reaches of the Smith River watershed provide exceptional and unique opportunities for backcountry recreation,” said Thomas O’Keefe, the Pacific Northwest Stewardship Director for American Whitewater. “We appreciate the leadership of Senator Merkley to expand the Smith River National Recreation Area to include the headwaters in Oregon. The area is characterized by rare hydrologic and botanical resources that the legislation appropriately recognizes. The extension of Wild and Scenic designation to the tributaries of the North Fork Smith will further protect one of the west coast’s last free-flowing rivers and a special place for all who enjoy wild rivers.”“We have been working to protect the North Fork Smith River’s wild headwaters—keeping its water pristine, protecting fish species’ habitats, and ensuring clean drinking water and outdoor recreation for local communities,” said Alyssa Babin, founder of Wild and Scenic Rivers in Brookings, Oregon. “We thank Senator Merkley for his leadership in introducing this bill, and his partnership in working to protect this important watershed.”“The North Fork Smith is a national treasure, and it always should have been a part of the Smith River National Recreation Area,” said Michael Dotson, executive director of the Klamath-Siskiyou Wildlands Center. ""We are thankful to Senator Merkley for his leadership in protecting one of the most spectacular rivers in the world.”“The expansion of the Smith River National Recreation Area completes a conservation effort initiated over thirty years ago,” said Grant Werschkull, Co-Executive Director for Smith River Alliance. “This action is vitally important to downstream communities and the Smith River as a stronghold for Pacific salmon species.”""The Smith River is recognized as one of the premier salmon strongholds on the West Coast,” said Guido Rahr, President and CEO of the Wild Salmon Center. ""We’re grateful to Senators Merkley and Wyden for this investment in wild salmon and the coastal communities that depend on them. Protecting the Smith's cold, clean flows across the entire watershed will secure this place for people and fish for generations to come.""“Senator Merkley’s pathbreaking legislation has the potential to conserve Oregon’s portion of the incomparable Smith River watershed in Southwest Oregon for this and future generations,” said Andy Kerr with The Larch Company. “We hope that Congress promptly considers and passes the bill into law.”###"

The lack of available vaccine appointments continues to fuel anxiety about a virus that is generally unfamiliar to Americans, who are urgently looking for solutions—especially those who identify with the LGBTQ+ community.“Monkeypox is spread through direct contact and can infect anyone. Yet health care services are too often inaccessible or otherwise denied to members of at-risk communities, particularly the LGBTQ+ community,” they continued. “It is critical for vaccine access to be equitable, even in the face of high demand. Indeed, demand is so high for vaccination that appointment slots made available by public health agencies have been filled nearly instantly, and some sites have even crashed due to high traffic from our constituents.”Since there is currently more demand than supply for the monkeypox vaccine, the Senators urge the Departments to work with urgency to take the necessary steps and action to respond to this public health concern fairly and efficiently among all communities—ensuring adequate doses, and equitable distribution of the vaccine in the United States.Full text of the letter can be found here and follows below:Dear Assistant Secretary O’Connell and Dr. Walensky:We write to express concern about the increasing number of monkeypox cases in the United States, and to urge the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to apply an interagency approach to address this outbreak, including by increasing access to the JYNNEOS monkeypox and smallpox vaccine in the United States.The United States has invested billions of dollars to develop, manufacture, and stockpile doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine as a component of a federal biosecurity program.

http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-introduces-legislation-to-keep-families-and-pets-safe-in-the-outdoors,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley today introduced Canyon’s Law in the United States Senate, a bill aimed at banning the M-44 ejector – a spring-loaded device filled with sodium cyanide used to kill predators. The problem with these devices: they’re indiscriminate in what sets them off. ""Cyanide bombs do not belong on public lands,” said Merkley. “These dangerous devices have no safeguard for our families and our pets, threatening animals and humans alike. More effective, safe, and humane predator control options are available, and should be the only options used on public lands.” M-44s are small traps made up of a stake that is driven into the ground with a spring and a canister loaded with the powdered poison, sodium cyanide. Once they're set, the traps resemble sprinkler heads, and when triggered, the M-44 ejects a cloud of cyanide meant to kill coyotes, wild dogs, or foxes. Canyon’s Law is named after Canyon Mansfield, an Idaho boy whose dog unfortunately came into contact with an M-44 while walking along public lands in 2017. Unknowingly, his dog activated a M-44 device, and Canyon watched helplessly as his beloved companion suffered a cruel and painful death. Fortunately for Canyon, the wind pushed much of the cyanide away from him, yet he still suffers health effects five years later. A companion bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Peter DeFazio (D-OR-04), and today, DeFazio held a hearing on Canyon’s Law in the House Natural Resources Committee.  “These cruel and deadly devices kill family pets and hundreds of unintended wildlife,” said Rep. DeFazio. “People have been injured as well and unless we ban these devices, it is only a matter of time before someone is killed. There are other proven, low-cost, and established ways to protect livestock.”Canyon’s Law is cosponsored by Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Ron Wyden (D-OR). Canyon’s Law is supported by Predator Defense, the International Fund for Animal Welfare, Center for Biological Diversity, Animal Welfare Institute, and the Western Watersheds Project. Final bill text can be found here. ### "
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-merkley-representatives-morelle-and-katko-team-up-to-close-summer-learning-gap,"Washington, D.C. – Today, Oregon’s Senator Jeff Merkley, along with Congressmen Joseph Morelle (D-NY-25) and John Katko (R-NY-24), introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Summer Meals and Learning Act—legislation to address summer learning inequities by keeping school libraries open at schools that serve free summer meals.“Every student—no matter their color, income, or zip code—deserves an excellent education that puts them on track for a lifetime of success,” said Merkley. “But when the school year ends and summer vacation begins, millions of children go months without learning opportunities, leaving them at a disadvantage. Add an existing problem of child hunger—even before the COVID-19 pandemic, over half a million people in Oregon, including one in five children, struggled with food insecurity—and the challenges for children grow. This bill will not just minimize an educational gap during the summer months, but also help ensure students are kept fed while school is out. I look forward to working with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to ensure brighter futures for our kids.”“As the husband of a retired teacher, I know that for many children, the joy of summer break is often overshadowed by the dread of food insecurity and learning loss,” said Congressman Joe Morelle. “No child should go hungry, which is I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing the Summer Learning and Meals Act to keep school libraries open during summer break and ensure children have access to reliable, healthy meals. In addition to reducing food insecurity, this legislation will play an important role in helping to close the achievement gap—giving all children the opportunity to thrive.”“Many children in Central New York struggle to access nutritious meals and educational resources during the summer months,” said Rep. Katko “This lack of access all too often disadvantages lower-income children and translates to long-term repercussions for their health and education. That is why I am proud to join Sen. Merkley and Rep. Morelle in introducing legislation to help ensure summer meals and summer reading can go hand in hand, ensuring brighter futures for every student.”While more affluent children often participate in extracurricular activities during the summer, too many low-income children lose access to learning opportunities when school is closed. Low-income children lose at least two months of reading achievement every summer, and by 5th grade, children without summer learning opportunities are two years behind their peers.Despite the fact that summer has been identified as a major factor in the achievement gap in America's schools, there is still no dedicated source of funding for summer learning. Research has also shown that high quality summer learning programs can help students maintain or even increase their academic skills over the summer months, especially in reading. However, the majority of school libraries are closed during the summer.In 2012, Oregon’s Summer Learning Partnership created a grant program to allow schools to keep their libraries open at existing summer meal sites to benefit the students most at-risk of learning loss. Based on Oregon’s successful program, the Summer Learning and Meals Act would create a new federal program that provides grants to state libraries to allow schools with summer lunch programs to keep their libraries open for student use during the summer months.Specifically, the Summer Meals and Learning Act will:In addition to Merkley, Morelle and Katko, the Summer Meals and Learning Act is cosponsored by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Cory Booker (D-NJ).Anti-hunger and nutrition advocates reiterated the importance of these flexibilities and applauded the bill to keep critical flexibilities for school nutrition programs to feed children. Endorsing organizations include: the American Library Association, National Summer Learning Association, Share Our Strength, and OregonASK.“In far too many communities, the school library is the only resource available to young students for summer reading programs and meals,” said Lessa Kanani'opua Pelayo-Lozada, President of the American Library Association. “School librarians encourage students to read throughout the summer months and help bridge the gap between school years for students of all ages. Librarians, with the support of the Summer Meals and Learning Act will help ensure that well-read also means well-fed.”“Summer is often the time of year where children go the hungriest due to a gap in meals programs provided during the school year through federal programs. According to NSLA’s 2019 report, “Feed Hungry Minds and Bodies: Combining Summer Learning and Summer Meals,"" food insecurity for children leads to higher likelihood of health, behavioral, and social development problems. Children do not need to go hungry during the summer months. There are sensible solutions at the federal level, like the Summer Meals and Learning Act, introduced by Senator Merkley and Reps. Morelle and Katko, which would create strong partnerships with libraries and community partners to ensure more kids, especially the most vulnerable, are fed during the summer months,"" said Aaron Philip Dworkin, CEO of the National Summer Learning Association.“This bill helps to address the ongoing challenges facing families, children and the organizations serving meals in their communities,” said Lisa Davis, Senior Vice President of Share Our Strength’s No Kid Hungry campaign. “With so many families struggling to stretch limited budgets to meet rapidly rising food, fuel and housing costs, summer meals are more important than ever. Communities need a variety of tools and flexibilities to ensure nutritious meals can reach children where they live, learn and play.”Final bill text can be found here.One-page summary of the bill can be found here.###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-leads-colleagues-in-urging-end-of-fast-tracking-oil-and-gas-infrastructure,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley today sent a letter with Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) urging the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to end the fast-tracking of oil and gas infrastructure by rescinding Nationwide Permit 12 (NWP 12), which would ensure that proposed oil and gas pipeline projects undergo adequate environmental and public interest review.“For over a decade, oil and gas companies have exploited the NWP program to fast-track oil and gas infrastructure projects that are clearly contrary to public interest and have adverse effects on the environment. Prior to issuing a permit under the Clean Water Act or the Rivers and Harbors Act, the Corps is required to conduct a review that assesses the project’s impact on the public and the environment,” wrote the Senators.NWP 12 is a general permit created by the Corps under the Clean Water Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act that authorizes the construction of oil and gas infrastructure and associated facilities that impair, dredge, or discharge fill material into U.S. waters. Under the NWP, projects are not individually reviewed for their impact on the environment or the public interest.The Senators’ letter asks that each oil and gas infrastructure project undergo independent project review in light of the risks posed by oil and gas infrastructure projects to the climate, Tribal interests, and the health and livelihoods of local communities.“The Corps conducts an independent, site-specific review for a project unless the Corps determines that a project ‘will cause only minimal adverse environmental effects when performed separately and will have only minimal cumulative adverse effect on the environment.’ For those projects that have ‘minimal adverse effects,’ the Corps expedites the approval process by issuing general permits, or Nationwide Permits (NWPs), that cover different categories of similar activities. Projects that fall within the scope of an NWP generally do not require independent review by the Corps. Given the state of our climate crisis there is no new fossil fuel project that can have a ‘minimal adverse impact’ on the environment,” they continued.The Senators also noted that NWP 12 creates a loophole for the oil and gas industry by allowing projects that impair only a half an acre of water to bypass independent review. This means one large oil pipeline can be approved as a series of small “single and complete” projects without undergoing an independent environmental and public interest review.The Army Corps has acknowledged there are serious concerns with NWP 12 and is currently conducting a formal review of the permit in accordance with Biden’s Executive Order 13990, requiring agencies to review executive actions taken during the previous administration that conflict with the Biden Administration’s climate objectives.“We appreciate the initial step that you have taken in opening NWP 12 for review, and we urge you to eliminate this overly broad and harmful permit. We look forward to supporting further action to ensure that all oil and gas infrastructure projects undergo a complete review that comports with the law, science, and the Administration’s goals on advancing environmental justice and addressing the climate emergency,” the Senators concluded.Full text of the letter can be found here and follows below:Dear Assistant Secretary Connor:We strongly support the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) initiating a formal review of Nationwide Permit 12 (NWP 12), and urge you to eliminate NWP 12 altogether. The fast-tracking of oil and gas infrastructure projects through NWP 12 threatens neighboring communities, the local environment, endangered species, and Tribal sovereignty, and contributes to the climate crisis.For over a decade, oil and gas companies have exploited the NWP program to fast-track oil and gas infrastructure projects that are clearly contrary to public interest and have adverse effects on the environment. Prior to issuing a permit under the Clean Water Act or the Rivers and Harbors Act, the Corps is required to conduct a review that assesses the project’s impact on the public and the environment. Among the review criteria are an environmental assessment and a determination as to whether the project is contrary to public interest.The Corps conducts an independent, site-specific review for a project unless the Corps determines that a project “will cause only minimal adverse environmental effects when performed separately and will have only minimal cumulative adverse effect on the environment.” For those projects that have “minimal adverse effects,” the Corps expedites the approval process by issuing general permits, or Nationwide Permits (NWPs), that cover different categories of similar activities. Projects that fall within the scope of an NWP generally do not require independent review by the Corps. Given the state of our climate crisis there is no new fossil fuel project that can have a “minimal adverse impact” on the environment. Every additional project worsens the wild fires, flooding, extreme heat, drought, hurricanes and other climate impacts that Americans are already facing.Additionally, NWP 12 authorizes all “activities required” for the construction of oil and gas infrastructure, so long as the activity does not result in a loss of more than one-half acre of water at each point that the project crosses jurisdictional waters. This creates a loophole for oil and gas companies to segment projects so they fall within the scope of individual permits and bypass independent review. As a result, massive pipelines, such as the Dakota Access Pipeline, are filed as a series of separate projects to avoid undergoing site-specific review. Oil and gas pipelines that cross state lines, threaten multiple communities, undermine Tribal sovereignty, and endanger sensitive ecosystems deserve a project-specific review, at a minimum.NWP 12 also undermines President Biden’s efforts to advance environmental justice and tackle the climate crisis through sound science. Fossil fuel infrastructure disproportionately impacts minority and low-income communities. Through NWP 12, oil and gas infrastructure projects will continue to bypass the public interest review that requires the Corps to consider the impacts of risks such as oil spills and air pollution on the welfare of surrounding communities. Oil and gas companies will also continue to use NWP 12 to circumvent study of the impacts of new fossil fuel infrastructure on the climate emergency. In order for the Corps to understand the scope of a project’s contribution to the climate crisis, the Corps must be able to assess a project’s cumulative impacts. This will not be possible as long as NWP 12 is in place, and allows infrastructure projects to be approved in pieces.We appreciate the initial step that you have taken in opening NWP 12 for review, and we urge you to eliminate this overly broad and harmful permit. We look forward to supporting further action to ensure that all oil and gas infrastructure projects undergo a complete review that comports with the law, science, and the Administration’s goals on advancing environmental justice and addressing the climate emergency.Sincerely,###"

http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/bipartisan-resolution-condemning-starvation-as-a-weapon-of-war-passes-the-senate,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Todd Young (R-IN), Cory Booker (D-NJ), John Thune (R-SD), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), and James Risch (R-ID) announced that their bipartisan Senate resolution condemning the use of starvation and hunger as weapons of war has passed the Senate unanimously.In May, the Senators introduced their resolution not only condemning the use of hunger as a weapon of war, but also recognizing the effect of conflict on global food security and famine, which was then swiftly voted out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee less than a month later.“From Ukraine to Syria to Ethiopia, we have and continue to watch with horror as bad actors destroy agriculture, deny humanitarian access, and disrupt markets for crucial commodities in a twisted effort to achieve their geopolitical aims through starvation,” said Senator Merkley. “Today’s passage of our resolution by the full Senate reaffirms our united stand that civilians everywhere must be protected during war and that hunger should never be used as a weapon to turn civilians into pawns.”“It is time for the United States to hold those who use food as a weapon of war accountable for their horrific action,” said Senator Young. “From Yemen to Ukraine, the world’s most vulnerable are suffering in unspeakable ways. Today’s Senate passage of our resolution sends a clear message that the United States will use all of the tools and authorities at our disposal to end these abuses.""“Today, the Senate sent a strong bipartisan message to condemn all those who use hunger as a weapon of war,” said Sen. Booker. “With conflicts around the world such as Russia’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine, violence in the Horn of Africa, and continued unrest in Afghanistan and Yemen, millions of people are currently at risk of hunger and starvation. As this resolution lays out, the United States has a moral responsibility to extend urgent humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations globally, bolster the global food supply chain, and hold individuals and governments accountable if they perpetrate these atrocities.”“Hunger and famine must not become weapons of war,” said Thune. “This bipartisan resolution reinforces the United States’ and its partners’ responsibility to work together to restore global stability and hold individuals and governments accountable for conflicts that drive global hunger and jeopardize food security.”“I am honored to bear witness as the Senate speaks today with one voice: we cannot stand by as despots from Russia to Ethiopia continue to exploit hunger to advance wartime goals,” Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Menendez said. “Ongoing and exacerbated disruptions in supply chains, obstructions to food production, and transport hub blockades are shaking vulnerable communities to their cores, with millions worldwide losing access to basic and necessary goods. Today’s passage must serve as a powerful call to action for the United States and broader international community. Our efforts to halt this callous manipulation of civilians and to hold perpetrators to account has never been more critical.”“From Russia’s war in Ukraine to Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Yemen, bad actors are deliberately destroying agricultural goods and infrastructure, manipulating markets, blocking access by humanitarians, and ultimately starving innocent civilians to death in a callous attempt to advance political or military objectives,” said Risch. “This appalling practice cannot stand. Senate passage of our resolution should send a clear message to Putin and others that the United States will use every tool at our disposal to ensure our food assistance is not being manipulated and that those who use hunger as a weapon will be held accountable.”Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has further highlighted how brutal autocrats weaponize hunger. By disrupting Ukraine’s planting season and substantial food exports and by reportedly stealing vast quantities of grain from Ukraine, Russia has put millions around the globe at risk of famine.This resolution is cosponsored by Senator Chris Coons (D-CT), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Tina Smith (D-MN), Bob Casey (D-PA), and Michael Bennett (D-CO).A bipartisan House version led by Representatives Sara Jacobs (D-CA), Peter Meijer (R-MI), Bobby L.

http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-sanders-colleagues-sound-alarm-bells-on-climate_urge-climate-emergency-declaration-from-president-biden,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) today led Senators Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), and Alex Padilla (D-CA) in a letter to President Biden urging the President to declare a climate emergency to unlock broad and crucial powers of the National Emergency Act (NEA). “Declaring the climate crisis a national emergency under the NEA would unlock powers to rebuild a better economy with significant, concrete actions,” wrote the Senators. “Under the NEA, you could redirect spending to build out renewable energy systems on military bases, implement large-scale clean transportation solutions and finance distributed energy projects to boost climate resiliency. All of these actions would employ Americans in new and emerging industries while securing American leadership in global markets.”The Senators note that declaring a national emergency is not something to take lightly, and even noted their apprehension of prior national emergencies, but state tackling the climate crisis is an emergency that demands ambitious, urgent action. In addition to calling for a national emergency, the Senators implore the President to direct the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) to develop a bold array of rules to reduce carbon dioxide and other pollutants, and how other agencies can be of service during this imperative moment.“The climate crisis is one of the biggest emergencies that our country has ever faced and time is running out. We cannot allow a single Senator to stall our progress. Addressing this crisis head-on, with the full authorities you possess is a win for the environment, public health, the planet, American workers, American consumers, and our national security interests. We urge you to act boldly, declare this crisis the national emergency that it is, and embark upon bold regulatory and administrative action,” the Senators concluded.Full text of the letter can be found here and follows below:Dear President Biden,For too long, we have been waiting for a single piece of legislation, and a single Senate vote, to take bold action on our climate crisis. While we will continue to fight for whatever climate and clean energy proposals can pass in a divided Senate, Congressional action to address the climate crisis appears to have stalled. As a result, we urge you to put us on an emergency footing and aggressively use your executive powers to address the climate crisis, create good-paying union jobs in the United States, and liberate hard-working American families from volatile energy prices. We ask that you start by declaring a climate emergency to unlock the broad powers of the National Emergency Act (NEA) and immediately pursue an array of regulatory and administrative actions to slash emissions, protect public health, support national and energy security, and improve our air and water quality.Declaring the climate crisis a national emergency under the NEA would unlock powers to rebuild a better economy with significant, concrete actions. Under the NEA, you could redirect spending to build out renewable energy systems on military bases, implement large-scale clean transportation solutions and finance distributed energy projects to boost climate resiliency. All of these actions would employ Americans in new and emerging industries while securing American leadership in global markets.We do not urge you to declare a national emergency lightly. We fought President Trump’s efforts to misuse executive power and sideline Congress, including to build a wasteful and destructive border wall. A president’s emergency powers should not be used wantonly. What we cannot afford, however, is to shy away from tackling the climate crisis just because President Trump misused the NEA. If ever there is an emergency that demands ambitious action, climate chaos is it.Similarly, you cannot shy away from directing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to rapidly develop a bold array of rules to reduce carbon dioxide, methane,  and other pollutants from coal- and gas-fired power plants, cars and light trucks, heavy-duty vehicles, and oil and gas facilities. These actions will help protect public health nationwide – particularly in environmental justice communities - and fulfill the EPA’s statutory requirements under the Clean Air Act. Your Office of Management and Budget should forthwith promulgate an updated social cost of carbon and require its use throughout government decision-making, including in areas such as procurement and the determination of royalty rates where it can be particularly effective. Your Interior Department should move boldly to limit carbon pollution from fossil fuels produced on public lands and waters, and your Energy Department should update a plethora of energy efficiency rules and promote the deployment of energy efficient technologies that will reduce carbon pollution and save consumers money. Your Department of Transportation should maximize the adoption of electric vehicles and the electrification of our mass transit. Your Department of Defense, the world's single largest consumer of oil and one of its top emitters, should transition its non-tactical vehicle fleet to electric and zero emission vehicles, install solar panels on military housing, and take other aggressive steps to decrease its environmental impact. Likewise, your Justice Department should investigate the fossil fuel industry for its decades of lying about its products and consider bringing a civil suit against the industry the way it successfully sued the tobacco industry. An emergency demands all this and more.The climate crisis is one of the biggest emergencies that our country has ever faced and time is running out. We cannot allow a single Senator to stall our progress. Addressing this crisis head-on, with the full authorities you possess is a win for the environment, public health, the planet, American workers, American consumers, and our national security interests. We urge you to act boldly, declare this crisis the national emergency that it is, and embark upon bold regulatory and administrative action.Sincerely,###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-responds-senate-committee-hearing-on-disclose-act-to-shine-light-on-dark-money-in-elections,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley issued the following statement after participating in the Senate Rules Committee hearing on the DISCLOSE Act—a hearing he requested to shine a light on dark money in our electoral system:“Our nation was founded not on aristocracy or royal bloodlines but on a simple yet revolutionary idea: that the people are in charge. Abraham Lincoln said it best: The United States is a ‘government of the people, by the people, and for the people.’ What that means is that we, the elected officials, work for the people. They elect us. The people are in charge. But this idea, this vision, this government by and for the people cannot survive if our elections are not open, fair, and free.“The essence of the First Amendment is that competing voices should be heard in the marketplace of ideas—but by equating money and speech and treating corporations as people, the Citizens United Supreme Court decision gave the largest corporations and billionaires a stadium sound system they can use to drown out the voice of the American people.“And dark money lets those special interests hide their identities, making it impossible for Americans to know which groups are pouring money into our elections, and what motivates them. If you get an email asking you for money, you want to know if it’s from your mom or a self-described Nigerian prince. It’s impossible to evaluate the merits of what you’re hearing if you don’t know who is saying it.“The DISCLOSE Act would let the American people know who is behind dark money-- there’s no place in democracy for secret expenditures by special interests to buy our elections.“We work for the American people – for waitresses and truck drivers and home health aides and firefighters, not for the tiny fraction of the top one percent who have hoarded enough wealth to fund superPACs. I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation and stop billionaires from secretly buying our elections.”Senator Merkley has been a longtime supporter of the DISCLOSE Act and has worked tirelessly over the years to bring awareness to the legislation and call upon colleagues to put the interests of the American people over those of powerful special interests.### "
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-urge-sba-to-process-all-eligible-covid-economic-injury-disaster-loan-applications,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley said today they are urging the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to process COVID Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) applications that were received prior to the agency’s May 6, 2022 deadline.“While we recognize the agency has assisted an unprecedented number of small businesses throughout the pandemic, our offices continue to hear from thousands of prospective borrowers awaiting consideration,” Wyden and Merkley wrote in a bipartisan letter with other senators to SBA Administrator Isabella Casillas Guzman. “We also continue to hear from EIDL applicants with disputed rejections who have received no communication from the administration in months. EIDL was a lifeline for businesses throughout this pandemic, but many of them continue to struggle. The program is too important to shut down prematurely. While funds remain, we expect SBA to process all eligible applications and appeals that have been submitted by the request deadline.”The COVID EIDL program has provided loans to nearly four million small businesses since the beginning of the pandemic—serving as an essential source of capital for small businesses, especially those that could not obtain credit to survive the pandemic from other lenders.On April 28, the SBA announced a May 6, 2022 submission deadline for COVID EIDL loan modifications, increase requests, and denial reconsiderations. Many applicants who submitted their applications prior to the deadline remain in limbo due to the SBA’s decision to stop processing certain applications. Instead, the SBA has issued a vague commitment to process “workable” applications, which has led to many deserving borrowers not receiving the funds they need.“Given that many applicants have not received final consideration, we find it difficult to understand SBA’s decision to stop processing requests that were submitted by the May 6th submission deadline… ‘Workability’ is not an acceptable standard to justify rejecting a borrower who is eligible and in need. The bar for denial is eligibility, not SBA’s willingness to continue processing applications. We find it particularly troubling that your agency continues to tell our offices that loans cannot be completed due to the exhaustion of funds when $800 million in loan subsidy remains – enough to support more than $7 billion in lending,” the letter concluded.The letter was led by U.S. Senators Ben Cardin, D-Md., John Cornyn, R-Texas, Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Roger Wicker, R-Miss. Alongside Wyden and Merkley, the letter was signed by U.S. Senators Michael Bennet, D-Colo., Bill Cassidy, R-La., Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., Patty Murray, D-Wash., Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., Margaret Wood Hassan, D-N.H., John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., Alex Padilla, D-Calif., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Chuck Schumer, D- N.Y., Jack Reed, D-R.I., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Robert P.

treatment of children in federal immigration custody, prioritizing more hasty
family reunification for those seeking refuge in the U.S.The Children’s Safe Welcome Act was introduced July 13 by
Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) also aims to better regulate the unregulated emergency shelters where migrant children and
unaccompanied minors are now housed.“For children who must spend time in government custody,
this bill ensures their time there will be brief and that their health and
well-being will be prioritized,” Mary Miller Flowers, senior policy analyst for
the National Center for Youth Law stated in a press release.Some key provisions of the bill include phasing out large
congregate care facilities, and avoiding family separation unless there’s a
safety concern for the child. The legislation would also codify minimum health
and safety requirements for children in the immigration system. If signed into law, the bill would prohibit the use of
family detention facilities in all cases, and prioritize placements for
unaccompanied children that are family-based. The legislation calls for an
ombudsperson to monitor compliance and guarantee legal protection for kids at
every stage of proceedings, while prioritizing the “swift release” of
unaccompanied minors who have a disability.Forty child welfare, legal, public health, and other
community organizations support the Children’s Safe Welcome Act. Their letter of support states that children fleeing their
home countries and seeking protection from abuse, violence, war or religious
persecution comprise one of this country’s most vulnerable demographic groups.
But currently, they “routinely experience significant harm” while in federal
immigration custody. Earlier this year, a district court judge in
California ruled that the government had violated the rights of
kids in immigration detention.The bill’s co-authors include Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand

as 161,000 unaccompanied minors who are predicted to cross the border by the
end of fiscal year 2022, according to an Interior Department report obtained by the Washington Examiner. So far
this year, U.S. officials recorded “encounters” with more than 1.7 million
adults, and at least 101,000 unaccompanied minors, according to U.S.
Customs and Border Protection data.

http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/in-the-news/oregon-supreme-court-justice-nelson-nominated-to-federal-bench-22,"President Joe Biden has nominated Oregon Supreme Court Justice
Adrienne C. Nelson to serve as a federal judge.If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Nelson, 55, would be the
first Black woman to serve on the U.S. District Court for Oregon.Gov. Kate Brown appointed
Nelson to be an associate justice on Oregon's high court in 2018,
making her the first Black judge to serve on that court — or any court of
appeal in the state.Before that, Nelson was a trial court judge for nearly 12
years on the Multnomah County Circuit Court.Nelson was one of three other federal judicial nominees
announced Thursday, July 14.The nominations continue to fulfill Biden's ""promise to
ensure that the nation's courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country — both in terms of personal and professional
backgrounds,"" read a
statement from the White House.All of the nominees ""are extraordinarily qualified,
experienced and devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution,"" White
House officials said.Nelson's interest in law began in Arkansas, where she grew
up.She was prohibited from serving as valedictorian at her high
school because of her race, according to Brown's office. The school initially
decided to give the honor to a white student with a lower GPA.Nelson's mother, Jacquelyn
Brown, sued the school district and prevailed, allowing Nelson to be named
valedictorian.Nelson stayed in the state to earn her undergraduate degree
at the University of Arkansas. She earned her law degree at the University of
Texas.She launched her legal career as a public defender at
Multnomah Defenders Inc. in 1996. Nelson then joined the private firm Bennett,
Hartman, Morris and Kaplan LLP, where she practiced from 1999 to 2004.She worked as a senior attorney and coordinator of Student
Legal and Mediation Services at Portland State University until 2006 when

http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-join-murray-in-letter-to-va-secretary-urging-end-discrimination-against-same-sex-spouses,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden today joined Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) in a letter to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Denis McDonough pressing for answers and immediate action to ensure same-sex veteran couples have access to the full scope of spousal benefits they are owed.  “Each of our veterans and their spouses deserve the same quality care and services once they leave the military – no matter who they love. Our veterans and their families, who selflessly served our nation and have sacrificed so much, must be afforded the benefits they have so rightly earned. This is not only a matter of fairness and equity, it is the morally right thing to do,” wrote the senators. “Yet, we have recently heard from numerous survivors about issues they are facing when they attempt to access the full Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits that they are entitled to under the law.” In their letter, the Senators underscored reported examples of VA’s refusal to deem same-sex marriages as having met the statutory marriage duration or deadline requirements when couples were legally barred from marrying within that timeframe immediately before the veteran’s death. The Senators highlighted how denying benefits in cases where same-sex couples failed to meet marriage duration requirements have left them ineligible for benefits due to living in places where marriage laws barred them from marrying.  Other federal agencies like the Social Security Administration took action to accept and reconsider claims for survivor benefits by same-sex spouses and partners who were previously unable to meet marriage duration requirements, VA has failed to provide recourse for same-sex couples held back by unconstitutional and discriminatory laws. The senators called for VA to make eligible for benefits bona fide same-sex relationships who have been denied benefits solely because they could not meet a strict marriage durational requirement. In addition, the senators noted VA’s setting of effective dates for benefits deepens the unconstitutional practice of same-sex marriage bans. Even after the Department of Justice announced that it would no longer enforce laws banning benefits to same-sex spouses of veterans, VA interpreted the announcement to apply retroactively, but only “as to claims for benefits based on same-sex marriages that were pending on direct review as of” the date of the Attorney General’s announcement, cutting short benefits of those in same-sex marriages who initially applied for such benefits, and were denied due to bans on same-sex marriage. The senators made clear that VA must end its discriminatory treatment of veterans’ spouses based on who they love, and apply effective dates as though the former unconstitutional laws were never enacted. “We promise to take care of all our veterans after they serve our country, and that includes ensuring that their partners have access to full and complete spousal benefits. Correcting this error will help end the discriminatory treatment of potentially thousands of same-sex veteran couples and allow them to access the benefits they are owed,” they concluded.In addition to Senators Merkley, Wyden and Murray, the letter was also signed by Senators Warnock (D-GA), Duckworth (D-IL), Blumenthal (D-CT), Baldwin (D-WI), Markey (D-MA), Hirono (D-HI), Luján (D-NM), Smith (D-MN), Hassan (D-NH), Whitehouse (D-RI), Murphy (D-CT), Sanders (D-VT), Gillibrand (D-NY), Heinrich (D-NM), Durbin (D-IL), Warren (D-MA), Klobuchar (D-MN), Menendez (D-NJ), Casey (D-PA), Kaine (D-VA), Schumer (D-NY), Cortez Masto (D-NV), Bennet (D-CO), Padilla (D-CA), Reed (D-RI), Shaheen (D-NH), Warner (D-VA), Booker (D-NJ), Rosen (D-NV), Feinstein (D-CA), Peters (D-MI), Brown (D-OH), Cantwell (D-WA), Coons (D-DE), Cardin (D-MD), Schatz (D-HI), Leahy (D-VT), and Kelly (D-AZ). Full text of the letter can be found here and follows below:Dear Secretary McDonough:  We write to inquire about the discriminatory treatment of certain same-sex veteran couples who are being denied full and complete spousal benefits. We must ensure that the unconstitutional laws of the past do not further harm the surviving loved ones of our country’s LGBTQ+ veterans.Each of our veterans and their spouses deserve the same quality care and services once they leave the military – no matter who they love. Our veterans and their families, who selflessly served our nation and have sacrificed so much, must be afforded the benefits they have so rightly earned. This is not only a matter of fairness and equity, it is the morally right thing to do.Yet, we have recently heard from numerous survivors about issues they are facing when they attempt to access the full Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits that they are entitled to under the law.It has come to our attention that VA is refusing to deem same-sex marriages as having met the statutory marriage duration or deadline requirements when the couples were legally barred from marrying within that timeframe immediately before the veteran’s death. For example, dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) benefits may only be awarded if the surviving spouse was married to the veteran for at least one year or within 15 years of the veteran’s discharge,1 and for eight years in the case of enhanced DIC benefits.2 Survivor’s pension benefits also have a one-year marriage duration requirement.3By denying benefits in cases where same-sex couples failed to meet marriage duration requirements, VA ignores the reality that discriminatory marriage laws where these couples lived barred them from marrying—even though they were in loving, committed relationships and would have married earlier if they could. It was not until the Supreme Court held in Obergefell v. Hodges a constitutional right to marry that same-sex relationships were properly recognized, including the “constellation” of rights associated with marriage, such as the “rights and benefits of survivors.”4After courts found unconstitutional the nine-month marriage duration requirement under the Social Security Act when applied to same-sex couples who were barred from meeting the requirement due to discriminatory marriage laws, the Social Security Administration began accepting and reconsidering claims for survivor benefits by same-sex spouses and partners who were unable to be married for the requisite nine months because of these bans on same-sex marriage.5 VA should do the same for veterans survivor benefits. Just like the unconstitutional laws banning same-sex couples from marrying, denials for veterans benefits that are tied to those marriage bans are unconstitutional too.Specifically, VA must make eligible for benefits bona fide same-sex relationships where either the same-sex couple had married but were prevented from being married for the time required under the statute, or where they were prevented from marrying each other at all. While marriage duration requirements may be defensible as a proxy for detecting or deterring sham relationships between opposite-sex couples—who have always enjoyed the right to marry—they cannot serve that function for same-sex couples who were barred from marrying one another. Surviving same-sex partners and spouses of veterans who were unable to marry because of now unconstitutional marriage laws should not be denied benefits solely because they did not meet a strict marriage durational requirement. We urge VA to be mindful of other past, discriminatory practices that upended the lives our veterans and their families – like the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy – and look primarily to the surviving partner’s own statements about whether and when they would have married but for unconstitutional bans on same-sex marriage.It also has come to our attention that VA’s setting of effective dates for benefits furthers these unconstitutional same-sex marriage bans. After the Supreme Court held that the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages under state law in June 2013, the Department of Justice subsequently announced on September 4, 2013, that it would no longer enforce laws banning benefits to same-sex spouses of veterans.6 The VA General Counsel interpreted the announcement to apply retroactively but only “as to claims for benefits based on same-sex marriages that were pending on direct review as of” the date of the Attorney General’s announcement.7 For claims received or re-applied for after the Attorney General’s announcement, “such claims could receive an effective date up to one year prior to receipt of the claim, but in no event earlier than September 4, 2013.”8By setting an effective date no earlier than September 4, 2013, VA is giving credence to the unconstitutional laws that prevented same-sex spouses from obtaining veterans benefits in the first place. A spouse married to an opposite-sex veteran would have had no issues receiving benefits immediately. However, VA is cutting short benefits of those in same-sex marriages who initially applied for such benefits and were denied due to bans on same-sex marriage. Moreover, any delay by a widow of a same-sex veteran in filing a claim for spousal benefits can be directly linked to VA’s enforcement of unconstitutional laws that would have led to the ultimate denial of such benefits. VA must stop its discriminatory treatment of veterans’ spouses based on their sex or sexual orientation, and apply retroactive effective dates as if the unconstitutional laws struck down by the Supreme Court were never enacted. Prior claims not previously appealed should be permitted to be reopened, as well as new claims to be filed.We promise to take care of all our veterans after they serve our country, and that includes ensuring that their partners have access to full and complete spousal benefits. Correcting this error will help end the discriminatory treatment of potentially thousands of same-sex veteran couples and allow them to access the benefits they are owed. Thank you for your attention to this important matter, and we look forward to hearing back from you soon.Sincerely,###"

This resilient building will provide crucial public service for years to come.” The $32,200 U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development grant will help with the construction of a new fire station in Dayville to replace the previous facility, which was damaged beyond repair in a July 2021 blaze.“The Dayville Volunteer Fire Department impacts the lives of many and its service to our rural area is vital,” said Dayville City Recorder Ruth Moore. “We currently find ourselves without a fire station, so we are thrilled with the additional funding that will allow us to move forward with the construction of a new building. A new fire station will provide our volunteers with a much needed facility to house our trucks and equipment and provide an area for trainings and meetings; all crucial elements for a functioning fire department. We are very appreciative to USDA Rural Development, as well as to all of the funders, for their support of this project. We would not be able to construct a new fire station without this assistance and are thankful for the help of Senators Wyden and Merkley.”"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/as-climate-legislation-stalls-merkley-calls-on-biden-to-use-full-scope-of-executive-powers-to-act-on-climate,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley issued the following statement after reports that climate provisions have been dropped from the reconciliation package:“I’ve seen my home state of Oregon burned up by catastrophic wildfires, exacerbated by climate chaos. I’ve seen entire towns burned to the ground. We cannot wait any longer to take action to combat climate chaos.“We need to move boldly and immediately to transition America away from fossil fuels to renewable energy like wind and solar. We must electrify our energy grid, and incentivize the transition to electric vehicles. For too long, we’ve been waiting on a single legislative package to save us and a single legislator to determine our fate. Now that it’s clear legislation to address our climate crisis is dead, President Biden needs to put us on an emergency footing to address this disaster.“President Biden should start by declaring climate chaos a national emergency under the National Emergency Act. Declaring a climate emergency would allow the president to redirect spending to build out renewable energy systems, help put large-scale clean transportation solutions in place, and finance distributed energy projects to boost climate resiliency. Each of these steps would help safeguard communities across America and slash the harmful pollution that drives the climate crisis.“President Biden must immediately end all new fossil fuel leasing. It was his campaign promise, and now is the time to show the American people he’s serious by saying no to expanding our addiction to fossil fuels. That means not moving forward with lease sale 257 in the Gulf of Mexico, not permitting Alaska’s Willow oil and gas project, and finalizing a 5-year leasing plan for the outer continental shelf that doesn’t offer new leasing.“The President can – and must – expand his use of The Defense Protection Act to help address the national security threats posed by our climate crisis and strengthen emergency preparedness in America by supporting the construction of resilient energy infrastructure and mobilizing domestic industry to ramp up the manufacturing of clean energy technologies.“These are a few of the necessary steps Biden should take to protect Americans from the coming deluge of violent storms and extreme weather events on the horizon, and can also spawn a robust clean energy industry generating millions of high-quality American jobs vital to rejuvenating our post-COVID economy. Our communities cannot be left on their own to struggle with the catastrophic effects of the climate crisis like we are seeing in Oregon as we deal with fires, smoke, extreme heat, and severe drought.“This is the time for the administration to think big. Cover federal properties in solar panels. Electrify the entire postal fleet, not a fraction. Require the government to quantify the climate costs of every decision it makes. Use the federal government’s massive footprint as a market participant to drive down new technology costs. There are enormous opportunities and our future depends on the president and his team seizing them.” ###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-urge-biden-administration-to-declare-national-and-public-health-emergencies-on-reproductive-rights,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden joined Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Alex Padilla (D-CA) and a dozen other colleagues in a letter to President Biden and Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra urging them to immediately declare national and public health emergencies on reproductive rights.  Millions of Americans have been endangered by the Supreme Court’s reckless decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and eliminate the constitutional right to an abortion. In state after state, Republican lawmakers have implemented extremist abortion bans and restrictions, even threatening in some cases to lock up doctors and patients. Health care providers have already been forced to withhold lifesaving care. And the maternal mortality crisis, mental health outcomes, and economic disparities are bound to worsen, especially if rightwing extremists follow through on their public calls for a nationwide abortion ban.“As President of the United States and Secretary of Health and Human Services, you have the authority to declare a national emergency and public health emergency over these attacks on Americans’ reproductive rights […] These authorities have been used by the Biden-Harris Administration—and other presidential administrations—to address public health crises ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic to the opioid epidemic,” wrote the lawmakers. The lawmakers outlined six powerful authorities and resources that could be unlocked by emergency declarations to safeguard and improve access to reproductive care across the country. By declaring a national and public health emergency, the administration could: “While it is impossible to immediately undo the damage inflicted by the Supreme Court’s repeal of Roe v. Wade, the Biden-Harris Administration must use every tool within its power to fight back,” concluded the lawmakers. “Your leadership during this unprecedented crisis for women is more important than ever.” In addition to Merkley, Wyden, Warren, Booker, and Padilla, the letter was also signed by Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Edward J Markey (D-MA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Tina Smith (D-MN), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). Full text of the letter can be found here and follows below: Dear Mr. President and Mr. Secretary:In the wake of the Supreme Court’s devastating decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, we write to urge you to immediately declare national and public health emergencies over Americans’ access to reproductive care. Millions of American women have been endangered by the Supreme Court’s reckless decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and eliminate the constitutional right to an abortion. Within days of the release of the Court’s opinion, nine states moved to ban abortion with virtually no exceptions, and over a dozen more states could enact additional abortion bans and restrictions in the coming weeks. Doctors have already been forced to withhold lifesaving care from women facing miscarriages, infection, and sepsis in light of draconian civil and criminal penalties imposed by extremist governors and state legislatures. In the midst of a maternal mortality crisis that disproportionately kills Black and Brown women, research suggests that a nationwide abortion ban—championed by former Vice President Mike Pence, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and numerous other anti-abortion officeholders in the aftermath of Dobbs—would increase pregnancy-related deaths by 21 percent; in Mississippi, a Black woman is already 118 times more likely to die by carrying a pregnancy to term than by having an abortion.  Mental health outcomes and economic disparities for people forced to carry unwanted pregnancies will become even worse.  Simply put, this is an emergency. The Biden-Harris Administration has already taken important steps to defend abortion rights in response to escalating rightwing attacks, including through commitments to expand patient access to medication abortion, protect the right to travel to obtain abortion services, and defend the privacy of patients seeking reproductive care. But you have the power to do more to address this crisis. As President of the United States and Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), you have the authority to declare a national emergency and public health emergency over these attacks on Americans’ reproductive rights. The National Emergencies Act and the Stafford Act confer wide powers for the President to declare a national emergency. The Public Health Services Act and the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act authorize the Secretary to declare a public health emergency. These authorities have been used by the Biden- Harris Administration—and other presidential administrations—to address public health crises ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic to the opioid epidemic.  Critically, declaring an emergency over the state of reproductive rights in the United States could unlock powerful flexibilities and resources for federal, state, and local government to safeguard and improve access to health care across the country. Specifically, this measure could: While it is impossible to immediately undo the damage inflicted by the Supreme Court’s repeal of Roe v. Wade, the Biden-Harris Administration must use every tool within its power to fight back. We urge you to declare national and public health emergencies over Americans’ access to reproductive care. Your leadership during this unprecedented crisis for women is more important than ever. Thank you for your attention to this important matter. Sincerely,  ###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-30-million-headed-to-astoria-to-expand-coast-guard-facilities,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden announced that the United States Coast Guard awarded a $30 million federal contract to expand Coast Guard shore-side facilities at East Tongue Point in Astoria. This enable the facility to accommodate the home porting of Fast Response Cutters (FRCs). Fast Response Cutters are the newest class of ships currently being produced for the United States Coast Guard. The $30 million contract will ensure that East Tongue Point can welcome the FRCs, including a fixed pier, two floating docks, gangways between the docks and pier, and utility work. The contract also includes dredging 96.5 thousand cubic yards of sediment and an additional 18 thousand cubic yards of clean sand fill.  “Coast Guard men and women put their lives on the line every day to keep Oregonians and others in our region safe,” said Merkley. “Making sure they have the latest equipment and technology to continue providing crucial, sometimes life-saving services, is critical to the safety of the surrounding communities, especially those whose livelihoods depend on being out on the water. Awarding this contract is a critical step forward to seeing how the facility in Astoria grows and continues to provide important services for the Pacific Northwest.” “Modernizing and expanding Coast Guard operations in Astoria is essential to support the heroes who work there to protect lives year-round,” said Wyden. “I’m gratified the North Coast has secured this significant $30 million investment that will build an even stronger Coast Guard presence in Oregon. And I’ll keep fighting to ensure this longstanding and proven Coast Guard resource has all that it needs to continue safeguarding the Oregon Coast for generations to come.”The FRC project will replace aging Island-class 110-foot patrol boats, and delivers vital capability to the Coast Guard, helping to meet the service’s need in the coastal zone and adjacent waters. The FRCs feature advanced command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance equipment; over-the-horizon cutter boat deployment to reach vessels of interest; and improved habitability and seakeeping.  The ships are designed for multiple uses including drug interdiction; ports, waterways and coastal security; fisheries law enforcement; search and rescue; and national defense. Forty-five FRCs are currently in service throughout the nation and abroad. “The expansion of the facilities at Tongue Point is the first, critical step in bringing the newest class of cutters to the Oregon Coast. The Fast Response Cutters that will be stationed in Astoria will ensure that future generations of Coast Guard men and women continue to provide expert service to the people of the Pacific Northwest for many years to come,” said Scott Jackson, Sector Commander and Air Station Commanding Officer of the U.S. Coast Guard.  Merkley and Wyden have long championed Coast Guard resources for the Oregon Coast. In 2015, they teamed up with members of the House delegation to save a critical Coast Guard helicopter at the Newport Coast Guard station after the local community raised the alarm that cutting Coast Guard resources could lead to more lives being lost in the notoriously treacherous waters off the Oregon Coast. In 2020, Merkley, Wyden along with Representative Bonamici urged for two more cutters to be stationed locally. Because of the rough seas and cold water off the Oregon Coast, timeliness is particularly critical to successful rescues in the Pacific Northwest, and Coast Guard resources are crucial to making these life-saving rescues possible.  ###"

http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-bass-gillibrand-durbin-introduce-bicameral-bill-to-protect-non-citizen-children-in-government-custody-22,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley, Representative Karen Bass (D-CA-37), and Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) teamed up to introduce the bicameral Children’s Safe Welcome Act. This bill establishes new standards to ensure that the safety and well-being of migrant children in government custody are prioritized. The Children’s Safe Welcome Act embeds child welfare best practices into every stage of our immigration system involving unaccompanied and accompanied noncitizen children who seek asylum in the U.S. “Every American should want all children to be treated with care, especially when we, through our government, are responsible for their well-being,” said Senator Merkley. “The previous administration pursued a deliberate strategy of inflicting trauma on children to deter people seeking asylum from coming to our borders. This was and still is shameful and wrong. But the good news is that we now have a detailed plan for an immigration system that serves the best interests of the children in our care. As President Biden and his administration continue rewriting their processes and procedures for children seeking asylum at the border, I urge them to use our legislation as a guiding compass to create an immigration system that is fair and gives all children the best chance to pursue their potential, regardless of the ultimate outcome of their asylum requests. We can and should be good enough to treat every child with dignity and respect.” “The separation of families at the border under the Trump administration was state-sanctioned child abuse,” said Representative Karen Bass. “Part of what allowed that administration to inflict trauma and terror was a lack of standards when it comes to the safety and well-being of migrant children in government custody. We have not forgotten the trauma. We have not forgotten the terror. This piece of legislation we are introducing today will help ensure that those horrors never happen again. I urge my colleagues in both the House and the Senate to join this fight and pass this bill.”“Our immigration system should recognize the dignity and promise of children who come here seeking asylum and a better life,” said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. “Not only will the Children’s Safe Welcome Act imbue our immigration system with compassion, humanity, fairness and safety, but it will also allow these children to live up to their potential. We must act to seize this opportunity to create a new immigration framework that strengthens protections for children and makes our communities stronger.”“Our immigration system has failed to meet our legal and moral obligation to protect families and children entering the United States at the southern border. We must ensure that the youngest immigrants have access to adequate care and legal representation in addition to mandating that families cannot and will not be separated,” said Senator Durbin. “In joining my colleagues to introduce the Children’s Safe Welcome Act, we can have a serious conversation about how we prioritize children’s welfare in our country’s immigration laws.” Historically, the United States’ immigration system was designed only with adults in mind. However, over the past few decades, our nation has only made piecemeal changes to reflect the distinctive needs of children also seeking refuge at the border. In an effort to profoundly reduce suffering and trauma to children, our immigration system needs comprehensive reforms consistent with the best interests of children.  Senator Merkley has been a long-time advocate fighting for decency, respect, and humane treatment for those seeking asylum at the borders—introducing the Immigrant’s Mental Health Act and the Freedom for Families Act.  In March, Senators Durbin and Merkley led a letter to the Biden Administration urging it to provide a just resolution for families separated under for the former administrations’ “Zero Tolerance” policy.  Specifically, the Children’s Safe Welcome Act will: The Children’s Safe Welcome Act is supported by leading experts, advocates, and organizations representing noncitizen children in all stages of our immigration system, including in particular The National Center for Youth Law and the Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights. “When we walk into facilities and see children held in unacceptable conditions, and then hear them recount the traumatic experiences they’ve had while in custody, it is painfully clear the protections we currently have for children in federal immigration custody are insufficient. They neither adequately ensure that children are in custody for the shortest possible amount of time, nor do they ensure that while in custody, the best interests of children are prioritized. We need stronger and more permanent protections. This is what the Children’s Safe Welcome Act offers us,” said Neha Desai, Senior Director, Immigration, National Center for Youth Law, and Flores counsel.""Today’s introduction of the Children’s Safe Welcome Act is a monumental step forward in reimagining policies that lead with humanity, safety, and family unity. For years, the Young Center has helped to guide the development of this bill to ensure all children, regardless of their immigration status, are protected. Under policies like Title 42, children continue to be separated from their loved ones and are often placed in restrictive facilities that fail to provide the care they need and deserve. From prioritizing keeping families together to restricting the use of large-scale, unlicensed facilities for unaccompanied children, this bill is a critical opportunity for Congress to strengthen and boldly enact new protections that invest in and prioritize every child’s health and safety,” said Gladis Molina Alt, Executive Director of the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights “Save the Children strongly supports the Children’s Safe Welcome Act, which would re-envision and guarantee child welfare protections for migrant children seeking asylum and a better life in the U.S.,” said Christy Gleason, Vice President for Policy, Advocacy and Campaigns at Save the Children “This legislation would protect children’s best interests by strengthening and improving health and safety standards for children in U.S. immigration proceedings, which have been ignored for far too long. Children and families deserve to be treated with compassion, dignity and respect, especially while in the custody of the U.S. government. We applaud Senators Merkley, Gillibrand and Durbin, as well as Representative Bass for introducing this bill, and look forward to working with them to pass it into law.”In addition to Senators Merkley, Gillibrand, Durbin, and Representative Bass, The Children’s Safe Welcome Act is cosponsored by Senators Brian Schatz (D-HI), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Patty Murray (D-WA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Bob Casey (D-PA), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN).The Children’s Safe Welcome Act is endorsed by 40 organizations including: Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, CAIR Coalition, Center for Children's Law and Policy, Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law, Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP), Center for the Human Rights of Children at Loyola, University Chicago School of Law, Child Welfare League of America, CHILDREN AT RISK, Children's Defense Fund, Children's Rights, Church World Service, Columbia Law School Immigrants' Rights Clinic, Disability Rights California, Disability Rights Florida, First Focus Campaign for Children, Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project, Human Rights Center, School of Law, University of California Ber, Immigrant Health Equity and Legal Partnerships (ImmHELP) , Immigrant Legal Defense, International Refugee Assistance Project, Juvenile Law Center, Kids in Need of Defense, Legal Services for Children, Mental Health Advocacy Services, Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, National Association of Counsel for Children, National Center for Youth Law, National Immigrant Justice Center, Our Children Oregon, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), Prevention Institute, Public Counsel, RAICES, Save the Children, The Children’s Partnership, Tulane Law School's Immigrant Rights Clinic, UC Davis Immigration Law Clinic, UNICEF USA, Women's Refugee Commission, and the Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights.Final bill text can be found here.A one page summary of the bill can be found here. ###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-announce-more-than-3-million-to-help-safeguard-water-supplies-around-oregon,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden announce a total of $3,052,940 in federal funding is headed to three projects across the state to combat record drought conditions throughout the west, including Oregon. These federal investments are intended to safeguard local water supplies in response the extreme drought and weather events.“Between record droughts and raging megafires, Oregon and other Western states have been hit hard over the last couple of years,” said Merkley. “These three water projects will restore habitats and riverbanks, and create resilient efficient water systems—helping stretch scarce water resources further in these challenging times. I look forward to following the progress of these important projects, and will keep working to deliver federal funding and resources needed to combat drought and ensure families and businesses can make it through these tough times.”“Drought and devastating wildfires fueled by the climate crisis have slammed Oregon, and the need is great throughout out state to respond with urgency,” said Wyden. “These federal resources from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law I fought to pass will help protect critical water supplies in these Oregon communities. And I’ll keep battling to protect lives and livelihoods throughout our state with similar support that helps Oregonians weather drought’s destructive impacts.” Funding for these projects is intended to advance quantifiable and sustained water savings by protecting watersheds impacted by wildfire, restoring aquatic habitats and stream beds, and advancing other environmental restoration projects to mitigate drought-related impacts.Oregon projects can be found below:Rogue Valley Council of Governments $784,151 – Bear Creek Fish Passage Barriers RemovalEast Fork Irrigation District$2,000,000 – Oanna & Yasui Sublateral Efficiency ProjectCurry Watersheds Nonprofit$268,789 – Sixes Riverbank Restoration and Estuary Enhancement“Funding provided by this project will address several long-standing barriers in Bear Creek that impede water flow and fish passage. These barriers have been overlooked for funding despite being identified as local priorities. It’s through programs like these that projects are able to be completed. The funding will allow for work leading to retrofitting or removing the obstacles improving fish habitat, allowing Bear Creek to flow more freely by restoring aquatic habitat and stream bed conditions, and improve overall water quality for Coho Salmon and other species that depend on Bear Creek,” said Greg Stahach, Natural, Rogue Valley Council of Governments, Resources Program Manager.""East Fork Irrigation District, with the support of the Hood River Watershed Group, Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and other agencies, is working to increase instream flows in the East Fork Hood River and mainstem Hood River while at the same time improving water reliability for EFID farmers and rural residents.  The WaterSmart grant for the Oanna-Yasui pipeline project will help us achieve our Irrigation Modernization Plan to improve the quality of our rivers, protect habitat for threatened salmon and steelhead, and provide reliable irrigation water for crop production,"" said Steve Pappas, East Fork Irrigation District, District Manager.“Curry Watersheds Partnership is a group of non-regulatory organizations working together to help local landowners and communities keep our shared lands and rivers healthy and sustainable. With this funding, we will be reducing severe erosion and enhancing water quality and instream habitat in the Sixes River estuary on the southern Oregon coast. Estuaries have been identified as a priority habitat by the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board, the Oregon Conservation Strategy, The Nature Conservancy, and the Oregon Independent Multi-disciplinary Science Team, due to the number of beneficial functions and services they provide both to fish and wildlife species and to the human population. Active erosion at the project site is undermining the landowner’s efforts to exclude livestock from the river and establish a riparian reserve, and consuming valuable pastureland and threatening irrigation that is integral to the property’s status as a ‘working lands’ cattle ranch. These large ranches are an asset to the local economy and agricultural community.  Instream and riparian habitat enhancements will benefit a wide range of native fish species, including the federally threatened Oregon Coast population of coho salmon, Pacific lamprey, Chinook salmon, coastal cutthroat trout, winter steelhead, as well as reptiles and amphibians, birds and waterfowl, mammals, plant communities, and insects. We are thrilled for this opportunity to advance our mission of supporting our communities to care for our lands and waters, now and into the future,” said Miranda Gray, Curry Watersheds Partnership, South Coast Watershed Council Coordinator.The funding announced is part of the $160 million in WaterSMART grants provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2022. This Department's WaterSMART Program focuses on collaborative efforts to plan and implement actions to increase water supply sustainability, including investments to modernize infrastructure.  Funds allocated by the BIL are intended to address water and drought challenges for the nation’s western water and power infrastructure by repairing aging water delivery systems, securing dams, completing rural water projects, protecting aquatic ecosystems and fulfilling Indian Water Rights Settlements. Local governments in states set to receive funding must complete their project within three years.###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-sounds-alarm-on-human-rights-concerns-in-ethiopia,"Washington, D.C. – Today, Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley, in a letter to the U.S. Department of State, called attention to human rights concerns for the Oromo community, urging the Department to do more to address the ongoing human rights and humanitarian situation in Ethiopia.  “I write to you regarding the human rights and humanitarian situation throughout Ethiopia. I thank you for the work of your Bureau to address the situation in northern Ethiopia since the start of the conflict in Tigray in November 2020, and the continued calls of the State Department for the Ethiopian government to take steps towards achieving sustainable peace. I fully support efforts by the State Department to bring an end to the conflict in northern Ethiopia, and continue to urge the Government of Ethiopia to allow unfettered humanitarian access and restore essential services to Tigray,” wrote Senator Merkley to Ambassador Molly Phee, the Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of African Affairs. The letter calls for more action from the State Department to advance a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Ethiopia, including accountability for human rights violations and an inclusive political dialogue to achieve meaningful peace.  “At the same time, I believe that in order to achieve lasting peace throughout Ethiopia, close attention must also be given to the conflicts and human rights abuses occurring in other regions and against a wide variety of ethnic groups. This includes the plight of members of the Oromo community, the country’s largest ethnic group, some of whom are currently facing a dire human rights and humanitarian situation due to ongoing fighting between the government and the rebel group, the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA),” he continued.   Oromo youth (Qeeroo) played a pivotal role in Prime Minister Abiy’s rise to power in 2018. Much like the U.S. government, the Oromo community initially had high hopes that the new Ethiopian government would protect human rights. Soon after assuming office, however, Abiy’s government began committing human rights abuses against Oromo civilians. “In June 2020, six months prior to the start of the war in Tigray, Hacahlu Hundessa, an Oromo activist and singer, was assassinated in Addis Ababa. During the protests that followed his death, more than 3,500 people were arrested, including peaceful protesters and Oromo politicians. Within a month, the number of arrests reached 9,000 […] Since that time, the situation for Oromo civilians throughout Ethiopia has only continued to deteriorate,” the letter states. In response to the abuses by the Ethiopian government, the letter calls on the Department of State to: The full letter can be found here and follows below: July 7, 2022 Dear Ambassador Phee,I write to you regarding the human rights and humanitarian situation throughout Ethiopia. I thank you for the work of your Bureau to address the situation in northern Ethiopia since the start of the conflict in Tigray in November 2020, and the continued calls of the State Department for the Ethiopian government to take steps towards achieving sustainable peace.[1] I fully support efforts by the State Department to bring an end to the conflict in northern Ethiopia, and continue to urge the Government of Ethiopia to allow unfettered humanitarian access and restore essential services to Tigray.At the same time, I believe that in order to achieve lasting peace throughout Ethiopia, close attention must also be given to the conflicts and human rights abuses occurring in other regions and against a wide variety of ethnic groups. This includes the plight of members of the Oromo community, the country’s largest ethnic group, some of whom are currently facing a dire human rights and humanitarian situation due to ongoing fighting between the government and the rebel group, the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA). Oromo youth (Qeeroo) played a pivotal role in the protest movement that spurred Prime Minister Abiy’s rise to power in 2018,[2] and the Oromo community, much like the U.S. government, initially had high hopes that his government would protect human rights. Unfortunately, soon after taking office, the Abiy government began committing human rights abuses against Oromo civilians.[3]  In June 2020, six months prior to the start of the war in Tigray, Hacahlu Hundessa, an Oromo activist and singer, was assassinated in Addis Ababa. During the protests that followed his death, more than 3,500 people were arrested, including peaceful protesters and Oromo politicians.[4] Within a month, the number of arrests reached 9,000, and there were widespread reports of prisoners experiencing due process violations.[5]Since that time, the situation for Oromo civilians throughout Ethiopia has only continued to deteriorate. There have been communications blackouts in Oromia, and numerous reports of Amhara militias (Fano)[6] and Ethiopian security forces attacking civilians.[7] Human Rights Watch, among others, have documented extrajudicial executions, often in relation to victims’ purported ties to the OLA, which itself has been implicated in killings of civilians.For example, in December 2021, Oromia state security forces killed a group of Oromo elders. During the November 2021 state of emergency, Some Oromo civilians were, like Tigrayans, also targeted for arrests on the basis of their ethnicity.[8] In April of this year, the Ethiopian government and the Oromia regional government announced a new military campaign inside Oromia in order to combat the OLA.[9]  There have been reports of government forces targeting Oromo civilians, including through the use of drones, in those operations.[10] This violence has led to an increasingly untenable situation for residents of conflict-affected parts of Oromia, with more than 500,000 individuals reported as having been recently displaced inside Western Oromia, alone.[11] Most recently, Ethiopian security forces have been implicated in shooting civilians, including ethnic Oromo, in Gambella regional state, in the aftermath of fighting with rebels in the state’s capital.[12]Meanwhile, the OLA and government officials have traded blame for two large-scale atrocities in Oromia since mid-June.  The government has accused the OLA of the attacks, which reportedly targeted ethnic Amhara and resulted in hundreds of deaths. The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission has called for the urgent reinforcement of government security forces to prevent further killings. Accountability for all human rights violations, no matter which parties to the conflict committed them, is necessary to allow for meaningful reconciliation and a peaceful and stable Ethiopia.The Horn of Africa, including the southern regions of Ethiopia, is also currently experiencing a severe drought, leaving many in need of humanitarian assistance. Recent reports suggest that at least 8 million individuals throughout southern Ethiopia are currently affected by the drought,[13] and over 2 million livestock have already been lost within Oromia.[14] I am very concerned about the ability of humanitarian aid to reach those individuals in need, especially in light of ongoing conflict and counterinsurgency operations in parts of the region. There have been reports about aid not being delivered to populations in need in southern Oromia due to security concerns.[15]In light of the above, I urge you to strengthen your calls for the Ethiopian government to reach peaceful resolution of all conflicts throughout the country. In the short term, this means doing more to call attention to the human rights abuses being perpetrated against Oromos, both in your engagement with members of the Ethiopian government and in the State Department Human Rights Country annual report. I urge you to have Embassy staff travel to conflict-affected parts of Oromia to see the situation for themselves and speak to those affected.In order to achieve lasting and sustainable peace throughout Ethiopia, I hope that the long-term focus of the State Department will include calling for the establishment of independent investigations into allegations of human rights abuses committed throughout Ethiopia,[16] and supporting the development of a truly inclusive and independent dialogue to chart a democratic path forward for the country. I stand ready to help the State Department develop these strategies, and look forward to working with you towards the peaceful resolution of conflicts throughout Ethiopia. Sincerely,###[1] Media Note: Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Phee and Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Satterfield, US Dep’t of State (Jan. 14, 2022), https://www.state.gov/assistant-secretary-of-state-for-african-affairs-phee-and-special-envoy-for-the-horn-of-africa-satterfield/.[2] Statement by Senator Coons, S.Hrg. 117-50, Ethiopia in Crisis: U.S. Strategy and Policy Response.

This is the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law at work!” ”Portland has long been a leader in sustainable infrastructure and our city’s airport is an important reflection of this legacy,” Blumenauer said. “I was proud to lead the Oregon delegation in securing $18.4 million dollars from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to increase the efficacy, sustainability and resilience of our airport. This historic investment is not just good for our community, but our climate.”PDX will use the $18.4 million to install a new heat pump, replacing old chillers and boilers that are up to 50 years old. The new heat pump will reduce carbon emissions and provide an estimated 83 percent reduction in energy demand to heat and cool the building. This project will have a goal of zero carbon emissions by 2050.“We appreciate the Oregon Congressional Delegation’s support for this grant,” said Port of Portland Executive Director Curtis Robinhold. “We remain firmly committed to a low-carbon future. The federal funds for this new system – which will improve the energy efficiency of PDX and significantly reduce the environmental impact of our new upgraded airport – will help us fully achieve our vision of a more sustainable and equitable PDX.” ###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-la-pine-to-receive-177-million-for-crucial-water-infrastructure-upgrades-22,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley today announced that the City of La Pine will receive more than $17.7 million in a combination of loans and grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for municipal water improvements to transition away from septic systems which are contaminating groundwater for residents and small businesses.“The people in this part of Deschutes County have long suffered from groundwater contamination from the septic systems,” said Wyden, who introduced the Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) Sector Development Act of 2022. “The city has already laid some of the foundation for a municipal wastewater system, so I’m gratified to see federal funds going toward getting this vital municipal wastewater project over the finish line.  This money will help La Pine reduce existing groundwater contamination and protect Oregon watersheds in this part of our state for years to come.”“Access to clean, reliable water and a strong water infrastructure system is vital to growing and strengthening our communities and economies,” said Senator Merkley. “This USDA funding to La Pine will provide crucial support that will allow the city to improve not only their water infrastructure and wastewater system, but also the quality of the local watershed.” The city of La Pine municipal water system improvements will include the following: Construction of a new 500,000-gallon water reservoir, installation of new water distribution lines to enhance looping, circulation, and fire flow capabilities, and the addition of the Cagle and Glenwood Acres subdivisions to the municipal water system. Overall, this project will ensure that this rural area will have the needed funds to improve sewer system capacity, reduce contamination and improve the quality of the watershed for years to come.“The City of La Pine would like to thank both Senators Wyden and Merkley, and Congressman Bentz for their efforts on behalf of all citizens that will benefit from these expansion improvements,” said Mayor Dan Richer. “We would also like to extend our appreciation for the efforts made by the United Stated Department of Agriculture and its regional representatives who greatly assisted in bringing this funding package and project to fruition. This will significantly improve the livability and long-term sustainability of our community for all current and future citizens.”"

(KOIN) — Both of Oregon’s United States senators were in Portland Saturday to take part in the Pride Festival, and while they recognized the great strides made for LGBTQ+ rights, they admit there is still much to do.At a Saturday press conference with Pride leaders, Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden each spoke about what’s been gained in recent times.“We have the end of bigoted policies like ‘Don’t ask, don’t tell.’ We have marriage equality,” Merkley said. “But we have a long way to go.”Wyden noted this was the first Pride parade in 2 years because of the pandemic. “In addition to Pride winning out, we must make sure we cross the finish line on the road to full equality in Oregon and this country,” he said.Merkley is the lead sponsor of The Equality Act, which would ban discrimination against LGBTQ+ Americans. It would add sexual orientation and gender identity to long-standing discrimination bans in employment, housing and more.The US House passed the Equality Act in February 2021, but it stalled in the Senate."

These improvements will not only support the airports, but local economies and Oregon as a whole.” This Southwest Oregon Regional Airport in North Bend will receive more than $1 million for a project that updates the existing northwest apron pavement that has reached the end of its useful life and adds another southwest apron to accommodate increased local use.“The Southwest Oregon Regional Airport is eager to put these funds to use toward a new aircraft apron that will accommodate the increase in airport users that the Oregon Coast is experiencing. Additionally this will provide a connectivity to our soon to be constructed, intermodal Air Cargo Facility,” said Theresa Cook, Executive Director of Coos County Airport District.Roseburg Airport will receive $200,000 to reconfigure its Taxiway A to meet Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) design standards.“We are so appreciative of this grant for making the design possible and thank the Oregon delegation and FAA for making this safety improvement a reality,” said Roseburg City Manager Nikki Messenger. “We have been looking forward to extending the taxiway to match the runway length for over a decade and this will help us make that happen.”"

This resolution emphasizes the urgency of this situation. Congress should come together to pass this resolution and then deliver the solutions to this crisis that our families and our planet deserve.” “Plastic waste is everywhere.  Not only is it piling up in our oceans and rivers – microplastics are now being found in the most remote reaches of Antarctica and, recently, even in human blood,” said Whitehouse, who co-founded the bipartisan Senate Oceans Caucus to find common ground in responding to issues facing the oceans and coasts.  “We’re clearly facing a crisis of plastic pollution, and we ought to use this Plastic Pollution Action Month to build on the success of my bipartisan Save Our Seas laws and combat the scourge of plastic waste.”Full text of the resolution can be found here.###"
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/in-the-news/195-million-grant-request-for-hood-river-white-salmon-bridge-receives-federal-delegation-support-22,"HOOD RIVER — On Monday, June 13, the Gorge region’s entire federal congressional delegation sent a letter to United State Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg expressing unanimous support for the Port of Hood River and Klickitat County’s joint grant application to help fund replacement of the Hood River-White Salmon Interstate Bridge.Submitted in May, the grant application seeks $195 million from the FY2022 INFRA/MEGA/Rural Multimodal Project Discretionary Grant program. In the Notice of Funding Opportunity issued March 22, USDOT combined three major discretionary grant programs into one Multimodal Projects Discretionary Grant opportunity to distribute $2.9 billion now available for major infrastructure projects as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.The letter, signed by Oregon Sens. Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden and Reps. Cliff Bentz and Earl Blumenauer and Washington Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell and Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler note that a successful award “will build on the nearly $100 million that has already been raised for this project, leveraging additional construction funding from a variety of sources.” Kevin Greenwood, the port’s bridge replacement project director, thanked Dan Mahr, field representative for Sen. Merkley for his work to coordinate the effort to gather signatures from the seven congressional offices.The letter to Secretary Buttigieg highlights the work of the Bi-State Bridge Replacement Working Group, noting that both state legislatures have authorized the creation of a new Bi-State Bridge Authority that would own and maintain the new bridge.Greenwood stressed the importance of the bi-state, bi-cameral, bi-partisan support for the project saying, “The practice of entities from both sides of the river working together and submitting joint applications with support from the congressional delegation is proving to be a successful strategy. The project had another joint application from the port and Klickitat County awarded last year as well that provided $5 million in funding from the BUILD program — the only successful application in both states.”For more information or to read the letter, visit the Port of Hood River website at www.portofhoodriver.com."
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/in-the-news/oregon-sens-ron-wyden-jeff-merkley-want-wider-access-to-abortion-pills-help-with-interstate-travel-for-abortions-22,"Senate Democrats, including Oregon’s Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, are asking President Joe Biden to increase access to abortion pills and help patients obtain abortions in other states following Friday’s Supreme Court decision ending the national right to abortions.They have been worried about the Supreme Court decision for weeks, since a draft opinion revealing the court intended to overturn the nearly 50-year precedent set by Roe v Wade.Earlier this month, Senate Democrats wrote to Biden, calling on the federal government to take action to shore up abortion rights. Then on Saturday, they wrote to Biden again, saying “now is the time for bold action.”The letter followed a speech by the president Friday, which came hours after the Supreme Court’s ruling. Biden said he would do what he could to protect abortion rights, but said his power was limited.Congress could pass a law making abortion legal across the U.S., but it appears unlikely given the current congressional makeup. Every Democrat and at least 10 Republicans in the Senate would need to support the bill because of the Senate’s filibuster.The senators, led by Patty Murray, D-Washington and chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, indicated that Biden could take a number of actions. They include:• Increasing access to medication abortion.• Helping individuals obtain abortions in other states, such as by providing vouchers for travel and child care.• Establishing a reproductive health ombudsman at the Department of Health and Human Services.• Protecting sensitive health and location data, particularly when it comes to websites or mobile apps used to track periods or fertility.• Analyzing the use of federal property to increase abortion access and considering whether to move military personnel and their families to states where abortions remain legal.• Ensuring that Medicaid clients can access a provider of their choice for family planning services.“These proposals are only starting points in a federal apparatus that affects millions of Americans every day. The entirety of the federal government has to be engaged in the administration’s efforts and must act as swiftly as possible,” the June 7 letter said.Leaders in some states have said they will try to restrict access to medications such as mifepristone, a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000 to end a pregnancy up to 10 weeks. It is commonly prescribed for miscarriages. It is usually prescribed with another pill — misoprostol. The latter would be difficult to restrict because it’s also prescribed for stomach ulcers.The Food and Drug Administration began allowing mailing abortion pills late last year. The pills are prescribed by doctors and can be self-administered.Biden’s administration said it would seek to ensure that patients have access to medications and contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration.A majority of the abortions in Oregon under Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette and Planned Parenthood of Southwestern Oregon, which perform half of the state’s abortions, are done by medication. Oregon providers cannot prescribe out-of-state but they can prescribe to patients with an Oregon address."
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/in-the-news/us-senate-passes-gun-safety-legislation-22,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- President Biden is calling on the House to quickly vote on a gun safety bill approved Thursday night in the Senate. Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley tweeted a video shortly after the vote, calling the bipartisan gun safety bill a victory. ""It, for example, invests in mental health for our schools and our community health clinics, and it provides extra scrutiny for those under 21 who are buying a rifle, and it closes the boyfriend loophole."" He added, ""These are not earth shattering, but they are substantial. And, we saw Democrats and Republicans come together and enact gun safety legislation of some significance for the first time in 30 years.""All 50 Democrats voted for the bill, along with 15 Republicans. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she will bring quickly bring it for a vote so it can be signed by the President."
http://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/in-the-news/oregon-delegation-reacts-to-supreme-courts-roe-decision-22,"Members of Oregon's congressional delegation quickly issued statements following the news that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the 50-year-old Roe v. Wade decision, which established a constitutional right to abortion.The court's decision means the procedure now becomes illegal in several states, though not in Oregon.U.S. Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., issued this statement on Friday's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision:""The Supreme Court's decision to overturn abortion rights is infuriating, heartbreaking, and dangerous. Abortion is health care. Abortion care is essential for the health and wellbeing of families and communities. I remember the days before Roe v. Wade, when abortions done without medical care could have tragic outcomes – including death. The decision today undermines decades of hard-fought protections for reproductive health and the right to determine when and whether to have a child. Make no mistake, overturning Roe v. Wade will not end abortions; it will make them unsafe. This decision will disproportionately hurt families and individuals who are already struggling, and, unfortunately, it will embolden many states to restrict access to the care people need. Additionally, several justices who joined the majority opinion have made statements claiming that Roe v. Wade is settled law; their action today overruling precedent is a betrayal of the American people's trust and erodes confidence in the Court.""We will not let this decision stop our fight to make abortion care accessible and available to all. I have helped the House pass legislation to put Roe v. Wade into law, and I will continue doing all I can to get it over the finish line.""U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., issued this statement:""Today I join millions of Americans feeling the shocking loss of reproductive freedom in our country. This is not merely a political or legal issue. This is profoundly personal, speaking to an individual's right to control their body and rely on a half-century of legal, constitutional certainty.""The ability to decide when, how, and with whom to have a child is deeply important. That decision is a personal one, and one that should be decided by an individual in consultation with their doctor and family, not an ideological Supreme Court.""Oregon is the only place in the U.S. where abortion is fully protected. We can be grateful to Planned Parenthood Oregon which has been preparing to receive a crushing influx of women seeking abortion care in the weeks and months to come.""We must quickly pivot to protect what we have and continue our fight in every state and every community. Congress should pass the Women's Health Protection Act which would codify a person's right to the full spectrum of reproductive care. We must prepare to fight each new legal challenge to abortion and protect health care providers that are able to continue offering a complete range of reproductive services.""This is not the end of the fight. Rather this is the beginning of a new chapter in which we must stand strong and intensify our efforts to protect the majority of people living in the United States.""U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat, posted his statement on his website and on social media.""When you have to make the most intimate, personal decisions that will impact your life and your health and body, I don't know anyone who wants some politician in the room. Yet, that is exactly the impact of this Supreme Court opinion for millions and millions of Americans, who suddenly find an overbearing government dictating their path. This assault on Americans’ rights and freedom is shocking.""After today, we will see the very real and dangerous consequences across the country of taking away the right to safe and legal abortions. It’s on all of us – Members of Congress, medical professionals, advocates, and voters – to stand up against this nightmare vision of people forced to carry pregnancies to term against their will. Each one of us should have the freedom to live our lives without politicians forcing their way into our bedrooms and exam rooms.""Across the country, millions of Americans face abortion being criminalized – even in the case of rape or incest or when the patient’s life is in danger. I’m proud to be from a state like Oregon, where we have made it clear we will stand strong for the right to compassionate reproductive care. The decision to have an abortion is one that should be made by you and only you – not by judges, not by MAGA politicians, and not by your ability to pay or the zip code you live in. Today’s news is incredibly disturbing and a huge blow to freedom across America, but we will not give up the fight.""Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., tweeted his reaction as well, calling Friday ""a heartbreaking day for America.""U.S. Rep. Cliff Bentz, Oregon's lone Republican member of Congress, praised the decision in brief statement: ""A momentous decision. Every human life is sacred."""
