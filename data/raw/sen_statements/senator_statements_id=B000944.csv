https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-grassley-introduce-legislation-ban-foreign-individuals-obtaining-us-farm-credit,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), a member of the U.S. Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, and U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), introduced the Farm Credit for Americans Act that would prevent foreign individuals from obtaining credit and financial services through the Farm Credit System (FCS). Currently, certain foreign individuals and entities are eligible to receive credit through this government-sponsored enterprise.“We created the Farm Credit System to ensure farmers and agriculture workers in Ohio and across the country have access to affordable credit – not to benefit foreign investors and hostile governments,” said Brown. “Foreign governments, especially China, have bought up prime farmland across this country at an alarming rate for decades. This will put in place a clear standard: American taxpayer dollars should not be used as a financing tool for foreign governments to undermine our national security and take our family farms.”FCS was established in 1916 to provide credit to rural areas when commercial lenders were avoiding farm loans. It is mandated and limited by statute to serve agriculture. In 2021, FCS had a portfolio of roughly $210 billion in farm loans.Since 1997, Farm Credit Administration (FCA) regulations have allowed FCS associations to extend credit to certain foreign nationals who are not permanent residents of the United States and to foreign-owned entities. Brown and Grassley’s bipartisan Farm Credit for Americans Act would make foreign individuals and entities, as defined by the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act, ineligible for financing through the FCS.Full text of the bill is available HERE.                    ###"

Brown’s Remarks HEREWASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), chairman of the Senate Finance Social Security, Pensions, and Family Policy Subcommittee, spoke on the Senate Floor on the importance of protecting Social Security. This came after several Republican members in the House and Senate have made proposals to undermine the retirement security Americans have earned. Brown was joined on the floor by U.S. Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.“A secure retirement shouldn’t be partisan,” said Brown on the Senate Floor. “Social Security and Medicare are two of the most popular and most unifying institutions in the country. Social Security is our government’s promise to working men and women – a promise that they will be able to retire with dignity.”Brown is working to not only protect Social Security, but to strengthen it. In July, Brown and Wyden urged the Social Security Administration to incorporate children in ongoing outreach efforts, to help families eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Brown has also urged the Biden administration to nominate a permanent Social Security Commissioner and has continued his effort to reform and update the SSI program to allow beneficiaries to meaningfully save for emergencies.Sen. Brown’s remarks, as prepared for delivery, are available below:Mr./Madame President,Everything we do here should come back to the Dignity of Work – the idea that hard work should pay off for everyone, no matter who you are, where you live, or what kind of work you do.And when work has dignity, people have a secure retirement.That means they can count on Medicare and Social Security, it means we protect people’s pensions, it means people make enough money to save.It's why we saved the pensions of 100,000 Ohioans who worked their whole lives to earn a pension and peace of mind in retirement. It’s why we are still fighting for the Delphi retirees – who lost their pensions through no fault of their own.And it’s why we will always – always – fight back against attacks on Social Security.A secure retirement shouldn’t be partisan.Social Security and Medicare are two of the most popular and most unifying institutions in the country.Social Security is our government’s promise to working men and women – a promise that they will be able to retire with dignity.Support for Social Security cuts across party lines, geographic lines, and racial lines.And Americans want to not only protect Social Security and Medicare – they want to make it stronger.But Republicans always come after these programs – it’s their answer for how to pay for anything:How do they pay for corporate hand outs? Cut Social Security.How do they pay for tax cuts for the wealthy? Wipe out the retirement security Americans earned.It’s always the same plan from the corporate elite and think tank extremists: some new scheme, some new way to disguise their unpopular agenda.We heard about privatizing Social Security.We heard about means testing it.The details differ, but the plan is the same – to kill off Social Security.This time, it’s Senator Rick Scott and Senate Republicans’ plan to terminate Social Security.They want to get rid of a bedrock promise made to America’s middle class.And it doesn’t matter to them that most Americans support Social Security.That’s why this week, Senator Wyden and Senator Casey and I are introducing a resolution to affirm that Social Security should remain a guarantee for every American.Because our government should work for the people, not against them.When work has dignity, we honor the retirement security people earned.This should be an easy decision.I urge my Republican colleagues in this body – colleagues with health care and retirement plans paid for by taxpayers – to think about the generations of Americans who have benefited from Social Security and the generations to come, who are relying on the promise of Social Security.I’ve listened to your speeches for years, extolling the value of hard work. I’ve also heard some of you try to run from your own plans to end Social Security. But the American people are on to Senate Republicans. The American people watched as you did nothing to solve the multiemployer pension crisis. They’re watching as you block the bipartisan Delphi Retiree fix.And they’re watching as your caucus tries to end Social Security for good.If the American people don’t need to worry about the Republican Senate Plan to end Social Security, now’s your chance to prove it.This is your chance to live up to your own words and co-sponsor this resolution.Show Americans that if you work hard all your life, your government, your senator, will be there for you – and that you’re not working in this body to undermine the promise of Social Security.Senator Wyden – we’ve worked together to protect Social Security for years.What is at stake with these attacks? Why do we need to show a united commitment to Social Security in the Senate?                                                                                                                                                                ###"
https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-colleagues-urge-biden-fill-vacant-leadership-posts-social-security-administration,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) led more than a dozen of their colleagues in a letter to President Biden, urging him to nominate a Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner to serve at the Social Security Administration. The Social Security Administration has been without permanent leadership for more than a year, making it difficult to address longstanding challenges that the agency faces in providing service to Americans who rely on these benefits.“Today Social Security covers over 179 million workers, and over 70 million people receive monthly Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits. More than one out of every six U.S. residents collects Social Security benefits and older Americans make up about four out of every five beneficiaries,” wrote the lawmakers. “Recent U.S. Census Bureau reports show that Social Security provides over half of the income for older adults, and nearly all of their income for one in four older adults. Social Security continues to be one of the largest anti-poverty programs in the country, lifting over 22 million Americans out of poverty.”Senators Brown and Van Hollen led the following Senators in the letter: Senators Tom Carper (D-DE), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Bob Casey (D-PA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Ed Markey (D-MA), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Patty Murray (D-WA), Kristen Gillibrand (D-NY), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT).The full text of the letter is available here and below.Dear President Biden,We write today to urge the nomination of a Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner to serve as Senate-confirmed leaders for the Social Security Administration (SSA) and carry out the responsibilities of the agency.Today Social Security covers over 179 million workers, and over 70 million people receive monthly Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits. More than one out of every six U.S. residents collects Social Security benefits and older Americans make up about four out of every five beneficiaries. Recent U.S. Census Bureau reports show that Social Security provides over half of the income for older adults, and nearly all of their income for one in four older adults. Social Security continues to be one of the largest anti-poverty programs in the country, lifting over 22 million Americans out of poverty. The Social Security Commissioner is directly responsible for all programs administered by the agency, including state-administered programs directed by SSA. Nominating and confirming a permanent Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner would provide accountable leadership to the agency and reassure the public of SSA’s commitment to supporting the vulnerable populations that rely on its programs.The Social Security Administration’s longstanding labor-management problems worsened under the prior Administration. Under prior leadership, SSA was among the most hostile agencies in the federal government in the way it chose to implement the since-repealed anti-union executive orders from 2018. Employee satisfaction is falling at SSA, and SSA employees report feelings of exhaustion at among the highest rates of any federal agency. Permanent, Senate-confirmed leadership at the agency will help improve this longstanding challenge for the agency and its employees.Thank you for your unwavering focus on ensuring the financial security and well-being of all Americans, including the millions who receive support from Social Security. We look forward to considering your nominees for Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner, and working together to improve overall service at the Social Security Administration for the millions of beneficiaries and those who use SSA’s services.  ###"

Nationwide, ED recognized 297 public and private schools as National Blue Ribbon Schools.“I am proud of the work done by Ohio’s Blue Ribbon Schools to help secure a bright future for our students,” Brown said. “These schools, and many others across our state, are setting a high bar and setting Ohio’s next generation up for success.”Designated Blue Ribbon Schools include:Throughout its history, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program has affirmed the hard work of students, educators, families, and communities in creating safe and welcoming schools.  ###"
https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-reduce-exposure-to-lead-in-drinking-water,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Michael
Bennet (D-CO), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN),
Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) introduced the Financing
Lead Out of Water (FLOW) Act. The FLOW Act would reduce exposure
to lead in old water pipes by making it easier for cities and utilities to
issue bonds to finance replacement projects.“Families shouldn’t have to worry about whether or not the water
coming out of the faucet is safe for their children to drink,” said Brown. “Because
of the work we did in the American Rescue Plan and Bipartisan Infrastructure
Plan, Ohio communities will be able to replace old pipes, using American-made
materials and installed by American workers, and the FLOW Act will
ensure that these investments reach even more Ohioans.”According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
between 6 to 10 million homes in the U.S. currently have lead water pipes, also
known as lead service lines, that connect the main water line to their home’s
internal plumbing system. Although public utilities across the country are
replacing their publicly-owned lead service lines, replacement projects have
moved slowly for privately-owned pipes that serve residences due to the cost of
replacing these lines.The FLOW Act provides an explicit guarantee in the tax code
to allow public-water utilities to issue tax-exempt bonds to help pay for
the removal and replacement of both the publicly- and privately-owned lead
service lines, resolving the full scale of the issue for residents in areas
with lead pipes. This bill also helps funds for lead pipe replacement from
the American Rescue Plan and bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also
called the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, both of
which Brown helped to write and pass, make a deeper impact on replacing the
nation’s essential water infrastructure.The bill text is available HERE. A one-page

https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-general-motors-announce-investment-toledo-plant-ev,"TOLEDO, OH – Today, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) joined elected officials, executives from General Motors (GM) and leadership of the United Auto Workers to announce that the company will make its first U.S. propulsion plant transformation for the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain in Ohio, with a $760 million investment in GM Toledo. This investment will transform the current transmission plant into a facility that manufactures battery electric truck drive units. This investment will be bolstered by the recently passed CHIPS and Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which Brown helped write and pass.“GM’s investment in American production and Ohio workers is part of the work we are doing to put in place a new pro-American, pro-union industrial policy,” said Brown. “Ohio union workers are the future of the auto industry, and that future starts today, right here, in Toledo.”GM will install new, state-of-the-art equipment to convert the transmission plant into an EV propulsion plant. It will be GM’s first EV plant of its kind in the United States. The company expects to retain the more than 1,500 employees that are currently at the facility.“Today's announcement was possible because of the hard work of our members and the retirees that came before them,” said Tony Totty, President of UAW Local 14. “We've had many concerns about where our members will fit in the electric vehicle future. Senator Brown heard our concerns, facilitated conversations with the Biden administration, which helped get us to this announcement. Now we need to build on this momentum for autoworkers around Ohio.""“Our Toledo team has a long, proud history of building great products and they have worked hard to earn this investment,” said Gerald Johnson, GM’s executive vice president of Global Manufacturing and Sustainability.  “This investment helps build job security for our Toledo team for years to come and is the next step on our journey to an all-electric future.”Right now, Toledo Propulsion Systems employees manufacture and assemble GM’s six-speed, eight-speed, and ten-speed rear-wheel-drive and nine-speed front-wheel-drive transmissions that are used in a variety of Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac vehicles.Renovation work is expected to begin in early fall.                            ###"
https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-colleagues-send-bicameral-push-president-biden-issue-major-disaster-declaration-puerto-rico,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) joined U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez (D-NY) and a bipartisan group of 42 colleagues in sending a bicameral letter to President Joe Biden to urge him to issue a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto Rico’s municipalities in response to Hurricane Fiona. Just days before the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Maria, the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history, Hurricane Fiona ravaged the island with catastrophic flash flooding, unprecedented rainfall, and high-speed winds. “Governor Pierluisi has formally requested a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto Rico’s municipalities in response to Hurricane Fiona. We strongly urge you to approve this request to ensure Puerto Rico has all the federal resources available to respond to this disaster,” wrote the bicameral group of lawmakers to President Biden. “Furthermore, 750,000 homes remain without potable water. Bridges have collapsed, roads are blocked with debris, and schools are damaged. FEMA Public Assistance is urgently needed to begin restoring this vital infrastructure.”In 2017, thousands of lives were lost in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria due to the Trump administration’s botched response. In 2020, following Hurricane Maria, the island faced destructive earthquakes, requiring more disaster recovery resources. The lawmakers also highlighted how institutions in charge of the electric grid have failed to repair the electrical system, resulting in continued frequent and widespread power outages.Joining Brown, Menendez and Velázquez in signing the letter were Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Sens.

The hurricane caused an island-wide blackout, leaving over three million residents without power for over twenty-four hours. Furthermore, 750,000 homes remain without potable water. Bridges have collapsed, roads are blocked with debris, and schools are damaged. FEMA Public Assistance is urgently needed to begin restoring this vital infrastructure.In addition, Hurricane Fiona has caused significant flood damage to homes across the island. Many families are now seeking temporary shelter and will require significant aid in order to rebuild their homes. FEMA’s Individual Assistance is critical to assist with these housing costs and other recovery expenses. We thank you for swiftly approving Puerto Rico’s Emergency Declaration this past Sunday.In 2017, thousands of lives were lost in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria due to the butchered government response by the Trump Administration. In 2020, the island faced destructive earthquakes, requiring more disaster recovery resources. Five years since Hurricane Maria, LUMA Energy and the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) have yet to adequately repair the electrical system, resulting in continued frequent and widespread electrical outages. These events have left Puerto Rico’s critical infrastructure vulnerable to extreme weather. We urge you to help the people of Puerto Rico equitably recover from these multiple disasters and access the federal funding they urgently need.Given the damaged infrastructure, we urge you to promptly approve Governor Pierluisi’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto Rico’s municipalities in response to Hurricane Fiona.Sincerely,  ###"

Brown’s Exchange HEREWASHINGTON, D.C. – In Case You Missed It: yesterday, during a Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee hearing titled “Ensuring Veterans’ Timely Access to Care in VA and the Community,” U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) pressed Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Denis McDonough on veterans’ access to quality care at VA facilities and in communities across Ohio.“My office has held veteran roundtables throughout Ohio, and a consistent refrain is my VA doctors understand me in a way that community doctors do not. They know what I am going through, and they know how to provide me with the care I need to get better,” said Brown at the hearing. “Veterans rely on VA for consistent care by well-trained professionals who provide a continuity of care to support the whole veteran.”Brown recently hosted roundtables with local veterans in East Liverpool, Zanesville, and Dayton to discuss how the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022 will expand benefits for Ohio veterans. His office previously held a series of roundtables throughout Ohio where Brown heard from veterans and veteran advocate concerns surrounding access to quality care.During the hearing, Brown pressed McDonough on VA workforce shortages in rural communities and asked him to work with rural community stakeholders as VA develops its national rural recruitment and hiring plan.“Simply yes,” said McDonough.Brown then asked about the steps the VA is taking to ensure that community care providers meet the same rigorous training that VA clinicians receive.“We've had study after study. I referenced several in my opening statement that show vets in our care do better in terms of outcomes. And that's a real driving force for us. There are times when we don't have the care, when it's it takes too long that we obviously facilitate that care in the community,” said McDonough. “The thing we really need from our community providers is their help. As the CBO reported last October, their help in making this integrated, this care much more integrated by getting those records back to us, by working with us in a more coordinated fashion so that our providers who do know about vets best can help integrate that care.”Additionally, Brown again raised concerns over patient safety and interoperability concerns regarding VA’s Electronic Health Record (EHR) roll out and urged McDonough to stop the roll out until all the concerns are addressed. In July, Brown raised this issue during a hearing with VA officials. On April 30th, the Chalmers P. Wylie facility in Columbus transitioned to Oracle Cerner’s Electronic Health Record. Brown commended the work of frontline doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and administrative support staff during the transition, but ongoing technical issues have made their efforts challenging.Video of Brown’s full exchange is available HERE. ###"
https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-to-banks-you-must-do-right-by-your-customers-workers-and-communities,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, delivered the following opening statement at today’s hearing entitled “Annual Oversight of the Nation’s Largest Banks.”Earlier this week, the Democratic staff of the Committee released snapshots highlighting the consumer abuses of each of the banks that testified at today’s hearing.For years, Senate Democrats have pressed the biggest banks to do right by their customers, and they will continue to fight for the working Americans and small businesses that make our economy work. More information about their work can be found here.Sen. Brown’s remarks, as prepared for delivery, follow:For too long, everyone called this committee Senate Banking – because it always delivered for Wall Street.We changed that, at the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. We put the Main Street economy – and the workers who power it – at the center of everything we do.Part of that commitment is to hear directly from the biggest banks that hold so much power in the economy. It’s our job to hold them accountable to their workers, to their customers, and to the American people.Today, we will continue a tradition we started last year, and hear from the CEOs of the nation’s seven biggest retail banks. After years of consolidation and concentration – through banking crises and rubber-stamped mergers – your banks dominate the banking industry.Together, you have over $13 trillion in assets – that’s half the nation’s GDP. You have hundreds of millions of customers. You also have the benefit of a federal backstop – a safety net – something that your customers don’t have.Your decisions affect millions of peoples’ lives – whether they can get their paycheck, how much it will cost to use their hard-earned money, whether they can save for retirement or their kids’ education, whether they can buy a house or make rent.And you profit from all those transactions – to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. With those profits – and with the taxpayer support you get – come a responsibility to actually serve your customers and the larger economy.And I think you know you don’t always hold up your end of the bargain:All of your banks have promoted Zelle, the payment app that most of you own. You pushed this on customers – but you haven’t taken responsibility for the fraud that it’s perpetuated.We all know about Wells Fargo’s fake account scandal. And we’ve learned that Wells wasn’t alone. In the never-ending quest for short-term profits, it turns out that other banks pressured their employees to open fake checking and credit card accounts.Customers who trust you to look out for them ended up with unjustified fees, damaged credit reports, and accounts they did not want…or even know about.It’s even worse for Black and brown consumers. Too often they walk into many of your banks not knowing if their check will be cashed or if they’ll be able to open an account.When mortgage rates were at record lows, many of you were more likely to deny mortgages for Black and Latino borrowers, making it even harder for these families to build wealth through homeownership.You focus on loans to wealthy clients who have massive stock portfolios. And at least one of you has complained about the paperwork on mortgages or small business loans for Main Street.And when consumers try to hold you accountable for cheating them out of their money, you subject them to forced arbitration.You take away people’s choice on how to pursue justice – because as we all know, if there’s one thing Wall Street hates, it’s real consequences.And it isn’t just the outright scams and fraud that damage our economy. It’s your entire business model, with short-term, quarterly profits as the Holy Grail.I have talked with workers in Ohio and across the country – in places that so often get passed over for investment. They tell me about the challenges they have with the banking system. They’ve watched your banks let them down, time and time again.It’s why so many people don’t trust the financial system.They’ve been burned over and over by second-chance accounts, foreclosures, late fees, overdraft fees. They’ve been turned down for loans.They’ve seen branches close. They’ve been scammed out of their money.Yesterday, I spoke to an Ohioan whose accounts were illegally frozen by one of your banks. She had zero access to her funds for a whole week, and the bank intended to take $442 out of her account, leaving her with nothing.So it’s not surprising that more and more Americans turn to shady payday lenders or risky crypto apps. They feel like they don’t have any other choice, when they have bills piling up and need to come up with the money.Over a third of Americans report they wouldn’t be able to cover a $400 expense in an emergency – if their car breaks down, if they lose their job, if their child needs surgery.All of you make tens of millions of dollars a year – 150 to 900 times what your median employee makes.  You probably don’t think twice about $400.That’s not a luxury that most Americans have.They don’t get the same breaks you do. During the pandemic, the Federal Reserve waived overdraft fees for banks – yet none of you waived those fees for your customers in 2020.And it’s not just your customers who have to make tough choices because of decisions that you make.It’s also your workers.You spend your billions in profits on exorbitant executive pay and stock buybacks – instead of investing in your workers, your customers, your communities.You say that you provide your workers with good pay and benefits, but how does it feel as a worker to be pressured to open fake accounts, to deny services to someone who walks in the door who doesn’t look like you – hardly a culture promoting the dignity of work. Don’t take it from me. Listen to what bank workers have said:From one Wells Fargo worker: “We want the customer base to know we’re forming a union really for them. We’re tired of having our name dragged through the mud at Wells Fargo because of things that we’ve asked to have more control over, but the company refuses to give us that control.”Another worker said, “They keep telling us we no longer have sales goals but we are given expectations as far as loan volume, new accounts, day one mobile activations. Not meeting these expectations will result in disciplinary action.”They added, “But the loyalty and responsibility I feel for my customers keeps me fighting every day.”Just trust us, you say. We’re making changes, we don’t need government watchdogs, we don’t need regulations.But trust goes both ways. And with crisis after crisis, and scandal after scandal, the biggest Wall Street banks have lost the trust of the American people.And as super regional banks get bigger and more complex, they’re starting to look more and more like Wall Street.I expect all of your banks to build up capital, and use it to invest in communities – not just your shareholders, not just your own compensation.I expect you to treat all your customers fairly.And I expect you to take steps to make banking work better for your customers and your workers.Steps like: eliminating overdraft and excessive fees, lowering the costs of basic bank accounts, ending forced arbitration, offering affordable home loans to all eligible borrowers in all communities. It means paying your workers – including contractors who feed you, who clean your office, who keep your banks and offices safe – a living wage.Some of your banks have taken positive steps to eliminate some fees and give consumers more power and choice over their own money.Some of your banks have made commitments to increase your workers’ wages. That’s a good start.These positive steps need to be part of a real commitment to changing how Wall Street does business – not just one-offs.You are among the most powerful actors in our economy. Your entire industry, and its substantial safety net are supported by American taxpayers.It’s past time for the financial industry to be as good to the American people as the country has been to you.We will continue to hold you to the highest standards, so that Americans can keep more of their hard-earned money. ###"
https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-colleagues-send-bipartisan-letter-to-address-pfas-exposure-at-military-installations,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) joined U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Mike Rounds (R-SD) in sending a bipartisan letter to Department of Defense (DoD) Secretary Lloyd Austin and White House officials to urge increased funding for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances?(PFAS) testing and remediation, and to improve PFAS-related planning to make use of the higher funding levels Congress is willing to appropriate to address the pervasive issue. “As you know, PFAS chemicals have emerged as widespread contaminants to the drinking water sources of military bases across the country largely due to their presence in aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) used by the military. Members of the military, veterans and civilians who have served at military installations and/or live in the surrounding communities found to have been contaminated with PFAS face health risks related to exposure to PFAS chemicals, as these materials are found in AFFF, in personal protective equipment used by firefighters and in standard consumer products,” the lawmakers wrote. “Our service members, military families, veterans and defense communities deserve the Department’s full attention to appropriately address the scope and severity of PFAS contamination. We ask you to honor that responsibility and take the steps necessary to prioritize this hazard impacting our communities.”The senators went on to detail the findings of a recent National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report that calls for expanded access to PFAS testing for Americans with a history of exposure to the chemicals and points to health risks such as high cholesterol, decreased fetal and infant growth and increase risks of kidney cancer for those exposed to PFAS. The letter detailed the robust amount of federal funding provided by Congress to DoD to accelerate PFAS testing remediation and Congress’ continued willingness to provide additional resources to address the challenges the Department faces due to PFAS exposure.In addition to Senators Brown, Shaheen and Rounds, the letter is signed by 38 lawmakers, including U.S. Senators Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Mike Braun (R-IN), Angus King (I-ME), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Gary Peters (D-MI), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Patty Murray (D-WA), Diane Feinstein (D-CA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Ben Cardin (D-MD), John Ossoff (D-GA), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Brian Schatz (D-HI), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and Ed Markey (D-MA). A full copy of the letter is available here and below:Dear Secretary Austin:We write with continued concern about the Department of Defense's (DoD) efforts to address contamination from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Nearly 700 military installations nationwide have known or suspected PAS contamination, exposing service members and their families, and civilian communities near DoD installations to these toxic chemicals. Given Congress' continued commitment to provide funding to address PFAS contamination, we respectfully request that the Department similarly prioritize planning andprogramming for PFAS testing and remediation.As you know, PAS chemicals have emerged as widespread contaminants to the drinking water sources of military bases across the country largely due to their presence in aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) used by the military. Members of the military, veterans and civilians who have served at military installations and/or live in the surrounding communities found to have been contaminated with PFAS face health risks related to exposure to PFAS chemicals, as these materials are found in AFFF, in personal protective equipment used by firefighters and in standard consumer products. The prevalence of PAS allows for multiple pathways for exposure. The recently released National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report calls for expanded access to PAS testing for Americans with a history of exposure to the chemicals and points to health risks such as high cholesterol, decreased fetal and infant growth and increased risks of kidney cancer for those exposed to PAS?. These health concerns pose a significant hazard to the safety of our communities, and individuals either previously or currently exposed to toxic PFAS chemicals, underscoring the urgency of reducing exposure.Over the past six years, Congress has increased funding by $1 billion for the Department to accelerate PFAS testing and remediation, more than doubling the amount requested in the annual budget request during that time frame. As evidenced by the historic $517 million authorization for PFAS related activities included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022, Congress has indicated a willingness to provide even greater funding to address these challenges. We are, however, concerned that DoD has failed to adequately prepare for additional funding being made available. It is our understanding that one of the major obstacles in the way of Congress putting more resources toward this problem is a lack of planning by the Department on how to execute a higher funding level. Simply put, DoD is not sufficiently prioritizing PFAS testing, remediation and disposal as part of its annual budget process, nor is the Department adequately developing the appropriate plans to utilize even higher funding levels as provided by Congress.DoD has a responsibility to place greater emphasis on addressing these pollutants impacting service members, military families and defense communities. Therefore, we strongly urge the Department to match Congress' urgency for addressing testing and remediation by developing requirements-based plans, policies, and programs and appropriately increasing DoD's annual budget requests for PFAS-related activities, including for PFAS destruction. Further, we expect that, as a part of this analysis, the Department will address past planning and programming deficiencies that DoD has claimed limits their ability to execute higher levels of funding, and we request that DoD provide a plan to Congress no later than upon the release of the President's Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2024 on how the Department is prepared to execute increased funding levels for PFAS-related activities. Finally, we support DoD's cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency on PAS, including collaboration on research and testing efforts, and encourage the Department to continue investing in joint efforts to address PFAS.Our service members, military families, veterans and defense communities deserve the Department's full attention to appropriately address the scope and severity of PFAS contamination. We ask you to honor that responsibility and take the steps necessary to prioritize this hazard impacting our communities. ###"
https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-highlights-big-banks-consumer-abuses-ahead-bank-hearing,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) hosted a news conference call about the consumer abuses of the nation’s largest consumer banks ahead of the hearing he will hold Thursday with the banks’ CEOs as Chair of the Senate Banking and Housing Committee. Brown was joined by Tarra Troutman, an Ohioan who looked at her bank account one day and found herself overdrawn and thousands of dollars in debt.Brown began the annual hearings to hold the big banks accountable when he became committee chair in 2021.  Bank of America, Citi, JP Morgan Chase, PNC, Truist, U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo play an outsized role in our financial system and economy. They serve hundreds of millions of consumers and small businesses and have assets of $13 trillion.“These megabanks rake in huge profits, year after year – during good times and bad times, even during the pandemic, even while corporations raise prices and Americans deal with inflation. And the big banks aren’t just making those profits despite what’s happening to their customers – they’re making massive profits at the direct expense of their customers, and their workers,” said Brown. “We know these banks have too much power in our economy. Our job is stand up to them, on behalf of Ms. Troutman and all of the Americans who try to do everything right, yet still get burned by the Wall Street system.”While the nation’s largest banks rake in huge profits, they have continued to fail their customers and workers. Banks bring in billions of overdraft fees from customers; and fail to help customers whose money is stolen on Zelle – a payment network owned by seven banks, including Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, PNC, Truist, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo. During the pandemic, they put their wealthy, Wall Street clients over Main Street small businesses and consumers for PPP loans.Brown was joined on the call by Troutman, an Ohioan who found out earlier this year that there was a $38,000 judgment against her for a $10,000 car she bought and then voluntarily surrendered more than 12 years ago. She found out about the judgment when she reviewed her PNC bank account in May and found she suddenly had negative balances and holds on her accounts – and on the accounts of her minor son.“Legal Aid was my savior and learned the opposing law firm representing the judgment creditor was still trying to enforce the erroneous judgment and sent a garnishment notice to PNC Bank. In response, PNC put a hold on all of my accounts – including the one with my son’s birthday money and savings,” said Troutman. “I had zero access to any funds that were in those accounts for more than a week. I couldn’t get money out to pay for gas, groceries or rent. Not having access to those funds was an incredible hardship and the entire situation was very traumatic and so stressful.”The U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs prepared snapshots following dozens of consumer abuse reports from large financial institutions nationwide. Tomorrow, the banks’ CEOs will testify at the Committee’s annual bank oversight hearing.The snapshot on PNC can be found here.The snapshot on U.S. Bancorp can be found here.The snapshot on Truist can be found here.The snapshot on Citi can be found here.The snapshot on Bank of America can be found here.The snapshot on Wells Fargo can be found hereThe snapshot on JP Morgan Chase can be found here                                                        ###"

https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-testifies-behalf-ohio-steel-companies-hearing-hot-rolled-steel-products,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) testified on behalf of the entire U.S. hot-rolled steel industry and its thousands of Ohio workers, urging the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) to extend anti-dumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD) to ensure U.S. Steel, Cleveland-Cliffs, Nucor, Steel Dynamics, SSAB, and their workers, get sufficient relief from unfair trade practices of foreign competitors. Hot-rolled steel imports have harmed the domestic industry and will continue to do so if the orders are lifted, especially the workers at Cleveland-Cliffs’ Cleveland, Toledo, and Middletown facilities.Brown was the only senator to testify at the hearing. “These are some of the most skilled and dedicated workers anywhere, but they can’t compete against dumped and subsidized imports, no matter how hard they work,” said Brown during his testimony. “When foreign competitors use unfair trade practices to get ahead and put our companies out of business, our trade laws are supposed to help level the playing field. That’s all we’re asking for – a level playing field.”For years, workers in the U.S. steel industry have found themselves at a severe competitive disadvantage due to unfairly-traded foreign imports.Earlier this year, following testimony by Brown, the ITC ruled in favor of American steel workers by recommending that President Biden extend anti-dumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD) to ensure U.S. Steel, Cleveland-Cliffs, Nucor, and Steel Dynamics, and their workers, get sufficient relief from unfair trade practices of foreign competitors. At that hearing, Brown testified on behalf of the entire U.S. flat-rolled steel industry and its thousands of Ohio workers, urging the ITC to side with steel workers. Imports of flat-rolled steel have harmed the domestic industry and will continue to do so if the orders are lifted, with the workers at Cleveland-Cliffs’ Cleveland and Middletown facilities especially impacted.In 2016, Brown testified before the ITC during a final determination hearing on antidumping and countervailing duties on cold-rolled, hot-rolled, and corrosion-resistant steel flat products. The three cases were filed by U.S. steel companies, including: U.S. Steel, AK Steel, ArcelorMittal, and Nucor, all of which have Ohio locations and together employ more than 8,000 Ohioans. Following Brown’s testimony, the ITC issued a unanimous finding that the U.S. steel industry has been injured by cold-rolled steel imports from China and Japan. This positive decision was good news for Ohio steel companies and resulted in new antidumping and countervailing duty orders against the countries’ steel imports.Brown’s remarks, as prepared for delivery can be found below:Chairman Johanson and members of the Commission, thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of the entire U.S. flat-rolled steel industry and the thousands of Ohio workers represented by the petitioners in the hot-rolled steel case before you.   Nothing has changed since the last time I appeared before the Commission: we still face the threat of dumped and subsidized imported hot rolled steel destroying jobs in the United States.Our steel companies are critical to our nation’s infrastructure, our national security, and our global competitiveness. Tens of thousands of Americans, including many Ohioans, rely on this industry for good-paying, middle class jobs. In this case, thousands of Ohio union steelworkers at Cleveland-Cliffs’ facilities in Cleveland and Middletown will be directly affected by this decision.I’ve been to Cleveland-Cliffs’ mills. Cliffs has made significant investments in its Cleveland Works plant. Earlier this year, the company invested approximately $200 million to reline one of its two blast furnaces there. This investment will result in more than two decades of useful life for that blast furnace, supporting 2,000 jobs at Cleveland Works.And in November of 2020, Cleveland-Cliffs completed its $1 billion Direct Reduction plant.This plant is the world’s most technologically advanced direct reduction plant, producing hot briquetted iron that emits 70%   less greenhouse gases than imported pig iron from Russia and Brazil. HBI (H-B-I) made in Toledo is used in Cliffs furnaces across its plants to make hot-rolled steel, which is why these orders are so important.The United States produces some of the cleanest steel made anywhere in the world, and American steel will become a critical input in the growing renewable energy industrial economy.But our steel manufacturers will struggle in the face of dumped and subsidized imports if these duties are not reimposed. If we refuse to provide the relief they need to compete, thousands of workers could be laid off, as happened in 2015 and 2016.The Commission plays a critical role in enforcing U.S. trade laws.You’re being asked to examine injury in the flat-rolled steel sector today, on hot-rolled steel.The domestic flat products steel sector clearly met the statutory definition for “injury” in the original case. And global conditions have not changed in the five years since. Subsidized steel imports caused serious harm to this industry before, and the outcome will be the same today, were duties lifted.ITC knows the impact unfair trade practices have on American steel. Given the ITC’s new agency-wide commitment to looking at the regional and demographic effects of trade practices, I urge the ITC to note the disproportionate impact these issues have had and will continue having on steel-producing states, like Ohio.If dumped and subsidized steel imports are once again allowed to come into the U.S. market unchecked, it will be impossible for American companies to generate profits, to pay workers  good wages, and to make the capital investments required for the continued competitiveness of U.S. steel. Every time a mill closes, we lose another critical link in our domestic supply chain forever. And Ohioans know all too well what this closure does to entire communities.I’ve talked with Ohio steelworkers about their jobs and their lives. I’ve met their families and heard their stories – their hopes, their dreams, and their fears about what happens when work disappears. These are some of the most skilled and dedicated workers anywhere. But they can’t compete against dumped and subsidized imports, no matter how hard they work. When foreign competitors use unfair trade practices to get ahead and put our companies out of business, our trade laws are supposed to help level the playing field. That’s all we’re asking for – a level playing field. I would also like to briefly address the interplay of AD/CVD duties and trade measures under Section 232.Title VII is intended to prevent material injury to American companies and workers caused by unfairly traded imports. If revoking AD and CVD orders is likely to lead to the continuation or recurrence of material injury, then domestic producers are entitled to relief, period. Section 232, on the other hand, gives the President sole authority to limit imports in situations where national security concerns are at stake.Because Presidents can lift 232 measures at any time, companies cannot rely on Section 232 relief being in place well into the future. AD/CVD relief gives much greater certainty.If AD/CVD relief is eliminated with the expectation that Section 232 measures will remain in place – and those measures are later weakened – the potential harm to the domestic industry would likely be immediate and irreversible.I implore you to draw the same conclusion that you drew in 2016. The facts support that decision, and thousands of workers in Ohio depend on it. I will be submitting a letter for the record that my fellow Ohio Senator Rob Portman and I led.It makes the same argument I am making to you today:  removing these tariffs only rewards bad behavior by foreign actors and costs us steel jobs in Ohio and throughout the nation.Thank you.                                                                                                                                          ###"

Funding for this investment was made possible through the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also known as the bipartisan infrastructure law, which Brown helped to write and pass.“Rural communities have been overlooked for too long. If we want to promote economic development throughout Ohio, we need to ensure that businesses and communities have the tools and resources they need,” said Brown. “I’m working to make sure Ohio gets its fair share – or more – of the investment. Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, these funds will have a significant economic impact for Noble County.”The Noble Green Acres project is a multi-year and multi-phase approach which will focus on purchasing specialized equipment and resources for agribusiness education and training. This grant will support access to equipment work-based learning programs for 1,400 students and 600 workers. In addition to ARC funds, local sources will provide $118,000.ARC is an economic development agency of the federal government. It has a mission to build community capacity and strengthen economic growth in the Appalachian region. ###"

Brown discussed a number of topics, including provisions secured in the 2018 Farm Bill, the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and how the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act will benefit Ohio agriculture, rural development conservation, and urban forestry.“More and more people are finally beginning to see what we have known for a long time: it’s better for the long-term health of our economy and our communities when we produce more in America,” said Brown. “Whether it’s semiconductors from Asia or beef from Brazil, there’s a cost to long supply chains – and there’s a benefit to Ohioans when we bring them home.”Brown recently met with local farmers, officials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and agriculture stakeholders in Chesterland, Grove City and Wooster to learn what priorities Ohio farmers have for the 2023 Farm Bill. Brown, the first Ohioan to serve on the Senate Agriculture Committee in nearly 50 years, will help write the upcoming Farm Bill.Brown has long been a leader for Ohio’s rural communities. Before the passage of the Farm Bill in 2008, 2013, and 2018, Brown held roundtables around Ohio to hear from farmers and rural communities about what they wanted to see in the bill, and successfully secured a number of Ohio-specific provisions that were important to the state’s farmers.Brown’s remarks at the annual breakfast, as prepared for delivery, follow:It’s great to be back in person – the last time we spoke in-person was Wednesday, March 11, 2020. I remember greeting folks with an elbow tap, but we still didn’t fully appreciate that within a few days, the world was about to change.It’s been a long two and a half years. And through it all, you have been hard at work to produce the food, fuel and fiber that is at the foundation of Ohio’s and our country’s economy. You all know that 1-in-7 in Ohioans depend on agriculture for their jobs.It’s why I joined the Agriculture Committee making me the first Ohio Senator on the Committee in fifty years. I joined so that I can fight for you, your families, and your communities.As you all know one of the most important things the Senate Agriculture Committee does about every 5 years or so is write a new farm bill.And we are beginning to gear up for the next one – the 2023 Farm Bill.This will be my fourth Farm Bill in the Senate.It’s something we always do in a bipartisan way – the 2018 Farm Bill passed by a final vote of 87-13.That’s one of the reasons I worked to get on the Senate Ag Committee because it has a reputation – along with the Veterans Committee, which I am also proud to serve on – for being one of the most bipartisan committees in the Senate.I look forward to working with Senator Stabenow and Boozman and all the members of the committee to continue that bipartisan tradition.Before we talk about the priorities for the next Farm Bill and what I’ll be fighting for on behalf of Ohio agriculture, I wanted to walk through where we’ve been.The best ideas don’t come from Washington, they come from Ohioans.They come from farmers themselves.It’s why leading up to every Farm Bill, we’ve held roundtables around the state.We’ve done them at some of your farms, and we’ve already started them again this year.At the end of last month, I was at President Bill Patterson’s farm – Patterson Fruit Farm in Chesterland.  I learned a lot and I also left with some delicious apples that Connie and I – with the help of our grandkids – turned into apple sauceWe also did one in Wooster. And my staff and I will be doing more.Many of the ideas I have successfully fought for in previous farm bill came directly from you and these roundtables.In the 2018 Farm Bill, we preserved and strengthened the safety net that farmers rely on to help them mitigate risk and prevent bankruptcies.We defended crop insurance and improved the Average Risk Coverage (ARC) program that I helped develop with the Republican Majority Whip, John Thune of South Dakota. As many of you remember, Senator Thune and I led the way in creating the ARC program in what became the 2014 Farm Bill. We based it on what I heard from farmers across Ohio.In 2018, we improved conservation programs.We got an amendment in the bill to increase the cost-share for EQIP.Instead of the normal 75 percent cost share, the best practices should be eligible for up to 90 percent cost share. So if you’re using the practices that best protect water quality or habitats, the government will pick up 90 percent of the tab.In 2018 we also created a new CRP program – called CLEAR , or the Clean Lakes Estuaries and Rivers Program – that aimed to enroll 5 million acres of farmland that directly protect water quality, and allow CRP to better work in Ohio.And it’s not just the last Farm Bill we’ll be working to build on next year – it’s all the work we’ve done this year to build rural infrastructure and improve our supply chains.Technology and innovation in agriculture continues to advance – auto steer tractors that rely on GPS, in-field monitoring, electric tractors, vehicles.But much of the new technology is dependent on reliable broadband – not only in the field, but also in your homes, as you track the weather and do your books.The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes big broadband investments. We want to work with you – and with mayors and county commissioners and township trustees – to make sure that Ohio gets our fair share, or more, of that investment. It's the same thing with bridges. Ohio has more than 3,200 bridges that need repair. [Story – what it means for farmers when a small county bridge is washed out]We also passed the Inflation Reduction Act, with $40 billion in agriculture, forestry, and rural development investments.And we included new incentives that will expand markets for homegrown American biofuels.We also included a new investment tax credit to help offset the upfront costs associated with building biodigester – something Sen Thune and I fought for.Looking at the next Farm Bill, we know that climate is going to be a factor – because it’s a factor for your farms already.You all see the changes in growing seasons. No one knows the weather better than Ohio farmers.Your voices need to be in the room.We are going to improve on what we accomplished in the last farm bill and fight to ensure the $18 billion in conservation funding including in the Inflation Reduction Act works for Ohio farmers.I also know problems with inflation have been squeezing farmers and rural communities, from fertilizer to fuel prices.This reality will be at the forefront of the Farm Bill effort. It’s why I will fight to ensure the 2023 Farm Bill preserves and strengthens Title 1 programs and crop insurance.We also know one of the big causes of inflation has been global supply chains that are too long and too fragile.We need investments in domestic production of fertilizer, and new research on how to do more with less.You shouldn’t have to depend on fertilizer inputs or natural gas inputs from hostile foreign nations.And it’s about domestic markets too.I want to make it easier for farmers to feed their communities and for consumers to buy local Ohio food and farm products. That keeps money where it belongs: here in our communities.We made progress on that in 2018, with the Local FARMS Act. And we’re going to build on that again.Whether it’s industrial production or ag production, more and more people are finally beginning to see what we have known for a long time:That it’s better for the long-term health of our economy and our communities when we produce more in America.Whether it’s semiconductors from Asia or beef from Brazil, there’s a cost to those supply chains – and there’s a benefit to Ohioans when we bring them home.Now I would like to turn things over to all of you. ###"
https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-to-gensler-out-markets-should-work-for-everyone,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, delivered the following opening statement at today’s hearing entitled “Oversight of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,” featuring SEC Chair Gary Gensler.Sen. Brown’s remarks, as prepared for delivery, follow:Welcome back Chair Gensler.Workers and their families don’t measure the economy by the stock market, and neither should we.It’s why in the Senate and in the Biden Administration, we are working to create an economy that delivers results for people who get their incomes from a paycheck, not an investment portfolio – rising wages and good-paying jobs and lower costs.That means fighting the corporate price gouging that hurts consumers, and the unfair labor practices that hurt workers.It means investing in American manufacturing and the workers who drive it.And it means making sure our financial watchdogs keep our markets and economy stable.At the SEC, that includes going after companies that try to cheat the market. It means strengthening corporate disclosures to stay ahead of risks like climate change. It means looking into the practices of private equity and hedge funds, as they stretch their tentacles into more and more areas of our economy.It’s been an eventful year.This summer, the Senate confirmed President Biden’s two nominees to the SEC. I know both new Commissioners got right to work on the many issues before the agency. And the Commission and its dedicated staff have been busy.Republicans on this Committee have bellyached about your ambitious agenda.If Wall Street and its allies are complaining, it probably means you’re doing your job.You put Americans’ savings first and you focus on fairness and transparency—two concepts critical to making sure our markets work for everyone, not just insiders and corporate executives.The SEC must continue making enforcement a priority.Bad actors are always coming up with new schemes to separate people from their hard-earned money, or to cheat the rules to gain a little more for themselves.Under your watch, the SEC has increased prosecutions for insider trading, which under the Trump Administration had fallen to the lowest level in a generation.In April, this Committee considered a Reed and Menendez bill that would outlaw insider trading in statute. The House has already passed a similar bill. Now the Senate must pass it.Last month, we saw the successful results of bipartisan work of our Committee Members to improve transparency and fight fraud.In 2020, Sens. Kennedy and Van Hollen pushed for the passage of the “Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act”, a bill to stop the U.S. stock exchange trading of foreign companies with China-based auditors that refused to comply with our oversight laws.Because that law jumpstarted negotiations, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) signed an agreement with Chinese authorities that will --finally -- allow auditors to begin inspections.In March, President Biden signed an Executive Order establishing a whole-of-government strategy for digital assets.While agencies across our government look at how we respond to the growth of crypto, and best protect people’s money, we know the SEC continues to enforce the law—going after crypto tokens that violate securities laws, shutting down crypto Ponzi schemes, and charging insider trading crimes in crypto.Over the last year in this Committee, we have looked at how crypto assets are used in scams and fraud, and play a role in illicit finance. We also heard from the Treasury Under Secretary testify on the President’s Working Group report on stablecoins.This morning, the Agriculture Committee is considering a crypto bill sponsored by Sens. Stabenow and Boozman that focuses on digital commodities. I appreciate their work to create regulation in the crypto space.It’s critical that we are careful and deliberate in drawing jurisdictional lines. In this kind of regulation, we have to prevent gaps and close loopholes that can be exploited or abused. That’s not easy, and it’s why action by the Agriculture Committee and CFTC is welcome. But it’s not enough.When Congress wrote Dodd-Frank, we fixed the problems in the oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market. That’s a lesson we need to remember when it comes to crypto—all our regulators need to work together, and to make sure investors, consumers, and market stability comes first.The SEC’s work on climate risk disclosure is also an important example of how to improve the market’s understanding of risks and to provide transparency and comparability. Clarity and uniformity are key.If only a subset of companies provides disclosure, and they do so in whatever form they want, that doesn’t serve anyone. Investors outside the U.S. already benefit from standardized climate risk disclosures; it’s time the U.S. market did as well.The SEC’s recent rule proposal to require more disclosure about corporate stock buybacks will also bring much-needed transparency to the market.We know stock buybacks are a big problem – they distort the market, and they funnel profits to executives at the expense of long-term investment in workers and innovation.And the process allowed for these buybacks has only made them more manipulative. For decades, companies have been able to announce stock buybacks to juice their stock price, but then only provide details months later on how, when, and even whether they ever completed their plans.Under the SEC’s new proposal, the market and the SEC would understand when companies are buying their stock, and if executives are buying or selling at the same time.Taken together with our unprecedented step in the Inflation Reduction Act to finally tax these buybacks, these are the first real steps we’ve seen in years to rein in this Wall Street scheme.Chair Gensler, I look forward to hearing more about other ways the SEC is working to hold bad actors accountable, and protect Americans who invest their hard-earned money in our markets. ###"
https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-applauds-tentative-agreement-to-avert-railroad-strike,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), released the following statement applauding the tentative agreement that would avoid a railroad strike.“Thanks to the round the clock work of President Biden, Secretary Walsh, the unions, and the rail carriers, a tentative agreement has been met that will avoid a strike and deliver improved working conditions for rail workers while ensuring the rail companies can retain and recruit more workers. If the agreement is ratified, this will help provide the predictability Ohio farmers and manufacture need as they feed the world and rebuild supply chains. This is the kind of outcome, for both businesses and workers, that is only possible when we have a government that respects unions and the collective voice of workers.###"
https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-announces-nearly-500000-for-agriculture-research-at-the-ohio-state-university,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH)   announced that the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National   Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) has awarded a $499,928   Biotechnology Risk Assessment Research (BRAG) grant to The Ohio State   University for research on emerging insect resistance to biotechnological   crops and to develop strategies to prevent evolution and spread of the   resistance.“We know how important farming is to our state – 1 in 7   Ohioans depend on agriculture for their jobs,” said Brown. “This award   will help The Ohio State University advance our knowledge and continue Ohio’s   leadership in innovation and agriculture.“This project will allow The Ohio State University researchers   to estimate the spread of European corn borer resistance into the U.S. and   Ohio,” said Dr. Andy Michel, Professor of Entomology and principal   investigator for the project. “Through international collaboration with   the University of Guelph, our work will provide farmers with an early warning   system of resistance, help extend the durability of corn biotechnology, and   secure safe and sustainable corn production.”Brown has long been a leader for Ohio’s agriculture sector. Before the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, Brown held   roundtables around Ohio to hear from farmers and rural communities about what   they wanted to see in the bill, and successfully secured a number of Ohio-specific provisions that were important to the   state’s farmers.The BRAG program supports the development of new information   that will assist federal regulatory agencies in making evidence-based   decisions about the effects of genetically engineered organisms on the   environment. This program supports investigations of managed and natural   environments across a wide breadth of organisms. This year, BRAG supported 12   research awards and one conference award. BRAG is co-administered by the   Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and jointly funded by USDA-NIFA,   USDA-ARS, and USDA-Forest Service.###"
https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-tillis-ryan-gonzalez-introduce-law-enforcement-de-escalation-training-bill,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Representatives Tim Ryan (D-OH-13) and Anthony Gonzalez (R-OH-16) introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Law Enforcement Scenario-Based Training for Safety and De-Escalation Act of 2022. The legislation would require the U.S. Department of Justice, through the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), to create immersive, real-life, scenario-based training curriculum to address key issues raised by law enforcement officers and the communities they serve. The curriculum would focus on improving community-police relations; officer safety and resilience; situational awareness; physical and emotional responses to stress; critical decision-making and problem-solving; de-escalation and use of force; and crisis intervention. The bill would also create a grant program to support public and private entities that train law enforcement officers using similar immersive curriculum. All law enforcement officers—in departments large and small, rural and urban—should have access to the state-of-the-art, scenario-based training that saves lives and rebuilds trust. This bill is an important step toward finding common ground between law enforcement and the communities they serve.  “We all want the same thing – to feel safe in our communities. Most Ohio police departments are small and don’t have the resources they need for the training that officers and community members need and deserve. This is an opportunity to bridge divides, to get out of partisan or ideological corners, and actually make policing work better and make our towns and neighborhoods safer,” said Senator Brown.“Our law enforcement officers risk their lives every single day to keep their communities safe, and they deserve training and resources that help them handle the most difficult situations,” said Senator Tillis. “Our bipartisan legislation will help law enforcement receive training to de-escalate a host of crises, including those involving people with mental health or drug dependency issues. Improved training will result in improved safety for both law enforcement officers and the people they regularly interact with.”“There is nothing more important than the safety of our law enforcement officers and the communities they serve. In Ohio and across the country, we have seen too many tragic confrontations between our police officers and community members—a problem that increased police training can help address,” said Congressman Ryan. “We must ensure our law enforcement officers who are routinely put in dangerous situations are equipped with every de-escalation tool necessary to keep our communities safe. Every officer in this country—in departments large and small, rural and urban—should have access to immersive, real-life, scenario-based training to respond to incidents in a manner that saves lives and protects our community.” “Ensuring our law enforcement is equipped with the proper tools to respond to varying types of emergencies is critically important,” said Congressman Gonzalez. “I am glad to lead this bipartisan, bicameral legislation that will develop a training curriculum to educate first responders which will increase safety for our officers and in our communities.”The NAACP, Fraternal Order of Police, and Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association have endorsed the legislation.“The NAACP strongly supports the Law Enforcement Scenario-Based Training for Safety and De-Escalation Act. Training is essential to improve interactions and the long-term relationship of law enforcement with communities in which they operate,” said Derrick Johnson, President and CEO of the NAACP. We appreciate the hard work Senator Brown, Congressman Ryan, and others have put forth to ensure that officers are trained on the culture of the communities they are sworn to protect, particularly measures to de-escalate interactions and reduce bias.  Although many officers are hard working men and women concerned with safety, if and when even one of their colleagues engages in unethical or problematic behavior, whether conscious or unconscious, trust of the entire community can and will be lost. Training enhancements are a critical response to improve the safety of Black communities.”“This training will not only better equip officers to ensure their own safety, but it will enhance their ability to serve and protect their communities by using current immersive technology to better prepare officers for real-life situations on the beat,” said Patrick Yoes, National President of the Fraternal Order of Police. “Immersive training will improve officer safety, de-escalation techniques, and community-police relations.”                                         ###"
https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-chips-act-enables-177-million-intel-investment-ohio-higher-education,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) applauded Intel’s $17.7 million first phase of investment in Ohio higher education. In March, Intel announced a $100 million investment in Ohio higher education initiatives that would benefit the semiconductor industry. Intel’s announcement is in partnership with the U.S. National Science Foundation, which will provide an additional $50 million for research grants nationally that will be available to Ohio institutions. Friday’s announcement followed Intel’s groundbreaking at its $20 billion semiconductor plant in New Albany, which is expected to create more than 10,000 jobs. Brown worked with local and state leaders and other members of Ohio’s Congressional delegation to ensure that Intel chose Ohio for what will be its most advanced manufacturing facility in the world. This project will help reverse decades of offshoring American manufacturing. Currently, 75 percent of chip manufacturing capacity is in Asian countries – mainly Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and China – but with this facility, chips will become a major Ohio export. “We need to make more things in America – and there’s no better place than in Ohio, with Ohio workers. This investment will help make Ohio the center of semiconductor innovation. We can’t let China and other foreign competitors lead us in this critical industry,” said Brown. “We already know that Intel’s record investment in Ohio will mean more than 10,000 new, good-paying jobs, and this added investment in higher education will help to ensure that Ohioans are responsible for burying the term ‘Rust Belt.’” Each recipient project has a different scope and different levels of funding, these range between $1.1 million to $3.5 million over 3 years. Projects include:For more details and a fact sheet on this investment, please visit HERE.Brown has pushed for action to support American semiconductor production, which is key to supporting investments in Ohio manufacturing. Intel’s plant will establish a long-term, reliable source of semiconductors, which are essential to U.S. economic competitiveness and national security. It also will support critical Ohio industries, like the auto industry and other high-tech manufacturing.In August, President Biden signed into law a legislative package that includes the CHIPS Act of 2022, which includes historic funding for domestic semiconductor manufacturing as well as support for other essential priorities for Ohio’s economy. Brown was instrumental in moving the legislation through the Senate. Along with the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the laws make historic investments to bolster semiconductor and battery production, and position the U.S. and Ohio to lead the world in the production of new technology like electric vehicles (EV), solar panel production, and sustainable aviation fuel. These laws boost advanced manufacturing hubs across the country, make historic investments in the Manufacturing USA and Manufacturing Extension Partnership programs Brown has long championed, and include Brown’s Buy America provisions are included in construction projects.  ###"

The legislation will grow Ohio’s sustainable aviation fuel industry and position Ohio to be a leader in the use and production of new fuels.In April, Brown led his colleagues in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requesting the EPA update its greenhouse gas modeling for biofuels and adopt the Argonne National Lab’s Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) model. Following the letter, President Biden announced the suspension of a federal rule preventing the sale of higher ethanol blend gasoline. The updates helped to reduce prices for Ohioans, support farmers and the biofuel industry and reduce our reliance on foreign energy sources.The investment was administered by DOE’s Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO), which is focused on developing technologies that convert domestic biomass and other waste resources into low-carbon biofuels and bioproducts. BETO is part of DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).  ###"

Brown’s remarks, as prepared for delivery, follow:Hard work should pay off for everyone.That’s the American dream. That’s what the dignity of work is all about – it’s a concept that Pope Leo XIII spoke of in the 19th century, and popularized by Dr. King.And when work has dignity, you can support yourself, your family, and your future.But we all know what’s happened over the last four decades.Corporate profits have gone up.  The stock market has soared.  Executive compensation has exploded.But wages have not kept up with the cost of living. Millions of workers with full-time jobs who aspire to the middle class can’t join it, no matter how hard they work. And even people we may define as middle class don’t feel much security and stability.And when workers are forced to find ways to make up for the gap between what they’re paid and what they should earn, what are they left with?Debt.Sometimes people will have to borrow money. Products that are well-designed, transparent, and regulated can help workers pay off an unexpected car repair, or help with the grocery bill, or cover a medical expense.But as we heard at our listening session with workers last week, too often these products aren’t well designed, they’re rarely transparent, and they’re not well-regulated.For too many workers, the only credit products available lead to more debt and more financial instability.We’ve discussed in this Committee the impact predatory payday lenders have on working families.Today, we examine the impact some newer consumer financial products have on workers.Companies tell us these new products are innovative, they’re easy to use, they’ll give people more options.But so often, “innovation” is just a new way for companies to make money – while trapping people in debt.Newer credit products, like “buy now, pay later,” could help consumers pay for products in installments, with strong consumer protections.Yet many of these products come with hidden fees, they lack transparency, and they aren’t underwritten properly. Ads encourage consumers to use these plans for multiple purchases, at multiple online stores – racking up debt they cannot afford to repay.Consumers like Briana Gordley.As a college student, Briana started off with one of these loans. First one BNPL company, then two, then three. One company told her they were raising her credit limit from $100 to $1,000.Initially, 18-year-old Briana wasn’t too concerned. As she put it, if the companies “believed in my ability to repay my debt, then I did too.”With the approval of more and more credit, Briana was juggling $1,500 in loans with different payment dates throughout the month, and her account kept getting overdrawn.Briana’s story gets to the core of the problem. With little-to-no underwriting, the “Buy Now, Pay Later” companies don’t know if they’re the only ones a consumer has credit with.  And without proper term disclosures, a consumer is left in the dark.For this model to work for consumers, we need real rules companies must follow, and proper disclosures.Then there are new consumer products that use a so-called “tip model” – structuring themselves to deliberately avoid disclosing their terms, specifically avoiding important disclosures required by the Truth in Lending Act.Products like cash advances, overdraft coverage, and Earned Wage Advances—that are not offered in conjunction with employers—use a model where consumers are asked to pay a “tip” to the lender, instead of a fee or interest rate to use the products.Companies claim that because a tip is not presented as a finance charge or interest rate, Truth in Lending and other consumer protection laws, like the Military Lending Act, do not apply.The tip is just “voluntary,” they say.But these tips are not voluntary at all.It’s just a way to cheat the system and hide the true cost to workers.Employer-based Earned Wage Advances with strong consumer protections can help workers cover unexpected expenses or emergencies – though the better alternative would simply be for the companies to pay their workers enough to live on.And then there are debt products that are so predatory, so offensive, they should have no place in our financial system – schemes like Training Repayment Agreement Provisions, appropriately known as “TRAPs.”I’ll say this for that term – it’s truth in advertising.These provisions in employment contracts allow employers to recoup the cost of training employees who leave the job.It’s an offensive concept.It’s the employer’s job to train their workers. On-the-job training isn’t some special perk for workers – it’s a smart investment for companies.TRAPs require workers to pay back their employers for training if they leave their job within a certain period of time, saddling workers with debt.It’s just a modern day version of the scrip that left coal miners exhausted, destitute, and trapped by their employers.Remember what Tennessee Ernie Ford sang about owing his soul to the company store: “You load 16 tons, what do you get?  Another day older and deeper in debt.”Employers use TRAPs to prevent workers from pursuing higher paying or better opportunities. They decide how much the training would supposedly cost on the market and go after their workers – threatening their credit and economic mobility.Last week, Cassie Pennings from Colorado told members of the Committee about her experience with TRAPs.Ms. Pennings pursued her calling as a nurse during the COVID-19 pandemic.At the start of her job, her employer made Ms. Pennings sign an employment contract, and buried in the fine print, it said that if she left before two years, she would be indebted to her employer for $7,500 for the supposed training they provided.When Ms. Pennings decided to leave her nursing job after a year because of a bad work environment, her employer took $1,000 out of her second to last paycheck to payback her “training.”  That was half of her paycheck.Her former employer told her they will send the rest of the amount to collections.Last I checked, indentured servitude was illegal in the United States.But it looks like some enterprising companies are rebranding it, with these new employment contracts.And that is the focus of today’s hearing: to ensure that so-called “innovation” is not a substitute for good pay and does not come at the cost of workers’ dignity of work. ###"
https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-announces-127-million-from-infrastructure-bill-to-replace-western-hills-viaduct-in-cincinnati,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has awarded the City of Cincinnati a $127,115,954 grant for full replacement of the Western Hills Viaduct. This will allow for a new structure to be built immediately south of the existing viaduct, which will connect to a redesigned interchange with I-75. These historic investments in bridge infrastructure were made possible by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which Brown helped write and pass. Brown has worked on a bipartisan basis to highlight the project to Secretary Buttigieg and the Department of Transportation. “For years, plenty of politicians have talked about rebuilding bridges across the country – with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law we passed last year, we’re finally getting it done. I’m working to make sure Ohio gets its fair share – or more – of that investment. We are starting here in Cincinnati with the full replacement of the Western Hills Viaduct – a bridge that has become a danger for our communities,” said Brown.“The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law continues to deliver
for the Cincinnati region. Thanks to Hamilton County’s support of Issue 7, the
Western Hills Viaduct is a project that is ready to go,"" said Jill P. Meyer, CEO of the Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber. ""This INFRA grant will
help us get the project finished. It’s a huge investment in Cincinnati and will
connect more people to jobs and neighborhoods.”In August 2021, Brown was joined on a conference call by Howard Krueger, 81, of Cincinnati. Mr. Krueger said several years ago a piece of concrete fell on his windshield and shattered it when he was driving under the Western Hills Viaduct.The bridge investment announced today is one element of several program in the infrastructure law that will fund the repair and replacement of Ohio’s bridges.  Brown introduced the Bridge Investment Act in 2018. Brown’s Bridge Investment Act, will also provide $12.5 billion in funding to repair and replace nationally and regionally significant bridges, part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act’s historic investment.  The package also provides Ohio $9.8 billion of formula funding to repair, replace, and upgrade roads and bridges throughout the state.The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act also:                    ### "
https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-president-biden-speak-at-intel-plant-groundbreaking-made-possible-by-chips-act,"NEW ALBANY, OH – Today, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) joined President Joe Biden, state and federal officials, and representatives from the Intel Corporation to break ground on Intel’s new $20 billion semiconductor plant in New Albany, which is made possible by the senator’s work to pass the CHIPS and Science Act.“America invented the semiconductor. Yet today, 90 percent of them are made overseas. That ends now,” said Brown. “Today, we are burying the term ‘rust belt.’ We’re breaking ground on an investment in our greatest asset: Ohio workers. The technology of the future won’t just be developed in America – it will be made in America, in Ohio, where we have built the engines of progress for generations.”The project will create at least 10,000 jobs, support tens of thousands of additional jobs in the area and will be built by Ohio union workers. The new plant will build out the domestic supply chain for this critical component for the auto industry and other high-tech manufacturing. This will speed up production, lower prices, end our reliance on China, and secure Ohio’s position as a leader in the industry.“Today marks a pivotal moment in the journey to build a more geographically balanced and resilient semiconductor supply chain. The establishment of the Silicon Heartland is testament to the power of government incentives to unlock private investment, create thousands of high-paying jobs, and benefit U.S. economic and national security,” said Pat Gelsinger, CEO of Intel. “We would not be here today without the support of leaders in the administration, Congress and the state of Ohio, who share a vision to help restore the United States to its rightful place as a leader in advanced chipmaking.” “The CHIPS Act is major accomplishment that will boost domestic production of semiconductor computer chips and bolster American manufacturing.  Most of the semiconductors and microchips that power our phones, household appliances, our vehicles and even our military’s weapons are made outside the U.S.  This bill provides for a massive industry investment with the proper guardrails to ensure corporations that receive the assistance are doing the right thing for our national interests,” said Tim Burga, President of Ohio AFL-CIO. “We thank Senator Brown for his leadership in crafting this critical bill and each member of the Ohio Congressional delegation that voted for it. This bill will spur the creation of thousands of building and construction jobs and provide high-road career paths for Ohioans well into the future while bolstering our economic and national security.” “The Ohio State Building and Construction Trades Council extends its sincere thanks to Senator Brown for his steadfast tenacity in helping secure this once in a lifetime project for the residents of Ohio as well as his unwavering commitment to the 100,000 men and women who put a hard hat on every day working in the Union Construction Industry in Ohio and who will be instrumental in making this a success,” said Mike Knisley, Executive Secretary and Treasurer for the Ohio State Building and Construction Trades Council.Brown worked with local, state, and other members of Ohio’s Congressional delegation to ensure this project landed in Ohio and was a leader in pushing the CHIPS Act through the Senate and getting the bill to the president’s desk. President Biden signed the CHIPS Bill into law in August.                            ###"
https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-announces-more-than-200000-for-agriculture-education-in-southeast-ohio,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) has awarded a $208,789 Food and Agricultural Service Learning Program (FASLP) grant to Rural Action in Athens. The funding aims to expand K-12 education on local food and farming; engage parents and community members in local food systems through gardening and Farm to School initiatives; and facilitate collaboration across the food system.“Ohio farmers grow some of the best produce in the country,” said Brown. “Not only does this investment provide nutrition education and critical access to healthy, local foods for students and families, but it will also help develop important local markets and expand business opportunities.”This FASLP grant supports programs intended to increase agriculture knowledge and improve the nutritional health of low-income children, and foster higher levels of community engagement between farms and school systems, while developing leadership skills for K-12 students to prepare the next generation for agricultural and related careers.In June 2021, Brown visited school officials and other local partners at Federal Hocking Middle School’s Farm-to-School program to celebrate the program and discuss his efforts to support local agriculture and address child hunger. In April 2021, Brown reintroduced his Kids Eat Local Act, bipartisan legislation to support local and regional food systems. The legislation would allow schools to use “locally grown, locally raised, and locally caught” as a product specification for the food they buy. This bill would help create new markets for farmers and new healthy options for school children. Brown also introduced the Farm to School Act, legislation to renew an important nutrition program that supports both school-aged children and local producers. The bipartisan bill would build on the successes of the USDA’s Farm to School Program, which supports initiatives that deliver fresh, local foods to schools nationwide.In the 2019 spending package, Brown helped secure $962 million for the NIFA. Brown has been a leader for Ohio’s rural communities. He successfully secured a number of provisions that are important to Ohio farmers in the 2018 Farm Bill, including reauthorization of the FASLP program which originally was a provision in Brown’s Local FARMS Act. He is the first Ohioan to serve on the Senate Agriculture Committee in 50 years. ###"

https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-opening-statement-at-insurance-oversight-hearing,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, delivered the following opening statement at today’s hearing entitled “Current Issues in Insurance.”Sen. Brown’s remarks, as prepared for delivery, follow:Every American needs insurance – whether it’s auto insurance to protect us when we’re on the road, or homeowners’ insurance to protect the biggest investment for most families, or life insurance to cement your family’s financial security in the event of a tragedy.It's our job to make sure that the industry is protecting Americans’ hard-earned money – not putting it at risk.  American insurance companies are regulated by state insurance commissioners. The state-based system of insurance regulation is historic, and ensures local markets and needs are taken into consideration. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners coordinates state commissioners across all jurisdictions, to identify and address risks to the entire system.In the Wall Street Reform Act, Congress created the Federal Insurance Office within the Treasury Department to promote national coordination in the insurance sector. It’s common sense – insurers operate across all state jurisdictions and internationally.I’m pleased to have both the Maryland Commissioner Kathleen Birrane on behalf of the NAIC, and Director Seitz of FIO testify today.If we’re going to keep Americans’ hard-earned money safe, it is more important than ever that they work together. Today we’ll explore many important topics.For example, three months ago, Lockheed Martin transferred $4.3 billion of its pensions to Athene Holding – an insurance holding company specializing in life insurance and owned by the private equity firm, Apollo Global Management.Overnight, Lockheed Martin employees and retirees were notified that their pensions would be managed by Athene and no longer governed by ERISA or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.This is just one recent example of private equity giants’ expansion into people’s pensions and the insurance industry.We know that workers end up worse off when Wall Street private equity firms get involved. We’ve seen it over and over, in industry after industry.In March, I asked the NAIC and FIO to look into private equity’s expansion into similar pension-risk transfer transactions. We need to understand the risks to workers whose financial security depends on pension and retirement programs.The NAIC and FIO provided thoughtful responses to my letter. The NAIC has been monitoring the risk-taking behavior of private equity-owned insurers.FIO has done similar work, and also looked at the wider interconnectedness of insurance and reinsurance markets across the world. Those connections have added to systemic risk concerns, because U.S. insurance companies depend even more on the financial health of insurance companies outside the U.S.Taken together, our insurance authorities are focused on these emerging and complex risks to safeguard our economy. Our communities and families rely on insurance companies to protect their loved ones, their homes, small business, and so many parts of our lives. We can’t ignore when risks build up, or firms behave irresponsibly.And we know who always pays the price when they do. It’s not insurance executives. It’s not private equity executives. It’s not Wall Street.It’s workers and their families. And it’s taxpayers, who were forced to bail out AIG 15 years ago.That should never happen again.That also means looking around the corner to make sure the industry and agencies are prepared for risks as they develop. As more Americans face increasingly severe climate catastrophes like wildfires and hurricanes each year, we need to help communities prepare – and we need to ensure insurance watchdogs and the companies they oversee are prepared.In the aftermath of some of these natural disasters, we have seen instances where insurers either raise prices or stop offering insurance altogether, leaving families and businesses struggling to find affordable coverage as they rebuild their lives and communities.We also know this industry has a long history of racial discrimination, just like so many big industries.Black and brown families face more difficulty in getting insurance across the board. We’ve seen this happen in auto insurance.Earlier this year, The New York Times also reported that customers, insurance agents, and employees sued State Farm for discrimination in the workplace and in paying out claims.My colleague Chairwoman Waters has been working on learning more about this as well. Her committee recently requested information about large life and P&C insurers’ involvement in financing chattel slavery.And I’m glad FIO and NAIC are also working on this. NAIC is investigating through its Special Committee on Race and Insurance.And I look forward to reviewing FIO’s upcoming report on availability and affordability of auto insurance, and hope it will shed more light on racial equity in accessing this insurance.Finally, later this year, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors will meet to consider whether the U.S. insurance system’s review of capital adequacy standards meets international criteria.Because we regulate insurance differently here in the U.S., where state and local markets and international markets are served by the same companies, it’s important that representatives of the U.S. system like FIO and the NAIC advocate for fair treatment by the international regulators.And now that the Fed Vice Chair for Supervision has been confirmed, Michael Barr and the offices testifying here today will get to work with our international counterparts in this process.All of these issues show how critical the work of FIO and NAIC is to our economy’s health and stability. I expect FIO and NAIC to prioritize monitoring these risks in their ongoing work. ###"

Brown’s Remarks HEREWASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) spoke on the Senate Floor to celebrate Labor Day and to honor the people who make this country work.“Whether you punch a clock or swipe a badge, earn a salary or make tips, whether you’re caring for children or an aging parent – all work has dignity,” said Brown on the Senate Floor. “And when work has dignity, hard work pays off for everyone – no matter who you are, where you live, or what kind of work you do.”Sen. Brown’s remarks, as prepared for delivery, are available below:Mr/Mme. President,This week we celebrated Labor Day – a day when Americans come together to honor all the people who make this country work.Whether you punch a clock or swipe a badge, earn a salary or make tips, whether you’re caring for children or an aging parent – ALL work has dignity.And when work has dignity, hard work pays off for everyone – no matter who you are, where you live, or what kind of work you do.Yet we know for so many Americans, their work doesn’t pay off like it should.Look at what’s happened over the last 30, 40 years:But for decades, wages barely budged. For most Americans, their purchasing power has largely been flat for almost 50 years.Because Wall Street rewards corporations that raise prices without raising paychecks.Wall Street rewards: Wall Street analysts actually downgrade stock prices when American companies invest in American workers, and in American production.If a company opens a new factory in Ohio, Wall Street will downgrade its stock. If that same company instead buys back its own stock, sending 40% of the returns to foreign investors, Wall Street will reward it. We’re working to change that. For the first time in far too long, we have a government on the side of workers.We have a dues-paying union member as Labor Secretary.We have a National Labor Relations Board actually looking out for workers and willing to go after corporate union-busting.We passed the most pro-worker infrastructure bill, with the strongest Buy America provisions ever.We’ve taken historic steps to put workers first, to invest in American workers, and to make our economy work for every American – Not just CEOs. Not just Wall Street.We passed the CHIPS Act – to bring our supply chains home, to bring down prices for American families, and to create tens of thousands of good-paying, union jobs in Ohio and all across the country.And we passed the Inflation Reduction Act taking on three of the most powerful special interests in Washington.We took on the big pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices.We took on big oil to lower energy prices and create jobs –union jobs – in the industries of the future.And we took on Wall Street – we’re going to finally tax stock buybacks, that reward CEOs and executives at the expense of workers and jobs.These are big wins for workers.And together, they are the biggest steps we have taken in decades to create industrial policy that puts our most valuable resource – American workers – first. It finally counters the business model where corporations hopscotch the globe in search of lower and lower wages.From the Infrastructure Bill to the CHIPS Act to the Inflation Reduction Act, we are laying down a new marker:The technology of the future – from semiconductors to batteries to electric vehicles – will be developed in America and made in America, by American workers.It hasn’t been easy, and our work is far from finished, but I’m optimistic.Today, I see more momentum behind the labor movement than at any time in my career.All over the country, more and more workers are seeing that unions are the best way to have a voice – from Starbucks to Amazon. Today, 70% of Americans approve of unions – the highest level of support in over 50 years.More people than ever want to join a union. They know that a union card means:Of course we know what workers are up against when they organize. Corporations unleash all their power to fight their own workers, too often illegally.It’s why I will never stop fighting to pass the PRO Act, to finally level the playing field between workers and corporations in union organizing.This week, we honor the workers who built this country.And we recommit ourselves to the fights ahead.When work has dignity, every American is paid the living wage they’ve earned.When work has dignity, all workers can afford child care, health care and housing.When work has dignity, American workers have retirement security, and paid leave, and power over their schedules and their lives.Because when you love this country, you fight for the people who make it work.That’s what our labor movement has done for more than a century. And it’s what I’ll continue to do."

The funds will boost tourism in Southeast Ohio by making upgrades to Burr Oak State Park in Athens County. The EDA investment will be matched with $604,625 in local funds and the project is expected to create or retain 125 jobs. The grant was made possible through funds from the American Rescue Plan, which Brown helped write and pass.“Ohioans depend on access to parks for outdoor recreation, community events, and local jobs,” said Brown. “This funding from the American Rescue Plan will support the local economy, create jobs, and promote local tourism at Burr Oak State Park.”The project will include new campsite amenities, trail segments, and docks at the marina to enhance the visitor experience at the park. This project is funded under EDA’s $240 million competitive American Rescue Plan Travel, Tourism, and Outdoor Recreation program.The EDA is the only federal government agency focused exclusively on economic development. The program is designed to provide financial assistance to communities and promote economic development. EDA grants are awarded through a competitive process based upon application merit, an applicant’s eligibility, and the availability of funds.

https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-discusses-local-food-supply-chains-farm-bill-priorities-call,"WASHINGTON, D.C. –Today, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) hosted a news conference call to discuss how to best secure and shorten food supply chains and learn what priorities Ohio farmers have for the 2023 Farm Bill. Brown, the first Ohioan to serve on the Senate Agriculture Committee in nearly 50 years, will help write the upcoming Farm Bill.“We know how important farming is to our state – 1 in 7 Ohioans depend on agriculture for their jobs, and Ohio farmers are some of the most productive in the world,” said Brown. “We’ve seen during the pandemic how long supply chains that stretch around the world can cause inflation. In the next Farm Bill, I want to make it easier for farmers to feed their communities and for consumers to buy local food and farm products, and keep money where it belongs: here in Ohio.”Bill Patterson of Patterson Fruit Farm in Chesterland, who is the President of the Ohio Farm Bureau, also joined the call. Brown spent the last week in Ohio talking to farmers and other agriculture representatives at roundtables around the state, including participating in a roundtable at Patterson Fruit Farm, as a part of the Farm Bill planning process.“With all of the unique challenges facing agriculture today, the next Farm Bill will be of utmost importance for Ohio farmers. We appreciate Senator Brown taking the time to sit down with Ohio Farm Bureau members to discuss the concerns of the agricultural community and using our input to shape the next chapter of farm policy in Washington,” said Patterson. “Ohio farmers appreciate Senator Brown’s efforts to bring together groups that represent all facets of Ohio agriculture. It's no wonder he has been instrumental in leading the highly bipartisan Farm Bills the last two cycles.” Brown has long been a leader for Ohio’s rural communities. Before the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, Brown held roundtables around Ohio to hear from farmers and rural communities about what they wanted to see in the bill, and successfully secured a number of Ohio-specific provisions that were important to the state’s farmers.   ###"
https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/brown-hosts-consumers-listening-session-new-financial-products,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, hosted a listening session with consumers from around the country. The consumers shared their experiences with new financial products, including how lack of transparency and risks undermines the dignity of work.“Debt products that are well-designed, transparent, and regulated can help workers pay off an unexpected car repair or help with the grocery bill or cover a medical expense. But in reality, these new products often aren’t well designed, they’re rarely transparent, and they’re not well regulated,” said Brown. “That leads to more debt and more financial instability for workers who aren’t paid a living wage.”In addition to today’s listening session, Chairman Brown will hold a Committee hearing on Tuesday, September 13th, titled “New Consumer Financial Products and the Impacts to Workers.” The hearing will be live streamed at banking.senate.gov and on YouTube.In April, Brown led his colleagues in a letter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) urging it to investigate Training Repayment Agreement Provisions (TRAPs). In December, Brown joined his colleagues to call on the CFPB to take action regarding the governance of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) products.Excerpts from each consumer’s statement are included below. Production-quality video is linked.Briana Gordley, from Texas, experienced significant debt after using BNPL loans.“I understand and believe in personal accountability and responsibility for the choices I made, but accountability and responsibility should be a two-way street between consumers and businesses, and I urge the committee to consider how new and evolving fintech products, such as BNPL, can, whether intentional or not, harm vulnerable consumers, and trap them in debt before their lives have even started.”BreAnn Scally, from California, worked off thousands of dollars of debt her employer stuck her with through a TRAP.“I didn’t read the agreement too closely, but what it said was that the training wasn’t free at all. It actually cost $5,000, and I’d need to pay back that $5,000 if I left within a two-year period after the beginning of the training…Over time my job at PetSmart became worse and worse, I was basically making minimum wage or just above it, but my job was impossible.

https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-discusses-how-pact-act-will-expand-benefits-for-veterans-exposed-to-toxins-liverpool,"EAST LIVERPOOL, OH – Today, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) hosted a roundtable with local veterans, including those who have been harmed by exposure to toxic burn pits, to discuss the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022 that was recently signed into law by President Biden.“This bill is the most comprehensive expansion of benefits for veterans who faced toxic exposure in our country’s history,” said Brown. “Providing health care and benefits for veterans who suffer from toxic exposure is a cost of going to war. If you were exposed to toxins while serving our country, you deserve the benefits you earned. Period. No exceptions.”Brown was joined by Susan Zeier, the mother-in-law of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson. The legislation is named after Robinson, a Central Ohio veteran who passed away in 2020 at age 39 from lung cancer after exposure to burn pits during a one-year deployment in Iraq in 2006. He will also be joined by veterans and advocates from around the region. Zeier, her daughter Danielle Robinson, Heath’s widow, and Heath and Danielle’s daughter Brielle were at the PACT Act signing at the White House last month.“First and foremost, I’d like to thank Senator Sherrod Brown for his part and full support in this burn pits journey. Witnessing President Joe Biden sign the SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act into law was an honor after a hard fought but landmark victory for all veterans and their loved ones,” said Zeier. “For decades, way too many of our veterans have suffered health consequences from various toxic exposures, including burn pits, only to be denied health care and other benefits from the Veterans Administration. This piece of legislation changes that by providing full VA benefits to sick and dying veterans and their families. My family is grateful this historic legislation is named in honor of our hometown hero.  We will now move forward knowing our mission and promise to Heath has been fulfilled and that no more families will have to suffer like ours did.”The PACT Act is the result of a years-long fight by Brown, veterans and advocates to secure access to Department of Veterans Affairs health care and disability benefits for veterans who were exposed to toxic chemicals. He now is working with Ohio veterans, their families and advocates to bring additional attention to provisions in the PACT Act so veterans can get the care they’ve earned and deserve.  “Senator Brown worked so hard to get the PACT act passed for the veterans who were exposed to the toxic smoke from the burn pits,” said David Oesch, a member of the Columbiana County Veterans Service Commission. “This will be very helpful to the veterans and their families for future care that will be needed for any symptoms that arise from the burn pits.”All Ohio veterans and family members can go to va.gov/pact to find out more about how they can now claim the benefits they have earned. ###"
https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-holds-roundtable-with-uaw-workers-on-how-chips-act-will-benefit-ohio-auto-industry,"TOLEDO, OH – Today, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) visited UAW Local 14, to discuss with UAW Local 12, Local 14 and Region 2B members how the recently passed CHIPS Act will support Ohio’s auto industry and Ohio autoworkers, position Ohio to lead in growing industries, and prevent future shortages that disrupt production and raise prices.“With the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, we are finally putting in place a real industrial policy – it’s a new approach that puts American workers and American production first,” said Brown. “We know how the shortage of semiconductor chips has hurt Ohio’s auto industry. This is the first step to bringing supply chains back home to Ohio, and will position our state to continue to lead in both of these industries.”More than 12,000 workers in Toledo are represented by the two unions, and many were affected by recent semiconductor chip shortages. Due to the shortages, workers have endured multiple temporary layoffs because of idled production lines.During the semiconductor chip shortages, GM directed available chips to their most in-demand vehicles and idled other production lines. For UAW Local 14 members, this led to temporary layoffs in at least one of those idled production lines. On the other hand, UAW Local 12 members in Toledo, many of whom work at companies along the supply chain supporting the most popular Jeep models, faced an increase in production levels without the accompanying additional resources. As chips were diverted to those more in-demand lines, some facilities struggled to hire enough workers to keep up with demand.“Senator Brown not only listens to the needs of his constituents, but he also comes up with solutions,” said Tony Totty, the President of UAW Local 14. “This semiconductor legislation addresses our members unemployment, supply chain and compensation issues concerning chip shortages. If more Senators problem solved like Sherrod, we would be in a better place.”“The current semiconductor chip shortage is another example of why outsourcing our supply chain across the globe was bad for workers and bad for business. The CHIPS Act will help bring manufacturing supply chains back to America and to American workers,” said Bruce Baumhower, the President of UAW Local 12. “The members of Local 12 are grateful to Sen. Brown for always fighting for workers and making this legislation possible.”The CHIPS Act will provide $52.7 billion to expand domestic semiconductor manufacturing, research and development, and workforce development, with $2 billion to focus solely on legacy-chip production. Legacy chips are essential to the auto industry and will mean more chips for Ford, Jeep, GM, and other companies in Ohio.“The CHIPS Act is a big investment in American manufacturing and American workers. The members of UAW Region 2B, Ohio & Indiana have been disproportionally impacted by chip shortage shutdowns. Producing semiconductor chips in the U.S. again will mean less disruption for all workers, including UAW members,” said Wayne Blanchard, the Director of UAW Region 2B Ohio & Indiana. “Thank you to Sen. Brown for fighting to get this bill passed and for his continued advocacy for working families.” ###"

In the next   Farm Bill, I want to make it easier for farmers to feed their communities and   for consumers to buy local Ohio food and farm products and keep money where   it belongs: here in our communities.”Brown, the first Ohioan to serve   on the Senate Agriculture Committee in more than 50 years, will help write   the upcoming Farm Bill.Brown has long been a leader for   Ohio’s agricultural communities. This week, Brown held several roundtables   around the state to talk with farmers and other producers about their   priorities for the upcoming Farm Bill.“The upcoming Farm Bill is an   absolutely critical legislative vehicle to protect and promote food security   for every Ohioan and every American. Food security means the ability to   afford and access adequate, nutritious food. But more broadly, food security   also means the sustainability and viability of our food systems and food   supply,” said Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, Executive Director, Ohio Association   of Food Banks. “We look forward to working in partnership with our elected   officials, including Senator Brown, over the next several months to make sure   Ohio is leading the national conversation around ways to promote food   security, in every sense of the term, in the 2023 Farm Bill.”“The tie between food security   and access to healthy food is undeniable in our ongoing work to lift up our   neighbors. The Farm Bill provides critical pathways to ensure availability of   fresh food for individuals and families facing food insecurity,” said   Matt Habash, President & CEO of the Mid-Ohio Food Collective. “We   appreciate the opportunity to work with Senator Brown and our federal officials   in creating a Farm Bill that brings together so many diverse interests to   work collectively toward ending hunger.”Before the passage of the 2018   Farm Bill, Brown held similar roundtables around the state to learn    from farmers and other agriculture stakeholders about what they wanted   to see in that bill, and successfully   secured a number of Ohio-specific provisions that were important to   the state’s agriculture industry.The event was sponsored by the   Ohio Association of Foodbanks, The Center for Community Solutions and the   Mid-Ohio Food Collective.###"

https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/first-solar-to-expand-production-in-northwest-ohio-because-of-inflation-reduction-act,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, First Solar Energy announced a $185 million investment to expand its manufacturing facilities in Wood County, made possible by U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown’s (D-OH) work to pass the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Brown has long been a leader in the Senate pushing to ensure technologies of the future are made in Ohio and across the country. This is part of a $1.2 billion investment to scale production of American-made, responsibly-produced photovoltaic (PV) solar modules, directly supporting the country’s transition to a clean energy future and enabling the fight against climate change.“We are already seeing the Inflation Reduction Act at work in our state, creating jobs and positioning Ohio to lead in new, growing industries,” said Brown. “With its historic expertise in glass manufacturing, Northwest Ohio is leading the way in 21st-century energy manufacturing, with companies like First Solar making some of the best, most efficient solar panels in the world. Today’s announcement is proof that when we invest in American workers, like new technologies including solar energy, we can both build our domestic industry, secure our supply chains, and support our local economies.”“The passage of the IRA has delivered precisely the durable industrial policy foundation that we’ve long advocated for,” said Mark R. Widmar, First Solar CEO. “It is a comprehensive foundation that enables the solar industry as a whole. It creates the scaffolding required to scale the full spectrum of activities, from critical minerals processing and investment in grid infrastructure to R&D and domestic manufacturing, required to effectively support energy security, the fight against climate change, and to deliver America’s energy transition.”      The announcement is another historic investment in Ohio’s manufacturing that will further position the state as a leader in new-age technology, continue to expand the state’s economy, and put another nail in the coffin of the term “Rust Belt.”Along with the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the news comes on the heels of the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022.  These laws boost advanced manufacturing hubs across the country, make historic investments in the Manufacturing USA and Manufacturing Extension Partnership programs Brown has long championed, and ensure Brown’s Buy America provisions apply to resulting construction projects.The Inflation Reduction Act includes a special additional 10 percent tax incentive to build clean energy manufacturing facilities in historic-energy communities, which are communities with significant employment related to coal, oil, and natural gas.

https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-visits-green-field-farms-discusses-local-food-supply-chains-farm-bill-priorities-at-roundtable,"WOOSTER, OH – Today, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) hosted a roundtable discussion with local farmers, officials from the Ohio Ecological Food and Farm Association (OEFFA), and agriculture stakeholders to discuss how to best secure and shorten food supply chains and learn what priorities Ohio farmers have for the 2023 Farm Bill. Brown, the first Ohioan to serve on the Senate Agriculture Committee in more than 50 years, will help write the upcoming Farm Bill.“We know how important farming is to our state – 1 in 7 Ohioans depend on agriculture for their jobs, and Ohio farmers are some of the most productive in the world,” said Brown. “We’ve seen during the pandemic how long supply chains that stretch around the world can cause inflation. In the next Farm Bill, I want to make it easier for farmers to feed their communities and for consumers to buy local Ohio food and farm products and keep money where it belongs: here in our communities.”“OEFFA is excited to partner with Green Field Farms to host this listening session with Senator Brown in the run up to 2023 Farm Bill negotiations. Green Field Farms is a wonderful example of organic farmers coming together to form a cooperative dedicated to sustainable agriculture, the revitalization of family farms and supplying fresh and nutritious food,” said Amalie Lipstreu, OEFFA Policy Director. “We appreciate the Senator’s leadership on issues critical to OEFFA farmers including deep investments in local and regional food systems and ensuring that farm bill programs support and incentivize sustainable agriculture.”Brown has long been a leader for Ohio’s rural communities. Before the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, Brown held roundtables around Ohio to hear from farmers and rural communities about what they wanted to see in the bill, and successfully secured a number of Ohio-specific provisions that were important to the state’s farmers.Brown also discussed how the Inflation Reduction Act will benefit Ohio agriculture, rural development conservation, and urban forestry. ###"
https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-tours-brite-energy-innovators-discusses-chips-act-investment,"WARREN, OH – Today, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) visited BRITE Energy Innovators, a nonprofit that helps develop early-stage renewable energy technology companies. Brown toured the facility and discussed how the recently passed CHIPS Act will support organizations like BRITE and the companies they work with, and position Ohio to lead in these growing industries.“With the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, we are finally putting in place a real industrial policy – it’s a new approach that puts American workers and American production first,” said Brown. “This is going to help nurture start-ups like the ones here at BRITE. It’s not enough to invent new technologies here – we have to make sure they’re commercialized in Ohio, that they grow new industries in Ohio, and that they create jobs in Ohio.”The CHIPS Act includes the National Clean Energy Incubator Program, which supports energy incubators like BRITE that accelerate the commercial application of clean energy technologies by providing physical workspaces or support.The CHIPS Act makes an historic $829 million investment in the Manufacturing USA program over the next five years, the largest increase in funding for the program since its inception. Brown codified the Manufacturing USA program into law through his bipartisan 2014 legislation, the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act, which created a network of 15 manufacturing innovation hubs around the country. BRITE is a partner of Youngstown’s “America Makes,” which was the nation’s first manufacturing and innovation hub, and served as inspiration for Brown’s legislation. America Makes was created when President Obama directed the Department of Defense to create it in 2012.“We have this key moment to reignite manufacturing in Ohio and the industrial Midwest. This new act will boost efforts to manufacture more zero-carbon technology here in America, provide those entrepreneurs we work with everyday access to Department of Energy resources and research, and establish a new federal office for clean energy innovation. That’s exciting,” said Rick Stockburger, President and CEO of BRITE Energy. “Our valley’s greatest export has been our young people and legislation like this energizes that magnet to get those talented people back to our area. We are all in this together – I applaud the large bipartisan support in creating a cleaner tomorrow, reshaping our energy future, developing more jobs and making America the place to do it.”                    ###"

National Prescription Drug Take Back Day is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in an effort to provide safe, convenient and responsible means for disposal of prescription drugs, while also educating the public about the potential for misuse and medications.“Addiction isn’t an individual problem or a character flaw, it’s a disease – a disease that all too often starts in the family medicine cabinet,” said Brown. “That’s why this DEA-sponsored Drug Take Back Day is so important in Ohio. Now more than ever, as drug overdoses have increased amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, all prescription medications — especially addictive opioid painkillers — should be disposed of safely to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands.”“In 2021, drug overdose deaths reached a never-before-seen high in this country, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. We all must redouble our efforts to curb abuse and addiction in this country,” said Portman. “Most individuals who become addicted to opioids start by using prescription drugs, and that’s why safely disposing of unused prescription drugs is critical tool in our efforts to stop opioid abuse. I urge all Ohioans to clean out their medicine cabinets and participate in this year’s Drug Take Back event.”Ohioans can look up the drug take back site closest to them here.###"
