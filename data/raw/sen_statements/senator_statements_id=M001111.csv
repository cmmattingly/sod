Senator Murray has long pushed back against efforts to curtail eligibility of the program, and this announcement comes after she urged VA Secretary Denis McDonough to revise VA’s unnecessarily restrictive criteria for the program to ensure it aligns with Congressional intent so that veterans and their families can access the critical services and care they have earned.“We owe our veterans and their families more than just a debt of gratitude—we owe them the services and care they have earned to support their mental and physical health,” said Senator Murray. “But I hear all the time from veterans in Washington state about the stress and the frustration they are experiencing, worried that they can’t access the Caregivers program, or that they might lose eligibility for the services they depend on. Not on my watch. After pushing non-stop for the VA to fix this problem and do right by our veterans, I’m glad that today the VA has announced steps to protect eligibility to ensure no family loses the VA services and support that they need, and that they have earned.”“While this is important, hard-fought progress, I know that our work isn’t over,” Senator Murray continued. “I’ve been pushing for a long time for the VA to align the Caregivers program with Congressional intent, and I’m going to keep doing all I can to cut red tape and ensure that veterans and caregivers can access this critically important program.”Senator Murray is a longtime champion for strengthening federal investments in caring for veterans, and as former Chair of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Senator Murray oversaw the initial implementation of the Caregiver Support Program in 2011 and since then has worked diligently to expand it and has been following its implementation closely.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/murray-leads-senate-democrats-in-fighting-republicans-national-abortion-ban/,"***WATCH: Senator Murray leads press conference calling out extreme Republican proposal***(Washington, DC) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), led her colleagues Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) at a press conference making crystal clear they will fight Republicans’ national abortion ban every step of the way.In state after state, Republicans have enacted extreme abortion bans—and now, they’re pushing a national abortion ban that would strip women in every state of their right to make their own health care decisions and punish doctors for providing abortion care. When introducing the legislation on Tuesday, Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) vowed that: “If we take back the House and the Senate, I can assure you we’ll have a vote on our bill.”“Republicans can’t pretend they want to leave abortion to states while blocking Senator Cortez-Masto’s bill to let people travel to other states for an abortion. Republicans can’t say they don’t want to punish doctors while blocking my bill to ensure doctors in states where abortion is legal can’t be punished for doing their jobs. But if there was any doubt about Republicans’ true intentions—about their extreme abortion plans—there’s no question after this week,” said Senator Murray. “Republicans want to ban abortion in every single state. They want to punish doctors.”“If Republicans think they can go after my constituents’ rights, go after women’s bodies and futures, and overrule the personal medical decisions of people across the country, they’ve got another thing coming. Because I am not going to stop pushing back. Democrats are not going to stop pushing back,” added Senator Murray.“Republicans are twisting themselves into pretzels to explain their position on abortion, because they know the American people overwhelmingly side with a woman’s right to choose,” said Leader Schumer. “The Republican abortion ban introduced this week shows the stark contrast between Democrats who are focused on creating jobs, lowering costs, and bringing our country together, and MAGA Republicans who are a pushing radical, extremist agenda.”“Two and a half months ago, the Supreme Court issued a ruling, shredding nearly five decades of precedent…This bill that was introduced will take these restrictions even a step further. This is not what the American people want,” said Senator Klobuchar. “It is now more clear than ever that we must codify Roe v. Wade into law.”“When a woman can’t make decisions about her own body and about abortion, this affects her family, her community, and our economy. The vast majority of Americans support a woman’s right to bodily autonomy, but apparently Republicans don’t think so,” said Senator Hirono. “If Republicans take control over the Senate, they are going to push for a national ban. And that means that states like Hawaii, which was the first state in the nation to protect a woman’s right to choose and all other states that come forward, or already have in place, basically codifying Roe—under this national ban bill, would fall by the wayside.”“Republicans’ proposal to ban abortion nationwide lays bare, in black and white, that they never really wanted to ‘leave women’s rights to the states’ like they have long told the American people,” said Senator Duckworth. “While Democrats spent this summer helping working families keep more of their hard-earned money, Republicans spent theirs trying to strip away millions of Americans’ rights and effectively make 50% of America second-class citizens. Democrats and I will do everything in our power to prevent this nationwide ban on basic healthcare—a ban that explicitly goes against what the vast majority of Americans want—from happening.”“Senator Graham’s radical proposal is exactly what Republicans had in mind when they hand-picked Supreme Court nominees to overturn Roe v. Wade. They want a national ban on abortion. And it’s what they will do if they take back control of the House and Senate. They’ve said so themselves,” Senator Wyden said. “The American people should expect them to follow through, and vote in November to guarantee that this bill never sees the light of day.”“With this bill to put a federal ban on a woman’s right to choose, our Republican colleagues have shown their true colors and proven beyond all doubt that they will stop at nothing to turn back the clock and make women in America second-class citizens,” said Senator Gillibrand. “They said that such decisions about the right to bodily autonomy and to life and death medical decisions should be made by individual states. But of course this was never really about the states. It’s always been about control — who controls women and our rights to privacy, bodily autonomy, basic human rights, civil rights, and constitutional freedoms. Voters will continue to make their voices heard and I will never stop fighting to enshrine the right to reproductive freedom into federal law once and for all.”“Americans should have no doubt about where Republicans stand now on this issue. They want to punish women and they want to punish doctors. They will do it at the state level and they will do it at the national level,” said Senator Blumenthal. “No state, not even Connecticut, is safe from this threat. I trust women, not the government or politicians, to make these preeminently important decisions.”  ###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

These projects will help build a stronger green economy by supporting a range of farm and environmental groups as they work to boost sustainable grazing practices for beef production, restore thousands of acres of forests, and more.“Washington state’s farmers and ranchers are an important part of our economy, producing the food to feed families across the country. As we work to build a stronger, greener economy and combat the climate crisis, I’m happy to see that the USDA is providing our agricultural sectors with the support they need to boost their climate resiliency and sustainability,” said Senator Murray.“I’m pleased that USDA is investing in important resources that will help boost sustainable growing practices, lower emissions, restore thousands of acres of forest, and more—all while supporting our farmers, and feeding families for generations to come.”Senator Murray has been a leader on confronting the climate crisis from every angle during her time in the Senate. Senator Murray was instrumental in passing the Inflation Reduction Law, the largest investment in combatting the climate crisis in American history. Senator Murray also joined President Biden in Seattle in April when he issued his Executive Order to safeguard American forests and fight climate change.Last year, Senator Murray helped pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which will help Washington state and the country transition to cleaner energy and electric vehicles, make the electric grid more reliable, help prevent and fight wildfires, and more—all while creating good-paying, union jobs.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

In every single state.”***WATCH SENATOR MURRAY’S FLOOR SPEECH HERE***(Washington, DC) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, took to the Senate floor to fight back against the Republican national abortion ban introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) yesterday. In the speech, Senator Murray promised to fight this bill every step of the way and to stand up for everyone’s right to control their own bodies and make their own medical decisions.“This bill shows the true Republican position: they want to ban abortion—for everyone. In every single state. And they want to punish doctors. They want to put them in prison for doing their jobs,” said Senator Murray. “So to anyone who lives in a blue state, like mine—anyone who thinks they are safe from these attacks here is the painful reality: Republicans are coming for your rights.”“So here’s my message to Republicans: If you want to go after my constituents’ rights, if you want to go after women’s bodies and futures, if you want to pass a national abortion ban, like this extreme bill, you are going to have to go through me,” continued Senator Murray. “Because Democrats are going to keep standing up for women and men across the country who do not want their rights taken away.”Senator Murray has been fighting to defend the right to abortion since she first got into politics, and she continues to fight every day for the needs of patients across the country. Just yesterday, she led 29 of her colleagues in calling on the Department of Health and Human Services to take immediate action to safeguard women’s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially get the health care they need. Senator Murray immediately put out a statement following the introduction of Republicans’ national abortion ban yesterday and joined her colleagues to speak out following Senator Graham’s press conference.Every week since Roe was overturned, Senator Murray has fought to pass key protections to safeguard Americans’ reproductive rights—pushing to advance commonsense legislation to protect the right to contraception, protect every American’s right to travel, protect doctors’ right to provide legal abortion care, and expand our national family planning program. But at every turn, Senate Republicans stood in the way, blocking every single bill.Senator Murray’s floor speech, as prepared for delivery, is below:“Thank you, M. President. “Yesterday, my Republican colleagues introduced a national abortion ban and made clear they are coming after the rights of my constituents and they are coming after the rights of people across the country.“This atrocious bill threatens the people of Kansas—who just voted overwhelmingly to protect abortion rights, the hundreds of thousands of people in Michigan who just signed a petition for a referendum vote to protect abortion and states like mine which already have strong abortion protections on the books. “Up to now, Republicans have tried to play down their abortion extremism.“They’ve tried to run away from the consequences of their extreme agenda— Even as patients have been denied prescriptions they need. Even as doctors have been forced to wait until patients’ lives are in danger before they can take action. Even as the health care crises they have caused spill across state lines to disastrous effect. But despite their empty rhetoric about ‘leaving it to the states’ the truth has been painfully clear—they think they know better than women when it comes to reproductive health care decisions.“They have shown again and again they don’t trust women to have full control over their own bodies, and they are willing to go after doctors. “They have blocked the most basic bills like Senator Cortez Masto’s bill making sure people can still travel to other states for legally available care and my bill making sure doctors in states where abortion is legal can’t be punished for doing their jobs. Over and over they have stood in the way of Democrats’ efforts to protect women’s abortion rights and it is crystal clear why. “This bill shows the true Republican position: “They want to ban abortion—for everyone. In every single state.“And they want to punish doctors. They want to put them in prison for doing their jobs. “So to anyone who lives in a blue state, like mine—anyone who thinks they are safe from these attacks here is the painful reality: Republicans are coming for your rights. “And you don’t have to take my word for it: the Senator from South Carolina said yesterday, and I quote, “If we take back the House and the Senate—I can assure you we will have a vote on our bill.”“There it is. Couldn’t be clearer. “This is the MAGA agenda. For all fifty states rights stripped away and doctors in prison. “Regardless of your circumstances regardless of what’s best for your health regardless of your family plans—of your hopes, fears, or dreams for your future. Republicans want to control your most decisions.“They don’t trust you to have full control over your own body.“It’s just horrifying. “And M. President—when he unveiled this bill yesterday, the Senator from South Carolina also said, and I quote: “I’ll make a prediction: we stay on this and we keep talking about it, maybe less than a decade from now, this will be law.”“This is the future they want—a national abortion ban.“Well let me tell you something—the Senator from South Carolina may not have been paying attention—but Democrats are already talking about this issue every week, every day, every opportunity. And women across the country have been with us: fighting for the right to abortion and fighting back against Republicans’ harmful attacks. “We saw it in Kansas, we are seeing it in Michigan, and I am seeing it everywhere I go in Washington state.“I have been talking to doctors, patients, and women and men across the country. “And they are outraged—outraged—that Republicans want to take away their rights, that Republicans want to put their doctors in prison. “And I am too. I’ve never been madder. “So here’s my message to Republicans:“If you want to go after my constituents’ rights, if you want to go after women’s bodies and futures, if you want to pass a national abortion ban, like this extreme bill, you are going to have to go through me. “Because Democrats are going to keep standing up for women and men across the country who do not want their rights taken away.” ###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

And we paid for it all while reducing the deficit by ensuring the largest corporations simply pay their fair share in taxes like the rest of us.“I’m so proud to have helped get this legislation passed and signed into law by President Biden—because the Inflation Reduction Act means lower health care costs for families, and more money back in their pockets. It means lower prescription drug costs for patients because we capped seniors insulin costs and out of pocket drug costs, and finally gave Medicare the power to force big drug makers to the negotiating table. It means good-paying jobs that’ll help build a stronger clean energy economy—and it also means lower energy costs for consumers. This law is a game changer for working families, our economy, and the environment—and I’m going to keep pushing to build on this historic progress.”The Inflation Reduction Act lowers prescription drug and health care costs and delivers the largest-ever investment in climate action—lowering energy costs, promoting energy independence, and creating good-paying jobs. It is fully paid for by ensuring the very wealthiest and giant corporations simply pay their fair share and would actually reduce the deficit by more than $300 billion.More on the Inflation ReductionActand what it means for Washington stateHERE.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/murray-leads-29-senators-in-urging-biden-admin-to-strengthen-privacy-protections-for-women-seeking-reproductive-health-care/,"As Republicans pass abortion bans and states investigate and punish women for seeking reproductive care, Murray leads senators in calling for HHS to take immediate action to protect women’s privacy under HIPAA(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), led 29 of her colleagues in calling on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to take immediate action to safeguard women’s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially get the health care they need. Specifically, the Senators urged the Biden Administration to strengthen federal privacy protections under the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to broadly restrict providers from sharing patients’ reproductive health information without their explicit consent—particularly with law enforcement or in legal proceedings over accessing abortion care. The push from the Senators comes as legislators and prosecutors across the country have sought to enforce Republicans’ abortion bans by investigating women and doctors for seeking and providing abortion care.“Our nation faces a crisis in access to reproductive health services, and some states have already begun to investigate and punish women seeking abortion care. It is critical that HHS take all available action to fully protect women’s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially seek medical care,” wrote the Senators.In their letter to Secretary Xavier Becerra, the Senators urge HHS to take immediate action to strengthen federal privacy protections under HIPAA, bolster enforcement of the protections, educate providers about their obligations, and ensure patients understand their rights. In June, in the wake of the Dobbs decision, Becerra pledged to work to protect patient and provider privacy.“To safeguard the privacy of women’s personal health care decisions and ensure patients feel safe seeking medical care, including reproductive health care, we urge you to quickly initiate the rulemaking process to strengthen privacy protections for reproductive health information,” urged the Senators. “In particular, HHS should update the HIPAA Privacy Rule to broadly restrict regulated entities  from sharing individuals’ reproductive health information without explicit consent, particularly for law enforcement, civil, or criminal proceedings premised on the provision of abortion care.”Since the Dobbs decision, the new patchwork of state abortion bans has caused widespread confusion among health care providers over whether they are required to turn over patients’ health information to state and local law enforcement. This confusion fundamentally threatens women’s health, as patients may delay or avoid seeking the care they need out of fear their sensitive health information could be weaponized against them. In recent weeks, states have investigated and sought to punish patients and providers for seeking and providing abortion care.Joining Senator Murray in sending the letter were Senators Baldwin (D-WI), Blumenthal (D-CT), Booker (D-NJ), Brown (D-OH), Cantwell (D-WA), Casey (D-PA), Duckworth (D-IL), Durbin (D-IL), Gillibrand (D-NY), Heinrich (D-NM), Hickenlooper (D-CO), Hirono (D-HI), Kaine (D-VA), Klobuchar (D-MN), Luján (D-NM), Markey (D-MA), Menendez (D-NJ), Merkley (D-OR), Padilla (D-CA), Reed (D-RI), Rosen (D-NV), Sanders (I-VT), Shaheen (D-NH), Smith (D-MN), Stabenow (D-MI), Van Hollen (D-MD), Warner (D-VA), Warren (D-MA), and Wyden (D-OR).The Senators’ full letter is available HERE and below:The Honorable Xavier BecerraSecretaryU.S. Department of Health and Human Services200 Independence Avenue, S.W.Washington, D.C. 20201Dear Secretary Becerra:Since the Supreme Court’s decision to strip away the constitutional right to abortion, patients across the country have lost access to reproductive health care, and providers have scrambled to adapt to the immense confusion, fear, and upheaval this ruling has caused. In some states, legislators and prosecutors have already sought to investigate and punish women seeking abortion care. To protect patients, and their providers, from having their health information weaponized against them, we urge you to take immediate action to strengthen education on and enforcement of federal health privacy protections, and to initiate the rulemaking process to augment privacy protections under Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations.Every day, health care personnel across this nation care for patients who are pregnant or may become pregnant. This care may include anything from an annual check-up to obstetrical visits to emergency care. In order for patients to feel comfortable seeking care, and for health care personnel to provide this care, patients and providers must know that their personal health information, including information about their medical decisions, will be protected. Recognizing this critical need, in 1996, Congress passed HIPAA, which directed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to issue privacy regulations for personal health information. HHS issued corresponding privacy regulations (the “HIPAA Privacy Rule”) in 2000, with several subsequent updates over the years.The Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision has caused widespread confusion among health care providers on health privacy protections, and whether they are required to turn over health information to state and local law enforcement. Stakeholders have told us about providers who have felt uncertain about whether they must turn over personal health information to state and law enforcement officials, including cases where providers believed they had to turn over information when doing so is only permitted—but not required—under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. In other cases, providers did not know that certain disclosures are actually impermissible. Stakeholders have even described clashes between providers and health care system administrators on whether certain information must be shared. Many of these issues seem to arise from misunderstandings of what the HIPAA Privacy Rule requires of regulated entities and their employees.This confusion is likely to grow as state lawmakers continue to implement a patchwork of laws restricting access to abortion and other reproductive health care services. Already, some states have laws in effect criminalizing abortion providers, and some states have enacted laws that penalize anyone who “aids or abets” an abortion, potentially exposing everyone from a referring provider to a receptionist to legal liability.[1] Some state legislators have even proposed to bar women from traveling to another state for abortion care.[2] And even before Dobbs, states had already prosecuted women following their abortions or miscarriages.[3] In many cases, these laws have been used to disproportionately criminalize or surveil women of color for their pregnancy loss.[4]Actions to prohibit abortion access and undermine health privacy are likely to have devastating consequences for women’s health. Out of concern that their reproductive health information may be used against them, women may delay or avoid disclosing a pregnancy or obtaining prenatal care. They may fear initiating treatments for conditions like cancer or arthritis, where treatment could impact a pregnancy, even as health care providers may hesitate to provide them. And women who experience complications from a pregnancy or abortion may avoid seeking desperately needed emergency care, risking devastating health consequences and even death. These concerns are not without justification – in recent years, numerous medical providers have reported women to law enforcement for seeking care following an abortion, a miscarriage, or other pregnancy-related medical issue.[5]HHS has the tools to protect patients and health care providers, even in the wake of this devastating decision. For over twenty years, the HIPAA Privacy Rule has protected the privacy of individuals’ health information, laying out when health information may or may not be shared without a patient’s explicit consent. In addition, the HIPAA Privacy Rule has long recognized that stronger protections may be needed for particularly sensitive health information, such as psychotherapy notes. We commend you for the actions the Department has already taken to clarify privacy protections in the wake of the Dobbs decision, including the issuance of additional guidance on the HIPAA Privacy Rule.[6] However, given the growing likelihood that women’s personal health information may be used against them, HHS must also take proactive steps to strengthen patient privacy protections.To safeguard the privacy of women’s personal health care decisions and ensure patients feel safe seeking medical care, including reproductive health care, we urge you to quickly initiate the rulemaking process to strengthen privacy protections for reproductive health information. In particular, HHS should update the HIPAA Privacy Rule to broadly restrict regulated entities from sharing individuals’ reproductive health information without explicit consent, particularly for law enforcement, civil, or criminal proceedings premised on the provision of abortion care.In addition, while HHS moves forward with the rulemaking process, the Department should take the following steps to improve awareness and enforcement of current privacy protections in the HIPAA Privacy Rule:Our nation faces a crisis in access to reproductive health services, and some states have already begun to investigate and punish women seeking abortion care. It is critical that HHS take all available action to fully protect women’s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially seek medical care.

Judge Mendoza will be the first Latino from Washington state to serve on the Ninth Circuit  bench.Senator Murray recommended Judge Mendoza to the Biden-Harris administration following Judge Margaret McKeown’s announcement that she would take senior status. Judge Mendoza is the 6th federal judge from Washington state confirmed to a lifetime appointment during this Congress, all of whom were recommended by Senator Murray.  “Judge Mendoza has been a trailblazer, focused on building a more fair and just legal system that works for everyone—not just the wealthy and well-off,” said Senator Murray. “In his time on the bench in the Eastern District [of Washington], he has presided over nearly 1,500 cases—including appellate cases—where he treated every party who came before him with fairness and respect.“Beyond just his impeccable professional qualifications, Judge Mendoza will bring an important perspective to one of the most consequential appellate courts in this country: the perspective of someone whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico and worked as farm laborers, maids, and factory workers to build a better life for their family,” continued Senator Murray. “I have no doubt—and based on his record I think there can be no doubt—that serving on the Ninth Circuit, Judge Mendoza will carefully review each case as an appellate judge, respect every party that appears before him, and protect the rights of the American people.”Judge Salvador Mendoza, Jr. has served as a U.S. District Court Judge for the Eastern District of Washington since 2014—he was confirmed by the full Senate for this role by a bipartisan vote of 92-4. Judge Mendoza previously served as a Washington State Superior Court Judge from 2013 to 2014. From 1999 to 2013, Judge Mendoza was a solo practitioner, then president, of a small law firm in Eastern Washington, and he also served as a judge pro tempore on various local courts. From 1998 to 1999, Judge Mendoza served as a Deputy Prosecuting Attorney for the Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office, and from 1997 to 1998, he was an Assistant Attorney General in the Office of the Washington State Attorney General. Judge Mendoza’s parents immigrated to the United States from Mexico working as farm laborers, maids, and factory workers to build a better life for their family—and as a child, Judge Mendoza worked as a migrant farmworker. He went on to receive his B.A. from the University of Washington in 1994, and his J.D. from the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law in 1997. Judge Mendoza will be the first Latino from Washington state to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court bench.Senator Murray has been a vocal supporter of the confirmation of highly qualified judicial candidates who represent the diverse communities in Washington state and across the country, with a special emphasis on increasing professional diversity on the federal court. Most recently, Senator Murray secured the confirmations of Tana Lin, Washington state’s first ever Asian American federal judge and a former public defender and civil rights lawyer; Lauren King, a tribal law expert who is serving as Washington state’s first ever Native American federal judge; John Chun, who will be the first Asian American man to serve as a federal judge in Washington state; David Estudillo, the son of Mexican immigrants and a former immigration attorney; and Kit Dimke who is serving in the Eastern District of Washington from the Spokane Courthouse.She is also pushing for the confirmation of Tiffany Cartwright, a leading civil rights lawyer who advanced out of the Senate Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support, as well as three nominees who have yet to receive a hearing: Jamal Whitehead, the Biden Administration’s first nominee with a disability to the federal bench, and Kymberly Evanson to the Western District of Washington, and Charnelle Bjelkengren, who is nominated to fill Judge Mendoza’s seat and would become the first Black woman to sit on the Eastern District of Washington.See below for a statement submitted for the Congressional Record by Senator Murray:“I rise today in support of the nomination of Judge Salvador Mendoza, from my home state of Washington, to serve on the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.“I was honored to recommend Judge Mendoza for this seat to President Biden, and to introduce him before the Senate Judiciary Committee in May. “I was thrilled to see him advance out of the Committee in a bipartisan vote and I couldn’t be happier to support him today and to strongly urge all my colleagues to join me in voting for his confirmation to the bench.“Judge Mendoza is a lifelong Washington state resident, and a tremendously qualified candidate to join the Ninth Circuit Court. He has served as a district court judge for the Eastern District of Washington since 2014, when he was confirmed by the Senate with an overwhelming, bipartisan majority of 92-4.“In his time on the bench in the Eastern District, he has presided over nearly 1,500 cases—including appellate cases—where he treated every party who came before him with fairness and respect.“And before that, he served Washington state as a Superior Court Judge.“He also has experience as a prosecutor, in the state Attorney General’s office, and as a solo practitioner—where he often represented defendants who could not afford their own attorneys.“He also worked to establish the first Drug Court in Benton and Franklin counties along with prosecutors, defense attorneys, mental health professionals, and other judges.“From representing those without means, to establishing drug courts, to serving with distinction on the Eastern District Court, Judge Mendoza has been a trailblazer, focused on building a more fair and just legal system that works for everyone—not just the wealthy and well-off.“Judge Mendoza’s many years of public service and even-handed application of the law have earned him not only the support of people across the state of Washington, but also the respect of both Democrats and Republicans.“It’s why my bipartisan judicial merit selection committee—which includes top Republican lawyers—recommended him to serve in his current District Court judgeship eight years ago, and why he was confirmed to that judgeship in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote.“And that should be no different today.“Beyond just his impeccable professional qualifications, Judge Mendoza will bring an important perspective to one of the most consequential appellate courts in this country: the perspective of someone whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico and worked as farm laborers, maids, and factory workers to build a better life for their family.“The perspective of someone who, as a child, worked beside them on farms in the Yakima Valley.‘The perspective of someone who was the first Latino federal judge in the Eastern District of Washington and who would break new ground once again as the first Latino from Washington state to serve on the Ninth Circuit.“Confirming Judge Mendoza will bring us even closer to building a federal bench that reflects the diversity of the people it serves.“That’s especially important to me, and to the many people across the country who don’t currently see themselves represented on our nation’s courts.“I have no doubt—and based on his record I think there can be no doubt that serving on the Ninth Circuit, Judge Mendoza will carefully review each case as an appellate judge, respect every party that appears before him, and protect the rights of the American people.“I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting his confirmation.“Thank you.”###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/senator-murrays-statement-on-the-anniversary-of-9-11-3/,"(Washington, DC) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) issued the following statement on the 21st anniversary of the attacks on 9/11.“Today, we remember the innocent lives that were taken from us during the devastating attacks on September 11—and we pause to honor the heroism of every first responder, servicemember, and American who stepped up in the face of unthinkable tragedy.“As we continue to mourn the loved ones we lost, we also draw inspiration from the countless individual acts of heroism, kindness, and solidarity we saw that day which exemplify the very best of our country. May we never forget the powerful example set by everyone who saved lives and was a light on that dark day—or what’s possible when we come together as Americans.”In 2019, Senator Murray voted to reauthorize the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund for the next 73 years, which provides financial support to help pay the health care bills for first responders and survivors of the attack on 9/11. Earlier this year, Senator Murray helped pass the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act (PACT Act) as a senior member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee. The PACT Act expands Post-9/11 combat veterans’, including those suffering from conditions caused by toxic exposures, access to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

This grant follows Senator Murray’s letter of support to the U.S. Department of Transportation for the Salmon Bay Bridge grant application in July 2022.“The Salmon Bay Bridge is absolutely critical to Washington state. Every single day, our residents and economy depend on the Salmon Bay Bridge being safe and reliable—that’s why I fought for critical funding for this project,” said Senator Murray.“This new drawbridge system for the Salmon Bay Bridge will help commuters, trains, maritime traffic, and goods get where they need to go—and help our economy and communities thrive. This is a huge deal for Washington state, and I’ll keep pushing in the Senate and on the Appropriations Committee to bring federal funding back home for critical projects like the Salmon Bay Bridge,” continued Senator Murray.Senator Murray has spent her career fighting to improve Washington state’s infrastructure. She was a key negotiator on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) that passed last year and included $8 billion for INFRA grants and doubled the funding available for the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) program. Senator Murray originally created the RAISE program (previously known as TIGER and BUILD) in 2009 and has been a longtime supporter of the program, most recently helping secure $7.5 billion for the RAISE program. The program is funded specifically via the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, which Senator Murray is a senior member of. Last month, Senator Murray announced nearly $100 million in RAISE grant funding for Washington state—the most that Washington state has ever received. She also led the fight to secure funding via the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) for culverts to boost salmon recovery efforts in Washington state, funding for ferries, and bridge repair.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/murray-hirono-warren-duckworth-applaud-landmark-abortion-access-measure-for-veterans-amid-republican-attacks/,"Following SCOTUS’ disastrous Dobbs decision, roughly half of women veterans in the U.S. live in states that have or are likely to ban abortionIn July, Hirono & Warren led Murray, Duckworth, colleagues in calling on VA to begin offering abortion services***VIDEO OF THE SENATORS’ PRESS CONFERENCE IS AVAILABLE HERE***(Washington, D.C.) — Today, U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), condemned Republican attacks on the Biden Administration’s landmark decision last week to allow the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to provide abortion care to veterans and their eligible dependents to protect the health and life of the woman and in cases of rape or incest. The action comes after Senators Hirono and Warren led Senators Murray, Duckworth and 21 Democratic colleagues in urging the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to immediately begin providing abortion services for veterans and eligible dependents following the far-right Supreme Court’s disastrous Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade.Because of the Dobbs decision, over 800,000—or half of women veterans in this country—live in states that are certain or likely to ban abortions. Prior to last week’s announcement, VA was prohibited from providing any abortion care or abortion counseling. Despite the landmark step forward to protect women’s health, Republicans have stated they will seek to block the VA’s efforts to provide abortion care in medical emergencies or case of rape or incest. Republicans in Congress have made clear they are “working to put a stop to” the policy announced by the Biden Administration, and Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall has even vowed to enforce his state’s abortion ban against VA doctors providing care in accordance with the new rule.“Last week, when the Biden Administration announced that for the first time ever VA will be able to provide abortion care to ensure none of our veterans or their eligible dependents will have to face medical emergencies, or stay pregnant after a rape or incest, I was excited to see meaningful progress to protect the right to abortion,” said Senator Murray. “And I was enraged to see yet another cruel, extreme reaction from anti-abortion Republicans who quickly made clear they want to block this proposal and take this care away from our veterans. It should be shocking to all of us that Republicans would put their own political ideology ahead of the wellbeing of our veterans—those who served our country in uniform and who put their lives on the line to keep us safe.”“Following the Supreme Court’s disastrous ruling overturning the right to an abortion, nearly half of female veterans in this country live in states that are certain or likely to ban abortion, which is why we led our colleagues in calling on the VA to provide abortion services to the veterans it serves. We’re glad to see the VA quickly heeding our calls to begin offering abortion services in instances of rape, incest, and the life of a mother. This decision is an important step—one that will save lives,” said Senator Hirono. “But instead of applauding the VA, Republicans are falsely claiming that this ruling is ‘contrary to long-standing, settled law.’ They are using fear and confusion to sow chaos and deprive women of their fundamental rights, instead of standing up for the veterans who have served our country. It’s shameful—and we’ll keep fighting back every day.”“As Republican politicians strip away abortion rights, I’m glad that the Biden admin and the VA are taking critical steps to protect veterans’ rights to an abortion,” said Senator Warren. “I’m going to keep working with my colleagues to ensure the VA has the tools it needs to protect abortion care for all veterans.” “I applaud Secretary McDonough’s leadership to help make sure that our Veterans have full access to the healthcare they need—including abortions. This decision could both save lives and enhance military recruitment and readiness,” said Senator Duckworth. “Our Veterans—who often have higher rates of chronic health conditions—have sacrificed the unimaginable for our nation and the last thing they should worry about is that our country will abandon them, risk their health and deny their fundamental rights. Just as we owe our Veterans the right to pursue having a family however they choose, we owe the heroes who risked everything overseas access to medically necessary care back at home—and for some Veterans, that includes abortions—and I’ll keep working to make sure this right is protected for all Americans.”The lawmakers were joined by Allison Jaslow, an Iraq War veteran and co-founder of Operation Liberty, a veteran-led, non-partisan effort to protect the reproductive freedom of U.S. servicemembers and veterans after the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe.“Thanks to action from the Administration, women veterans in states like Texas, Oklahoma, and Alabama—whether they were a patient of the VA before now or not—will now have somewhere to turn to get the reproductive health care that they may need, have earned, and deserve,” said Jaslow. “It’s also heartening to see in the guidance that was issued last week, how much trust the VA is putting in patients who are seeking care, and the physicians they are getting that care from. This is a long-overdue policy change, but a necessary one in this moment of crisis. Make no mistake, this decision will save lives, and lawmakers who are vowing to fight to ensure that a total ban on abortion remains at the VA are misguided at best, and at worst, attacking veterans’ healthcare in an effort to advance a broader ideological agenda. Either way, it’s unacceptable.”“Veterans and their families have always faced unique barriers to abortion access. But  following the devastating Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, abortion care has become even more difficult for veterans across the country to access,” said Lindsay Church, Executive Director of Minority Veterans of America. “This reality disproportionately harms racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ people, and service members, veterans, and their families living in poverty. The Department of Veterans Affairs has taken critical measures to lift restrictions that once made it impossible to get access to abortion counseling and care through VA, in order to provide services in the cases of rape, incest, and threats to the life and health of the patient. While we support the Department’s efforts to expand care regardless of state law, VA can and must do more to protect a patient’s right to make decisions for their own bodies, no matter their circumstance. Veterans fought for rights they are now being denied and it’s on our policymakers to protect these rights swiftly and without delay.”###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Senator Murray’s process for recommending candidates for the federal bench has been lauded as a national model for senators to replicate—for its emphasis on diversity of professional experience and background.“A judiciary that serves all people fairly—not just the rich and powerful—and upholds the rule of law is at the bedrock of our democracy, and I am confident that Judge Bjelkengren will bring those values to the federal bench,” said Senator Murray. “Not only has Judge Bjelkengren demonstrated her commitment to fairness and impartiality on the Spokane County Superior Court and, previously, as an administrative law judge—she also served Washington state as an Assistant Attorney General in Spokane, where she worked on issues from child care to higher education. I look forward to seeing her continue to serve Eastern Washington as a judge on the District Court, and I’ll work hard to advance her nomination as quickly as possible to consideration by the full Senate.”Judge Charnelle Bjelkengren currently serves on the Spokane County Superior Court, and was the first Black female judge in Eastern Washington when she was appointed in 2019. Previously, Bjelkengren served as senior administrative law judge in the Spokane Valley Office of Administrative Hearings. In that role, she held hearings involving the Employment Security Department and the Department of Social and Health Services and oversaw a team of administrative law judges. Bjelkengren previously worked for the Washington State Attorney General’s Office in Spokane. As an assistant attorney general, she represented several state agencies, including the Department of Social and Health Services, Department of Licensing, and Employment Security Department. While at the Attorney General’s office, she also worked on issues including childcare licensing, civil commitments, unemployment compensation, and higher education. She graduated from Minnesota State University and received her JD at Gonzaga University School of Law, located in Spokane, WA.Senator Murray has been a strong advocate for the confirmation of highly-qualified judicial nominees who reflect the diversity of communities in Washington state and America, pushing for greater professional diversity on the federal bench in particular. Since the start of this Congress, Senator Murray has secured the lifetime appointments of five highly qualified candidates as federal district court judges in Washington state.Most recently, Senator Murray secured the confirmations of Tana Lin, Washington state’s first ever Asian American federal judge and a former public defender and civil rights lawyer; Lauren King, a tribal law expert who is serving as Washington state’s first ever Native American federal judge; John Chun, who will be the first Asian American man to serve as a federal judge in Washington state; David Estudillo, the son of Mexican immigrants and a former immigration attorney; and Kit Dimke who is serving in the Eastern District of Washington from the Spokane Courthouse. Senator Murray is currently pushing to confirm Salvador Mendoza Jr. to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, whose seat in the Eastern District Judge Bjelkengren is nominated to fill and who, as a child, worked as a farmworker and is the son of Mexican immigrants who worked as farm laborers, maids, and factory workers; and Tiffany Cartwright, a leading civil rights lawyer, both of whom advanced out the Senate Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support, as well as Jamal Whitehead, the Biden Administration’s first nominee with a disability to the federal bench, and Kymberly Evanson to the Western District of Washington, who have yet to receive a hearing.### Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

I’m going to do absolutely everything I can in the other Washington get our Tribes and our fisheries the resources they need to support their communities and have productive, healthy harvests”(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced over $16 million in fishery disaster assistance funding for several Tribes in Washington to compensate for disasters over the past decade. This funding is provided through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as part of the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act. This is just the latest in Senator Murray’s long push to make Washington state’s salmon and the fishing industry major federal priorities.“Wild salmon populations in Washington state are declining on the whole and threatening our ecosystems and local economies—and its disproportionately harming Washington state Tribes,” said Senator Murray. “This funding will help our Tribes recover the losses they’ve experienced through no fault of their own. I’m going to do absolutely everything I can in the other Washington get our Tribes and our fisheries the resources they need to support their communities and have productive, healthy harvests. Healthy fisheries have to be an ongoing policy priority at every level of government, and I’m committed to doing my part in the Senate.”The Washington state fisheries, Tribes, and year of the disaster for which they are receiving this funding are:Senator Murray has consistently fought for consistent fisheries disaster funding. She helped secure $300 million for fisheries disaster funding as part of the CARES Act and an additional $255 million in the fiscal year 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act. That funding has been instrumental in fulfilling outstanding requests for disaster assistance like those announced today.Further, Senator Murray has successfully secured major investments that will benefit endangered and harvestable salmon species alike. In the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Senator Murray helped secure $220 million to create a new fish passage at the Howard Hanson dam that will be critical toward salmon recovery efforts in Washington state and the Pacific Northwest. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also delivered $1 billion for culvert removal, replacement, and restoration; $172 million for the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund (PCSRF); and $207 million for the Coastal Zone Management Program, among other habitat investments.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Prior to the announcement, VA was prohibited from providing any abortion care or abortion counseling.“Since the moment we first learned that the Supreme Court planned to rip away the right to abortion and overturn Roe, I have pushed the Biden Administration to do everything in their power to protect women’s rights and their health.

For the first time ever, the Veterans Health Administration will finally be able to provide abortion care to ensure none of our veterans or their eligible dependents will have to face medical emergencies—or stay pregnant after a rape or incest—simply because Republican politicians think they know what’s best for them.“It’s clear that despite Republicans’ hollow claims they don’t want to endanger women’s lives or health, their actions and their abortion bans have again and again put women at risk—and it’s Democrats who are pushing to protect women’s health. This action by the Biden Administration will make a real difference to veterans and their families—it’s a common-sense policy that will quite literally save lives. But we cannot stop here: I’ll keep fighting for abortion rights until everyone has full control over their own bodies, lives, and futures.”###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Seattle, which enacted its own rescue plan, was financed in part through flexible dollars to localities provided by the American Rescue Plan Act, which Senator Murray helped craft and pass in 2021.Senator Murray was joined by Alan Macleod, owner of MacLeod’s, Lois Ko, owner of Sweet Alchemy, Max Genereaux, owner of Hattie’s Hat, and Legh and Maggie Burns, owners of Re-SouL – all of whom received PPP loans thanks to the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan. Sweet Alchemy and Hattie’s Hat also received funds through the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. She was also joined by Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell, Markham McIntyre, Director of the City of Seattle Office of Economic Development, Mike Fong, SBA Pacific NW Region Administrator, Mike Stewart from the Ballard Alliance, which received funds through the American Rescue Plan, and Mike Tulee from United Indians of All Tribes and Sacred Circle.“Small businesses are the backbone of our local economy, so when the pandemic hit, I took swift action to help them keep their doors open and their employees on payroll,” said Senator Murray. “It was great to hear from so many small business owners right here in Seattle that the American Rescue Plan helped get through hard times. I will always be a strong voice for our small business owners in the U.S. Senate, and I absolutely plan to keep fighting for top priorities of mine to support Washington state workers and small businesses—like making child care affordable and accessible and finally passing a federal paid leave program.”Senator Murray has been a longtime champion for Washington state’s restaurants and small businesses, and has pushed for provisions to support business owners through the pandemic. Earlier this summer, Murray pushed for the Small Business COVID Relief Act of 2022¸a bipartisan bill to provide $48 billion to replenish the Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF) and provide relief to small businesses in other industries that have experienced significant declines in revenue, including gyms, minor league sports, buses and ferries, among others. Last year, Murray helped secure provisions from the RESTAURANTS Act, including more than $28 billion to create a Restaurant Revitalization Fund, and other small business relief in federal aid packages, including the American Rescue Plan. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Washington state businesses have received more than $9 billion in federal relief.Senator Murray has led the fight for key priorities that ensure small business can hire and retain workers—including quality affordable child care. A former preschool teacher, Senator Murray has led legislation and worked tirelessly to address the child care crisis, lower child care costs for working families, expand families’ child care options and support child care workers. Senator Murray is also a leader in pushing for a federal paid family and medical leave program, which would help put small businesses on an even playing field with larger companies.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

But the painful reality is that too many survivors still fight to be heard—or can’t access the care they need to heal and seek justice. When Leah Griffin first shared her story with me back in 2014—about facing sexual assault, but being told to ‘try somewhere else’ when she sought a sexual assault examination—I was furious, and I have worked non-stop since then to make progress on this and get survivors the support they deserve,” said Senator Murray. “I worked hard to finally reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, and I’m so proud that we not only improved it in key ways to support tribal communities, but also included key provisions from my Survivors’ Access to Supportive Care Act that I worked on with Leah. VAWA was a badly-needed and overdue step, but I won’t stop pushing until every survivor has access to justice and the care they need.”“We are proud the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization of 2022 continues to strengthen legislation refusing to leave any survivor behind,” said Norine Hill, Executive Director and Founder of Mother Nation. “Mother Nation will continue to work with our Indigenous Sisters to ensure that VAWA’s protections can be the reality for all our relatives” “Domestic violence survivors and their children are in dire need of safe housing, flexible financial assistance, and trauma-informed advocacy. What we’re hearing from domestic violence programs around the state is that crisis calls and requests for safe housing have increased 30%, 40%, and even 60%. One domestic violence program had to turn away 2,600 requests for emergency shelter,” said Judy Chen, Executive Director, Washington State Coalition Against Domestic Violence. “VAWA re-authorization takes important steps to fund housing stability and direct cash assistance for survivor households, so they can get safe and stabilize, protect their children, and start re-building their lives.”Senator Murray first introduced SASCA in 2016, after her constituent, Leah Griffin, shared her personal story of surviving a sexual assault and then getting turned away from a hospital when it was unable to administer a rape kit—ultimately contributing to prosecutors declining to file criminal charges. Since then, she has fought to pass the critical legislation, and ultimately succeeded in including key provisions of the bill in the recent March reauthorization of VAWA which will help develop national standards of care for survivors of sexual assault, strengthen the sexual assault examiner workforce, and expand access to sexual assault examination services.The reauthorization of VAWA also includes provisions that expand special criminal jurisdiction of Tribal courts to cover non-Native perpetrators of sexual assault, child abuse, stalking, and sex trafficking on tribal lands. The reauthorization also increases services and support for survivors from underserved and marginalized communities—including LGBTQIA+ survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking. VAWA also supports survivor-centered, community-based restorative practice services, including culturally specific services and services in rural communities.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

One domestic violence program had to turn away 2,600 requests for emergency shelter,” said Judy Chen, Executive Director, Washington State Coalition Against Domestic Violence. “VAWA re-authorization takes important steps to fund housing stability and direct cash assistance for survivor households, so they can get safe and stabilize, protect their children, and start re-building their lives.”Senator Murray first introduced SASCA in 2016, after her constituent, Leah Griffin, shared her personal story of surviving a sexual assault and then getting turned away from a hospital when it was unable to administer a rape kit—ultimately contributing to prosecutors declining to file criminal charges. Since then, she has fought to pass the critical legislation, and ultimately succeeded in including key provisions of the bill in the recent March reauthorization of VAWA which will help develop national standards of care for survivors of sexual assault, strengthen the sexual assault examiner workforce, and expand access to sexual assault examination services.The reauthorization of VAWA also includes provisions that expand special criminal jurisdiction of Tribal courts to cover non-Native perpetrators of sexual assault, child abuse, stalking, and sex trafficking on tribal lands. The reauthorization also increases services and support for survivors from underserved and marginalized communities—including LGBTQIA+ survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking. VAWA also supports survivor-centered, community-based restorative practice services, including culturally specific services and services in rural communities.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Maritime High opened in September 2021 as a collaborative project of Highline Public Schools, Northwest Maritime Center, Port of Seattle, and the Duwamish River Community Coalition, with the goal of preparing students for well-paid, meaningful, and lasting careers.Senator Murray was joined by Dr. Ivan Duran, Superintendent of Highline Public Schools; Tremain Holloway, Principal of Maritime High School; Ryan Calkins, Seattle Port Commissioner; Jake Beatty, Executive Director of Northwest Maritime Center; Paulina Lopez, Executive Director of the Duwamish River Community Coalition; and Linda Farnsworth, Maritime High School PTA President.“As our kids return to the classroom this fall, I’m working hard to ensure our schools and educators have the resources and support they need. I’m proud to have led the charge in delivering critical resources to schools via the American Rescue Plan, and passing the largest increase in federal K-12 funding for public schools in over a decade—and I’m continuing to stay laser-focused on ensuring we get our kids back on track, support their mental and emotional health, and make sure every single student in our state can get a quality, public education,” said Senator Murray. “When we invest in our schools and students, we invest in our future—and programs like the ones here at Maritime High School play a huge part in making that a reality.”“Maritime High School is a great example of how we can create innovative options for students through partnerships with business and other organizations in our community,” said Superintendent Ivan Duran. “Maritime High School provides hands-on, career-focused learning for students who will become the workforce fueling our maritime-focused local economy into the future.”As Chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (LHHS), Senator Murray has long fought to ensure every student gets a quality public education, recently securing a $1 billion increase for the primary source of federal funding for public K-12 schools—the largest increase in more than a decade. She also secured $433 million in new funding—totaling $14.2 billion overall—for special education state grant programs, which support nearly 7.7 million students and children with disabilities. Senator Murray is also a leader in expanding access to workforce development opportunities—securing an increase of $50 million for the Department of Labor’s Registered Apprenticeship Programs in the recent funding package, to expand apprenticeship opportunities, including youth apprenticeships, across Washington state and the entire country.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Salmon recovery has to be an ongoing policy priority at every level of government, and I’m committed to doing my part.”***PHOTOS AND B-ROLL OF THE EVENT HERE******AUDIO OF THE EVENT HERE*** (Seattle, WA) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), joined U.S. Rep. Kim Schrier (D-WA-08), as well as local and Tribal leaders for a press conference at the Howard Hanson Dam to highlight major recent investments secured by Murray and Schrier for the dam and salmon recovery efforts. During the event, Senator Murray underscored the critical role of salmon in Washington state’s economy and ecosystems, and stressed the need to ensure fish passages like the Howard Hanson Dam have the federal resources needed to strengthen salmon recovery.Senator Murray was joined by representatives from the US Army Corps of Engineers, Tacoma Public Utilities, Tacoma Water, City of Tacoma, the Muckleshoot Tribe, Lakehaven Water and Sewer District, Covington Water District, the City of Kent, Green/Duwamish & Central Puget Sound Watershed, Puget Sound Partnerships, and Pierce County.The event included remarks by Colonel Alexander Bullock, Commander of the US Army Corps of Engineers; Jaime Pinkham, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works; Jackie Flowers, Director & CEO of Tacoma Public Utilities; and Jaison Elkins, Chairman of the Muckleshoot Tribe as well as other members of the Muckleshoot Tribe.“I don’t need to tell everyone here just how many challenges are facing our salmon—this is something we need to tackle from every angle,” said Senator Murray. “Wild salmon populations in Washington state are declining on the whole—threatening our ecosystems and local economies, not to mention our way of life especially for our Tribes. I’m going to do absolutely everything I can in the other Washington to save our salmon – and the funding to build this infrastructure at the Howard Hanson Dam is going to play a huge role in recovering local salmon runs. Salmon recovery has to be an ongoing policy priority at every level of government, and I’m committed to doing my part.” “I am thrilled to have helped secure a whopping $220M in infrastructure funding for the downstream fish passage project at Howard Hanson Dam,” said Rep. Schrier. “I worked with stakeholders across the 8th district to ensure this critical project was included in funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This stands to do more for Chinook salmon populations than any other project to date. And that is something Washingtonians care deeply about.”“Tacoma Public Utilities celebrates the federal government’s initial investment into our region’s environmental future,” Jackie Flowers, Director & CEO of Tacoma Public Utilities. “While more funding will be needed to get the project across the finish line, the broad regional support we see here at the Howard Hanson dam today underlines the project’s critical importance to salmon and orca recovery, all while benefitting Tacoma Water customers.” Senator Murray helped secure $220 million to create a new fish passage at the dam that will be critical toward salmon recovery efforts in Washington state and the Pacific Northwest thanks to funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Senator Murray has been a consistent and forceful advocate for the Howard Hanson Dam and its related salmon recovery projects, pressing the Army Corp to prioritize funding for Howard Hanson for years, imparting the importance of the dam to the Biden Administration when the President first took office. Back in 2010, she secured $44 million in badly-needed emergency funds for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to repair the Howard Hanson Dam and keep Green River Valley communities safe from flooding.Investing in salmon recovery was a major priority for Senator Murray when negotiating the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which delivered $1 billion for culvert removal, replacement, and restoration; $172 million for the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund (PCSRF); and $207 million for the Coastal Zone Management Program, among other habitat investments.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Now, here in Everett and its surrounding communities, they won’t have to.”***PHOTOS OF THE EVENT HERE******VIDEO OF THE EVENT HERE***(Everett, WA) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, helped mark the opening of a new veterans clinic in Everett. The clinic offers a host of services including primary care, some specialty care, laboratory services, behavioral health, clinical pharmacy, radiology, and telemedicine. The clinic will be a game-changer for local veterans who will no longer have to travel miles out of their way to receive the VA care they need.“I’m proud to sit on the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, so I can help make sure VA has the resources it needs to get our veterans the best possible care and to open new clinics like this one that will make a real difference in the lives of so many,” said Senator Murray. “I’ve always believed no one should have to drive hours out of their way or jump through hoops to get the health care they need—but especially not veterans seeking the care they earned. Now, here in Everett and its surrounding communities, they won’t have to.”“When my dad got sick—the VA was really able to help us out,” continued Senator Murray. “It was essential to making sure my dad could get the care he needed, and my family was able to make ends meet. That’s how the VA system is supposed to work, and I’ll keep doing everything I can on the Senate Veterans’ Committee to make that a reality for other families today as well.”The daughter of a World War II veteran, Senator Murray has been a longtime advocate of military servicemembers, veterans, and their families. Earlier this month, Senator Murray helped to pass the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act (PACT Act) into law. The PACT Act would, among other things, expand the toxic-exposure coverage for post-9/11 veterans and create a framework for coverage going forward. In May, she introduced the Helping Heroes Act, new legislation to support the families of disabled veterans, including children who take on caregiving roles. Senator Murray is also a cosponsor of the BUILD for Veterans Act, which would help the VA build new facilities that would better meet the needs of current and future veterans – including women veterans, veterans in need of long-term care, and veterans with spinal cord injuries and diseases.Senator Murray also worked hard to include billions of dollars in relief for veterans national assistance programs in the American Rescue Plan including $14.5 billion for health care services, $400 million for rapid retraining assistance, and $500 million to help states upgrade State Veterans Homes across the country and $250 million in one-time emergency grants to support these facilities and ensure they can care for our veterans during the pandemic.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Key infrastructure and energy investments must be in place before we can seriously consider breach. Still, specific salmon runs are struggling, and breach is an important option that could help save the salmon—and we cannot under any circumstances allow the extinction of salmon to come to pass. “Therefore, it’s critical that Tribal, local, state, and federal entities immediately pursue interventions and implement policies that will protect salmon populations. In the coming years, local, state, and federal partners must work together to invest in the communities and industries that rely upon the dams—the onus should not be on the Tribes who have borne the brunt of salmon declines as a result of the dams being built.“Furthermore, it should not be lost on anyone that breach would ultimately require Congressional authorization and strong bipartisan support—for that to become a credible option, the benefits of the dams must be sustained or mitigated.“Sustaining or replacing the benefits of the dams will require several urgent undertakings: we need to do a lot more to transition to clean and renewable energy sources, we have to invest in the region’s infrastructure to lower the cost of shipping goods to market, and we have to invest in water infrastructure and irrigation to support our producers in the face of a worsening climate crisis. “The passage of recent landmark federal investments in clean energy, climate, and infrastructure will help accelerate this work—but this will require collaboration at every level of government and the administration’s support. Finally, justice for the Tribes of the Pacific Northwest must be at the forefront of the environmental and economic agenda as we work toward salmon recovery—this will require an ongoing commitment and consistent consultation as regional investments are made. “I want to thank the independent consultant team who put tremendous work into this process and the final report they released. As we work toward a shared regional goal to save our salmon—I look forward to partnering closely with Democrats and Republicans, with all stakeholders from every community, and with Tribes from across the Pacific Northwest.”Governor Inslee’s statement on the joint Federal-State Process can be found HERE.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

That’s why I am continuing to push for action”(Kittitas County, WA) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) hosted a roundtable at Kittitas County Fire Station #73 with local firefighters and Kittitas and Yakima County officials on her work to bolster wildfire mitigation and prevention. During the event, Senator Murray underscored steps she’s taken thus far to prevent wildfires and she spoke directly with local officials and first responders on the ground about what needs to be done to protect Washington state communities and better support their efforts. Kittitas County has topped 100 degrees throughout the summer, highlighting the need for wildfire prevention and mitigation. Senator Murray was joined by John Sinclair, Fire Chief of Kittitas Valley Fire and Rescue and Emergency Manager for the City of Ellensburg; Tony Miller, Director ofEmergency Management of Yakima County; Nicole Parpat, Grant Coordinator and Grant Writer for Yakima County; and Savannah Herrera Davies, Kittitas County Firefighter.“Across the state, we’ve seen everything from devastating wildfires, to deadly heatwaves, to months-long droughts. That’s why I am continuing to push for action,” said Senator Murray. “The measures taken in the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are big steps, but we need to do more to ensure our federal wildfire prevention and response efforts are able to meet this moment and account for the severity of fire seasons we’re now facing.”“Climate change is happening. Forests are diseased, distressed, and mismanaged for decades,” said John Sinclair, Fire Chief of Kittitas Valley Fire and Rescue and Emergency Manager for the City of Ellensburg. “We need an integrated approach to this involving Federal, State and Local partners to mitigate the issues.  We need good fire on the ground in the spring and the fall, to consume the fuel, small diameter sawmills, in central Washington, grazing and other fuels mitigation such as biomass, bio-char, and logging.  If we do not, we will continue to wipe out communities and kill citizens.”“As a Grant Specialist, I obtain funding for emergency responders. The main mission of first responders is to protect life and property. This requires the necessary staffing and equipment to minimize the loss of life and property,” said Nicole Parpat, Grant Coordinate and Grant Writer for Yakima County. “Grant funding increases the quality and capacity of response and care to the whole community. Lack of grant funding increases the probability of equipment failure, increases the risk to responders and compromises community safety.”“With the wildfires increasing over the years, federal funding to help mitigate and respond to these fires is essential,” said Tony Miller, Director of Emergency Management of Yakima County. “The other issue that needs to be addressed is volunteer firefighters in the rural communities. These communities do not have the funds to staff full time firefighters. There needs to be incentives to help these communities increase their volunteer departments.”“In order for us to better protect key infrastructure and natural resources, we need to be more proactive instead of reactive when it comes to managing and reducing fuels especially in the Wildland Urban Interface,” said Savannah Herrera Davies, Kittitas County firefighter. “This starts with educating the public about what they can do to protect themselves and their properties from wildfire. As we know, fire knows no boundaries so we need to work more cohesively when it comes to federal, state, and privately owned lands. To achieve this common goal, we need to focus more funding into preventative measures.” The Inflation Reduction Act that Senator Murray helped pass earlier this month made historic investments in wildfire prevention, management, mitigation and recovery – including $5 billion in grants to support healthy, fire resilient forests, forest conservation, and drought and fire resilient agricultural practices.Last year, Senator Murray also played a key role in passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which provided funding for community wildfire defense grants, mechanical thinning, controlled burns, the Collaborative Forest Restoration Program, and other federal firefighting resources. She also has fought to pass legislation that created a budget for firefighting efforts separate from the rest of the National Forest Service’s budget (commonly referred to as the fire funding fix). Senator Murray and her colleagues in Western states have been pushing for increased firefighter pay and were able to secure salary increases for firefighters across the country in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.Senator Murray is a cosponsor of two bills to redesign and strengthen the federal government’s response to wildfires and provide additional resources to ensure equity for communities experiencing natural disasters. The FIRE Act would make several changes to the Stafford Act that governs FEMA—which was written when FEMA primarily focused on hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods—to ensure that FEMA’s disaster preparedness and response efforts fully address the unique nature of wildfires and their impacts on communities. This includes directing FEMA to pre-deploy assets during red flag warnings, improving relocation assistance for public infrastructure affected by fires, ensuring equity of assistance for tribal communities and tribal governments, and examining ways to speed up the FEMA assistance process.Throughout her career, Senator Murray has prioritized securing the necessary funding for the Yakima River Basin Project and Columbia River Basin Project, which would transform water management and drought resiliency capabilities for the entire region, making a significant difference as Washington state works to fend off worsening fires and manage more severe droughts.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Idaho’s total ban on abortions does not include exceptions when the health of the mother is at risk—and last night, a federal judge blocked enforcement of the law in medical emergencies after the Biden administration filed suit in the first post-Roe challenge to state abortion restrictions.“Today, women in Idaho join the one in three women across the country who are being denied access to abortion in their own state by Republican politicians who think they know what’s best for them.“Idaho’s cruel abortion ban denies women their most fundamental right to control their own bodies and chart their own futures. And while I’m relieved a federal court has blocked enforcement of the ban in medical emergencies, every single woman should have the right to make her own health care decisions.“In state after state, Republicans are forcing women to carry pregnancies to term, or drain their savings to travel and get care. They’re putting women’s health at risk and even threatening doctors with time in prison for protecting patients’ health. And with each new abortion ban taking effect, we’re seeing the health care crisis Republicans have caused worsen. I’ve talked to providers in eastern Washington who saw an influx of patients from across the border in Idaho once Roe fell—and that’s sure to rise as more women are forced to delay care and travel to get the services they need.“It’s truly shameful. We can’t—and I won’t—stop fighting to restore every American’s reproductive rights.”Idaho’s extreme abortion ban threatens providers with up to five years in prison for providing abortions in conflict with the state’s ban. Idaho’s separate, six-week abortion ban—which was modeled after Texas’ SB-8 law and allows family members to sue providers for a minimum of $20,000—went into effect last Friday. Tennessee’s near-total ban on abortion also takes effect today, as does Texas’ radical law putting providers who perform an abortion at risk of life in prison and a minimum $100,000 fine.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Senator Murray also discussed the provisions she secured to boost the budget of the Department of Energy’s Office of Science, which funds labs like PNNL and others across the state. The CHIPS and Science Act also invests in the National Science Foundation, which funds research and development across Washington state and the country to keep America on the cutting-edge of technology and innovation in the next generation. “Here’s the short and simple: leading the world in innovation also leads to good-paying jobs,” said Senator Murray. “The investments in research and the next generation of chip-making—that’s not just good news for PNNL—it’s GREAT news for the Port of Benton, for TRIDEC, and the entire region. As a voice for Washington state in the Senate, I’m going to keep working to make sure that research and innovation happens right here in the Tri-Cities.”“Thank you, Senator Murray, for being an unwavering advocate for the Tri-Cities and our region – and for your role in helping make this legislation a reality,” said Diahann Howard, Executive Director of the Port of Benton and the Tri-Cities Research District. “This is a prime example of your understanding of our community’s vision beyond Hanford as we further transition from cleanup to clean energy technologies and jobs.”“Senator Murray, thank you for your critical support for the Tri-Cities community. The Chips and Science Act is another example of your work to open new opportunities for the State of Washington and for our local economy,” said Karl Dye, President and CEO of TRIDEC. “Pacific Northwest National Lab is known globally as a leader in innovative applied materials science for research and development. Funding from this act will allow the lab to compete to increase efficiency in future chip designs.”“We must rethink our computing paradigm so we can use artificial intelligence to speed scientific discovery and technological innovation,” said Dr. Steven Ashby, Battelle Senior Vice President. “Battelle researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory are already working with partners, including Micron Technology, to address this challenge. They are collaborating on advanced memory chips and computer architectures for AI applications that will perform significantly better than is possible today.”The recently passed CHIPS and Science Act will enable the Department of Commerce to provide $39 billion in incentives via loans, loan guarantees and grants to chip manufacturers, as well as to companies that do not make chips (e.g., chip equipment and materials suppliers). The bill also provides a 25 percent investment tax credit for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and the construction of semiconductor manufacturing facilities. Additional funds can support local workforce development efforts.The CHIPS and Science Act also reauthorizes National Science Foundation’s Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program and doubles the budget for ATE from the current level of $75 million per year to $150 million per year. This program helps community and technical colleges improve and expand educational programs for technicians to work in high-tech STEM fields that drive the U.S. economy and secure good paying jobs in the Tri-Cities.The bill will allow small and medium sized microchip manufacturers to expand and hire more workers, get products on the shelves faster, and lower costs on consumer electronics. When it comes to national security, the CHIPS and Science Act will decrease our reliance on foreign supply chains and make American manufacturing more competitive on the world stage. Overall, the legislation will help drive major investments in research and innovation, like Micron’s investment at PNNL, that will happen directly in the Tri-Cities communities.  ###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Passing this legislation will save lives and I’ll be working hard to get this done as soon as possible.”***VIDEO OF THE EVENT HERE******PHOTOS OF THE ROUNDTABLE HERE***(Pasco, WA) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, announced new legislation that would expand access to benefits for more past and current Hanford workers that are exposed to beryllium but unable to access care due to outdated federal laws that place overly burdensome requirements around proof of illness on workers.Senator Murray held a roundtable meeting with Hanford workers and labor leaders at UA Local 598, where she was joined by Steve Maki, Worker Trainer Director at the Volpentest Hazardous Materials Management and Emergency Response (HAMMER) for Central Washington Building Trades; Jeff McDaniels, President of Hanford Atomic Metal Trades Council (HAMTC); Nickolas A. Bumpaous, President of the Central Washington Building and Construction Trades Council and the Business Manager for UA Local 598, Plumbers and Steamfitters; Steve Mauri, Worker Trainer Director at HAMMER for HAMTC; and AJ Fouts, Government Affairs Director for the Plumbers & Steamfitters UA Local 598.“The federal government has a legal and moral obligation to the Hanford workers who are doing incredible and important work at Hanford—it’s my job to make sure the administration is living up to that obligation, whether that’s securing federal dollars for the Hanford site or making sure Hanford workers are getting the benefits they have earned,” said Senator Murray. “My new bill will expand access to benefits for sick workers who are not getting the care they need because of a technicality—this is a wrong I am determined to make right. Passing this legislation will save lives and I’ll be working hard to get this done as soon as possible.”“Workplace exposure to toxic substances for workers is deeply personal to me. My personal experience with beryllium exposure, my background as an advocate and workforce representative, allows me to help minimize exposures for all workers,” said Calin Tebay, worker and health advocate. “This also allows me to help current and former workers, and their families, get access, education, and care they deserve. For nearly 12 years, I have worked with colleagues and medical professionals across the country with a shared goal of creating consistent, accurate, and up to date diagnosis criteria for Beryllium related Disease and Conditions. This would include updating the Department of Labor’s diagnosis criteria for Beryllium Sensitization to ensure workers exposed to this toxic metal, and are diagnosed with this condition, can and will receive care. I strongly support this legislation and appreciate Senator Murray for listening to and working with the Hanford workers, medical experts, and many others and taking on this important issue.” “Occupational exposure to beryllium is a serious threat to workers, including those involved in the production and cleanup of our nation’s nuclear weapons. Fortunately, these workers can receive medical care and benefits through the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act (EEOICPA). The BeLPT is a test that detects whether workers have developed beryllium sensitization, which puts them at risk for developing chronic beryllium disease (CBD), said Dr. Lee Newman, beryllium disease expert and Distinguished Professor, Director of the Center for Health, Work & Environment at the University of Colorado. “I strongly support Senator Murray’s legislation, which reflects our updated medical and scientific understanding that EEOICPA’s definition of BeLPT should be updated. CBD is a serious disease with no cure, but early detection can help slow its progression. This legislation will help workers receive the timely care they deserve.”“For years now, research studies conducted by National Jewish Health and others have shown that three borderline beryllium lymphocyte proliferation tests (BeLPTs) confirms a diagnosis of beryllium sensitization and indicates a risk for developing chronic beryllium disease,” said Dr. Lisa Maier, Chief of the Division of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences at National Jewish Health. “These individuals have been exposed to beryllium as they’ve worked to protect our nation’s security. We are extremely grateful that Senator Murray and others are working to forward this important legislation to help get appropriate care and compensation to those impacted workers.”For decades, beryllium was used to cap nuclear rods, including at the Hanford site. Beryllium is a heavy metal, exposure to which can cause “beryllium sensitization” or, in more advanced cases Chronic Beryllium Disease (CBD). CBD leads to scarring on the lungs causing many other respiratory problems, including an increased incidence of lung cancers. Currently, the Department of Labor’s Office of Workers Compensation Programs (OWCP) administers the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act (EEOICPA), through which Hanford workers dealing with issues stemming from their exposure to beryllium receive care and benefits. As the law is currently written, someone must present one abnormal blood test and evidence of a lung disease in order to receive benefits and care for their illness through the EEOICPA. Many workers or former workers, however, receive “borderline” test results for years while symptoms manifest or they never get the “abnormal” result at all. This legislation would amend the EEOICPA to count three “borderline” results as sufficient evidence to receive a diagnosis of beryllium sensitivity. This provision would apply to former, current, and future workers so no one would face unfair barriers to care.The bill would also extend the Department of Labor’s independent Advisory Board on Toxic Substances and Worker Health for five more years, through 2029. The Board is charged with advising the Secretary of Labor on matters relating to workplace safety for workers onsite with toxic substances and is instrumental in helping improve the federal compensation process for workers, including those at Hanford, to gain the health care and benefits they deserve. This legislation is supported by the Hanford Worker Engagement Center, National Jewish Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Colorado School of Public Health at the University of Colorado, and the Center for Health, Work & Environment, Colorado School of Public Health at the University of Colorado.Senator Murray has led the fight in Congress to secure funding for the cleanup at the Hanford, protect workers, and support the Tri-Cities communities. Earlier this summer, she secured an unprecedented increase in President Biden’s budget request for Hanford site cleanup, putting that request at $2.613 billion for FY2023. In the FY2022 government funding package, Senator Murray secured $2.595 billion for the Hanford site cleanup—notably, this was $128 million above the President’s Budget Request. As she negotiates funding for the fiscal 2023 budget, Senator Murray is fighting to build on the previous budget’s funding and the increased request by the President will be critical as she seeks to secure the strongest possible funding for the Hanford site cleanup. The President’s revised budget request came only after Murray’s strong urging and public exchanges with Secretary Granholm and OMB Budget Director Shalanda Young.In March 2021, Senator Murray reintroduced and is currently fighting to pass the Toxic Exposure Safety Act which would make it easier for workers at the Hanford site and other nuclear clean-up sites to receive the full benefits they’re entitled to when suffering from illnesses due to toxic exposure on the job.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

I hear from people in Washington state all the time about how student debt has been holding them back—preventing them from starting families, buying homes, and all too often, from simply making ends meet. That’s why, for months, I’ve been calling on President Biden to deliver relief for borrowers and families across the country. Finally, real relief is here.“This is a milestone moment for borrowers. Tonight, tens of millions of borrowers across the country who’ve been saddled with student debt can sleep easier knowing their balances will finally go down—and millions will see their debt wiped entirely. In Washington state alone, the President’s action will be life changing for hundreds of thousands of eligible borrowers whose debt will shrink—and so many whose balances will be completely canceled.This is huge. And I’m really glad former Pell Grant recipients will get additional relief—this is a big step forward to get relief to those who need it most and help address long-running racial and economic disparities in our student loan system.“These steps will lift stress off people’s shoulders, help borrowers make rent, provide for their families, and build for a better future—and will strengthen our entire economy.“Now, it will be important for the Department of Education and the Administration to deliver on this historic announcement by ensuring borrowers can easily access the relief they are due.“And make no mistake: we can’t stop here. I’m going to keep fighting to make college more affordable. And I continue to urge the Administration to permanently fix the broken student loan system that’s holding borrowers back. That’s what I’ve been pushing to get done for months—and I won’t stop fighting until it’s a reality.”Senator Murray has led the charge to make the student loan system work for students and families, ensure borrowers get the relief they are entitled to, and lower the cost of college. In 2020, she called for the federal government to forgive at least $10k in student debt.Since then, Senator Murray has pushed the Biden Administration to fix the broken student loans system and ensure borrowers get the relief they are owed. Earlier this year, Senator Murray called on the Biden Administration to permanently fix our broken student loan system and extend the student loan payment pause until at least 2023 to do so. Specifically, she called on the Administration to:###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

At the event, Senator Murray and Rep. Schrier also highlighted how the IRA will cap Medicare beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket prescription drugs costs at $2,000 a year, cap their insulin costs at $35 a month, and cap price increases on their prescriptions at the rate of inflation so that drug makers cannot jack up prices to pad their own profits—helping Washington state’s more than 1.4 million Medicare recipients save money on their prescriptions.As Chair of the Senate Health Committee, Senator Murray helped lead Senate Democrats in passing the Inflation Reduction Act’s prescription drug provisions, which was signed into law just last week. Rep. Schrier, who has type 1 diabetes and is one of the few doctors in Congress, has been leading the push in the House to cap insulin costs at $35 and had her bill to speed up getting generic insulin options on the market implemented by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) last year.“Skyrocketing drug costs have been hard on families across Washington, and across the country,” said Senator Murray. “Too many people have been facing impossible choices because of skyrocketing drug costs, like skipping meals or skipping their medication just to make ends meet—all while drug companies are jacking up prices and raking in massive profits. That’s why I fought tooth and nail to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, lower drug costs, and hold pharmaceutical companies accountable. This bill is going to be life changing—and lifesaving—for so many seniors and people with disabilities who rely on Medicare to get the care they need.”“Since I began in Congress, my constituents have been telling me that they need relief from rising health care and prescription drug costs. The Inflation Reduction Act, now law. is the answer to their concern,” said Rep. Schrier. “It will finally allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, cap out of pocket costs for seniors and cap insulin prices for seniors at $35 a month, and continue to cap health care premiums at 8.5% of a family’s income. First included in the American Rescue Plan and now in this law, this premium cap has cut premiums in half for the average 8th district family and has achieved record low numbers of people without insurance. At a time when families are feeling pinched by costs, this law will make a meaningful difference in their lives. ”“We are grateful for Sen. Murray and Rep. Schrier’s leadership to pass the Inflation Reduction Act,” said Dr. Elizabeth Wako, M.D., Chief Executive, Central Puget Sound, Providence Swedish. “Not only does it provide financial relief on prescription drug costs for our seniors, but it extends health insurance access for millions of Americans and includes the largest investment in climate action in our country’s history.”“I’m a relatively healthy senior but need expensive prescription drugs to treat my dry eye condition,” said Jackie Boschok, President, Washington State Alliance for Retired Americans. “I look forward to being one of the more than 29,000 Medicare Part D enrollees in Washington State alone, who experienced out-of-pocket prescription drug costs over $2,000 in 2021 that will now have those costs capped at $2,000 per year.”“AARP has spent decades calling on Congress to make prescription drugs more affordable, and we finally won the fight for Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices, thanks to the commitment of legislators like Senator Murray and Representative Schrier,” said Cathy MacCaul, Advocacy Director for the Washington state AARP. “We can’t overstate what a monumental improvement this prescription drug package will be for older Americans.”“The Inflation Reduction Act is a monumental piece of legislation that has major benefits for disadvantaged communities. We will see substantive action on climate change that lessens the burden on low-income BIPOC, immigrant, and refugee communities who are disproportionately impacted by this crisis,” said Michael Byun, Executive Director for Asian Counseling and Referral Services. “We also see positive changes for the health and wellbeing of Asians, and Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders with lower health care premiums and expansion of coverage so that everyone has access to high quality health care. These are just a couple of important examples to highlight in the Inflation Reduction Act and we thank Senator Murray and Congresswoman Schrier for their leadership in making this possible.”###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

During the event, Murray spoke with participants about the implementation of the “VOW to Hire Heroes Act,” her bipartisan, bicameral, comprehensive legislation signed into law by President Obama that has lowered the rate of unemployment among our nation’s veterans. Murray also spoke with roundtable participants about what more can be done to support Washington state servicemembers’ transition back into their communities.“For our veterans, coming home is a special time for their families and their communities, but it can also be stressful and daunting for them. The transition back into civilian life involves so many different factors: mental health, housing, workforce training, and more,” said Senator Murray. “But so much of the transition back to civilian life is rooted in stable, gainful, fulfilling employment. That’s why I wrote the bipartisan VOW to Hire Heroes Act as Chair of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee and pushed to make many of its incentives to hire veterans permanent. I am going to keep working and getting veterans the resources they need to thrive here in Washington state — and supporting a successful transition back to civilian life is an important part of that.”During the roundtable, Senator Murray was joined by Lt Col. Lita Rakhra is WA Air National Guard Deputy Chief of Staff, WMD, Garrison Commander; Annie DeAndrea, Transition Assistance Specialist for the Washington National Guard; Britt Feldman, the Navy Region Northwest Work and Family Life Coordinator; Dr. Larry Pruitt, Director for Suicide Prevention Programs at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Puget Sound Health Care System; Michael Schindler, a U.S. Navy veteran, CEO Operation Military Family; Rick Kelling, a U.S. Army veteran, ETS Sponsorship Program; Leon Richardson, U.S. Army Reserve, Director of Adult Services Division for King County’s Department of Community & Human Services; Megan Stanley, the Veterans Administrator for King County’s Department of Community & Human Services, Adult Services Division; COL (Retired) Mary Forbes, Assistant Director at WDVA; Lt Col, Alex Straub, attorney for the Washington National Guard and transitioning servicemember; and Master Chief Trev Lawrence, Leading Yeoman/ Personnel Officer and transitioning servicemember.Once known as Transition GPS (Goals, Plans, Success), the TAP process is broken down into five parts over a minimum 12-month timeline, although those getting ready to retire can start as far as 24 months out. The Transition Assistance Program provides information, tools, and training to ensure servicemembers and their spouses are prepared for the next step in civilian life. TAP is a cooperative effort amongthe Departments of Labor, Defense, Education, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs, the Small Business Administration, and the Office of Personnel Management.The daughter of a World War II veteran and also a senior member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Senator Murray has been a longtime advocate of military servicemembers, veterans, and their families. Earlier this month, Senator Murray helped to pass the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act (PACT Act) into law. The PACT Act would, among other things, expand the toxic-exposure coverage for post-9/11 veterans and create a framework for coverage going forward. In May, she introduced the Helping Heroes Act, new legislation to support the families of disabled veterans, including children who take on caregiving roles. Senator Murray is also a cosponsor of the BUILD for Veterans Act, which would help the VA build new facilities that would better meet the needs of current and future veterans – including women veterans, veterans in need of long-term care and veterans with spinal cord injuries and diseases.In addition, Senator Murray helped pass the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (NDAA) where she championed measures to support quality of life improvements for servicemembers and their families, such as a 2.7% pay raise for military servicemembers, 12 weeks of parental leave for servicemembers, establishing a Basic Needs Allowance for servicemembers, and inclusion of provisions from the Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act to address sexual assault in the military. Senator Murray also worked hard to include billions of dollars in relief for veterans national assistance programs in the American Rescue Plan including $14.5 billion for health care services, $400 million for rapid retraining assistance, and $500 million to help states upgrade State Veterans Homes across the country and $250 million in one-time emergency grants to support these facilities and ensure they can care for our veterans during the pandemic.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

As a longtime champion for both organizations, Senator Murray secured the $1 million in federal funding through Congressionally-directed spending (CDS) to help finish the construction of Chief Seattle Club’s ?ál?al building, where the clinic is housed. Murray also secured $5 million in federal funding to support the work of the Seattle Indian Health Board in the Fiscal Year 2023 draft appropriations bill that she is working to pass this year. Senator Murray was given a tour of the clinic and gave remarks alongside Seattle Indian Health Board CEO Esther Lucero; Seattle City Council President Debora Juarez; Auburn City Councilmember Chris Stearns; Seattle Indian Health Board Chief Health Officer Dr. Socia Love-Thurman; Chief Seattle Club Executive Director Derrick Belgarde; and Deputy Seattle Mayor Greg Wong. The event was hosted by the Seattle Indian Health Board. “I’m glad I was able to secure funding to help get Chief Seattle Club’s new housing development up and running and I look forward to delivering additional funding for the Seattle Indian Health Board,” said Senator Murray. “The Seattle Indian Health Board’s new clinic in Pioneer Square is extraordinary and will help countless urban Natives get the high-quality and culturally-informed care they need. This Congress has delivered one of the largest-ever federal investments in our Tribal communities—whether through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law or American Rescue Plan—and I am fully committed to building on that progress in every way that I can, and congressionally-directed spending is just another way I can fight for and support Native people.”As a voice for Washington state’s Tribes in the Senate, Senator Murray has been committed to supporting Native communities throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and to creating economic opportunity for Native families. Senator Murray helped secure resources for Native-led health services in Seattle, including nearly $3 million in grants to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the American Rescue Plan, Senator Murray helped secure the largest ever federal investment in Tribes to support Tribal communities as they confronted the health and economic impacts of the pandemic. This included $20 billion for Tribes to combat COVID-19 and provide support to communities in need, more than $6 billion for the Indian Health Services to provide medical and public health support to Tribes, more than $1.2 billion to help provide affordable housing and homelessness services, and more than $1 billion for Native education programs to assist with learning during the pandemic. In her role as a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Murray has consistently fought to secure additional funding for Tribal communities. She has successfully secured increased funding for the Indian Housing Block Grant Program, which helps to combat the housing issues that specifically plague Tribal communities and provide housing assistance to Native Americans with low-incomes. ###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

It’s going to bring down costs on everything from appliances to cars to medical equipment—everything that requires chips, create good-paying jobs here in King County and across our state, and it’s going to protect us against the price spikes we saw as a result of the pandemic, by strengthening a really critical supply chain.”***PHOTOS AND B-ROLL OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE HERE******AUDIO OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE HERE***(Seattle, WA) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), hosted a press conference with local business and workforce leaders in Seattle to discuss how the CHIPS and Science Act will boost manufacturing in Washington state while lowering costs and strengthening a critical supply chain.Senator Murray helped pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act in July after more than a year of bipartisan, bicameral negotiations. The bill is a critical investment in American manufacturing – especially in Washington state, which ranks in the top ten states in semiconductor manufacturing, with many of those jobs in King County. By producing more semiconductor chips in America, this bill will help get more goods to shelves and lower prices on a wide range of products that require chips like household appliances, cars, and medical devices. The CHIPS and Science Act, which was recently signed into law, will create good-paying jobs in Washington state, while strengthening supply chains and national security by reducing reliance on foreign manufacturers.“When the Senate took up the CHIPS and Science Act, I knew that what we were doing was going to make a big, big difference when it comes to building a stronger economy right here at home,” said Senator Murray. “This bill is a game changer. It’s going to bring down costs on everything from appliances to cars to medical equipment—everything that requires chips, create good-paying jobs here in King County and across our state, and it’s going to protect us against the price spikes we saw as a result of the pandemic, by strengthening a really critical supply chain. This is a win for Washington state and I am going to keep fighting to lower costs and create jobs here in Seattle and across the state.”Senator Murray was joined by Rachel Smith, President and CEO of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce; Michael Schutzler, CEO of the Washington Technology Industry Association; Paul Francis, Executive Director of the State Board for Community and Technical Colleges, and Ken Young, General Manager of the Space Systems Business Unit at Aerojet Rocketdyne. “The federal investments championed by Sen. Patty Murray will translate into direct cost-savings for consumers and business owners,” said Rachel Smith, President and CEO of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce. “Along with investments in research, development, and manufacturing, the CHIPS and Science Act will provide a big boost to one of most important things we need – broader, more inclusive access to science, technology, engineering and math education for our future workforce – that will mean more opportunity for good-paying jobs in key industries for the coming generations. Innovation today means jobs tomorrow. This legislation impacts jobs in our homegrown industries like aerospace, communications, clean energy, information technology, and health care, and I am filled with optimism that the success of our region will be sustained and we can continue to compete for talent on the global stage.”“WTIA members are enthusiastic about the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act. There is significant opportunity for Washington state to help grow the STEM workforce, increase R&D in emerging technologies, and establish a regional tech hub,” said Michael Schutzler, CEO of the Washington Technology Industry Association. “We are ready to partner with the Senator and many others as the programs are implemented. This is an exciting time to build a better future.”“We deeply appreciate Senator Murray’s role in pushing this transformative game-changing legislation. With support from the CHIPS and Science Act, our 34 community and technical colleges will train Washingtonians for well-paying, highly-skilled jobs that employers are desperate to fill. And we’ll strengthen and expand the frontiers of our economy in the process,” saidPaul Francis, Executive Director of the Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges.“While ensuring the ability to access domestically-sourced semiconductors is critical, it is equally important that this effort supports the production of existing designs,” said Ken Young, General Manager of Aerojet Rocketdyne in Redmond, Washington. “Producing new chips with existing designs reduces the schedule, risk and cost of redesigning and requalifying critical components for many high-tech industries, including aerospace and defense.”The recently passed CHIPS & Science Act will enable the Department of Commerce to provide $39 billion in incentives via loans, loan guarantees and grants to chip manufacturers, as well as to companies that do not make chips (e.g., chip equipment and materials suppliers). The Act also provides a 25 percent investment tax credit for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and the construction of semiconductor manufacturing facilities. Additional funds can support local workforce development efforts. These activities may be beneficial to a range of local companies, like Aerojet Rocketdyne.The CHIPS & Science Act also reauthorizes National Science Foundation’s Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program and doubles the budget for ATE from the current level of $75 million per year to $150 million per year. This program helps community and technical colleges like Renton Technical College improve and expand educational programs for technicians to work in high-tech STEM fields that drive the U.S. economy and secure good paying jobs in King County.The bill will allow small and medium sized microchip manufacturers to expand and hire more workers, get products on the shelves faster, and lower costs on consumer electronics. When it comes to national security, the CHIPS and Science Act will decrease our reliance on foreign supply chains and make American manufacturing more competitive on the world stage.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

During the event, Senator Murray highlighted her continued commitment to smart, just housing policy and bold investments from the federal government in affordable housing, and—importantly—increased housing supply.Senator Murray has expressed strong support for President Biden’s Housing Supply Action Plan and proposed fiscal year 2023 budget for federal housing programs. The proposed budget includes a total of $50 billion in new mandatory funding to boost the nation’s housing supply. The budget also requests an increase of the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Housing Trust Fund and would also raise the cap on low-income housing tax credits to make low- and moderate-income housing worth building. President Biden’s requested budget would provide the resources necessary to build 500,000 new homes.Senator Murray was joined by Craig Chance, the Executive Director of the Housing Authority of Thurston County; a local voucher recipient supported by American Rescue Plan funds; Karen McVea, Director of Rental Assistance for the Thurston County Housing Authority; and Margaret Salazar, HUD’s Regional Administrator serving Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Alaska.“Washington state is dealing with a really serious housing crisis—and while the American Rescue Plan I helped pass delivered the largest federal investment in mortgage and rental relief in our country’s history, we still need long-term solutions,” said Senator Murray. “Right now, we need more housing and we’ve got to help our communities build it—that’s why I’m pushing to boost federal funding to help states and local communities plan and develop more affordable housing. Working families should be able to afford a decent home without putting more than half their income towards their rent or mortgage—and no one should ever go without a roof over their head.”“We are grateful for Senator Murray’s leadership,” said Craig Chance, Executive Director of the Housing Authority of Thurston County. “One example is the Emergency Housing Voucher program made possible by the American Rescue Plan Act. A 62 year old neighbor, previously enduring without shelter, shared with us that before he secured permanent housing through this program he’d given up hope of having decent housing.  Individual neighbors and the entire community benefit from Senator Murray’s engagement in this noble work.”“Across Washington and throughout the Northwest we are in a housing crisis,” said Margaret Salazar, HUD Regional Administrator. “But with every family we house, we have greater inspiration and greater resolve. At HUD, we have awarded unprecedented funding through the American Recue Plan and it’s making a difference. We are grateful to Senator Murray for her continued stalwart leadership and advocacy around housing, in Washington and nationally.”Senator Murray has been a strong advocate for housing investments, securing more than $400 million in rental assistance, $170 million in homeowner assistance, over 2,400 new Emergency Housing Vouchers, and nearly $100 million for housing and services to support people experiencing homelessness in Washington state specifically through the American Rescue Plan. These federal investments resulted in the largest eviction prevention effort in history. Earlier this year, Senator Murray also announced $143.6 million in Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funding for Washington state from the American Rescue Plan, in addition to annual federal appropriations, that would go to families with low-incomes to help with utility and energy costs during the winter. In May, Senator Murray questioned U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Marcia Fudge on the homelessness crisis and the inadequate supply of affordable housing—and reiterated her commitment to pushing for a major federal investment to tackle the national housing and homelessness crisis.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

During the roundtable, Senator Murray spoke with participants about their ongoing work, the federal funding she has secured for the Port of Longview, and what other ways the federal government can support Washington state ports.Last year, Senator Murray secured $2.5 million in Congressionally-directed spending through the Fiscal Year 2022 appropriations bill for the Port of Longview’s Industrial Rail Corridor Expansion (IRCE) project. This project will expand rail capacity to underutilized marine terminals to unleash economic potential for private sector investment. This project will double freight capacity through the corridor, and leverage the Port’s position as an economic engine for the region. Senator Murray also secured a $16 million Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grant for the IRCE in addition to her recent Congressionally-directed spending request.“The Port of Longview is an important economic driver for the entire region—and it’s my job to support the work that happens here every day,” said Senator Murray. “Whether through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law or my seat on the Appropriations Committee, we have been able to secure some really significant and meaningful federal infrastructure investments for the Port of Longview and all of Southwest Washington. When we invest in our infrastructure and strengthen supply chains, those dollars go a long way towards lowering the prices of products on shelves and creating good-paying, union jobs here in Washington state.”During the event, Murray, discussed how important RAISE grant funding has been for local infrastructure projects across Washington state. Senator Murray originally created the RAISE program (previously known as TIGER and BUILD) in 2009 and has been a longtime supporter of the program, most recently helping secure $7.5 billion for the RAISE program – a 50% annual increase – in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. RAISE grants can be used for a wide variety of infrastructure projects with local or regional impact. The program is funded specifically via the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, of which Senator Murray is a senior member. Just this month, Senator Murray announced nearly $100 million in additional RAISE grant funding for projects across the state. Senator Murray has secured nearly $460 million in RAISE funding for Washington state projects since she founded the program.The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Senator Murray helped pass invests more than $17 billion in port infrastructure and waterways with the primary aim of addressing needed repairs and maintenance backlogs, reducing congestion to strengthen our supply chains and remove bottlenecks to expedite commerce, cutting emissions near ports by boosting electrification, and investing in other low-carbon technologies to reduce environmental impacts on neighboring communities.In particular, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law designates $450 million annually for the next five years for the Port Infrastructure Development Program. This will allow significant improvements to port facilities and projects that include: loading and unloading of goods at a port; movement of goods into, out of, around, or within a port; resilience projects addressing rising sea-level, flooding, extreme weather events, and natural disasters; and environmental and emissions mitigation measures.Senator Murray has been a longtime advocate of Washington state ports. The 2020 Water Development Resources Act includes changes secured by Murray to the Harbor Maintenance Tax and Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. These changes will provide billions of dollars each year to invest in and enhance the global competitiveness of ports in Washington state and across the country.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Because the largest expenses for most older adults are housing and health care costs, actions that help reduce cost burdens are critical.”“It’s an honor for the Area Agency on Aging & Disabilities of Southwest Washington to host Senator Murray and her staff for this important roundtable discussion,” said Mike Reardon, Executive Director of the Area on Aging and Disabilities of Southwest WA. “Additionally, we say “Thank You” to Senator Murray for championing solutions to the rising costs of prescription medications for Medicare recipients. The Medicare prescription drug provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act will benefit the lives of millions of older adults across the nation, particularly those on fixed incomes. This bill will benefit 1.4M Washingtonians, 115,000 of whom live in Southwest Washington. These are significant numbers and again want to thank Senator Murray for her hard work on this important issue.”“Nosotras somos mejores juntas,” said Pat Cano, LULAC Senior Member, Advisory Council Member for the Area Agency on Aging and Disabilities of Southwest Washington.The Inflation Reduction Act includes several groundbreaking steps to bring down prescription drugs for Washington state’s more than 1.4 million Medicare patients, like finally allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug costs—something Senator Murray has been fighting to do for years and will bring down costs for patients everywhere and generate enormous savings for taxpayers. It also caps Medicare beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket prescription drugs costs at $2,000 a year, caps their insulin costs at $35 a month, and caps price increases on their prescriptions at the rate of inflation so that drug makers cannot jack up prices to pad their own profits.Senator Murray held the roundtable at the Clark County Area Agency on Aging and Disability. She was joined by Mike Reardon, Executive Director of the Area on Aging and Disabilities of Southwest WA; Lisa Bayautet, a citizen representative for Area on Aging and Disabilities of Southwest WA; Bridgette Fahnbulleh, advocate and former Vancouver NAACP President; Pat Cano, LULAC Senior Member, Advisory Council Member for the Area Agency on Aging; and Cass Freedland, Chair of the Clark County Commission on Aging.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/murray-cantwell-visit-sw-wa-semiconductor-manufacturer-as-chips-science-act-spurs-industry-growth/,"CAMAS, WA – Today, U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA) toured semiconductor manufacturer nLight to tout the major opportunities coming to Southwest Washington in the recently-passed $250 billion CHIPS & Science Act. The competitive grant funding, loans, and loan guarantees as well as the investment tax credit in the bill will potentially support major investments in Clark County’s cluster of semiconductor and electronics manufacturing companies. The Greater Portland Region supports over 30,000 jobs in computers and electronics, with over 2,800 jobs in semiconductor and related device manufacturing in Clark County alone.“Right here in Clark County, nLight and companies like them make up a hub of semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S.,” said Sen. Murray. “This bill is a game changer. It’s going to bring down costs on everything from appliances to cars to medical equipment—everything that requires chips, it will create good-paying jobs here in Clark County and across our state, and it’s going to protect us against the price spikes we saw as a result of the pandemic, by strengthening a really critical supply chain. We are building an economy that not only leads the world in innovation, but leads to good-paying jobs right here at home and lower costs on our store shelves.”“We want to be the leaders in the production of semiconductors and we want to be the leaders in advanced chip manufacturing,” said Sen. Cantwell. “We want to be the leaders in the design of the future applications for this great technology. And Camas and Clark County are leading the way.”“Since the beginning of last week, Micron Technology, GlobalFoundries, Qualcomm, and SEH have all announced plans for over $40 billion to build new semiconductor fabs – and increase production right here in the United States,” Sen. Cantwell continued.The Senators emphasized the opportunities to improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education in the region, including $200 million for the National Science Foundation to grow the semiconductor workforce.Said Scott Keeney, CEO, nLight: “As the world changes, there’s been more pressure. And I think this CHIPS Act comes at a critical time, not only to enhance what we’re doing in industry, but also to go deeper into science and technology, and to go into workforce development, and to go into education.”Said Jennifer Baker, President of the Columbia River Economic Development Council: “We must optimize our efforts on the national stage to anchor in the benefits right here … We can support every young person in our community to explore career pathways in STEM, feeding their curiosity, not just with technology, but also challenging them to ask how it works…To colleagues in the room, I say let’s get after it.”During the tour, the senators and media saw the chip manufacturing process in action, from automated wafer construction to semiconductor laser cutting.The recently passed CHIPS & Science Act will enable the Department of Commerce to provide $39 billion in incentives via loans, loan guarantees and grants to chip manufacturers, as well as to companies that do not make chips (e.g., chip equipment and materials suppliers). The Act also provides a 25 percent investment tax credit for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and the construction of semiconductor manufacturing facilities. Additional funds can support local workforce development efforts. These activities may be beneficial to a range of local companies, like Analog Devices, nLight, WaferTech, and SEH America.The CHIPS & Science Act also reauthorizes National Science Foundation’s Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program and doubles the budget for ATE from the current level of $75 million per year to $150 million per year. This program helps community colleges like Clark College improve and expand educational programs for technicians to work in high-tech STEM fields that drive the U.S. economy and secure good paying jobs in Clark County.Additionally, the CHIPS & Science Act provides support for expanding internship and experimental learning opportunities at Washington State University Vancouver like the school’s Future Leaders Project, which aims to connect historically underserved students with paid summer internships and mentoring. The bill also supports the school’s ongoing efforts to increase the access, entry and retention of women and people of color in STEM fields. The campus serves a large population of first-generation college students (44 percent) and students of color (33 percent).MORE PHOTOS FROM THE EVENT CAN BE FOUND HERE.

This isn’t  just about saving patients’ money—this will save lives. We are helping patients who are rationing their prescriptions to make ends meet, or who are afraid to see their doctors—not because they are scared of getting a diagnosis, but because they are scared of the price tag.“This historic legislation will be the largest-ever investment in climate action in our country’s history. And Washington state is uniquely poised to take full advantage of federal clean energy tax credits and grants that will deliver lower energy costs for consumers, millions of good-paying jobs, and promote real energy independence.“Getting this legislation signed into law will help communities in every part of Washington state—and it marks a historic turning point in how we tackle the climate crisis in this country, while lowering everyday costs for families everywhere in Washington state. This is an important step forward and I’m committed to building on this historic progress.”The Inflation Reduction Act lowers prescription drug and health care costs and delivers the largest-ever investment in climate action —lowering energy costs, promoting energy independence, and creating good-paying jobs.  The Inflation Reduction Act is fully paid for by ensuring the very wealthiest and giant corporations simply pay their fair share and would actually reduce the deficit by more than $300 billion.More on the Inflation Reduction Act HERE. ###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

This is a huge win for Washington state, where it will help create good-paying jobs and put us on a path to sustainable energy independence.”***PHOTOS OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE HERE******AUDIO OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE HERE***(Seattle, WA) – Today in Seattle, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) hosted a press conference highlighting the landmark climate action investments included in the Inflation Reduction Act she helped pass. The legislation, signed into law today by President Joe Biden, will invest $369 billion over the next decade into clean energy while creating good-paying jobs and lowering everyday energy costs⁠—delivering the largest climate investment in United States history.  Senator Murray held the press conference at Hinoki, a residential building constructed and leased by the Seattle Housing Authority, that includes significant investments in energy saving measures that the Inflation Reduction Act will make more affordable and accessible across Washington state.  On the rooftop at Hinoki a 52-kilowatt solar installation generates renewable energy for Seattle City Light’s renewable energy purchasing program. The metering credits received from Seattle City Light help lower the operating costs of the building. Hinoki is an all-electric building, eliminating the need for natural gas often used for heating and water heating. Senator Murray was joined by  Don Meyer, Commissioner and President at Port of Tacoma; Toshiko Hasegawa, Port of Seattle Commissioner for Pos. 4; and Debra Smith, CEO of Seattle City Light. During the press conference, Senator Murray highlighted noteworthy provisions secured in the legislation to lower energy costs in homes, cut carbon emissions by 40 percent by the end of the decade, and create good-paying clean energy, jobs in every part of Washington state.“We know that we’re in the thick of the climate crisis – we see it all around us: life-threatening heat waves, road-buckling temperatures last summer, wildfires endangering people’s lives and homes. That’s why I was determined to deliver a landmark investment in climate action,” said Senator Murray. “The Inflation Reduction Act is going to help supercharge a clean energy economy right here in Washington state while lowering everyday energy costs. This is a huge win for Washington state, where it will help create good-paying jobs and put us on a path to sustainable energy independence.”The Inflation Reduction Act will establish major cost-saving benefits for Washington state consumers with home energy rebates and consumer tax credits to invest in energy efficiency— rooftop solar, heat pumps, appliances, and more. It will also establish $4,000 tax credits for consumers purchasing used clean vehicles and up to $7,500 for new clean vehicles—encouraging manufacturers to put more clean vehicles on the market.“The investments in the Inflation Reduction Act will help us invest in developing and scaling clean hydrogen technology, and produce cheaper, cleaner infrastructure. That is going to create jobs and deliver important progress in our fight against climate change because this bill is the beginning, not the end of our fight,” said Senator Murray. “Here’s the short and sweet: climate action is good for workers, good for consumers, good for business, and good for our planet—period. With the Inflation Reduction Act, we are delivering lower costs, lower emissions, and a stronger clean energy economy.”The climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act will implement major clean energy tax credits and grants that would spur a historic, first-of-its-kind economy-wide transition to clean energy—from our utilities to manufacturing industry. This will help build on and expand existing solar and wind energy production in Central and Eastern Washington to move us toward sustainable energy independence and takes steps to help rural communities and farmers across Washington state adapt to a rapidly changing climate.The Inflation Reduction Act will help electrify ports like the Port of Seattle to help cut those emissions and make the air around them safer to breathe. The Inflation Reduction Act also funds research and development into cleaner aviation fuel and technology – much of which happens in Washington state.The Port of Tacoma and The Northwest Seaport Alliance are actively implementing sustainability initiatives to improve local air quality, meet the global climate challenge, and sustain and strengthen our competitiveness in the cargo shipping industry. The Inflation Reduction Act will provide critical funding to help expedite our transition to zero-emission port operations,” stated Port of Tacoma Commission President and The Northwest Seaport Alliance Co-Chair Don Meyer.“We applaud the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and the generational investment in clean air, clean energy and environmental justice. The Port of Seattle and The Northwest Seaport Alliance are eager to put this funding to work to further our zero-emission goals, for the health of our climate, communities, and our industries,” stated Port of Seattle Commissioner and The Northwest Seaport Alliance Managing Member Toshiko Hasegawa.“Seattle City Light welcomes this landmark climate legislation to incentivize clean energy technologies and provide much needed support for environmental justice communities,” said Debra Smith, general manager of Seattle City Light. “We envision this as a driving force in growth of renewable energy solutions, building energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction.”The Inflation Reduction Act is fully paid for by ensuring the very wealthiest and giant corporations simply pay their fair share—without raising taxes on any Americans making less than $400,000 per year—and would actually reduce the deficit by more than $300 billion.A full summary of the climate and energy provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act can be found here.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/murray-senate-dems-support-proposed-rules-on-student-debt-relief-programs-encourage-biden-admin-to-further-strengthen-proposal/,"Senators applaud critical forward progress, outline further steps to strengthen proposed regulations(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), led 22 of her colleagues in commenting on the Department of Education’s proposed rules to expand and improve student debt relief programs. In a letter to Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, the Senators applauded the Department’s efforts to provide and expand relief to borrowers whose schools closed or defrauded them, borrowers working in public service, and borrowers who are totally and permanently disabled. The Senators encouraged additional steps to improve the Department’s student debt relief programs and ensure borrowers can access the relief they are owed.“The Department’s proposed rules will help to provide additional relief to struggling borrowers, protect students and taxpayers from fraud and abuse committed by institutions, and ensure our federal student loan program fulfills its promise to put higher education within reach for more students without subjecting them to complex, burdensome, or punitive requirements that make it harder to get the relief they are owed,” wrote the Senators. “This proposal represents an enormous step forward for students and borrowers, and, when finalized, it will help ensure government benefits and programs function as Congress intended.”In their letter, the Senators commended the Biden administration’s proposals to deliver and expand relief for these borrowers—steps Senator Murray and her Democratic colleagues urged the Department to take in a letter last year.They also detailed additional steps the Department should take to strengthen its proposal. In particular, the Senators recommended steps to further strengthen its borrower protection rule, further expand relief for borrowers seeking a closed school discharge and eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, eliminate interest capitalization on all loan types, and further protect students’ right to seek relief in court. The Senators also urged the Department to continue working to fix the income-driven repayment system, crack down on bad actors, and provide as much relief as possible to borrowers.“As the Department works to finalize these regulations, we urge you to build on this progress by strengthening rules in other vital areas, including income-driven repayment and gainful employment,” added the Senators. “We also urge the Department to continue efforts to protect borrowers outside the rulemaking process, including by immediately and efficiently using its current oversight and enforcement authorities to reign in bad actors and provide as much relief as possible to borrowers.”The letter, led by Senator Murray, was also signed by Senators Schumer (D-NY), Baldwin (D-WI), Markey (D-MA), Wyden (D-OR), Reed (D-RI), Coons (D-DE), Hirono (D-HI), Cardin (D-MD), Warnock (D-GA), Gillibrand (D-NY), Warren (D-MA), Lujan (D-NM), Casey (D-PA), Whitehouse (D-RI), Blumenthal (D-CT), Smith (D-MN), Cortez Masto (D-NV), Padilla (D-CA), Brown (D-OH), Durbin (D-IL), Van Hollen (D-MD), and Rosen (D-NV).The Senators’ full letter is available HERE and below:The Honorable Miguel CardonaSecretary of EducationU.S. Department of Education400 Maryland Avenue, S.W.Washington, D.C. 20202Docket ID ED-2021-OPE-0077Dear Secretary Cardona:We write in response to the U.S. Department of Education’s (“Department”) proposed rules regarding debt relief for borrowers whose schools closed or defrauded them, borrowers who are totally and permanently disabled, and borrowers who are public service workers. The Biden-Harris Administration’s proposed regulations for student loan discharge programs make tremendous progress in providing and expanding relief to borrowers, and we’re pleased to see Senate Democratic priorities, as outlined in the July 1, 2021, letters on program integrity and debt relief, reflected in this proposal.[1] We applaud the proposal’s improvement and streamlining of student loan relief programs and commend the Department’s efforts to support student loan borrowers.For far too long, students who face a variety of barriers have been cheated by predatory for-profit colleges, denied their day in court due to mandatory arbitration agreements, and denied debt relief because of standards that are impossible to meet. Borrowers have seen their balances balloon due to interest capitalization, they have had their lives altered by sudden college closures, and they have faced burdensome and overly-complicated requirements to access debt relief. This Administration has demonstrated its commitment to helping borrowers access the relief they are entitled to and holding institutions accountable for misconduct, including through this draft rule. This proposal represents an enormous step forward for students and borrowers, and, when finalized, it will help ensure government benefits and programs function as Congress intended.For these reasons, we strongly support the Department’s proposed rules for student loan relief programs. Below, we provide detailed input on each of the draft regulations proposed by the Department. We also urge the Department to continue efforts to protect borrowers outside the rulemaking process, including by immediately and efficiently using its current oversight and enforcement authorities to reign in bad actors and provide as much relief as possible to borrowers.Borrower Defense to RepaymentAfter years of deregulation of the “borrower defense” rule under the previous Administration, which undermined protections for defrauded borrowers and relentlessly denied them relief, we commend the Biden-Harris Administration for reversing course and proposing the strongest borrower defense rule we have ever seen.The previous Administration required borrowers to meet an extremely difficult standard to prove their colleges caused them harm and, as a result, only 7.5 percent of borrower defense claims were estimated to be approved, down from 65 percent under the prior rule.[2] This was so unpopular that Congress—in a bipartisan effort—passed a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn the rule, which was later vetoed by President Donald Trump.[3]We commend your efforts to redress the harms this deregulatory regime caused borrowers—including borrowers from low-income families, first-generation students, students of color, and veterans—who have been targeted and lied to by predatory for-profit institutions. These borrowers deserve to be able to access the loan relief they are entitled to through a fair and streamlined process.Specifically, we strongly support the establishment of a single and streamlined borrower defense standard that better captures the full scope of institutional misconduct relevant for a borrower defense claim. To date, the review process for borrower defense claims has been overly burdensome, with inconsistent regulatory standards depending on loan disbursement date. This has contributed to inequities amongst similarly situated borrowers and lengthy delays in the adjudication of claims, leaving borrowers waiting far too long for relief. The establishment of a single standard with clearer and expanded grounds for borrower defense claims represents a tremendous step forward in protecting consumers and the integrity of the federal financial aid programs. We are also pleased to see that misconduct related to substantial omission of fact and aggressive and deceptive recruitment can serve as a basis for borrower defense under the Department’s draft rule.Additionally, the restoration and strengthening of a group process for borrowers seeking discharge, the establishment of a set timeline for adjudication of both group and individual claims, and the enhanced authorities for the Department to recoup the cost of discharges from predatory institutions are welcome and necessary changes. We support the Department’s approach to establishing a presumption of full discharge in place of the partial relief approach utilized under the last Administration and eliminating the limitations period for borrowers, both of which have created major barriers that have unnecessarily prevented borrowers from accessing the relief to which they are entitled.We remain concerned about the need to protect borrowers from predatory for-profit colleges that are defrauding borrowers at scale and urge you to allow legal assistance organizations, in addition to state attorneys general, to bring forth group claims. Additionally, we encourage you to suspend interest accrual immediately for all borrowers with a pending borrower defense claim. Under the draft regulations, the Department proposes to cease interest accrual for borrowers filing an individual claim only after their claim has been pending for 180 days. Borrowers covered by group claims, meanwhile, would see their interest paused immediately, a distinction that the Department states is based on the premise that not all group members proactively apply for borrower defense. However, no borrower opts into being defrauded or misled by their institution, and no borrower subjected to misconduct should have to see their loan balance balloon while they wait for the Department to take action. We further encourage you to clarify that, if the Secretary reopens a borrower defense application under which a borrower received partial forgiveness, the Secretary may not reduce or rescind previously provided forgiveness. This change would appear to be in alignment with the Department’s intent, given that the preamble states, “a borrower only stands to benefit from the Secretary reopening a borrower defense application that was fully or partially denied.”Lastly, we encourage you to continue to use existing enforcement authorities to hold institutions accountable for engaging in misconduct and wasting taxpayer dollars. We are encouraged by the Department’s ongoing efforts to deliver group discharges of borrower defense claims and look forward to more relief for groups of students who are subject to the same findings of misconduct.Mandatory Pre-dispute Arbitration and Prohibition of Class Action Lawsuits Provisions in Institutions’ Enrollment AgreementsAs part of its deregulatory agenda, the previous Administration removed restrictions banning the use of pre-dispute arbitration agreements and class action lawsuit waivers, thereby allowing institutions to deny students their day in court by requiring them to give up their rights as a condition of enrollment. Instead, students at these institutions are forced to waive their right to pursue class action lawsuits or are required to resolve disputes through mandatory arbitration proceedings. Furthermore, the outcomes of arbitration proceedings are often kept secret—effectively hiding predatory practices from the public and regulators, including the Department. As outlined in the July 1, 2021, letter from 12 Senate Democrats on program integrity, for-profit colleges have a long track record—unique compared to other sectors of higher education—of imposing these mandatory arbitration agreements and class action lawsuit waivers. [4] For example, a 2016 study examining enrollment contracts from 217 institutions found mandatory arbitration clauses in 98 percent of contracts at for-profit institutions, compared to just seven percent at nonprofits.[5] No public institutions examined in the study required students to settle disputes through arbitration.[6]We applaud the Department’s proposal to reinstate the ban on mandatory arbitration agreements and class action waivers for lawsuits relating to acts or omissions regarding the making of the Federal Direct Loan and the provision of educational services for which such loans are obtained. Since forced arbitration is prevalent in for-profit colleges,[7] the draft proposal to prohibit forced arbitration clauses and class-action waivers will benefit many borrowers attending for-profit colleges. Additionally, the proposal will have a greater impact on Black students who are overrepresented at for-profit schools, by a near 15-percentage point difference, compared to public and private universities.[8] We further commend the collection and public disclosure of arbitral and judicial records related to borrower defense claims. These disclosures will enhance transparency regarding the outcomes of arbitrations, support oversight efforts, and help ensure prospective students and their families have access to information about past instances of institutional fraud and misrepresentation.As you work to finalize the pre-dispute forced arbitration and class action waiver bans, we encourage the Department to make clear that institutions must use the notice language included in the final regulations verbatim and without conditions when providing the required notices to borrowers. We further urge you to clarify the timing of notices sent to borrowers who previously attended institutions that maintained mandatory arbitration and class action waiver requirements. These students should be made aware as quickly as practicable that their rights to pursue claims in court—both as an individual and as part of a class—have been restored.Public Service Loan ForgivenessWe commend the Department’s efforts to expand Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) eligibility and codify recent improvements in the consideration of qualifying payments and the application process. As expressed by 23 Senate Democrats in the July 1, 2021, comment letter on debt relief, Senate Democrats support closing holes in PSLF eligibility, removing overly restrictive regulations on qualifying payments, and making it easier for borrowers working in public service to obtain the PSLF forgiveness they are entitled to under the Higher Education Act (HEA).[9]The proposed rule makes critical improvements to the PSLF program by codifying parts of the Biden-Harris Administration’s limited PSLF waiver, which has already resulted in at least $9 billion of forgiveness for more than 146,000 public servants and more than 1 million borrowers receiving, on average, one additional year of credit toward PSLF.[10] Specifically, we applaud allowing more payments to qualify for PSLF including counting payments made prior to consolidation and payments made in multiple installments or outside the 15-day period in current regulations toward PSLF forgiveness. Additionally, the Department’s proposed definition of full-time employment will protect borrowers from being subject to a higher full-time definition set by their employer, ensure eligible borrowers working for multiple employers can obtain relief, and clarify how the Department will calculate the equivalent weekly hours worked for borrowers who are non-tenured instructors.      While we are encouraged by the Department’s necessary proposal to count certain periods of deferment and forbearance toward PSLF, we urge you to count all such periods toward PSLF to reduce unnecessary complexity, address administrative failures by student loan servicers, and fulfill the program’s goal of alleviating the burden of federal student loans for borrowers in public service.[11] Unfortunately, federal investigations have found that student loan servicers have steered borrowers into forbearance, made errors during loan transfers, and failed to advise borrowers about their options to enroll in income-driven repayment plans, under which monthly payments—even if they are $0 payments—count toward PSLF.[12] Borrowers should not lose progress toward forgiveness when a servicer pauses a borrower’s payments to process paperwork, nor should borrowers be penalized for following bad advice from a servicer or experiencing other types of industry misconduct.Under the proposed regulations, the Department contemplates the inclusion of for-profit early childhood education (ECE) employers as qualifying employers for the purposes of PSLF. In response to the Department’s request for comments on this proposal, we support the inclusion of for-profit ECE employers because early childhood educators employed by for-profit ECE employers fundamentally provide a public service to the nation. In addition to providing critical services to educate and care for young children, early childhood educators also play an integral role in supporting working families, businesses and the nation’s economy. According to American Community Survey data, nearly two-thirds of children younger than age six have all parents in the labor force, making access to quality, affordable child care a necessity for working families across the country.[13] Section 455 (m)(3)B)(i) of HEA includes “early childhood education (including licensed or regulated child care, Head Start, and state funded pre-kindergarten)” as part of the statutory definition of a “public service job”, demonstrating Congress’ intent to specifically include the early childhood workforce as eligible for PSLF. The child care sector is a mixed-delivery system that relies at least in part on non-public providers.[14] Additionally, many family child care providers are small businesses with one early childhood educator as both the sole proprietor and sole employee. The vast majority of child care providers are small businesses operating on razor thin profit margins that are usually less than 1 percent.[15]Moreover, when Congress authorized the PSLF program in 2007, the intent was to incentivize employment in public service positions that were presumed to generally have lower wages than other occupations. Today, early childhood educators, who are almost entirely women and 40 percent of whom are women of color—typically earn poverty-level wages despite having highly specialized skills and postsecondary education.[16] Staffing challenges due to inadequate wages for early educators are fueling a nationwide shortage of child care. The inclusion of for-profit early childhood education employers as qualifying employers for PSLF could help recruit and retain highly qualified early educators and strengthen the workforce to ensure that child care remains available to the children and families who need it.The Department should take a multifaceted approach to implement this measure. For example, the Department should collaborate with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to identify methods to collect Employer Identification Numbers (EINs) for Head Start and Early Head Start programs.[17] Additionally, the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act requires states to have in effect licensing requirements applicable to child care services provided within the state.[18] In addition, HHS regulations require each state lead agency to maintain a website with a “localized list of all licensed child care providers” in the state.[19] In turn, HHS operates a national website that links to state databases of child care providers.[20] The Department should consult with HHS on whether and how these state databases may be used to help verify licensed and regulated child care programs. Where practicable, the Department and HHS should automate information-sharing related to qualifying employers and clarify that borrowers working for for-profit ECE employers may pursue the reconsideration process outlined in the proposed rule if they are denied PSLF relief.We also support extending PSLF eligibility to certain self-employed independent contractors who are working on a full-time basis with a qualifying employer, but are not employed directly by the qualifying employer. For example, as noted in the preamble, public defenders and doctors in rural nonprofit hospitals who are independent contractors are not currently eligible for PSLF. Eligibility requirements should be adjusted to account for such types of circumstances particularly in public and nonprofit settings, in which borrowers are providing a public service with a qualifying employer but are not compensated directly by the qualifying employer. Additionally, externally sponsored fellows at not-for-profit organizations and public agencies, such as early career attorneys in public service roles, should be eligible for PSLF. These borrowers are not considered “employees” under the Department’s draft PSLF regulations despite working for a qualifying employer and contributing to the public good. We believe the treatment of contracted fellowships should be distinct from other types of more lucrative, contracted positions in which borrowers may be providing a service to the qualifying employer while being compensated by a non-qualifying employer. In the case of independent contractors, organizations are likely to be willing to sign PSLF forms on their behalf given that they are likely already completing PSLF forms as qualifying employers and often track the number of hours worked for the independent contractors they hire. The Department should clarify the definition of “employee” includes contractors, working for a qualifying employer, who may receive tax forms other than W-2s, including 1099 forms.Relatedly, we support the Department’s ongoing efforts to provide relief to public service workers through the limited PSLF waiver and urge the Department to extend the application deadline for the waiver to align with the implementation of the new changes being made under the Department’s forthcoming rules.Interest CapitalizationAs the Department’s preamble explains, interest capitalization—in which some or all of a borrower’s unpaid interest is added to their principal—can contribute to growing balances, extended time to repayment, and a higher risk of delinquency and default, leading to financial and psychological challenges that hamper successful loan repayment.[21] Furthermore, the Department’s data demonstrate that interest capitalization is particularly harmful for Black borrowers, Pell Grant recipients, borrowers from low-income families, and borrowers who left college without completing a degree or credential.[22]The Department’s proposal to remove interest capitalization where not required by statute represents a vital step in preventing borrowers’ debts from growing over time and reducing racial and socioeconomic disparities in loan repayment outcomes. We applaud the Department’s proposal and encourage you to build on these efforts in the forthcoming regulations for income-driven repayment by eliminating negative amortization on all loan types, as proposed in the July 1, 2021, letter from 23 Senate Democrats on debt relief.[23] We additionally encourage you to remove capitalization when a borrower in the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) repayment plan is determined to no longer have a partial financial hardship, as it is currently required (and maintained in the Department’s draft rules) under 34 CFR 685.209(a)(2)(iv). The Department should also examine whether it is still necessary to maintain language capping the amount of interest capitalized under the alternative repayment plan at 34 CFR 685.208(l)(5), as well as the reference to that provision at 34 CFR 685.202(b)(2), as redesignated by the Department’s draft rules, given the proposed striking of 34 CFR 685.202(b)(4).Total and Permanent Disability DischargesAs outlined in the July 1, 2021, letter from 23 Senate Democrats on debt relief, current regulations have created unnecessary barriers for borrowers who are entitled to a total and permanent disability (TPD) discharge under the HEA.[24] We strongly support the Department’s proposal to expand the types of acceptable documentation and the list of medical professionals who are authorized to certify a borrower’s eligibility for a TPD discharge. We also commend the Department’s proposed changes to expand the categories of borrowers who may qualify for discharge in alignment with congressional intent. Additionally, we support that the Department’s draft rule would make it possible for qualifying borrowers to access a TPD discharge without an application and encourage the Department to automate the TPD process as much as possible wherever the Department can do so.Under the current TPD regulations, borrowers who receive a discharge are subject to a three-year post-discharge monitoring period during which a borrower’s discharged loan is reinstated if their income rises above a certain level or if they subsequently receive a federal student loan or a TEACH Grant. As the Department’s preamble noted, however, many borrowers have had their loans reinstated due to paperwork issues and not because they had earnings above the threshold for reinstatement. We support that the Department has proposed eliminating the three-year income monitoring period as proposed in the July 1, 2021, letter from 23 Senate Democrats on debt relief.[25] This change will remove unnecessary and harmful barriers that have prevented borrowers from getting the much-needed relief that they are entitled to under the law.However, the Department’s draft rules propose to maintain the reinstatement of loans for borrowers who obtain additional loans or TEACH Grants within three years of receiving TPD discharge. During negotiations, non-federal negotiators recommended reducing the three-year monitoring period to one year, but the Department’s preamble stated that they “[had] not been presented with a reason to change our current position on having a three year limitation on borrowers taking out additional title IV loans.” It appears that the Department intends to use loan reinstatement as a deterrent to discourage future borrowing, but in practice, this policy risks imposing a hefty penalty on borrowers who may not understand the consequences of borrowing new loans.[26] This policy may be particularly harmful for borrowers who discover only after re-enrollment that they will not be able to complete their chosen program or secure work in their desired field.We therefore encourage the Department to revisit this issue, to examine the frequency and impact of loan reinstatement due to subsequent borrowing, and to consider shortening the monitoring period to one year, as suggested by non-federal negotiators. This change would provide more certainty to borrowers who receive a TPD discharge and align with the Department’s overarching efforts to bolster borrowers’ access to debt relief and minimize harmful and punitive consequences associated with borrowing.Closed School DischargesThe closure of an institution of higher education can have severe and life-altering consequences for enrolled students, even as corporate executives and private equity owners escape accountability, as witnessed during the precipitous closure of ITT Technical Institutes and Corinthian Colleges.[27] It is vital that the Department adopt a robust closed school discharge (CSD) rule and maintain a reliable and straightforward CSD process in order to ensure taxpayers and borrowers are not left paying the price when an institution collapses. As part of this effort, 23 Senate Democrats have called on the Department to reinstate the automatic CSD process and process discharges more quickly; eliminate restrictions that prevent students who transfer from receiving a CSD; and extend the look-back window that allows borrowers who left an institution prior to its official closure to access a CSD.[28]We are encouraged by the Department’s proposals to reinstate automatic closed school discharges and extend the look-back window from 120 to 180 days, with the option for a further extension in exceptional circumstances. We also appreciate and support the clarifications regarding what constitutes an exceptional circumstance, how the Department will identify a school’s closure date, and the definition of a program for purposes of the CSD regulations. However, while we appreciate the Department’s proposal to eliminate provisions that deny a CSD to students who transfer, we are concerned that the Department’s alternative—namely, denying a CSD to students who accept and complete a teach-out plan or agreement—will have similarly harmful consequences.Section 437(c)(1) of the HEA requires that the Secretary of Education discharge the loans received by any student who “is unable to complete the program in which such student is enrolled due to the closure of the institution” and makes no mention of transfers to other institutions.[29] As 23 Senate Democrats pointed out in the July 1, 2021, letter on debt relief, the current regulations denying a CSD to borrowers who transfer to another institution within 3 years of a college’s closure are inconsistent with the statute and should be eliminated.[30] Similarly, the HEA does not condition the receipt of a CSD on the rejection of a teach-out plan or agreement. For this reason, and the reasons outlined below, we urge the Department to eliminate these unnecessary restrictions and adopt regulations consistent with the HEA that provide an automatic CSD for any student who is unable to complete their program due to institutional closure, regardless of whether they subsequently transfer or accept or complete a teach-out plan or agreement.Under the Department’s regulations, a teach-out plan is only required to provide for the “equitable treatment of students” and include general details such as a list of currently enrolled students, academic programs offered by the institutions, and other institutions offering similar programs.[31] A student who accepts a teach-out plan does not have any assurance that they will be able to complete their program, much less that program completion will be possible in a timely fashion and with minimal disruption. It is unclear what the Department intends to accomplish by excluding students who “complete” a teach-out plan, but given that those students are not necessarily provided any pathway to transfer previously earned credits or to continue and complete their programs, it seems contrary to the Department’s stated goals to deny them access to an automatic CSD.Teach-out agreements, meanwhile, are subject to more stringent requirements, but still only provide for a “reasonable opportunity” for program completion and do not ensure that students will be able to transfer all (or even a majority) of their credits or access programs that are reasonably affordable (or even comparably priced).[32] As such, it is unreasonable to assume that all students who accept and complete a teach-out plan or agreement will receive their desired credential in a comparable program of study without suffering the consequences of an institutional closure. Even those students who do complete a comparable program through a teach-out plan or agreement may still experience major disruptions and incur significant costs re-taking coursework that does not transfer. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that students pursuing a teach-out plan or agreement will receive a credential that is of comparable value in the workforce as what they might have received had their original institution not closed, particularly given the reputational damage often associated with the closure of an institution. There is also no guarantee that a credential earned through a teach-out agreement will have the same programmatic accreditation as the student’s original program or that it will fulfill any relevant state licensure requirements.Accordingly, we urge the Department to strike the provisions denying a CSD to students who complete a teach-out plan or agreement, and, to the greatest extent practicable, accelerate the timeframe for providing automatic discharges given that the one-year monitoring period would no longer be necessary. If the Department is unwilling to make that change, we urge you to, at a bare minimum, remove the exclusion of students who complete teach-out plans and limit the exclusion of students who complete teach-out agreements to only those students who actually complete a comparable program within a reasonable amount of time (e.g., one year). The Department could also limit the exclusion to students who are able to transfer most or all of their previously earned credits. When a student takes longer to complete their program, or is unable to transfer most or all of their credits, they incur more costs (in both time and money) at their new institution retaking or completing additional credits and experience fewer benefits from the education they received at their previous institution prior to its closure. Lastly, if the Department does opt to restrict access to a CSD based on subsequent enrollment, it should, to the greatest extent practicable, automate data collection (e.g. by using CIP codes and NSLDS enrollment status) rather than requiring new reporting, which may be particularly challenging once institutions have closed and are no longer tracking students who have left.False Certification DischargesWhen an institution falsifies a student’s eligibility for Title IV aid, it should be the institution—not the student—who pays the price. However, as the Department’s preamble explains, the current false certification regulations include two sets of eligibility criteria, creating confusion and establishing different standards and processes for false certification discharges depending on when the loans were first disbursed. Additionally, some borrowers who may be eligible may not have received a discharge because of the difficulty in navigating unnecessarily complex requirements. Therefore, we applaud the Department’s proposal to streamline the false certification discharge process by providing one set of regulatory standards covering all false certification discharge claims. We also support the expansion of acceptable documentation, clarification of applicable dates, and creation of a group false certification discharge process included in the draft rules. These proposals represent a significant step forward for students who have been coerced or defrauded by their schools.The Department’s proposed rules will help to provide additional relief to struggling borrowers, protect students and taxpayers from fraud and abuse committed by institutions, and ensure our federal student loan program fulfills its promise to put higher education within reach for more students without subjecting them to complex, burdensome, or punitive requirements that make it harder to get the relief they are owed. As the Department works to finalize these regulations, we urge you to build on this progress by strengthening rules in other vital areas, including income-driven repayment and gainful employment. Thank you for your attention.Sincerely,###[1]Sen. Richard Durbin et al. to Sec.

The CHIPS and Science Act will invest in American manufacturing – especially in Washington state, which ranks among the top ten states in terms of its semiconductor manufacturing workforce. The bill will allow small and medium sized microchip manufacturers to expand and hire more workers, get products on the shelves faster, and lower costs on consumer electronics.

https://www.murray.senate.gov/senator-murray-applauds-president-biden-signing-the-honoring-our-pact-act-into-law/,"Senator Murray: “We’re talking about the largest expansion in VA services and medical care for toxic-exposed veterans in over 30 years and I couldn’t be more proud to see this bill become law.”(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, released the following statement on President Biden’s signing of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act (PACT Act) into law. Before this legislation was signed, VA denied more than 70 percent of disability claims related to burn pit exposure because of veterans’ inability to prove their illnesses or cancers are linked to exposure to burn pits. The PACT Act would, among other things, expand the toxic-exposure coverage for post-9/11 veterans and create a framework for coverage going forward.Senator Murray secured provisions in the PACT Act for $36 million to lease a new VA clinic in the Tri-Cities area. This follows concerns raised by local veterans on the major challenges they have faced accessing the care and services they need. The provision would allow VA to replace and expand services currently offered through the Richland Outpatient Clinic to enhance outpatient services, close space gaps, and reduce strains on the Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VA Medical Center in Walla Walla. The facility would ensure veterans in the Tri-Cities region have greater access to primary, specialty, and mental health care. This new VA clinic would be critical to ensure patients can receive the health services they need from a VA provider closer to where they live, create jobs for more VA staff, and improve the level of care provided to veterans. “For too long, so many toxic-exposed veterans in Washington state and around the country have suffered from deadly cancers, respiratory diseases, and other chronic illnesses as a result of their service, yet have struggled to get the VA care they need,” said Senator Murray. “No one who served our country should face hurdles getting the care or medical treatment they need as a result of their service. Thanks to the PACT Act, generations of toxic-exposed veterans, including over 124,000 in Washington state, will have expanded access to the medical services they desperately need, and VA will have the resources to help process claims efficiently and better serve our vets. We’re talking about the largest expansion in VA services and medical care for toxic-exposed veterans in over 30 years and I couldn’t be more proud to see this bill become law.”“I’m especially glad I was able to secure $36 million in federal dollars for a new VA clinic in the Tri-Cities and help make a real difference in the quality of care available to veterans in Central Washington,” continued Senator Murray. “This bill is important and meaningful progress in living up to our promise, and will ensure all of our vets—across all generations—get the very best VA has to offer.”Among its many priorities, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022 will:As a voice for Washington state’s veterans in the Senate, Senator Murray has been consistently fighting to make sure our country fulfills its promise to our veterans and their families, voting last week to send the PACT Act to the President’s desk. In June, Senator Murray spoke on the Senate floor calling for swift passage of the PACT Act. In May, she introduced the Helping Heroes Act, new legislation to support the families of disabled veterans, including children who take on caregiving roles. Senator Murray is also a cosponsor of the BUILD for Veterans Act, which would help VA build new facilities that would better meet the needs of current and future veterans – including women veterans, veterans in need of long-term care and veterans with spinal cord injuries and diseases.Senator Murray has led the fight to ensure VA expands fertility treatment and adoption services for veterans and their families through her Veteran Families Health Services Act. She is pushing VA to prioritize the long-term care needs of all veterans—including women veterans, veterans of color, LGBTQ+ veterans, and veterans with disabilities. Murray has also authored legislation that will give servicemembers the tools they need to build real financial security into retirement.A one-pager on the bill can be found HERE.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/washington-to-get-nearly-100-million-in-infrastructure-investments-through-raise-grants/,"Murray, Cantwell announce key federal infrastructure funding coming to Washington stateWASHINGTON, D.C – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Chair of the Commerce, Science, and Technology Committee, announced nearly $100 million in Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grant funding for Washington state. RAISE grants, which were originally created under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act as TIGER grants, can be used for a wide variety of infrastructure projects with local or regional impact.This is the most Washington state has ever been awarded. Washington state was awarded the second-most grants of any state and received the fourth most in total funding. The state also received a total of 4.35 percent of the RAISE funding available this year, whereas for highway formula funds, Washington state receives 2.2 percent of the funding available.Senator Murray originally created the RAISE program (previously known as TIGER and BUILD) in 2009 and has been a longtime supporter of the program, most recently helping secure $7.5 billion for the RAISE program. The program is funded specifically via the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, which Senator Murray is a member of.As chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator Cantwell worked to authorize the RAISE grant program for the first time ever in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which provided the program with $7.5 billion over five years, a 50 percent increase in funding.The following RAISE grants were awarded to Washington state projects:Lummi Island Ferry Replacement and System Modernization Project, Whatcom County – $25 million“As someone who relies on our state’s ferry system, I know just how important this investment is. These federal dollars will help replace the 60-year-old ferry with a safer, greener ferry that will also allow for more riders,” said Senator Murray. “This is a win for jobs, for clean energy, and for anyone who relies on the ferry service. I created the RAISE program to help make infrastructure projects like this one a reality, and as a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I’m going to keep working to secure the federal dollars Washington state needs to keep moving forward.”“With over 1,000 permanent residents on Lummi Island, we know how critical having frequent, reliable ferry service is. This $25 million grant award will fully fund the replacement of the 60-year-old Whatcom Chief with a state of the art battery-electric hybrid ferry. This new ferry will nearly double vehicle and passenger capacity, reduce carbon emissions, and will serve residents and visitors to Lummi Island for the foreseeable future,” Sen. Cantwell said.Lummi Island is a rural community with the ferry producing the only connection between the island and the mainland of Whatcom County. The ferry is one of the state’s oldest vessels and is well past the end of its useful life. The RAISE grant for the Lummi Island Ferry Replacement and System Modernization Project will help replace the ferry with a battery-hybrid vessel that would reduce emissions and increase affordable ridership capacity commensurate with demand. This funding comes following a letter of support written by Senator Murray to Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg in March.Poplar Way Bridge Project, City of Lynnwood – $25 million“A new Poplar Way Bridge in Lynnwood would mean less traffic, safer travel for bikers and pedestrians, and more access to forthcoming public transportation options when Lynnwood Link is completed,” said Senator Murray. “These RAISE grants are going to make a world of difference in these communities whether it’s safer streets, shorter commutes, or cleaner air. I created the RAISE program to help make infrastructure projects like this one a reality, and as a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I’m going to keep working to secure the federal dollars Washington state needs to keep moving forward.”“This $25 million grant will fully fund the construction of Poplar Way Bridge, improving multimodal access into Lynnwood while also reducing regional congestion on I-5. Lynnwood’s population has grown by 13 percent since 2010, and with a new Sound Transit Light Rail station expected to open by 2024, Poplar Way Bridge will allow the city to accommodate future growth,” Sen. Cantwell said.The $25 million grant will go towards the construction of a new six lane bridge, the Lynnwood Poplar Way Bridge, over I-5 that would support car, bike, and pedestrian traffic. The new bridge will reduce congestion in the City of Lynnwood, provide an alternate route for emergency vehicles, and improve access to the Lynnwood Link light rail, scheduled to open in 2024. This funding comes following a letter of support written by Senator Murray to Secretary Buttigieg in March.Bothell Way Multimodal Improvement project, City of Bothell — $19 million“No matter where we live, we all want safer streets – and that’s exactly what this RAISE grant will go towards in Bothell,” said Senator Murray. “The project is going to make the roads safer for buses, motorists, and bikers trying to go to the grocery store or pick their kids up from school. I created the RAISE program to help make infrastructure projects like this one a reality, and as a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I’m going to keep working to secure the federal dollars Washington state needs to keep moving forward.”“As Bothell continues to grow over the coming decades, average daily traffic on Bothell Way is expected to double. This $19 million grant will fully fund multimodal and freight improvements on Bothell Way by reconstructing and widening 1.3 miles of highway — improving freight mobility, safety, and transit access for all highway users,” Sen. Cantwell said.The $19 million dollar RAISE grant will provide vital improvements to the Bothell’s transportation system and address key safety concerns in the communities. The project will reconstruct and widen roadways, install bus rapid transit lines, and construct protected bike lanes to reduce interaction between motorists and bikers. It will also help install adaptive traffic signals to enhance safety and improve traffic flow, and well as provide for the construction of new sidewalks to connect residential and retail areas. This funding comes following a letter of support written by Senator Murray in July.Pines Road/Burlington Northern Santa Fe Grade (BNSF) Separation Project, City of Spokane Valley — $21.7 million“Pines Road is one of Spokane Valley’s busiest streets and, thanks to this grant funding, we are reducing congestion on Pines Road and expanding public transportation access so everyone can get where they need to go quickly and safely,” saidSenator Murray. “These projects are critical to ensuring workers get to work on time, kids get to school on time, and reducing our emissions so our air is cleaner. I created the RAISE program to help make infrastructure projects like this one a reality, and as a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I’m going to keep working to secure the federal dollars Washington state needs to keep moving forward.”“Last year, the Spokane Valley’s Pines Road crossing of the BNSF mainline resulted in over 26,000 vehicle hours of delay. This crossing sees over 15,000 vehicles and 67 trains per day and saw 9 recorded collisions in 2021. This $21.7 million in grant funding will increase safety by fully replacing an existing at-grade crossing with an underpass of BNSF’s railroad tracks, and will keep vehicle and freight traffic moving by constructing a multi-lane roundabout,” Sen. Cantwell said.Pines Road is one of the most heavily traveled roads in Spokane Valley. The $21.7 million RAISE grant for the Pines Road BNSF Grade Crossing Elimination Project will construct a new roundabout at the intersection of Pines Road and Trent Road, both of which are state highways. It also provides for constructing a new rail underpass at Pines Road that would expand capacity from one track to four and expanding bus service routes. The project will also add a new parking lot with electric vehicle charging stations and a new trailhead facility to provide access to the Centennial Trail and the Spokane River. Senator Murray also secured $5 million in Congressionally Directed Spending this year for the Pines Road project. This RAISE funding comes following a letter of support written by Senator Murray to Secretary Buttigieg in May.Airport Road Multimodal & Regional Access Improvements Project, City of Pullman – $5 million“Airport Road is a critical artery for so many drivers in Pullman and the surrounding area, but right now is not built for any other kind of transit,” said Senator Murray. “This planning grant will help the city implement their complete streets policy around the city so that walkers and bikers can safely community on Airport Road and around Pullman. These kinds of investments make our communities stronger and better places to live and raise a family and I am proud to fund projects like these in Washington state.”“Pullman-Moscow Airport is an economic driver for the region, supporting nearly 1,000 jobs with an economic impact of $130 million annually. These funds will support efforts to increase the capacity of Airport Road which will improve access for students, business travelers, and workers as the airport continues to grow,” Sen. Cantwell said.Right now, Airport Road in Pullman is limited to motorized vehicles. The City of Pullman Airport Road Multimodal & Regional Access Improvements Project will design a road to expand access to alternative forms of transportation and improve access to the airport for communities in the region. This will be especially important given the recent announcement of Pullman-Moscow Airport’s terminal expansion. The grant funding will ensure that these projects are shovel-ready once the city acquires capital funding. This funding comes following a letter of support written by Senator Murray to Secretary Buttigieg in April.Yakima County Heritage Connectivity Trails project, Yakima County – $1 million“Safety and connectivity are two absolutely critical parts of any transportation system and this planning grant will help improve both in Yakima County,” said Senator Murray. “Right now, Yakima County experiences more fatal collisions between pedestrians and automobiles than anywhere else in Washington state. This project will help address that by building more trails that connect people to the resources they need so that walkers and drivers stay a safe distance from each other. This is a really important project in our state and I am really proud to help get Yakima County critical funding with this grant.”“There have been 26 crashes involving pedestrians in the Heritage Connectivity Trails project area over the last decade, 80 percent of which resulted in serious injury or death. This funding will support efforts by the Yakima Nation and the state to improve safety and walkability of this dangerous stretch along US 97,” Sen. Cantwell said.Native Americans are disproportionately represented in serious injury and fatal traffic collisions in Washington State, with the Yakama Nation experiencing the highest rate in the state.

Projects like this one are so important to our state and I am proud to help secure these federal dollars to help make them a reality.”“Access to quality and affordable transportation is critical to improving economic mobility. These planning funds will assist the state with improving multimodal transportation options for the residents of both Spokane’s East Central Neighborhood and Seattle’s Judkins Park Neighborhood, both of which have poverty levels double their cities’ average,” Sen. Cantwell said.This $5 million planning grant will help connect communities in Seattle and Spokane connect to I-90 more easily and provide greater access to future mass transit options like light rail. WSDOT will also use lessons learned from these two areas to develop a toolkit for implementing analytical methods and safety measures introduced in the recently completed Active Transportation Plan across the state.RAISE Grants Awarded to Washington State in the Last Five Years include:###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Murray on IRA Keeping Health Care Costs Low: “Stress Off Patients’ Shoulders, Money in Their Pockets” – MORE HEREICYMI: Senator Murray Statement on IRA’s Historic Steps to Lower Americans’ Prescription Drug Costs – MORE HEREICYMI: Senator Murray On Largest Climate Change Investment in History in the Inflation Reduction Act – MORE HERE***WATCH: Senator Murray Delivers Floor Remarks on Inflation Reduction Act***(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) helped pass the Inflation Reduction Act, a historic piece of legislation that will lower health care costs and deliver the largest-ever investment in climate action—lowering energy costs, promoting energy independence, and creating good-paying jobs.  The Inflation Reduction Act is fully paid for by ensuring the very wealthiest and giant corporations simply pay their fair share and would actually reduce the deficit by more than $300 billion.“No one should have to worry about whether they can afford the health care or medicine they need. This bill will finally give Medicare power to force drug companies to the bargaining table and negotiate lower drug prices for patients across the country. And for seniors who are often on fixed incomes: we are going to cap the price of insulin at just $35 per month, cap out-of-pocket costs, and we are stopping big pharma from jacking up the cost of their drugs—forcing them to limit price increases to inflation,” said Senator Murray of the Inflation Reduction Act’s prescription drug provisions. “Lifesaving medicine doesn’t do any good if people can’t afford it—and this legislation makes meaningful progress toward making sure people don’t have to empty their savings account just so they can fill their prescription.”“This bill helps people get quality, affordable insurance too, by extending the health care tax credits we passed in the American Rescue Plan—that makes a difference right now for millions of people,” said Senator Murray of the Inflation Reduction Act’s health care provisions. “More than 100,000 people found coverage on Washington state’s exchange for no more than $100 a month because of these tax credits. These aren’t just words on paper and it’s not just about saving patients’ money—this will save lives. We are helping patients who are rationing their prescriptions to make ends meet, or who are afraid to see their doctors—not because they are scared of getting a diagnosis, but because they are scared of the price tag. And I am going to keep building on this momentum with even more bold policies to ensure health care is truly a right, not a privilege, for everyone in our country.”“I talk to young people in Seattle who are urgently calling on Congress to take bold climate action and families in Yakima County who are deeply concerned by a wildfire season that seems to get worse and worse every year—the climate crisis is here and it’s time we take action,” continued Senator Murray on the Inflation Reduction Act’s climate and energy provisions. “This historic legislation will be the largest-ever investment in climate action in our country’s history. Washington state is uniquely poised to take full advantage of federal clean energy tax credits and grants that will deliver lower energy costs for consumers, millions of good-paying jobs, and promote real energy independence.”“And finally—this legislation won’t just bring down families’ every day costs, it will bring down the deficit—by more than $300 billion,” said Senator Murray in closing on the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax provisions. “Because every cent of this bill is paid for—and then some—by simply ensuring giant corporations pay their fair share in taxes. There’s no reason a billion dollar corporation should pay less in taxes than a firefighter or a teacher in Walla Walla, Washington—just because the current system lets them skirt or even plain cheat on their taxes. That’s not right. And Democrats won’t let it fly any longer and no working or middle-class family in Washington state will see their taxes go up one penny.”LOWERING PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS:The Inflation Reduction Act will finally allow Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug costs—something Senator Murray has been fighting to do for years—bringing down costs for patients and generating enormous savings for taxpayers. It will cap Medicare beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket prescription drugs costs at $2,000 a year, cap their insulin costs at $35 a month, and cap price increases on their prescriptions at the rate of inflation so that drug makers cannot jack up prices to juice their own profits—helping Washington state’s more than 1.4 Medicare recipients save money on their prescriptions. LOWERING HEALTH CARE COSTS:The Inflation Reduction Act will extend—for three full years—the health care tax credits Senator Murray championed in the American Rescue Plan to keep saving families money on health care. The tax credits have saved millions of Americans thousands of dollars on health care, spurred record enrollment on the exchanges, and helped bring our nation’s uninsured rate to an all-time low. In Washington state, more than 60,000 new people have enrolled in coverage, two in five have found coverage for less than $100 a month, and 40,000 people have found coverage on Washington’s exchange for less than $10 a month.BUILDING A STRONGER CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY, LOWERING ENERGY COSTS AND EMISSIONS:Washington state is a leader on tackling the climate crisis and the Inflation Reduction Act would only bolster those efforts. The Inflation Reduction Act would establish major cost-saving benefits for Washington state consumers with home energy rebates and consumer tax credits to invest in energy efficiency— rooftop solar, heat pumps, appliances, and more. It would also establish $4,000 tax credits for consumers purchasing used clean vehicles and up to $7,500 for new clean vehicles—encouraging manufacturers to put more clean vehicles on the market.The climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act would implement major clean energy tax credits and grants that would spur a historic, first-of-its-kind economy-wide transition to clean energy—from our utilities to manufacturing industry. This would help build on and expand existing solar and wind energy production in Central and Eastern Washington to move us towards sustainable energy independence and takes steps to help rural communities and farmers across Washington state adapt to a rapidly changing climate.The Inflation Reduction Act will help electrify ports like the Port of Seattle to help cut those emissions and make the air around them safer to breathe. The Inflation Reduction Act also funds research and development into cleaner aviation fuel and technology – much of which happens in Washington state.You can find a summary on the climate and energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act here.FULLY PAID FOR AND LOWERS THE DEFICIT BY ENSURING GIANT CORPORATIONS PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE:The Inflation Reduction Act would invest in re-building the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to go after giant corporations and the very wealthiest cheating on their taxes. Importantly, it imposes a 15% Corporate Minimum Tax to ensure the wealthiest Americans and corporations simply pay their fair share of taxes. In sum, the revenue raising provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act will help reduce the deficit by more than $300 billion.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

These investments will be especially impactful in Washington state where we are experiencing climate impacts like dangerous heat waves first hand, and state leaders and business innovators have been on the forefront of clean energy solutions.

The measure is a critical step in the process of Sweden and Finland joining NATO, strengthening both Europe and the United States’ security interests and serving as a bulwark against continued Russian aggression in Europe. All 30 current members of NATO are expected to vote to allow Sweden and Finland to join. Following her vote, Senator Murray issued the following statement:“Putin’s brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has underscored just how critical strong alliances like NATO are. So much of our strength and security comes from our unity and I am glad that the Senate has overwhelmingly voted to allow Sweden and Finland – two countries that share our values and goals – to join NATO.  This measure will help keep America and our allies safe—and deter any further aggression by Russia in the region. As long as dictators like Putin threaten our friends and neighbors—free and peaceful democracies—it’s important that Congress sends the message loud and clear: the United States will always defend freedom and oppose tyranny.”Senator Murray has been steadfast in her support for Ukraine and committed to holding Putin accountable for his unprovoked war of aggression and heinous war crimes. In April, Senator Murray helped impose sweeping sanctions on Russia and revoke Russia’s normal trade relations following its invasion of Ukraine. In March and May, she voted for bills that sent Ukraine economic, military, and humanitarian assistance to help fend off the invasion from Russia. ###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/republican-senator-blocks-bill-to-protect-doctors-providing-legal-abortion-care-from-extreme-attacks/,"Senator Braun blocks the Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act***WATCH: Senator Murray calls out Republicans’ extreme agenda***(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), sought unanimous consent to pass her Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act to protect doctors’ ability to safely provide abortion care in states where it remains legal like Washington state—but Republican Senator Mike Braun (R-IN) blocked the straightforward and urgently-needed legislation.Senator Murray and her Democratic colleagues took to the floor to swiftly pass the legislation as Republican elected officials in states across the country threaten legal action against doctors for providing legal abortion care—and have even drafted legislation that would make it a crime to perform an abortion even when the patient’s life is at risk or the doctor is practicing in a state where abortion is legally permitted. In Indiana, Dr. Caitlin Bernard is facing legal threats after providing legal abortion care to a 10-year-old rape victim who was forced to cross state lines. Dr. Bernard has endorsed the legislation.“Doctors are following the law—but still facing legal threats and harassment. Right now, in Indiana, a doctor is being investigated after providing an abortion for a 10-year-old who was raped. Think about that. A doctor is being investigated after doing their job, after simply providing health care,” said Senator Murray. “The fact Dr. Bernard is being investigated, after just doing her job and helping her patient, is chilling. And I want to be very clear: while Dr. Bernard’s story may be in headlines across the country: she is not the only doctor facing threats, and she will not be the last. At this very moment, Republican state lawmakers are drafting legislation that would make it a crime to provide abortion care to a resident even in another state where it’s legal.”“Today, we offered a bill to protect doctors performing legal abortions. They blocked that too,” added Senator Murray. “We have seen time and time again over the last few weeks that when it comes to protecting rights and providing health care for women, patients, and families, Republicans’ promises are empty, and their positions are extreme.”Senator Murray introduced the Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act alongside Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Senator Alex Padilla (D-CA), Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), and 22 of their Democratic colleagues earlier this week. The legislation would help protect against Republicans’ attacks, ensuring that providers in states where abortion remains legal are protected from any efforts to restrict their practice or create uncertainty about their legal liability.Senator Murray’s remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below:“I’d like to start by recognizing the overwhelming victory for the right to abortion in Kansas last night.“Since the day the Supreme Court struck down the right to abortion, and upended the lives of women across the country, the American people have been using their voices to speak out against Republicans’ extreme bans.“And now—for the first time since the Dobbs decision—they’ve had the chance to speak with their votes. And they sent a message loud and clear. “People do not want their fundamental rights stripped away.“They will not forget Republicans cruelty in dragging us back half a century.“And when abortion is at stake, they are not staying on the sidelines.“M. President, last night the people of Kansas sent a message as clear as any I have ever seen in politics.“Now, today, we’re going to see if Republicans are finally getting that message—or if they are continuing to ignore the American people.“Because Democrats are here today with legislation to protect doctors providing legal abortion care and ensure they can do their jobs, practice medicine, and save lives without threat of legal action.“I really cannot believe we need this bill at all—we’re talking about doctors who are following the law, and simply want to provide care to their patients.“But that’s where Republicans have dragged this country.“It’s not enough for Republicans that their cruel abortion bans have meant: appointments cancelled, prescriptions denied, and doctors forced to wait until patients get sicker—wait until women are at death’s door—before they can provide lifesaving care.“No—they’re going further than that.“Now they’re coming after doctors providing legal abortion care too.“I really cannot emphasize that enough: these doctors are following the law—but still facing legal threats and harassment.“Right now, in Indiana, a doctor is being investigated after providing an abortion for a 10-year-old who was raped.“Think about that. A doctor is being investigated after doing their job, after simply providing health care—care that can be lifesaving care that was entirely legal in her state, care that—up until Republicans’ far-right Supreme Court overturned Roe—was legal across the country.“The fact Dr. Bernard is being investigated, after just doing her job and helping her patient, is chilling.“And I want to be very clear: while Dr. Bernard’s story may be in headlines across the country: she is not the only doctor facing threats, and she will not be the last.“At this very moment, Republican state lawmakers are drafting legislation that would make it a crime to provide abortion care to a resident even in another state where it’s legal.“From talking with doctors back home, I can tell you they are following this closely, and they are worried.“I’ve heard from providers back in Spokane, and across Washington state, who are worried they could face lawsuits that threaten their practices and their livelihoods just for doing their jobs, just for providing care their patients need—care that is, once again, completely legal in my state.“So Democrats are standing up for doctors.“We have been drafting a bill of our own—the Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act—and we’re so proud to say that Dr. Bernard herself supports this bill.“And I’d also like to thank my colleagues, the junior Senator from Nevada, the junior Senator from New Mexico, and the junior Senator from California for their partnership on this bill.“As well as my colleague Representative Schrier from my home state of Washington, who is leading this legislation in the House.“This is another simple bill to address a threat we know is far too real.“The Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act will protect doctors providing legal abortion care, and ensure they can practice medicine and save lives without fear of legal threats and intimidation.“It will make clear that the attacks we have seen on doctors are unacceptable. That politicians should not be harassing, scaring, investigating, threatening, or punishing doctors for providing care that is perfectly legal, that patients want, and that—in many cases—is even necessary to save lives.“Democrats are going to try to pass this bill right now, because we believe no doctor should be punished for caring for patients and providing legal abortion care.“And if Republicans who have claimed they ‘don’t want to punish doctors,’ actually mean it—if those words are more than another empty talking point, more than another broken promise—they will stay out of the way and let us get this done.“But if they don’t—if they block us like they blocked legislation to protect the right to travel across state lines for an abortion, like they blocked legislation to expand family planning services, like they blocked legislation to protect the right to contraceptives—their obstruction will continue to speak louder than any of their hollow claims about caring for patients, families, and women.“And even if they stop us from getting this bill done today, they are not going to stop us from continuing to put them on the record and hold them accountable for their true positions. They are not going to stop us from doing everything we can to protect the rights—and the people—they are putting in such grave danger.“And they are going to have to answer to the people they represent—to the patients, providers, and families whose lives they are turning upside down.”###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

The PACT Act, which President Biden is expected to sign, will expand the toxic-exposure coverage for post-9/11 veterans and create a framework for coverage going forward. Last week, Senate Republicans blocked the PACT Act – a bill 25 of them previously voted to pass – as retaliation for Senate Democrats announcing the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.Importantly, Senator Murray secured notable provisions to authorize and invest $36 million to lease a new VA clinic in the Tri-Cities area. This follows concerns raised by local veterans on the major challenges they have faced accessing the care and services they need. The provision would allow VA to replace and expand services currently offered through the Richland Outpatient Clinic to enhance outpatient services, close space gaps, and reduce strains on the Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VA Medical Center in Walla Walla. The facility would ensure veterans in the Tri-Cities region have greater access to primary, specialty, and mental health care. This new VA clinic would be critical to ensure patients can receive the health services they need from a VA provider closer to where they live, create jobs for more VA staff, and improve the level of care provided to veterans. “With this bill, generations of toxic-exposed Washington state veterans will finally be able to get the high-quality care they need and have earned, and VA will get the resources needed to process claims efficiently and better serve our vets.” said Senator Murray. “There’s a lot we need to do to really make sure the VA works for veterans, but passing the PACT Act will make a difference and save lives.”“Importantly, I’m glad I was able to secure $36 million in federal funding in this legislation to help build a new VA clinic in the Tri-Cities,” added Senator Murray. “I believe strongly that no veteran should be driving hours to get the care they’ve earned. Building a new VA clinic in the Tri-Cities is going to help reduce the strain on the VA in Walla Walla and really make a difference in the quality of care for our veterans right here in Central Washington.”“It’s downright shameful that Senate Republicans blocked this from passing last week,” Senator Murray said. “Democrats voted to make sure veterans get the health care they’ve earned. Republicans did not. They decided to play political games at the expense of sick veterans – that’s wrong but I’m glad this bill is finally headed to the President’s desk.”Among its many priorities, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022 will:As a voice for Washington state’s veterans in the Senate, Senator Murray has been consistently fighting to make sure our country fulfills its promise to our veterans and their families. Senator Murray recently spoke on the Senate floor calling for swift passage of the PACT Act. In May, she introduced the Helping Heroes Act, new legislation to support the families of disabled veterans, including children who take on caregiving roles. Senator Murray is also a cosponsor of the BUILD for Veterans Act, which would help VA build new facilities that would better meet the needs of current and future veterans – including women veterans, veterans in need of long-term care and veterans with spinal cord injuries and diseases.Senator Murray has led the fight to ensure VA expands fertility treatment and adoption services for veterans and their families through her Veteran Families Health Services Act. She is pushing VA to prioritize the long-term care needs of all veterans—including women veterans, veterans of color, LGBTQ+ veterans, and veterans with disabilities. Murray has also authored legislation that will give servicemembers the tools they need to build real financial security into retirement.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

That’s not just cruel—it also flies in the face of federal laws.”(Washington, DC) — Today, Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), issued the following statement on Attorney General Merrick Garland’s announcement that the Department of Justice (DOJ) is suing Idaho over its extreme abortion ban, which does not include exceptions when the health of the mother is at risk. The lawsuit alleges the ban violates the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which protects patients’ access to emergency medical treatment, and seeks an injunction on the ban to the extent that it conflicts with EMTALA. The announcement marks DOJ’s first post-Roe challenge of state abortion restrictions.“The abortion ban in Idaho—which doesn’t include an exception when the health of the mother is at risk—will force patients to cross state lines and come to Washington state just to get the abortion care they need, even in an emergency. We’re talking about women facing urgent situations, forced to delay treatment and find a way to travel—with their health on the line. That’s not just cruel—it also flies in the face of federal laws on emergency medical care.“I’m glad to see the Biden Administration and the Department of Justice act today to challenge Idaho’s cruel law and fight to protect women’s health.

This week, the Senators will take to the Senate floor to seek unanimous consent to pass the legislation.“Doctors shouldn’t be punished for providing their patients with legal abortion care—full stop. The legal threats, the intimidation, and the non-stop attacks from Republicans against abortion providers are unacceptable, and Democrats are fighting back,” said Senator Murray. “This bill is simple: it protects doctors providing legal abortion care, and ensures they can practice medicine and save lives without threat. It’s urgent that we protect the doctors so many women depend on, so this week we’re calling for unanimous consent to get this done—and Republicans will either stand aside so we can pass this bill, or show once and for all that their messaging that they ‘don’t want to punish doctors’ is hollow.”Republicans’ nonstop attacks against women’s reproductive freedom have long targeted doctors, with state laws like Texas’ SB8 allowing for anyone to bring a lawsuit against an abortion provider. But in the wake of theSupreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, these attacks have ramped up—with Republican state legislators drafting legislation that would make it a crime to perform an abortion on a state resident even in another state where abortion is legal. And already, abortion providers are facing non-stop attacks from Republican politicians, including Dr. Caitlin Bernard—an abortion provider who is facing legal threats after providing legal abortion care to a 10-year-old rape victim who was forced to cross state lines. Dr. Bernard’s case is emblematic of what abortion providers across the country are facing, as Republicans lob legal threats and intimidate doctors providing legal abortion care.The Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act will help protect against these attacks, ensuring that providers in states where abortion remains legal are protected from any efforts to restrict their practice or create uncertainty about their legal liability.“As a full-spectrum OBGYN and abortion provider, I wholeheartedly appreciate the Senate’s effort to create legislation that protects our ability to provide important reproductive healthcare for our patients. I have experienced personal and professional harassment for simply doing my job, including inflammatory and intimidating statements from the highest levels of my home state government and threats of violence from people I have never met. This behavior cannot continue,” said Dr. Caitlin Bernard, who has endorsed the legislation. “Living in a state with one of the highest maternal mortality risks and with a severe shortage of OBGYN specialists, I can say firsthand how much people in my state need the care I and other OBGYNs provide. If we do not stop this state-sanctioned harassment, we will lose OBGYNs and health risks will increase substantially. I stand with our Senators to promote the Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act to preserve our ability provide important health services in my home state, including abortion care.”“Imagine looking someone in the eye and saying: ‘I have all the skills and the tools to help you, but our state’s politicians have told me I can’t,’” said Dr. Nisha Verma with Physicians for Reproductive Health. “As a doctor, I am being forced to grapple with impossible situations more and more – situations where the laws of my state directly violate the medical expertise I gained through years of training and the oath I took to provide the best care to my patients. I am heartbroken that the people in my communities in the South are not able to access the same quality of care as those living in other parts of the country, not because their doctors don’t have the skills or knowledge to provide that care, but because they are prohibited from doing so by abortion bans that are based solely on politics. Politics. Not medicine.”“Being an abortion provider means being for our communities, supporting them and providing care in the way they want or need. It also means living with the threat of surveillance, harassment, intimidation and violence from those that seek to eliminate abortion access and harm providers of this care. This is our reality,” said Dr. Jamila Perritt, an OBGYN and President & CEO of Physicians for Reproductive Health. “Considering the long history of harm against abortion providers, I am glad to see Congress introducing the Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act. Every person – abortion providers, supporters, staff, every person in our community deserves support and protection. We deserve to what we are trained to do: provide comprehensive reproductive health care that patients need without bias, shame, or stigma. We deserve to provide this essential health care without violence or harassment.”The Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act will ensure that providers in states where abortion remains legal are protected from any efforts to restrict their practice or create uncertainty about their legal liability. Specifically, the bill will:In addition to Senators Murray, Luján, Padilla, and Rosen, the legislation is also co-sponsored by Senators Schumer (D-NY), Bennet (D-CO), Markey (D-MA), Stabenow (D-MI), Heinrich (D-NM), Blumenthal (D-CT), Wyden (D-OR), Warren (D-MA), Merkley (D-OR), Smith (D-MN), Van Hollen (D-MD), Cardin (D-MD), Menendez (D-NJ), Klobuchar (D-MN), Murphy (D-CT), Reed (D-RI), Cortez Masto (D-NV), Whitehouse (D-RI), Hirono (D-HI), Sanders (I-VT), and Duckworth (D-IL).The bill has been endorsed by: Dr. Caitlin Bernard, Physicians for Reproductive Health, the National Women’s Law Center, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Catholics for Choice, the National Partnership for Women & Families, the Center for Reproductive Rights, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and the National Council of Jewish Women.Read full text of the legislation here. Read a one-pager here.Senator Murray’s remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below:“Hi everyone, thanks so much for being here today.“And a big thanks especially to Senators Rosen, Luján, and Padilla for their partnership on this bill.“And to my colleague Representative Schrier from my home state of Washington, for leading this legislation in the House.“Our bill—the Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act—is really straightforward. It protects doctors providing legal abortion care and ensures they can do their jobs, practice medicine, and save lives without threat of legal action.“No doctor should ever be punished for caring for patients and providing legal abortion care, but that’s exactly what extreme Republicans are doing across the country.“This is the terrifying reality we are living in.“Right now, Republican state lawmakers are drafting legislation that would make it a crime to provide abortion care to a resident even in another state where it’s legal.“That means doctors in Washington state who are just doing their jobs… who are just providing the care that their patients need—care that is legal by the way—could face lawsuits that threaten their practices and their livelihoods.“And make no mistake—Republicans aren’t waiting to pass laws to threaten and intimidate doctors providing abortion care.“Right now, in Indiana, a doctor is being investigated after providing an abortion for a 10-year-old who was raped.“Think about that. A doctor is being investigated after doing their job, after simply providing health care—care that can be lifesaving, care that was entirely legal in her state, care that—up until Republicans’ far-right Supreme Court overturned Roe—was legal across the country.“The fact Dr. Bernard is being investigated, after just doing her job and helping her patient, is chilling.“And it’s just the latest in the parade of atrocities caused by Republicans’ extremism.“And I want to be very clear: while Dr. Bernard’s story may be in headlines across the country: she is not the only doctor facing threats, and she will not be the last.“That’s why I’m so glad to have providers—like Dr. Bernard, and like Dr. Verma, who is with us today—who are willing to speak out and make clear to the world the threat they are facing, and the terrifying stakes if they are prevented from providing the legal reproductive health care that so many women depend on.“That’s why I’m so proud to stand alongside them and make crystal clear that doctors should not be punished.“Republicans like to claim they don’t believe in punishing doctors either: but the threats, the intimidation, the laws they are drafting—they all say otherwise.“So we are going to keep putting them on the record as to where they actually stand.“Which is why this week, Senator Luján, Senator Padilla, Senator Rosen, and I will work to pass the Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act. “This is once again a simple bill to address a threat we know is far too real.“This bill will protect doctors providing legal abortion care, and ensure they can practice medicine and save lives without fear of legal threats and intimidation.“It will make clear that the attacks we have seen on doctors are unacceptable. That politicians should not be harassing, scaring, investigating, threatening, or punishing doctors for providing care that is perfectly legal, that patients want, and that—in many cases—is even necessary to save their lives.“So to all the Republicans who have claimed they “don’t want to punish doctors,”“If you want to show that your word is more than another empty talking point, more than another broken promise.“This is a no-brainer—let us pass this bill this week.“But if they don’t—if they block us like they blocked legislation to protect the right to travel across state lines for an abortion, like they blocked legislation to expand family planning services, like they blocked legislation to protect the right to contraceptives—their obstruction will continue to speak louder than any of their hollow claims about caring for patients, families, and women.“And Democrats will continue fighting to protect the rights—and to protect the people—Republicans have put in such grave danger. “Thank you, and now I’ll turn it over to Dr. Verma.”###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

The nearly $230 million secured by Senator Murray represents a 98% percent increase over last year and will fund critical projects across the state, create jobs, expand support services, and more. Implementation of Senator Murray’s Congressionally-directed spending requests will be contingent upon passage of the fiscal year 2023 appropriations bill drafts which have been released by the Senate Appropriations Committee.“It’s my job in the Senate to make sure that Washington state’s priorities are the federal government’s priorities. I talk with constituents from every community from every part of our state, and I know the needs of Washington state’s families better than any well-meaning bureaucrat in DC,” said Senator Murray. “Congressionally-directed spending is just another way I can make sure Washington state communities are heard in the other Washington—whether it’s securing direct funding for salmon recovery, affordable housing, or local infrastructure needs. I listen to people from every part of Washington state, and then I bring their voices with me to make sure that the issues they care about are reflected in the laws we pass here in Congress.”Among the projects for which Senator Murray secured funding:The investments secured by Senator Murray will touch every corner of the state and address the issues Washington state families care about most. That includes funding to expand local affordable housing options, major investments in salmon recovery, local infrastructure needs, mental health investments, workforce development programs, support programs for Washington state veterans, and much more.As the second-ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Murray has been instrumental in securing major federal investments for Washington state priorities. Overall, Senator Murray secured hundreds of millions of dollars in direct funding for local community projects across Washington state.

This past March, in the fiscal year 2022 Senate Appropriations bills, Senator Murray secured more than $116 million in Congressionally-directed spending for local projects across Washington state.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/major-upgrades-expected-for-washington-ports-rivers-salmon-wetlands-as-water-resources-development-act-passes-senate/,"Murray, Cantwell, Push Forward Critical Port, Water and Salmon Projects Today, the Senate passed the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2022 by a vote of 93-1. U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA) fought to secure language in the bill that would provide funding for critical port, water resource and salmon restoration projects in Washington state. The Senate will now work with the House of Representatives to move a bicameral bill forward to be considered by the House and Senate.“Salmon recovery has got to be a major federal priority—it’s my job to make sure it is and this year’s Water Resources Development Act has us headed in the right direction,” said Senator Murray. “The provisions Senator Cantwell and I fought to secure will go a long way in restoring critical salmon habitat, make important investments our water transportation infrastructure, and helping to ensure every family has access to clean, safe drinking water. This legislation is good news for our salmon, good news for our ports, and good news for our entire state.”“Senate passage of the Water Resources Development Act is a major step forward for Washington state waterways, ports, and salmon,” said Senator Cantwell. “This funding will support key infrastructure projects, like deepening the Blair waterway in Tacoma to increase competitiveness at the port and dredging the Port of Clarkston to boost tourism, it will open more than 100 miles of salmon habitat by constructing fish passage at Howard Hanson Dam, and support water storage innovations, like ground water and aquifer storage. I look forward to ensuring that these and other Washington state projects get underway soon.”Below is a full list of all Washington state projects included in the Senate-passed WRDA Bill:Howard A. Hanson Dam Downstream Fish Passage Facility:WRDA will authorize construction of the Howard A. Hanson Dam Downstream Fish Passage, which will open at least 100 miles of prime salmon and steelhead habitat above the Howard A. Hanson Dam in Pierce County, nearly doubling the amount of habitat currently available. Completing the downstream fish passage facility will also allow the Additional Water Storage Project for the Green River to move forward, ensuring clean water to surrounding communities.Tacoma Harbor Deepening:WRDA will allow the Army Corps to deepen the Blair Waterway at the Port of Tacoma. The current authorized depth of the federal channel in Tacoma’s Blair Waterway does not meet the draft requirements of today’s fleet of larger container ships, which means these ships can’t call on the Port of Tacoma. Deepening the waterway will allow for these ships to call on the Port of Tacoma, creating more economic opportunity for the Port, Seaport Alliance and surrounding community.Dredging at the Port of Clarkston:Directs the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge the Port of Clarkston, ensuring vessels can continue passage. Maintenance of the Snake River between Lewiston, Idaho and Clarkston, Washington is critical to support safe and efficient navigation. Over 8.6 million tons of cargo are moved by barge on the inland portion of the Columbia Snake River System that feeds the deep draft lower Columbia River which transported over 56 million tons of cargo in 2018. In any given year, nearly 10% of the U.S. wheat exports transit the Snake River and the river cruise industry on the Columbia Snake River System provided over 25,000 cruise passengers in 2019, with over $15M in direct economic benefits to the region.Duckabush Estuary Restoration:Directs the Army Corps of Engineers to consider taking further action and providing resources to reconnect the Duckabush River to neighboring floodplains and wetlands by modifying local roads, elevating Highway 101, and rerouting utilities. This is a critical step in the removal and replacement of the Highway 101 causeway and bridges and in the larger Puget Sound Nearshore Restoration Project which is restoring nearshore habitat throughout Puget Sound.Columbia River Treaty Flood ProtectionWRDA directs the Army Corps to study one of the key pillars in the efforts to modernize the Columbia River Treaty regime: flood control in the Columbia River Basin. The Columbia River Basin experiences high annual runoff, variation in flows and a limited amount of water storage in the United States portion of the Columbia River Basin. The WRDA bill authorizes a study to evaluate how to improve water storage and flood control in the Columbia River Basin.Army Corps Aquifer Recharge and Water Supply Conservation: Directs the Army Corps to evaluate alternative water storage processes, such as aquifer recharge and groundwater storage, when addressing flood storage and water conservation projects. This will lead to innovative solutions to water conservation and storage challenges that Washington state and states throughout the West face.Expanding Mitigation Banking:Allows for more entities to use mitigation banking credits and help process mitigation banking credits. A mitigation bank is a wetland, stream, or other aquatic resource area that has been restored, established, enhanced, or preserved for the purpose of providing compensation for unavoidable impacts to aquatic resources when there are port, flood control or water supply projects. This is a big deal for our ports that undertake many types of projects that require mitigation banking to support supply chain efficiency and resilience, safety, job growth, and economic development which benefits the community and promotes stability of the region. Columbia River Village Development Plan:Requires the Army Corps of Engineers to revise and complete the village development plan for Dalles Dam, Columbia River, Washington and Oregon to address the impacts to Indian villages and housing sites that resulted from construction of multiple dams by the Corps in the Columbia River Basin. When the Dalles Lock and Dam in Oregon was constructed in the 1950s, Tribal villages in Celilo, Oregon and Spearfish, Washington were inundated and lost. The Flood Control Act of 1950 authorized the construction of a replacement village to compensate the four Columbia River Treaty Tribes: the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation; the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation; the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation; and the Nez Perce Tribe. Columbia River Ecosystem Restoration Study:Directs the Army Corps to study salmon recovery and restoration throughout the Columbia River Basin and its tributaries.A one-page summary on WRDA 2022 is available HERE, a section-by-section summary is available HERE.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/senator-murray-statement-on-inflation-reduction-act/,"Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, issued the following statement on The Inflation Reduction Act Of 2022.“As prices increase, one of my top priorities is to lower everyday costs for the basics—I’m thinking of the mom in Seattle or Spokane who is figuring out how she’ll pay for her kid’s medication and afford rent this month. People in Washington state and all across the country should never have to choose between their prescription or other basic necessities—because lifesaving drugs don’t do any good if people can’t afford them. This legislation would drastically lower prescription drug costs and finally let Medicare negotiate drug prices—this is a big deal and a huge step forward.“Washington state leads the nation in clean energy investments and climate action—but we can’t tackle the climate crisis alone. This legislation would deliver a landmark federal investment in climate action and clean energy—to help us establish sustainable energy independence, lower energy costs in the long term, and create good-paying jobs everywhere in America and Washington state.“Last year, Democrats took action to lower Americans’ health care premiums by hundreds of dollars a year—this has helped hundreds of thousands of people in Washington state save money on their health care. This package would extend the tax credits that made that possible for three years because no family should have to worry about how they’d cover higher health care costs now, too.“And critically, this legislation is all fully paid for by making sure the very wealthiest and giant corporations simply pay their fair share in taxes.“We absolutely have to deliver on these critical priorities—to save Americans thousands on their prescriptions, lower health care costs, combat climate change before it’s too late, and create a fairer tax system that finally puts working people first—and I’m committed to doing exactly that and passing this legislation as quickly as we’re able to.“But at a moment like this, when child care is already really unaffordable and too hard to find for so many families, with our child care sector on the brink of collapse—and now with Republicans forcing women to give birth no matter their circumstance—it is even more urgent we lower child care costs. The simple reality is that if we don’t act now, the child care crisis will only get worse—so as we fight inflation, we must help parents find and afford the child care they need so they can get back to work, and help child care providers stay in business. Senator Kaine and I have a plan that will lower child care costs for working families, and I’m going to keep fighting to tackle the child care crisis however I can—because we simply can’t leave kids, families, or moms behind.”You can find the one pager for the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 here, a breakdown of the prescription drug piece here, and the energy security and climate change investments here. ###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Women are being forced to stay pregnant against their will, birth control is under attack, maternal mortality rates are worsening, and lives are at risk. We need lifesaving solutions—and that’s what this bill delivers.”“This bill creates a new, historic federal abortion fund that provides women the support they need to get abortion care in a post-Roe America—covering child care, travel expenses, and more. It does away with the unjust Hyde Amendment that for too long has prevented millions of women from having abortion care covered by their insurance—even in states where it is legal. It makes critical investments to address the maternal mortality crisis. And it will make it easier to get birth control by boosting our national family planning program, helping women get contraceptive care at the same place they get primary care, and finally cracking down on insurers that aren’t following the law and forcing women to pay extra costs for their birth control.“In the face of Republicans’ unprecedented attacks on our reproductive freedom, I won’t shy away from bold solutions. Every single person deserves to have full control over their own bodies, lives and futures: that’s the future I fight for every day, and that’s the future this bill would help deliver.”Senator Murray’s FY23 LHHS funding bill includes investments in:Additionally, the bill includes a directive from the Committee to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to:###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Markey (D-MA) sought unanimous consent to pass the Right to Contraception Act to protect every American’s fundamental right to use birth control—but Republican Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) blocked the common-sense legislation. Senators Murray and Markey pushed to quickly pass their legislation with Senators Mazie Hirono (D-HI) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) following passage of companion legislation in the House of Representatives last week—despite nearly the entire House Republican conference voting against the bill.“It has been nearly sixty years since the Supreme Court decided Griswold v. Connecticut—and affirmed Americans’ right to privacy and with it: their right to contraception. So you’d think this would be a settled issue. And for the vast majority of Americans—it is,” said Senator Murray. “Yet, as we just saw, somehow—in the year 2022—this isn’t a settled issue for Republican politicians.”“Just last week, 195 House Republicans voted against the Right to Contraception Act. And now they have blocked action in the Senate as well. The evidence of where Republicans actually stand on birth control is overwhelming. They aren’t standing for women. They aren’t standing for families. They aren’t standing for a right nearly all Americans support,” added Senator Murray. “They are simply standing in the way.”The Right to Contraception Act would protect the right to use contraception, which was first recognized by the Supreme Court more than half a century ago but is now under threat—with Justice Clarence Thomas writing the Court should revisit the decision, Republican lawmakers in states across the country eyeing restrictions on birth control, and Republicans in Congress blocking commonsense legislation to enshrine the right to use birth control into federal law.Read full text of the legislation here.Senator Murray’s remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below:“Thank you M. President.“It has been nearly sixty years since the Supreme Court decided Griswold v. Connecticut—and affirmed Americans’ right to privacy and with it: their right to contraception.“So you’d think this would be a settled issue.“And for the vast majority of Americans—it is.“The right to birth control is overwhelmingly popular.“It turns out, people want to be able to control their own bodies and make their own decisions about starting a family.“Yet, as we just saw, somehow—in the year 2022—this isn’t a settled issue for Republican politicians.“We have seen some of my Republican colleagues not only block this, but try to deny reality, try to say “This isn’t an issue” or claim that Democrats are just, “wasting time.”“That’s rich.“Because I can’t help but remember how we all heard some Republicans saying the Supreme Court wouldn’t overturn Roe as well.“How they tried to claim Democrats were overreacting, even as they stacked our courts with anti-abortion judges, and worked for decades to chip away at abortion rights.“And now, we are seeing the nightmare we warned about become reality: women unable to control their own bodies, and get the abortion care they need.“A nightmare Republicans tried to deny—and are still trying to deny, even as it happens, even as ten year olds are having to travel across state lines for an abortion after being raped, even as women are being left bleeding for days waiting for treatment for their miscarriage.“So when Republicans say they support the right to birth control, my issue isn’t simply that I’m skeptical. It’s that I know better.“And let’s be clear, when I say I know better, I don’t mean in my gut. I mean I have heard Republicans’ own words. I am watching their own actions.“Justice Thomas said explicitly in his concurring opinion in Dobbs that he wants the court to reconsider Griswold, which affirmed the right to contraception.“The senior Senator from Tennessee said the Griswold decision was “unsound.”“That alone would be scary enough.“But Republicans aren’t just talking about undermining access to birth control—they’re already taking action.“Read the legislation from Republicans in Idaho, Missouri, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Michigan, which would, in fact, outlaw Plan B and IUDs.“Talk to women who have already gone to the pharmacy only to be denied their birth control or Plan B. Yes, this is already happening to people.“And just last week, 195 House Republicans voted against the Right to Contraception Act.“And now they have blocked action in the Senate as well.“The evidence of where Republicans actually stand on birth control is overwhelming. They aren’t standing for women. They aren’t standing for families. They aren’t standing for a right nearly all Americans support.“They are simply standing in the way.“I’d like to thank the senior Senator from Massachusetts, the junior Senator from Illinois, and the junior Senator from Hawaii for their work with me on the Right to Contraception Act Republicans just blocked.“I know we will all keep working on this.“And I’d like to set the record straight—because so many of the arguments we have seen from Republicans just don’t add up they are trying to distract from their extreme position. But we won’t let them.“M. President, this bill is incredibly straightforward.“So you simply cannot say you support the right to birth control and then block this bill.“I hope everyone will listen closely, because here is what this bill actually does. It simply codifies Americans’ right to birth control into law. That’s it.“And you don’t have to take my word for it, read it yourself! It’s all of 15 pages.“It protects a right people depend on, and makes sure no one can take it away. And, we are talking about a really basic—and really fundamental—right here.“Since that right was affirmed half a century ago, generations of Americans have used contraception to control their future, manage and treat their health needs, and start a family when they are ready to.“For them, it’s not political. And it shouldn’t be political here in Congress either.“Especially when protecting this right is supported by a majority of Democrats, a majority of Independents, and, yes, even a clear majority of Republicans.“M. President, the American people are watching closely.“They were watching previously when Senate Republicans blocked us from protecting the right to travel across states to get abortion care.“They were watching last week when Senate Republicans blocked expanding support for our nation’s long-standing family planning program.“They were watching when the vast majority of Republicans in the House voted against the right to birth control.“And they are watching right now as Republicans block a bill that preserves their right to use condoms, and take the pill, and get IUDs, and buy Plan B.“As Republicans refuse to let us protect that right and pass this bill and continue denying the threats that are already undermining that right.“This is a basic, fundamental right: and mark my words: the American people will not forget Republicans blocking us from getting this done.”###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

The CHIPS and Science Act will invest in American manufacturing – especially in Washington state, which ranks among the top ten states in terms of its semiconductor manufacturing workforce. The bill will allow small and medium sized microchip manufacturers to expand and hire more workers, get products on the shelves faster, and lower costs on consumer electronics. When it comes to national security, the CHIPS and Science Act will decrease our reliance on foreign supply chains and make American manufacturing more competitive on the world stage.“Passing the CHIPS and Science Act will strengthen our supply chains, invest in American manufacturing and jobs here in Washington state, and lower the cost of everyday goods that we all rely on,” said Senator Murray. “This legislation sends a clear message that we are making things in America again and that we will continue to lead the world in manufacturing while creating good-paying jobs here at home. I’m focused on real solutions, not soundbites—this is one important way we can tackle major challenges Washington state families are facing like inflation.”“Passage of the CHIPS and Science Act creates local opportunities with national significance,” said  Jennifer Baker, president of the Columbia River Economic Development Council in Clark County, WA. “Clark County’s semiconductor industry supply chain partners, microelectronics, and integrated circuit manufacturers, can take strides in advancing technologies and production efficiencies through passage of this important legislation. Complementing the chips-specific investments, the CHIPS and Science Act includes support for growth in additive manufacturing and bioscience sectors where we see promising regional activity. Enhanced workforce and higher education resources through the CHIPS Act underline the opportunity for more individuals to learn about and pursue careers in STEM—encouraging career path mobility and bolstering industry competitiveness.”“The Seattle metro region is home to a flourishing information technology and computer science industry and there is no doubt the bipartisan Chips and Science Act passed today will give our local companies more leverage to compete on the global stage,” said Rachel Smith, President and CEO of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce. “We see clearly how this federal investment will accelerate the development of new technologies that will not only benefit companies, but the consumers who will enjoy better quality of life because of the new tools and systems to come.

Markey (D-Mass.), Senator Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), and Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) announced their effort to pass the Right to Contraception Act this week in the Senate, following passage of companion legislation in the House of Representatives last week—despite nearly the entire House Republican caucus voting against the bill.The Right to Contraception Act would codify the right to contraception, which the Supreme Court first recognized more than half a century ago in its decision in Griswold v. Connecticut. Codifying the constitutional right to obtain contraceptives would reverse actions red states have already taken to restrict access to contraception and ensure that an overturning of the Griswold decision by the far-right Supreme Court majority would not endanger access to contraceptives. On Wednesday, the senators will seek unanimous consent on the Senate floor to pass the Right to Contraception Act.“Right now, one of the most powerful judges in the country is writing about overturning the right to contraception, Republican state legislators are working to restrict women’s ability to get the birth control of their choice, and House Republicans have voted against protecting Americans’ right to use birth control,” said Senator Murray. “Americans depend on the right to use birth control to control their own bodies and make their own decisions about when to start a family—and we must protect it. This is a basic, fundamental right—so Americans will be watching closely to see if Republican colleagues stand in our way as we work to pass the Right to Contraception Act.”The Right to Contraception Act is endorsed by Planned Parenthood Federation of America, NARAL Pro-Choice America, National Women’s Law Center, National Organization for Women, Power to Decide, National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, Reproductive Health Access Project, Catholics for Choice, Association of Maternal & Child Health Programs, Upstream USA, National Center for Lesbian Rights, National Partnership for Women & Families, Jewish Women International, Positive Women’s Network-USA, and the National Council of Jewish Women.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

So far this year, King County in Washington state alone has lost more than 280 people to fentanyl overdoses—an increase of 50% since last year. Last year, the U.S. lost over 100,000 people to drug overdoses—an all-time high—and in just two years, fentanyl deaths among teens have more than tripled nationwide.“My heart goes out to every family touched by this crisis—and I’ve heard from so many of them. People who lost a loved one after a long, hard struggle with addiction, and those who lost a loved one suddenly to a counterfeit pill, laced with a lethal dose of fentanyl,” said Senator Murray. “Our communities are doing everything they can to fight this. But they need help from the federal government to stop these dangerous drugs at the source, cut off supply lines, and, importantly, get these kids and their families the help they need. And the way we do that is to support families on the ground through robust public health efforts, and better access to mental health and substance use disorder care.”Illicit fentanyl is up to fifty times stronger than heroin and one hundred times stronger than morphine—and is contributing to a devastating, year-over-year rise in overdose deaths. At Tuesday’s hearing, Senator Murray underscored the importance of cutting off the supply lines for fentanyl and cracking down on fentanyl-laced pills, and pressed administration officials on the steps being taken to disrupt fentanyl trafficking and curb access to counterfeit pills being sold to teens online.“Our law enforcement and first responders on the ground are really working to rise to this challenge to stop these deadly pills, save lives, and ensure people can get the care they need,” said Senator Murray. “But when I talk to police officers, fire chiefs, and first responders back in Washington state, it’s clear we have to do a lot more to build on the progress they are making, cut off the supply lines that produce these dangerous drugs, and prevent them from ever reaching our communities.”Senator Murray also made clear the fentanyl crisis must be tackled from every possible angle, including by holding companies that fueled the opioid crisis accountable and strengthening our nation’s mental health and substance use disorder programs, because most who die by overdose don’t receive substance use treatment. In particular, Senator Murray made clear that she is determined to keep making progress on the bipartisan mental health and substance use disorder legislation she has been working on with Ranking Member Burr.  “If there’s one thing we all take away from today’s conversation—I hope it is that our communities cannot wait, they need urgent action from the Administration, and from us in Congress,” said Senator Murray. “That’s why it is as important to me as ever that we advance a bipartisan package that makes meaningful progress on these issues. I hope all of my Republican colleagues agree, and that we can continue our progress negotiating a robust mental health and substance use disorder bill that supports the programs we have seen make such a difference, and provides additional tools and resources to tackle the new threats and emerging challenges in this space.”Senator Murray’s opening remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below:“Last week, back in Washington state, King County declared fentanyl a public health crisis. And it’s painfully obvious why.“This year, King County alone has lost over 270 people to fentanyl overdoses, an increase of nearly 50 percent from last year.“That’s more than one fentanyl death every day—and mind you that’s just one county in my state, just one corner of our country—which lost over 100,000 people to drug overdoses last year. An all-time high.“And that number doesn’t just represent a grim record.“It represents so many personal tragedies, so many families shattered by the loss of a loved one, parents, caregivers, and—increasingly—teenagers.“Now, there’s no question we had a mental health and substance use disorder crisis on our hands before the COVID pandemic.“But there is also no doubt things have gotten so much worse due to the trauma of this pandemic and so much more deadly with the sharp rise of illicit fentanyl in recent years.“That’s because fentanyl is up to fifty times stronger than heroin and one hundred times stronger than morphine.“Just two milligrams can be a lethal dose.“From April 2020 to 2021—synthetic opioids, mostly illicit fentanyl, were responsible for nearly two-thirds of all overdose deaths.“And the recent rise in fentanyl overdose deaths has also reflected the painful, systemic health inequities we still need to do so much to address.“Black communities as well as American Indian and Alaska Native communities have suffered a higher increase in overdose deaths than other demographics.“There has also been a deeply alarming rise in young people dying from overdoses.“In 2019, over 250 teens died from illicit fentanyl.“Last year—we lost almost 900.“Think about that—fentanyl deaths for teenagers more than tripled in two years.“My heart goes out to every family touched by this crisis—and I’ve heard from so many of them. People who lost a loved one after a long, hard struggle with addiction, and those who lost a loved one suddenly to a counterfeit pill, laced with a lethal dose of fentanyl.“Our communities are doing everything they can to fight this. But they need help from the federal government to stop these dangerous drugs at the source, cut off supply lines, and, importantly, get these kids and their families the help they need.“And the way we do that is to support families on the ground through robust public health efforts, and better access to mental health and substance use disorder care.“When it comes to cutting off the supply of fentanyl, FDA has been working to crack down on counterfeit drugs being sold online, something I want to see them continue making progress on to protect our youth.“And the DEA is working to seize fentanyl-laced pills before they can end up in our kids’ hands.“I’ve been pressing President Biden on this—the same way I pressed the Trump administration—and we are seizing more fentanyl-laced pills than ever before—and I appreciate the hard work that is going into that.“Our law enforcement and first responders on the ground are really working to rise to this challenge to stop these deadly pills, save lives, and ensure people can get the care they need.“But when I talk to police officers, fire chiefs, and first responders back in Washington state, it’s clear we have to do a lot more to build on the progress they are making, cut off the supply lines that produce these dangerous drugs, and prevent them from ever reaching our communities.“Drug trafficking is a serious problem, and that’s why Democrats continue to work with Republicans to provide significant funding for border security and drug interdiction.“But let’s get one thing clear—we need to be taking this seriously and having real conversations about how we address the national threat of fentanyl use and supply. Not playing politics. Not scapegoating and fearmongering. Not attacking refugees and immigrants with proposals that are based more on xenophobia than on what will actually work to keep people safe.“That’s not to say we can’t talk about accountability—especially for opioid manufacturers who fueled this crisis to line their pockets.“There were enormous corporations that knew just how dangerous and addictive these products were, and yet decided to ignore the risks for patients, market these pills aggressively, and flood our communities with opioids.“We absolutely must hold these companies accountable for padding their profits at the expense of countless lives.“Of course, stopping the supply of illicit fentanyl, and holding companies accountable which fueled the opioids crisis is critical.“But we really have to tackle this challenge from every angle possible.“And with that in mind, we have a lot more work to do to help our communities get people the mental health and substance use disorder care they need.“Right now, less than ten percent of people who need substance use disorder treatment can get it—and care is even harder to get if you are Black, Hispanic, or American Indian or Alaska Native.“The painful reality is that most people who died by overdose didn’t get any substance use disorder treatment before they passed away.“That’s unacceptable, and we’ve got to do better.“A big part of the problem is that our mental health and substance use disorder workforce has been woefully overstretched and understaffed.“I have said this before—but it is so important to understand if we are going to get our arms around this.“Almost 130 million Americans live in areas with a mental health care provider shortage—essentially they don’t have even one mental health care provider per 30 thousand people.“In Washington, our mental health care workforce is only able to meet 17 percent of our state’s needs.“If we are going to turn the tide in the fight against fentanyl, that is going to have to change.“We cannot lose sight of the fact that a strong public health system, and easy access to treatment for everyone, are some of the most powerful tools in our arsenal here.“We need to make sure every community has a robust public health department—with the data needed to track overdoses and stop spikes and the ability to raise public awareness about rising threats like counterfeit drugs laced with fentanyl.“And we need to support programs on the frontlines in our communities that are focused on prevention, treatment, and recovery support.“I’ve fought hard to invest in our communities to expand mental health and substance use disorder care, through HRSA which is helping build our mental health and substance use disorder workforce in rural communities; through federal grants which have helped set up dozens of new treatments centers across my state; and in the American Rescue Plan, which included critical funds for this work.“But talk to anyone on the frontlines of this for two seconds, and you’ll understand we still have so much more to do.“Talk to the Fire Chief in Seattle who told me a few months ago they respond to four overdoses every day…“Talk with the University of Washington researcher who told me how 80 percent of people who could benefit from services to keep them alive, can’t access them…“Talk with the nurse in Everett who told Secretary Becerra about how there are just not enough beds to get people treatment and the mom who told him about how she lost her job, her house, and her child while she was struggling with fentanyl addiction.“Talk to Jason Cockburn at the Second Chance Foundation in Everett who has spoken about challenge of trying to get kids the treatment they need, or the many people who desperately tried to help him find an open treatment bed for a 15 year-old earlier this year, calling contacts, posting to Facebook—all to no avail.“It is so clear leaders like Jason who are on the front lines of this crisis need so much more from our federal agencies and from this Congress. More when it comes to getting fentanyl off our streets. And more when it comes to getting people the health care they need.“Which is why I am as determined as ever to continue the progress Senator Burr and I are making on a bipartisan package on mental health and substance use disorders.“We need to support the programs on the ground in our communities that are already doing lifesaving work to identify people who are at risk—and prevent substance use disorders in the first place, to get people treatment, and to support people in recovery.“And we need new programs—especially when it comes to addressing the new challenges we are seeing with fentanyl and with the heartbreaking increase in overdoses among young people.“So I’m going to continue pressing for us to advance as expansive a package as possible, as quickly as possible.“And I believe we can do it—because we’ve done it before.“In 2016, and again in 2018, Democrats and Republicans worked together to pass some of the most comprehensive legislation to respond to the opioid crisis in our country’s history—that has made a big difference.“That legislation has undoubtedly saved lives.“But I have traveled to just about every part of Washington state to talk about this crisis—from Everett, to Seattle, to Longview, to the Tri-cities, to Spokane, and more.“And the challenges we are dealing with today are not the same challenges we faced in 2018.“So now it’s on all of us here to build on the bipartisan progress we’ve made.“And it is painfully clear our communities cannot wait. They need us to meet this moment with serious action and life-saving support for families.”###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Period,” said Senator Murray. “But it’s clear that egregious treatment of young people has occurred in residential care facilities across the country—so we’re demanding answers and accountability. No young person should ever fear for their safety, suffer abuse or neglect, or be denied the supportive care and education they deserve.”“I am seriously concerned by report after report of abuse and neglect in residential care facilities responsible for caring for youth struggling with mental health and substance abuse disorders,” said Senator Wyden. “These youth and their families have put their trust in these organizations to help them get better and instead are being met with more trauma. Accountability is desperately needed, and we’re demanding answers.”In letters to the CEOs of Acadia Health Services, Deveraux Advanced Behavioral Health, Universal Health Services, and Vivant Behavioral Healthcare, the Senators cited deeply troubling reports of abuse and neglect of youth in the care of residential treatment facilities operated by their companies. These facilities provide in-patient therapeutic services for youth with mental health, substance use, and behavioral and emotional disorders, or other disabilities—but reporting has detailed abuse and neglect in facilities across the country. Specifically, the Senators highlighted reports of inappropriate use of—and lack of reporting—on restraint and seclusion, staffing shortages, a lack of appropriate mental health and substance use disorder services, and concerns about the quality of education provided.“Over the past several years, a series of reports have raised concerns about the conditions that children and youth experience in residential treatment facilities …. [W]e are concerned by numerous stories of exploitation, mistreatment and maltreatment, abuse and neglect, and fatalities in these facilities. To ensure that children and youth placed in your care are safe and provided the care and treatment they need to be able to return to their homes and communities, we write to learn more about the policies and procedures at your facilities,” wrote the Senators.Specifically, the Senators demanded the chief executives provide information about any instances of abuse or neglect; any complaints, inspections, and investigations; funding sources; and details about their policies and use of restraint and seclusion.Read the Senators’ letters to Acadia Health Services, Deveraux Advanced Behavioral Health, Universal Health Services, and Vivant Behavioral Healthcare:Christopher H. HunterChief Executive OfficerAcadia Health Services6100 Tower Circle, Suite 1000Franklin, TN 37067Dear Mr. Hunter:Over the past several years, a series of reports have raised concerns about the conditions that children and youth experience in residential treatment facilities (RTFs).[1] While estimates vary, thousands of children and youth in the United States are placed in these facilities for therapeutic services such as mental health and substance use treatment or behavioral or emotional health treatment.[2] While there is a role for RTFs in the continuum of treatment, we are concerned by numerous stories of exploitation, mistreatment and maltreatment, abuse and neglect, and fatalities in these facilities. We therefore request information from Acadia Health Services to better understand your policies and practices in providing treatment to children and youth being served in your facilities.Recent national reporting has detailed a number of instances of abuse and neglect in RTFs, including inappropriate use of and lack of reporting of restraint and seclusion, staffing shortages, a lack of appropriate and advertised mental health and substance use disorder services, and concerns about the education services being provided to children and youth.[3] These concerns are not new. In 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report that found “thousands of allegations of abuse, some of which involved death” at RTFs across the country.[4] This study found “untrained staff, lack of adequate nourishment, and reckless or negligent operating practices” among facilities.[5] In January 2022, GAO released a subsequent report finding RTFs have failed to prevent instances of abuse and neglect.[6] Children and youth who have been in RTFs have reported harm and abuse – either at the hands of staff or other children and youth in the facility – and that their time in the RTFs “negatively impacted their well-being, from being served meals that lacked proper nutrition and promoted undesired weight gain or loss, feeling over medicated or coerced into taking medication, being unable to feel a sense of normalcy or socialize with peers, lacking access to on-grade level school work which diminished their educational outcomes, being deterred from performing acts of freedom and self-expression, practicing their religion, or speaking their native language.”[7]Families and states place children and youth with the most intensive needs in the care of RTFs with the expectation that these children and youth will be given the supports and services they need. To ensure that children and youth placed in your care are safe and provided the care and treatment they need to be able to return to their homes and communities, we write to learn more about the policies and procedures at your facilities. We request that you provide answers to the following no later than August 4, 2022.Please direct any questions and response to this letter to Amanda Lowe at Amanda_Lowe@help.senate.gov and Rebecca Nathanson at Rebecca_nathanson@wyden.senate.gov.

It is imperative that VA’s Central Office leadership understands the struggles veterans and front-line providers deal with every day at these facilities. The botched roll-out of the new Electronic Health Record, and years of attempts to cut care and services has undermined trust and made providers’ jobs immeasurably harder. Department leadership needs to hear directly from veterans about these issues and then act immediately to implement real solutions.”Earlier this year, the two lawmakers rejected the VA’s recommendation to reduce services at the Jonathan M. Wainwright VA Medical Center in Walla Walla, and they took action to prevent them from being implemented.

https://www.murray.senate.gov/senator-murray-helps-introduce-the-cannabis-administration-and-opportunity-act/,"ICYMI: Senator Murray Joins Bipartisan Effort to Improve Safety for Legal Cannabis Businesses – MORE HERESenator Murray: “It is long past time the federal government catches up to Washington state when it comes to cannabis laws.”(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), helped introduce the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act (CAOA). The CAOA, introduced by Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) and co-sponsored by Senator Gary Peters (D-MI), would decriminalize, regulate, and tax cannabis at the federal level and empower states to implement their own cannabis laws.“It is long past time the federal government catches up to Washington state when it comes to cannabis laws,” said Senator Patty Murray. “This legislation is about justice, strengthening our economy, and bringing the federal government into the 21st century. Our bill will undo deeply unfair and racially unjust laws that have disproportionately harmed people of color—that’s hugely important. It will also strengthen our economy by finally recognizing the cannabis industry and modernizing federal regulations. I’m committed to working closely with small business owners, Tribes, local officials, and all stakeholders to make sure this legislation works for Washington state—where we have led the nation on common sense cannabis laws.”“While the reforms we are pushing for are critical and long overdue—I remain fully committed to passing SAFE Banking however possible—including as a standalone bill,” continued Senator Murray. “It makes absolutely no sense that legal cannabis businesses are forced to operate entirely in cash and my bill would bring them into the formal banking system where they belong.”The Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act:Bill text can be found HERE.Summary of introduced CAOA can be found HERE. Senator Murray continues to be a leader in this space. In 2017, she helped introduce her Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act which would allow state-legal cannabis businesses to access banking services and continues to push for its passage. Last April, Senator Murray held a press conference in Tukwila to outline the path forward for the SAFE Banking Act and affirmed her commitment to getting this legislation signed into law. ###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/republican-senator-blocks-murray-smith-effort-to-pass-commonsense-family-planning-bill/,"Smith, Murray, Warren bill would protect and expand access to birth control and other essential reproductive health care services***WATCH: Senator Murray calls out Republicans’ hypocrisy on Senate floor***(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), sought unanimous consent to pass her bill with Senators Tina Smith (D-MN) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to protect and expand access to family planning services—but Republican Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) blocked the legislation.The Expanding Access to Family Planning Act would protect access to critical reproductive health care services—like birth control, cancer screenings, and more—by providing a consistent and strong source of funding for the Title X Family Planning Program. After Roe was overturned, Republicans have claimed that they support family planning and will pursue policies to support women and families—with Senator Marshall last week stating at a HELP hearing that “family planning opportunities need to be expanded.”“As much as Republicans are talking now about supporting women’s health, as hard as they might try to pretend that they do support family planning services, when they’ve been given a chance today … they stood in the way,” said Senator Murray. “We are not proposing anything radical or groundbreaking here. We are simply saying we should expand the national family planning program that already exists. The one President Nixon signed into law decades ago. The one we have already funded before, in a bipartisan way, many times. Title X is a program that is already providing patients family planning services and contraception, STI testing and treatment, screenings for breast cancer and cervical cancer, and more.”“So my message to the American people who are witnessing this? Pay attention. Pay attention. The Republican agenda is: no to family planning, no to your right to travel for the health care you need, and no to your constitutional right to abortion,” added Senator Murray. “Senate Democrats and I will not stop holding them accountable for empty promises or for the devastating harm that their extreme abortion bans are now inflicting on so many patients and families.”The Title X Family Planning Program is the only federal program dedicated to providing comprehensive family planning and preventive health services. Hundreds of thousands of Americans rely on the program for essential health care. In 2020 alone, over 1.5 million patients received family planning services through Title X. Title X is funded through the annual appropriations process, which subjects the program to an unpredictable funding stream that is insufficient to meet the national need. The legislation would provide a consistent and strong source of funding for Title X.Senators Smith, Murray, and Warren introduced the bill alongside 30 of their Democratic colleagues on Tuesday. You can access a summary of the legislation here and the full text here.Senator Murray’s remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below:“Thank you M. President.“It’s now been almost a month since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ended the right to abortion, and upended health care for women across the country.“And every single day, women, providers, and patients have been shouting from the rooftops about how damaging this is—how women’s lives are at risk.“Every single day, we are seeing the horrors caused by Republicans’ oppression: women forced to stay pregnant and give birth when they don’t want to, patients denied prescriptions they need, a ten year old forced to travel across state lines to get an abortion after being raped, a woman experiencing a miscarriage left bleeding for ten days as providers weren’t clear if they could treat her due to Republicans’ extreme bans.“And all the while, Republicans have been trying to ignore the devastation they have caused.“And even more cruelly: they have been trying to distract us. Telling us that what we’re seeing isn’t really happening.“They have tried to say it won’t undermine birth control access, even as patients have been denied plan B.“They have tried to say we don’t need to protect the right to travel for abortion care, even as some Republicans are already writing, and introducing, bills to take that right away.“They have even tried to say their extreme bans won’t undermine care for ectopic pregnancies or miscarriages, even as providers have already been forced to change the standard of care because of Republicans’ dangerous abortion bans, making them perform riskier, invasive surgeries than would otherwise be necessary, or even sit on their hands until patients’ vital signs drop before they can do what they know is needed to save lives.“It is unconscionable. And despite what we have heard from Republicans—it is happening right now in our country.“And, I know I’m not the only one who is entirely unconvinced by Republicans’ words about wanting to support women and families.“I’m skeptical when one Republican Senator says: ‘We have to start thinking in terms of some of these things …. to be more supportive of families and mothers.’“I’m skeptical when another says: ‘It’s not just a matter of saying, ‘We are pro-life.’ It’s a matter, then, of promoting and allowing these people who are making very difficult decisions with their lives to make sure we can help.’“And I was, frankly, surprised when just last week, at a hearing I chaired on how the Dobbs’ decision threatens women’s health, the junior Senator from Kansas claimed he believes ‘family planning opportunities need to be expanded’ and he even promised to continue supporting ‘robust funding.’“Well here is their chance to match their rhetoric with action.“Because Senator Smith, Senator Warren, and I have a bill right here that would do exactly that.“In fact, it is even called the Expanding Access to Family Planning Act.“I know Senator Smith cares a lot about this, and while she can’t be here right now due to COVID, I want to thank her for her leadership, and explain what this bill she drafted does.“M. President, this bill is really simple—almost couldn’t be simpler!“It takes our nation’s long-standing family planning program, Title X, and it provides the strong, mandatory funding Title X needs to support patients across the country.“That’s it. So easy. So straightforward.“Now, if Republicans really mean what they are saying, if they are really serious about expanding access to family planning, well then, there’s just no reason we can’t get this done right now.“After all, we are talking about a program with a long history of bipartisan support.“We’re talking about a program that was signed into law by a Republican—President Nixon—way back in 1970.“We are talking about a program that helps patients get the birth control they need, the STI testing and treatment they count on, the cervical and breast cancer screenings that could save their life, and the support they need to plan a family on their own terms.“This isn’t just the popular thing to do—though helping patients get the birth control they need is overwhelmingly a popular thing to do— it’s the right thing to do.“So, let’s get it done.“This should not be controversial. It simply expands our nation’s long-standing family planning program.“A program, I should note, that we included in our bipartisan funding bill earlier this year.“Now just a couple months ago, Republicans were adamantly against increases for this program but now they are apparently changing their tune and claiming they want to support families, they want to expand family planning services, they want to do exactly the thing this bill would do.“Unless of course, they don’t mean it, and it’s just empty rhetoric—just another desperate Republican distraction from the reality they have ushered in.“So, right now, Republicans will have the chance to go on the record on whether they actuallysupport family planning, whether they actually want to help people get birth control.“And believe me, the same people Republicans have been trying to ignore—the same people who are having their health care undermined, their life plans upended, their control over their own bodies taken away—are going to be watching closely.“And they are not going to forget how much—or rather howlittle—Republicans’ promises are worth.” ###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/at-hearing-senator-murray-presses-va-leaders-for-answers-and-solutions-on-electronic-health-record-system-failures/,"***WATCH SENATOR MURRAY’S FULL QUESTIONING HERE***(Washington, D.C.) – Today, during a Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee (SVAC) oversight hearing, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member of SVAC, joined her Senate colleagues in questioning Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Oracle Corporation officials for an update on the status of VA’s Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) program. The hearing included testimony from Dr. Terry Adirim, Program Executive Director of the Electronic Health Record Modernization Integration Office at VA; David Case, Deputy Inspector General at VA Office of Inspector General (OIG); and Mike Sicilia, Executive Vice President of Oracle Corporation.During the hearing, Senator Murray underscored the recurring problems associated with the program rollout and once again made clear that the system should not be implemented anywhere else in Washington state until VA resolves its issues and implements recommendations by VA OIG. Senator Murray has been consistently pushing for accountability and solutions in light of recent reports published by VA OIG highlighting more failures caused by the EHRM rollout.“There continue to be flaws with the EHR that risk patient care and safety and VA’s written testimony does not match what I heard from the providers. I don’t want to hear aa rosy picture and minimizing the concerns—I don’t want to hear any of that. VA might have inherited this program but you own it now, and VA owes our veterans a system that works and puts patients first,” said Senator Murray. “And I’ve said it before, VA cannot roll out this system anywhere else in Washington state until the issues with the system are resolved and the Inspector General’s recommendations are implemented by the VA and closed by the Inspector General. The focus right now needs to be fixing this in Spokane.”“I want to ask you Dr. Adirim, you answered in response to a question about how many outages there had been, where you said 24 outages and 48 degradations,” continued Senator Murray. “[The] Spokesman-Review printed an article just yesterday with a document that suggests those numbers underestimate the true frequency of disruptions in the system. The document they have includes more than 180 incidents classified as degradations, downtime, and full or partial outages that have affected the system’s users just since 2021. Do you know why that might be?”In her response, Dr. Adirim indicated no knowledge of the document Senator Murray referred to. Senator Murray noted there appears to be a major discrepancy between what VA is publicly saying and how many of these failures are being reported, and emphasized the need for answers and accountability.During her questioning, Senator Murray noted the challenges VA providers have faced delivering care to veterans while working under Cerner’s faulty system and VA’s botched rollout. Murray questioned Dr. Gerard Cox, VA’s Assistant Under Secretary for Health for Quality and Patient Safety, on whether it is responsible to continue rolling out the Cerner system with its existing flaws and inadequate workarounds.“As I’ve said, I have talked to veterans who have suffered serious harm—I’ve talked to them personally—as a result of the EHR failures. I have talked to providers, personally, who are doing double the work to make sure they meet their patients’ needs while navigating this flawed system. I continue to insist that facilities like Spokane keep their over-hires to manage this workload,” said Senator Murray. “Dr. Cox, is it responsible for VA to continue rolling out this program with its existing flaws and inadequate workarounds when there have clearly been instances of patient harm and when monitoring patient safety reports could become unsustainable?”Dr. Cox did not answer yes or no definitively; instead, citing confidence in VA taking sufficient steps to build safeguards knowing where the vulnerabilities are based on experiences in Spokane to reduce the risk of additional harm or similar problems at other sites. Senator Murray reiterated she expects answers back from VA on the number of outages that have occurred.Senator Murray has been conducting oversight on the EHR rollout at Mann-Grandstaff VAMC for years:###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

President Biden laid out new funding opportunities for communities facing extreme heat and weather, and steps to expand offshore wind opportunities that will create good-paying jobs and lower costs for families.“Here in Washington state, we’ve seen wildfires devastate entire communities, heat waves that made the pavement on our roads buckle, and our droughts are getting worse. The climate crisis is here—we’re in it and that’s just the plain truth,” said Senator Murray. “With these executive actions, we are taking meaningful action to protect communities against extreme heat and invest in clean energy which will set us on the path for energy independence and lower energy costs. This is a step in the right direction, but it’s still not enough. Tackling the climate crisis will require a landmark investment in climate action through Congressional action, and a whole-of-government approach that leverages the President’s full executive authority.”In his speech, President Biden announced actions he is taking to accelerate clean energy, create jobs, and lower costs for families:Senator Murray has made clear that Congress must take bold climate action, outlining her priorities in a July 2021 op-ed to the Seattle Times, stating, “Congress must send President Biden a landmark investment in climate action that will protect our planet for current and future generations — nothing less will cut it.” Senator Murray has rallied her colleagues in the Senate as a leader in the fight to pass bold climate action legislation and continues to press for climate action in every way possible.The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that Senator Murray helped pass last year will help Washington state and the country transition to cleaner energy and electric vehicles, make the electric grid more reliable, help prevent and fight wildfires, and more—all while creating good-paying, union jobs. Notably, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes Senator Murray’s Clean School Bus Act, which provides federal grants to help transition the nation’s diesel school buses to zero emission, electric buses. Senator Murray also joined President Biden in Seattle in April when he issued his Executive Order to safeguard American forests and fight climate change.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/senator-murray-secures-major-higher-education-relief-for-community-colleges-rural-colleges-and-minority-serving-institutions/,"Senator Murray: “This funding is going to make a big difference in the lives of students across Washington state—helping our colleges and universities help meet students’ basic needs and invest in everything from mental health services, housing, and child care, to providing direct financial relief.”(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Education Committee and a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced an additional $2 million in federal relief from the American Rescue Plan to support students pursuing a higher education in Washington state as they recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Senator Murray secured nearly $40 billion throughout the pandemic for colleges, universities, and students; more than $1.3 billion came through for Washington state from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF). HEERF funds can be used to help colleges, universities, and students make it through the pandemic.HEERF includes billions in investments for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), community colleges, rural colleges, and institutions serving large populations of low-income students. 7.5 percent of HEERF funds are set aside for supplemental awards to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and other Minority-Serving Institutions. The latest round of HEERF grants, known as Supplemental Support under American Rescue Plan (SSARP), provide $198 million in additional targeted investments to support the institutions most impacted by the pandemic, including under-resourced institutions and institutions serving large shares of low-income students and students of color. Of the latest round of SSARP funds, the majority of institutions are required to distribute roughly half of all grant funds directly to students with the greatest need to help them afford tuition, housing, food, and other basic needs. “When I helped write the American Rescue Plan, I wanted to make sure we were making a significant investment to ensure students who have weathered this pandemic had the support they needed to recover,” said Senator Murray. “This funding is going to make a big difference in the lives of students across Washington state—helping our colleges and universities help meet students’ basic needs and invest in everything from mental health services, housing, and child care, to providing direct financial relief.”  The pandemic has led to a steep college enrollment decline, particularly for students with low-incomes and students of color. As of fall 2020, high-minority and high-poverty high schools saw a 9.4 percent and 11.4 percent decline in college enrollment, respectively. And over the last 40 years, we have seen the most growth in jobs requiring higher levels of job preparation, including education and training. Today, 70 percent of jobs are held by people with more than a high school diploma.A longtime advocate for schools and students, Senator Murray has pushed to expand access to a college education for students in Washington state, and across the country. In March, Senator Murray was instrumental in helping secure major investments in the Fiscal Year 2022 spending package to make college more affordable and accessible. The bill included $1.1 billion, an increase of $40 million for TRIO, and $378 million, an increase of $10 million for GEAR UP—programs that help low-income and first generation students prepare for college and succeed once they’re there. The legislation also increased increase the maximum Pell Grant award by $400 (or 6.2 percent) to $6,895 for the 2022-23 school year—which is the largest increase since the 2009-10 school year.  See below a full list of Washington state schools receiving HEERF funding under SSARP:###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Becerra, Sen. Murray ask for details on monkeypox response plan, including efforts to provide public health guidance, ensure access to tests, treatments, and vaccines, coordination with local health departments, and funding challenges(Washington, D.C.) – Yesterday, Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee Chair Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) sent a letter to Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, asking for more information on the Department’s response to the global monkeypox outbreak. In the letter, Senator Murray emphasized the need to learn the lessons of the COVID response and strengthen the public health system as she is pushing to do through several legislative proposals like her bipartisan PREVENT Pandemics Act. Senator Murray specifically requested a briefing from the Department to get more details on how Secretary Becerra is handling challenges like providing clear public health guidance, ensuring access to tests, treatments and vaccines, coordinating with local public health departments, and more.“As I have raised on multiple calls with the Administration, I am concerned with the state of the U.S. response to monkeypox. The spread of monkeypox is a reminder that our work to protect families and strengthen our preparedness and response system is far from complete and cannot end with the COVID-19 pandemic. Communities across the country are relying on you to do everything you can to protect them from the threat of monkeypox. I write to request a briefing from the Department of Health and Human Services on the domestic response to the monkeypox outbreak, including understanding how it is applying the lessons learned from the COVID-19 response, as well as the additional resources and authorities it needs to respond to and stop the disease from spreading further.” wrote Senator Murray.The letter went on to note, “Various reports indicate challenges at the local level, with some patients and providers stating they do not have the information and resources necessary to understand, test for, or respond to the disease, which is now presenting with uncharacteristic features. Since the disease spreads through close, intimate contact, some patients are seeking care at sexual health clinics, which are frequently under-resourced despite providing critical services to underserved communities, including the LGBTQ+ community. Ensuring the public health system responds appropriately to monkeypox will require both decisive action from the Department and its state, local, and Tribal partners, as well as robust, sustained investments in public health.”Earlier this year, the HELP Committee advanced Senator Murray’s bipartisan PREVENT Pandemics Act, legislation to strengthen the U.S. public health and medical preparedness and response system. Senator Murray has also re-introduced the Public Health Infrastructure Saves Lives Act, legislation to provide the kind of sustained, annual investments required to end the cycle of crisis and complacency in public health funding.  Full text of the letter below and PDF HERE.The Honorable Xavier BecerraSecretaryDepartment of Health and Human Services200 Independence Ave SWWashington, DC 20201Dear Secretary Becerra:     The United States is reporting a historically high number of monkeypox cases with over 1,970 cases confirmed in 43 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.[1] As I have raised on multiple calls with the Administration, I am concerned with the state of the U.S. response to monkeypox. The spread of monkeypox is a reminder that our work to protect families and strengthen our preparedness and response system is far from complete and cannot end with the COVID-19 pandemic. Communities across the country are relying on you to do everything you can to protect them from the threat of monkeypox. I write to request a briefing from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or the Department) on the domestic response to the monkeypox outbreak, including understanding how it is applying the lessons learned from the COVID-19 response, as well as the additional resources and authorities it needs to respond to and stop the disease from spreading further.The global monkeypox outbreak was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in May 2022, and today, 13,340 cases related to this outbreak have been detected in 69 countries.[2] Over the last two years, the COVID-19 pandemic has not only highlighted the dangers of a fragmented, understaffed, and underfunded public health system, but has put an unprecedented strain on our front line public health and health care workers, who are now being tasked with addressing yet another emerging public health threat. It is critical that lessons from COVID-19 are incorporated into our monkeypox response.HHS has already taken a number of steps to respond to the domestic monkeypox outbreak, include activating the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Emergency Operations Center, releasing updated guidance and training for health care providers, mobilizing the Laboratory Response Network and working with commercial labs to expand testing capacity, deploying medical countermeasures, and releasing a vaccination strategy for close contacts.[3],[4]However, it is clear more work is necessary to ensure that public health officials at all levels have the information and resources they need to respond quickly to this outbreak. Various reports indicate challenges at the local level, with some patients and providers stating they do not have the information and resources necessary to understand, test for, or respond to the disease, which is now presenting with uncharacteristic features.[5],[6],[7],[8] Since the disease spreads through close, intimate contact, some patients are seeking care at sexual health clinics, which are frequently under-resourced despite providing critical services to underserved communities, including the LGBTQ+ community.Ensuring the public health system responds appropriately to monkeypox will require both decisive action from the Department and its state, local, and Tribal partners, as well as robust, sustained investments in public health. History repeatedly shows the critical importance of providing long-term investments in our public health and medical response systems to ensure the U.S. is prepared to respond to a variety of threats. The global eradication of smallpox, a virus in the same family as monkeypox, is a public health success story – and is a credit to sustained, bipartisan investment into the research and development of medical countermeasures.  The federal government stockpiled countermeasures, practiced responses with state and local health departments, and educated the public about smallpox.While this investment in countermeasures has been sustained over decades, funding for the broader U.S. public health system has instead been subject to a cycle of crisis and complacency. That lack of consistency is why I have pushed for passage of the Public Health Infrastructure Saves Lives Act[9], which would provide the sustained funding we need to handle emergencies such as monkeypox or COVID-19. Additionally, to ensure HHS has additional tools to respond efficiently to public health emergencies, I have worked with Senator Burr on our bipartisan PREVENT Pandemics Act.Given the continued spread of this virus and the need to ensure that all public health officials have the guidance and resources necessary to respond, I request a briefing by August 2, 2022 to better understand both HHS’s immediate response and the additional resources and authorities it needs. Specifically, I request updates on: (1) HHS’s plan for responding to the current domestic monkeypox outbreak, including the guidance being provided to state, local, and Tribal health departments and to health care providers; (2) the current status of monkeypox vaccines, tests, and therapeutics, including their manufacture and guidance on the distribution of those countermeasures; (3) an overview of how the Department is applying lessons from the COVID-19 response to the monkeypox response; and (4) what additional resources or authorities are needed to respond to and stop the disease from spreading further.Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.

The bill would protect access to critical reproductive health care services—like birth control, cancer screenings, and more—by providing a consistent and strong source of funding for the Title X Family Planning Program.The Title X Family Planning Program is the only federal program dedicated to providing comprehensive family planning and preventive health services. Hundreds of thousands of Americans rely on the program for essential health care. In 2020 alone, over 1.5 million patients received family planning services through Title X. Title X is funded through the annual appropriations process, which subjects the program to an unpredictable funding stream that is insufficient to meet the national need. The Senators’ Expanding Access to Family Planning Act would provide a consistent and strong source of funding for Title X.“Our legislation will strengthen Title X to help more patients get the birth control they need, the cervical and breast cancer screenings that could save their life, and the support they need to plan a family on their own terms,” said Senator Murray. “I’d just ask all of my Republican colleagues—who have been loudly talking about supporting women and have been using their so-called support for family planning to cover up their extreme agenda—what is your word worth? Will you actually support women—and help them get the birth control they need? On Thursday, women across the country will be watching closely.”The Expanding Access to Family Planning Act would:The bill is endorsed by Planned Parenthood Federation of America, National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, Physicians for Reproductive Health, Catholics for Choice, the National Partnership for Women & Families, Power to Decide, NARAL Pro-Choice America, National Council of Jewish Women, URGE: Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity, In Our Own Voice: National Black Women’s Reproductive Justice Agenda, National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice, ACLU, Advocates for Youth, National Women’s Law Center, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and the Center for American Progress.You can access a summary of the bill here and the full text here.Senator Murray’s remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below:“You know, in the weeks since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, since Republicans ripped away women’s right to decide for themselves whether or not to keep a pregnancy, we have heard a lot of talk from Republicans about how they want to support women and families. We’ve heard about how theyare—somehow, in some way or another—the party that supports families.“Our Republican colleagues have paid lip-service to the notion of supporting women in this new, post-Roe era they have ushered in.“After Roe was overturned, Senator Grassley said, “We have to start thinking in terms of some of these things, to be more supportive of families and mothers.”“Congresswoman Nancy Mace recently said, “Republicans are compassionate. We do care about family planning.”“Senator Rounds has said, “It’s not just a matter of saying, ‘We are pro-life.’ It’s a matter, then, of promoting and allowing these people who are making very difficult decisions with their lives to make sure we can help.”“And just last week, at a hearing I chaired on how the Dobbs’ decision threatens women’s health, Senator Marshall proudly stated that “family planning opportunities need to be expanded” and he promised to continue supporting “robust funding.”“Now, we’re doing something very simple.“We are simply asking our Republican colleagues to make good on their so-far hollow words by supporting women and families—and expanding access to family planning.“Our bill is straightforward—and really, it’s a no-brainer.“In the wake of the Dobbs decision, we want to expand access to family planning services for people all across the country by investing in the Title X program.“And that’s exactly what the Expanding Access to Family Planning Act will do.“Our legislation will strengthen Title X to help more patients get the birth control they need, the STI testing and treatment they count on, the cervical and breast cancer screenings that could save their life, and the support they need to plan a family on their own terms.“And if Republicans are serious about their promises to support women, protect their health, and invest in policies to lift families up, they will join us, strengthen the Title X program, and help get people the family planning and lifesaving health services they need.“This should not be controversial.“The Title X program has—historically—had broad, bipartisan support.“For crying out loud, the program was signed into law by a Republican—President Nixon—way back in 1970.“Helping patients get the birth control they need is not just something Americans overwhelmingly support, it’s the right thing to do.“So we’re here today to see if Republicans are actually willing to reverse course—and walk the walk, not just talk the talk.“Because let’s be honest: Republicans messaging on family planning has so far been hollow.“It’s been straight-up false.“The Trump administration put in place a disastrous gag rule for the Title X program that forced Washington state providers—and so many others—out of the Title X program for years.“I led the charge in making sure the Biden Administration worked to quickly reverse the rule and rebuild the program.“But just a couple of months ago, Republicans tried to reinstate it.“And yet, here they are again—claiming to support family planning services.“Well, this Thursday, the rubber hits the road.“On Thursday, we’re going to take to the Senate floor to seek unanimous consent to pass our bill and help get people the family planning services they need.“And I’d just ask all of my Republican colleagues—who have been loudly talking about supporting women, and families, and family planning, who have been using their so-called support for family planning as a way to cover up their extreme agenda: What is your word worth? Will you actually support women—and help them get the birth control they need?“People all across our country will be watching very closely.”###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/chairs-murray-scott-applaud-release-of-new-guidance-on-school-discipline/,"(Washington, D.C.) – Today, the Department of Education released new guidance for states and school districts to help school leaders address disparities in discipline for students with disabilities. In 2018, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that students with disabilities, along with Black students and boys, face disproportionate rates of discipline when compared to their peers.“No one should be unfairly disciplined in school because of their disability,” said Chair Patty Murray (D-WA), Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee. “I welcome the guidance announced today by the Biden administration after former Secretary DeVos failed to enforce key protections for students. This is an important step forward to help root out discriminatory disciplinary practices in our nation’s schools, and I applaud the administration for standing up for the rights of all students—including children with disabilities—to learn in a safe and supportive environment.”“The guidance the Biden administration issued today will help schools keep students and staff safe. Regrettably, two years ago the Trump administration used its school safety commission report to send the wrong and baseless message that schools are safest when they discriminate against students. I applaud this administration for supporting evidence-based solutions to help states and schools keep students safe—without employing discriminatory discipline practices,” said Chairman Robert C. “Bobby” Scott (VA-03), House Education and Labor Committee.Following the shootings in Parkland, Florida, and Santa Fe, Texas in 2018, the Trump administration—rather than working with Congress on gun control measures—established a federal school safety commission. In December 2018, without evidence, the commission recommended rescinding the 2014 Obama-era discipline guidanceon the grounds that curbing disproportionate suspensions of students of color made schools less safe.In 2020, the GAO reported findings that undermined the Trump administration’s reasoning for scaling back civil rights protections in K-12 schools. Moreover, GAO’s report found no causal link between punitive discipline practices, such as suspensions and expulsions, and school shootings—disputing the Trump administration’s claim that a lack of suspensions and expulsions of students of color contributes to mass school shootings. ###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Becerra and highlighted the need for a stronger federal mental health responseMurray: “When you are struggling, it makes all the difference in the world to know there is someone you can talk to who will listen and help you get the care you need—and that’s what the 988 suicide and crisis lifeline is all about.”Washington, D.C. – Today, Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), released the following statement on the launch of the new 988 suicide and crisis lifeline.“Getting mental health care is a serious challenge for people across Washington state and across the country, especially as our nation’s mental health crisis has worsened during the pandemic. So many people—particularly young people—are just not doing okay. When you are struggling, it makes all the difference in the world to know there is someone you can talk to who will listen and help you get the care you need—and that’s what the 988 suicide and crisis lifeline is all about.“That’s why I pushed so hard to establish this new 988 number for the suicide lifeline, and to provide additional resources in our bipartisan funding bill earlier this year to get ready for its launch. It’s also why it was important to me for Secretary Becerra to hear directly from crisis line operators in Seattle last month about the lifesaving work they do, and the federal support they need.  “Starting tomorrow, people facing a mental health crisis can call or text 988 to talk to someone and get the support they need. 988 will make the national lifeline easier than ever to reach—and help make sure everyone has someone to turn to. But this is just one step of many we must take to address our nation’s mental health and substance use disorder crisis. We also need to be clear-eyed about the current strain on our mental health system—I am going to keep working to strengthen the new 988 Lifeline to make sure it works as intended, and to pass other steps to support families and save lives.”Last month, Senator Murray hosted a roundtable at Crisis Connections, a crisis hotline center in Seattle where Secretary Becerra heard from Washington state mental health professionals on the front lines of their communities’ mental health challenges.Senator Murray has consistently spoken out about the need to address the mental health and substance use disorder crises that are hurting people all across the country. She has championed efforts in Congress to provide more support for communities responding to the mental health crisis and fought to secure over $5 billion dollars for federal mental health and substance use disorder programs in the recent, bipartisan government funding bill. The funding she secured included $101.6 million for the Suicide Prevention Lifeline to successfully transition to 988, a $77.6 million increase.As Chair of the Senate HELP Committee, she worked to secure significant investments in mental health in the recently passed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. She is also working on a bipartisan package to strengthen mental health services for children and youth, continue improving suicide screening and prevention to save lives, make it easier for people to get mental health care, and much more. Senator Murray has held two hearings this year focused on addressing the mental health crisis, and at a hearing on President Biden’s budget request pressed Secretary Becerra on the administration’s plans to tackle the crisis.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

According to the reports, 60 high-risk patient safety concerns occurred as a result of the EHR system, leading to thousands of orders for medical care getting sent to an undetectable location, rather than the intended care or service location, posing significant harm to patients. In addition, the VA OIG found that VA senior staff did not provide timely, complete, and accurate information regarding staff training of the EHR system, which greatly impeded oversight and failed to meet proficiency checks.“The new reports released by VA OIG make clear what I’ve been saying for a long time: the Electronic Health Record system is deeply flawed and cannot move another inch until its glaring errors are resolved,” said Senator Murray. “My number one priority here is patient safety and, as the reports make plain, the EHR system is jeopardizing patient safety to the tune of hundreds of orders.”“These reports tell a different story than VA and Oracle Cerner in that the OIG says there are still dozens of issues that have not been fixed. As I’ve said in the past, officials need to be completely transparent and cannot withhold or slow walk any information to the Inspector General’s office. So I’m going to carefully review these reports and continue to hold both VA and Oracle Cerner accountable.

https://www.murray.senate.gov/republican-senator-blocks-murray-cortez-masto-effort-to-protect-right-to-travel/,"***WATCH: Senator Murray calls out Republicans’ extremism on Senate floor***(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), and Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) sought unanimous consent to pass their bill to protect Americans’ fundamental right to travel across states lines—but Republican Senator James Lankford (R-OK) blocked the Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act of 2022. The legislation would protect every woman’s fundamental right to travel across state lines to receive abortion care—and to protect the providers who care for them—as extreme Republican lawmakers seek to punish women for exercising their right to travel to get the care they need.“Republicans lawmakers have already set their sights on ripping away the right to travel. Let’s be really clear what that means: they want to hold women captive in their own states,” Senator Murray said on the floor. “They want to punish women—and anyone who might help them—for exercising their constitutional right to travel within our country to get the services they need in another state.”“It should be hard to think of something more extreme, more barbaric, more un-American than ripping away women’s rights and forcing them to travel hundreds of miles to get an abortion. And yet, here Republicans stand, saying no. Saying to American women: ‘We don’t just want to control your bodies—we want to control your travel. We want to hold you captive in your state and force you to give birth.’ They should be ashamed of themselves,” Senator Murray said in a statement. “It’s disgraceful that anyone would object to making sure people can travel to other states for reproductive health care. It’s morally repugnant. By objecting to this bill, Republicans are rejecting any appearance of fighting for people’s rights, and embracing all-out oppression of women like never before.”The Senators introduced the legislation earlier this week alongside Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and many of their Democratic colleagues. Legislation introduced in Missouri and draft legislation proposed by anti-choice extremists make clear that interstate travel for reproductive health care is under attack. The Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act of 2022 underscores the Constitutional protections for interstate travel and provides redress for women whose rights are violated. The legislation would also protect health care providers in pro-choice states from prosecution and lawsuits for serving individuals traveling from other states.Read full text of the legislation here.Since the leaked draft revealed the Supreme Court was planning to overturn Roe, Senator Murray has been a leader in the Senate pushing back: immediately calling the decision a “five alarm fire,” pushing for a vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act so every Republican Senator was forced to show the American public where they stood, and leading her colleagues in the fight to protect everyone’s reproductive rights. Senator Murray has led her colleagues in urging the Biden administration to craft an all-of-government plan to protect abortion rights. She called out data brokers’ collection and sale of sensitive location data that could put those seeking abortion care at risk—and introduced legislation to ban the practice outright. She introduced legislation condemning the criminalization of the full range of reproductive and sexual health care. Senator Murray also introduced legislation to expand access to affordable, over-the-counter birth control—and has led efforts in Congress to ensure patients can get the birth control they need without being forced to jump through unnecessary hoops or pay out-of-pocket.In the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling, Senator Murray has led her colleagues in calling on the Biden administration to take bold action to protect Americans’ reproductive rights. Senator Murray held a hearing yesterday on reproductive health care in a post-Roe America and the barriers, challenges, and threats it poses to women’s health.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Our veterans and their families, who selflessly served our nation and have sacrificed so much, must be afforded the benefits they have so rightly earned,” wrote the senators.Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee (SVAC), led 40 of her Democratic colleagues in the Senate in a letter to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Denis McDonough urging answers and speedy action to ensure same-sex veteran couples have access to the full and complete spousal benefits they are owed.“Each of our veterans and their spouses deserve the same quality care and services once they leave the military – no matter who they love. Our veterans and their families, who selflessly served our nation and have sacrificed so much, must be afforded the benefits they have so rightly earned. This is not only a matter of fairness and equity, it is the morally right thing to do,” wrote the senators. “Yet, we have recently heard from numerous survivors about issues they are facing when they attempt to access the full Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits that they are entitled to under the law.”In the letter, the senators underscored reported examples of VA’s refusal to deem same-sex marriages as having met the statutory marriage duration or deadline requirements when couples were legally barred from marrying within that timeframe immediately before the veteran’s death. The senators highlighted how denying benefits in cases where same-sex couples failed to meet marriage duration requirements have left them ineligible for benefits due to living in places where marriage laws barred them from marrying—even though they were in loving, committed relationships and would have married earlier if they could. Whereas other federal agencies like the Social Security Administration took action to accept and reconsider claims for survivor benefits by same-sex spouses and partners who were previously unable to meet marriage duration requirements, VA has failed to provide recourse for same-sex couples held back by unconstitutional and discriminatory laws. The senators called for VA to make eligible for benefits bona fide same-sex relationships who have been denied benefits solely because they could not meet a strict marriage durational requirement.In addition, the senators noted VA’s setting of effective dates for benefits deepens the unconstitutional practice of same-sex marriage bans. Even after the Department of Justice announced that it would no longer enforce laws banning benefits to same-sex spouses of veterans, VA interpreted the announcement to apply retroactively, but only “as to claims for benefits based on same-sex marriages that were pending on direct review as of” the date of the Attorney General’s announcement, cutting short benefits of those in same-sex marriages who initially applied for such benefits, and were denied due to bans on same-sex marriage. The senators made clear that VA must end its discriminatory treatment of veterans’ spouses based on who they love, and apply effective dates as though the former unconstitutional laws were never enacted.The senators conclude, “We promise to take care of all our veterans after they serve our country, and that includes ensuring that their partners have access to full and complete spousal benefits. Correcting this error will help end the discriminatory treatment of potentially thousands of same-sex veteran couples and allow them to access the benefits they are owed.”In addition to Senator Murray, the letter was also signed by Senators Warnock (D-GA), Duckworth (D-IL), Blumenthal (D-CT), Baldwin (D-WI), Markey (D-MA), Hirono (D-HI), Luján (D-NM), Smith (D-MN), Hassan (D-NH), Whitehouse (D-RI), Murphy (D-CT), Sanders (D-VT), Gillibrand (D-NY), Heinrich (D-NM), Durbin (D-IL), Warren (D-MA), Klobuchar (D-MN), Menendez (D-NJ), Casey (D-PA), Kaine (D-VA), Schumer (D-NY), Cortez Masto (D-NV), Bennet (D-CO), Padilla (D-CA), Wyden (D-OR), Reed (D-RI), Shaheen (D-NH), Warner (D-VA), Booker (D-NJ), Merkley (D-OR), Rosen (D-NV), Feinstein (D-CA), Peters (D-MI), Brown (D-OH), Cantwell (D-WA), Coons (D-DE), Cardin (D-MD), Schatz (D-HI), Leahy (D-VT), and Kelly (D-AZ).This letter follows a similar letter Senator Murray and Senator Wyden led with 43 of their Senate Democratic colleagues last December to Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen and Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service Charles Rettig calling for the Biden Administration to revise current guidance that has led to members of the LGBT community being denied pension survivor benefits after losing their life partner. That request is still under review with the agency.Full text of the letter below, and PDF available HERE:Dear Secretary McDonough:We write to inquire about the discriminatory treatment of certain same-sex veteran couples who are being denied full and complete spousal benefits. We must ensure that the unconstitutional laws of the past do not further harm the surviving loved ones of our country’s LGBTQ+ veterans.Each of our veterans and their spouses deserve the same quality care and services once they leave the military – no matter who they love. Our veterans and their families, who selflessly served our nation and have sacrificed so much, must be afforded the benefits they have so rightly earned. This is not only a matter of fairness and equity, it is the morally right thing to do.Yet, we have recently heard from numerous survivors about issues they are facing when they attempt to access the full Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits that they are entitled to under the law. It has come to our attention that VA is refusing to deem same-sex marriages as having met the statutory marriage duration or deadline requirements when the couples were legally barred from marrying within that timeframe immediately before the veteran’s death. For example, dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) benefits may only be awarded if the surviving spouse was married to the veteran for at least one year or within 15 years of the veteran’s discharge,1 and for eight years in the case of enhanced DIC benefits.2 Survivor’s pension benefits also have a one-year marriage duration requirement.3By denying benefits in cases where same-sex couples failed to meet marriage duration requirements, VA ignores the reality that discriminatory marriage laws where these couples lived barred them from marrying—even though they were in loving, committed relationships and would have married earlier if they could. It was not until the Supreme Court held in Obergefell v. Hodges a constitutional right to marry that same-sex relationships were properly recognized, including the “constellation” of rights associated with marriage, such as the “rights and benefits of survivors.”4  After courts found unconstitutional the nine-month marriage duration requirement under the Social Security Act when applied to same-sex couples who were barred from meeting the requirement due to discriminatory marriage laws, the Social Security Administration began accepting and reconsidering claims for survivor benefits by same-sex spouses and partners who were unable to be married for the requisite nine months because of these bans on same-sex marriage.5 VA should do the same for veterans survivor benefits. Just like the unconstitutional laws banning same-sex couples from marrying, denials for veterans benefits that are tied to those marriage bans are unconstitutional too.Specifically, VA must make eligible for benefits bona fide same-sex relationships where either the same-sex couple had married but were prevented from being married for the time required under the statute, or where they were prevented from marrying each other at all. While marriage duration requirements may be defensible as a proxy for detecting or deterring sham relationships between opposite-sex couples—who have always enjoyed the right to marry—they cannot serve that function for same-sex couples who were barred from marrying one another. Surviving same-sex partners and spouses of veterans who were unable to marry because of now unconstitutional marriage laws should not be denied benefits solely because they did not meet a strict marriage durational requirement. We urge VA to be mindful of other past, discriminatory practices that upended the lives our veterans and their families – like the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy – and look primarily to the surviving partner’s own statements about whether and when they would have married but for unconstitutional bans on same-sex marriage.It also has come to our attention that VA’s setting of effective dates for benefits furthers these unconstitutional same-sex marriage bans. After the Supreme Court held that the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages under state law in June 2013, the Department of Justice subsequently announced on September 4, 2013, that it would no longer enforce laws banning benefits to same-sex spouses of veterans.6 The VA General Counsel interpreted the announcement to apply retroactively but only “as to claims for benefits based on same-sex marriages that were pending on direct review as of” the date of the Attorney General’s announcement.7 For claims received or re-applied for after the Attorney General’s announcement, “such claims could receive an effective date up to one year prior to receipt of the claim, but in no event earlier than September 4, 2013.”8By setting an effective date no earlier than September 4, 2013, VA is giving credence to the unconstitutional laws that prevented same-sex spouses from obtaining veterans benefits in the first place. A spouse married to an opposite-sex veteran would have had no issues receiving benefits immediately. However, VA is cutting short benefits of those in same-sex marriages who initially applied for such benefits and were denied due to bans on same-sex marriage. Moreover, any delay by a widow of a same-sex veteran in filing a claim for spousal benefits can be directly linked to VA’s enforcement of unconstitutional laws that would have led to the ultimate denial of such benefits. VA must stop its discriminatory treatment of veterans’ spouses based on their sex or sexual orientation, and apply retroactive effective dates as if the unconstitutional laws struck down by the Supreme Court were never enacted. Prior claims not previously appealed should be permitted to be reopened, as well as new claims to be filed.We promise to take care of all our veterans after they serve our country, and that includes ensuring that their partners have access to full and complete spousal benefits. Correcting this error will help end the discriminatory treatment of potentially thousands of same-sex veteran couples and allow them to access the benefits they are owed. Thank you for your attention to this important matter, and we look forward to hearing back from you soon. Sincerely, ###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/biden-nominates-jamal-whitehead-and-kymberly-evanson-at-senator-murrays-recommendation-to-western-district-of-washington/,"Following Senator Murray’s Recommendation, President Biden Makes Whitehead His First Disabled Nominee to the Federal Bench(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) applauded President Biden’s nomination of Jamal Whitehead and Kymberly Evanson to serve on the Western District Court in Washington state following her recommendation. Whitehead is the first disabled Biden Administration nominee to the federal bench.“Our federal bench should be filled with judges who are committed to justice and who reflect the diversity of the communities they serve—which is why I am thrilled for Jamal, his family, and the Western District of Washington state,” said Senator Murray. “Throughout his career, Jamal has prioritized those who have been discriminated against in the workplace or have been victims of other unlawful employment practices. The people of Washington state deserve a justice system that works for everyone, not just the wealthy and powerful. I look forward to his swift confirmation so he can get to work for the community he grew up in and the people of Washington state.”Whitehead is currently a shareholder at Schroeter Goldmark & Bender (SGB) in Seattle. His practice focuses on civil litigation, with a focus on representing individuals facing workplace discrimination, retaliation, and other unlawful employment practices as well as bringing class actions based on similar practices. Whitehead’s trial experience includes serving as lead class counsel for over 10,000 detained individuals at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma. The suit resulted in a jury award of $17.3 million to the class for backpay owed by the private-prison giant GEO Group, who operates the Northwest Detention Center. Whitehead received his B.A. the University of Washington and his J.D. from Seattle University School of Law.“The Western District of Washington state deserves judges who will apply the law fairly and evenly, and that’s exactly who they’ll get in Kymberly Evanson,” Senator Murray continued. “Kymberly has extensive litigation experience on behalf of municipalities and has been steadfast in her commitment to fairness and to justice, especially in her pro bono practice and her work on First Amendment cases. The Senate should move to confirm her without delay so she can continue to work for the people of Washington state.”Evanson is a partner at Pacifica Law Group, where she represents state, municipal, private, and non-profit clients on matters involving the First Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and a range of other constitutional, municipal, elections, and administrative matters. Prior to joining Pacifica in 2011, Evanson was an associate at K&L Gates in Seattle. She has also represented various governmental entities across Washington state, including King County, Seattle-King County Public Health, the City of Seattle, and the State of Washington. She has also done significant pro bono work with a particular focus in recent years on clemency cases. Evanson received her undergraduate degree from Seattle University and her J.D. from Georgetown University. After graduating from law school, she clerked for Judge Emmet Sullivan on the District Court for the District of Columbia.Senator Murray has been a strong advocate for the confirmation of highly-qualified judicial nominees who reflect the diversity of communities in Washington state and America, pushing for greater professional diversity on the federal bench in particular. Since the start of this Congress, Senator Murray has secured the lifetime appointments of five highly qualified candidates as federal district court judges in Washington state.Most recently, Senator Murray secured the confirmations of Tana Lin, Washington state’s first ever Asian American federal judge and a former public defender and civil rights lawyer; Lauren King, a tribal law expert who is serving as Washington state’s first ever Native American federal judge; John Chun, who will be the first Asian American man to serve as a federal judge in Washington state; David Estudillo, the son of Mexican immigrants and a former immigration attorney; and Kit Dimke who is serving in the Eastern District of Washington from the Spokane Courthouse. Senator Murray is currently pushing to confirm Salvador Mendoza Jr. to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals who, as a child, worked as a farmworker and is the son of Mexican immigrants who worked as farm laborers, maids, and factory workers; and Tiffany Cartwright, a leading civil rights lawyer, both of whom advanced out the Senate Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support.  Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/at-hearing-senator-murray-spells-out-catastrophic-consequences-for-womens-health-in-a-post-roe-america/,"Senator Murray: “Republicans are going to force women to stay pregnant, not only when they don’t want to be—but even when it could kill them.”Senator Murray: “We will not let Republicans whistle past the graveyard they have spent so long digging. And we will absolutely not stop fighting with everything we’ve got to end this chaos, save lives, and codify the right to abortion into law.”***WATCH: SENATOR MURRAY’S OPENING REMARKS***(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, led a hearing on the state of reproductive care in a post-Roe America and the threats the Dobbs decision poses to women’s health. At the hearing, Senator Murray underscored the swift and harsh consequences the Dobbs decision and Republicans’ decades-long work to rip away the right to abortion has already had—and will continue to have—for millions of women across the country.“Three weeks ago, the Supreme Court—and the Republicans who dedicated years to swinging the court aggressively to the right—dragged our country back fifty years. They overturned Roe v. Wade, ended the right to abortion, and upended the lives of millions of people. And the consequences have been harsh and swift,” said Senator Murray. “And Republicans’ response to this devastation is to discuss how they can push even farther, be even crueler, take even more power away from patients, and scare even more doctors out of their jobs.”Senator Murray asked providers and experts about how forcing women to keep pregnancies jeopardizes the health and safety of women and patients across the country—and will exacerbate the United States’ maternal mortality crisis. Sharing the story of a constituent who survived two ectopic pregnancies, Senator Murray described how Republicans’ extreme policies prevent women from getting the medical care they need even when their pregnancies pose a threat to their lives—and stressed that the toll will fall hardest on people in rural areas, women of color, women with disabilities, and transgender patients, who already face steep barriers to getting care, but will, of course, hurt women everywhere in America.“Pregnancy is a life-changing medical procedure. It takes a physical toll. It takes a mental toll. And for too many women in our country, it takes their life. No one should be forced to go through this against their will. But Republicans are going to force women to stay pregnant, not only when they don’t want to be—but even when it could kill them,” said Senator Murray.“About one in fifty pregnancies in our country are ectopic. That means they are not viable, and without medical action they are deadly. But in Republicans’ post-Roe world—health care providers aren’t sure when or even if they will able to treat ectopic patients without being sent to prison. Some have already been instructed to observe patients until they have unstable vital signs before acting—basically, to sit on their hands until women are at dire risk, before they can do what they know is medically necessary,” said Senator Murray. “That is absolutely barbaric. And it’s a policy choice that Republicans have made.”Senator Murray noted that Republicans’ extreme agenda doesn’t just threaten the health of pregnant patients in states that have banned abortion. It affects a wide range of patients in every state as Republicans eye a nationwide abortion ban, cause health care crises across state lines, seek to restrict travel, and curtail access to medication abortion, birth control, services like IVF, and even lifesaving medications for patients with lupus, cancer, arthritis, and more.“Make no mistake—this isn’t just going to devastate patients in states with abortion bans,” said Senator Murray. “Republicans have been explicit that they want to go farther. They want to pass legislation to go after people who help patients travel for an abortion, and a national abortion ban that would trample the rights of patients in Washington state.”“This isn’t idle worrying. Because Republicans in several states have already proposed extreme bills that ban abortion starting at conception, and could impact IVF and some methods of birth control,” added Senator Murray. “And already, pharmacies have told patients with lupus, arthritis, and other conditions they can’t fill their prescriptions due to concerns the drugs would be used for an abortion.”Senator Murray stressed that Republicans cannot continue to ignore the devastation they have caused. And she stressed that she and her Democratic colleagues are not going to stop fighting to protect our fundamental rights—and with two more pro-choice Senators—will restore the right to abortion nationwide.“I’m going to continue standing with women and lifting up patients’ voices. And anyone who thinks I’m going to stop? Any Republican who thinks people will forget about this in a few months? You still do not get it,” said Senator Murray. “How little do you have to care about women to think anyone will forget the people who are killed by this? Women who can’t get an abortion but need one, who turned to unsafe misinformation because they were denied access to safe medical care. People who couldn’t get their prescription filled, couldn’t start chemo, or died in a maternal health care desert since doctors don’t want to be treated like criminals for doing their jobs.”“We will not let Republicans whistle past the graveyard they have spent so long digging. And we will absolutely not stop fighting with everything we’ve got to end this chaos, save lives, and codify the right to abortion into law. We will never stop fighting for women’s rights to control their own bodies. Never,” added Senator Murray.Senator Murray’s opening remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below:“Three weeks ago, the Supreme Court—and the Republicans who dedicated years to swinging the court aggressively to the right—dragged our country back fifty years.“They overturned Roe v. Wade, ended the right to abortion, and upended the lives of millions of people.“And the consequences have been harsh and swift.“Women sobbed in clinics, as they had their abortions canceled, their personal health care decisions overruled, their futures thrown in jeopardy, and their control over their own bodies taken away.“It was heartbreaking, terrifying, enraging, and barbaric. And that was just day one.“Since then, the devastating repercussions of Republicans’ cruelty continue to crash around us.“Women unable to get abortions for any reason. Health care providers unable to do their jobs without risking prison. Patients with lupus, cancer, arthritis, and more denied the medications they need. Complete uncertainty for people planning their futures as access to Plan B and IVF has been thrown into jeopardy.“And Republicans’ response to this devastation is to discuss how they can push even farther, be even crueler, take even more power away from patients, and scare even more doctors out of their jobs.“Republicans are talking about a federal ban on abortion—overruling laws in states like my home state of Washington, and ripping away rights from my constituents.“Republicans are talking about criminal penalties for women and health care providers.“Republicans are talking about making traveling to get an abortion illegal.“Republicans are talking about everything except the actual harm they are causing.“This is a health care crisis that was entirely avoidable—and is entirely their own creation.“I have been warning for years about Republicans’ attacks on reproductive rights putting lives at risk. And I am far from the only one.“Women, providers, and patients across the country have all been shouting from the rooftops, at the tops of their lungs that overturning Roe would be devastating.“But Republicans don’t care.“They have refused to listen to me or to the majority of people across the country who wanted Roe to stand—who wanted to keep their rights, and preserve women’s ability to control their own bodies.“And Republicans are still continuing to spread disinformation about the reality we’re facing, about the consequences of their backwards agenda. “I mean it’s unbelievable.“When the leaked decision came out, Republicans tried to say they weren’t going to put women and doctors in jail.. even as state legislatures across the country were already moving to do so.“And they are still trying to say it won’t be that bad, even when it’s clearly devastating for women across the country who they are ignoring and oppressing.“Well, today, they are going to hear exactly what their cruelty means for women seeking abortions women Republicans will force to stay pregnant when they don’t want to be—women whose bodies Republicans are taking control of without their consent and against their wishes.“And this isn’t just about whether people want to be parents—though let me be perfectly clear that we must do way more than Republicans have even dreamed of doing to actually support parents.“Child care, paid leave, you name it—Republicans have blocked Democrats’ non-stop efforts to deliver for working families.“But anyone who has given birth, also knows this isn’t just about whether you are ready to raise a child.“Pregnancy is a life-changing medical procedure. It takes a physical toll. It takes a mental toll. And for too many women in our country, it takes their life.“No one should be forced to go through this against their will.“But Republicans are going to force women to stay pregnant, not only when they don’t want to be—but even when it could kill them.“Just ask Elisabeth, who I spoke with last week in Spokane.“She has been pregnant four times, all planned, all wanted. But twice—she learned her pregnancy would be fatal if not ended. In the first instance—she got the heartbreaking news that one of the twins she was carrying had passed, the other could not possibly survive outside the womb, and that her life was in grave danger. In the second instance—she was told that without immediate action she would lose too much blood to survive the night.“As Elisabeth told me, “Had I lived in a state without access to safe and legal abortion, I would have died, bleeding out on the side of the road, trying to make it to a state that would help me.”“Those are the stakes. And not just for Elisabeth—but for so many patients.“About one in fifty pregnancies in our country are ectopic. That means they are not viable, and without medical action they are deadly.“But in Republicans’ post-Roe world—health care providers aren’t sure when or even if they will able to treat ectopic patients without being sent to prison.“Some have already been instructed to observe patients until they have unstable vital signs before acting—basically, to sit on their hands until women are at dire risk, before they can do what they know is medically necessary.“That is absolutely barbaric. And it’s a policy choice that Republicans have made.“Some may try to suggest patients go to another state, but if you’re in the middle of a medical emergency that is dangerous—or impossible.“Not to mention that Republicans are already discussing banning interstate travel.“And we cannot lose sight of the fact that the same patients and providers hurt by these restrictions are on the frontlines of our nation’s maternal mortality crisis.“We have the worst maternal death rate in the developed world. And in the very states where it is most dangerous to give birth, Republicans are now forcing people to give birth against their will.“It doesn’t take an expert to understand this is only going to get worse because of these dangerous abortion bans.“Women will be denied the care they need—the care their doctors know could save their lives.“States will lose maternal health care providers, who understandably don’t want to live where they could be jailed for doing their job.“And it can be even harder still for transgender patients seeking reproductive care while facing stigma, discrimination, and bigotry.“And make no mistake—this isn’t just going to devastate patients in states with abortion bans.“First off—I want to be very clear: Republicans have been explicit that they want to go farther. They want to pass legislation to go after people who help patients travel for an abortion, and a national abortion ban that would trample the rights of patients in Washington state.“And secondly, even now, health clinics are being overwhelmed.“I was just in Spokane last week, only miles from the Idaho border, and providers there are already seeing an uptick of patients, and preparing for a huge surge of patients seeking care when Idaho’s extreme ban goes into effect next door.“We are talking as many as five times more people seeking abortions at our clinics.“They are on the frontlines of a full blown health care crisis.“And let’s not forget there are so many women who can’t travel to get an abortion, who don’t have the time or resources, who face barriers to accessible travel, or who are too young to drive themselves.“There is also the very real risk that people with no other options will turn to dangerous, even deadly, misinformation that is spreading on social media.“Because as I have warned before, so many times: banning abortion doesn’t stop abortions, it just stops people from getting safe abortions.“And it is not only women seeking abortions who are having their lives totally upended by Republicans.“It’s women seeking birth control. Republicans have discussed going after contraception next, and Justice Thomas said the Supreme Court should overturn the right to birth control …“People hoping to start a family using IVF could also be under threat. IVF providers have serious concerns about whether parents and providers could be punished if an embryo doesn’t survive being thawed for implantation, or for disposing unused embryos.“This isn’t idle worrying.“Because Republicans in several states have already proposed extreme bills that ban abortion starting at conception, and could impact IVF and some methods of birth control.“And already, pharmacies have told patients with lupus, arthritis, and other conditions they can’t fill their prescriptions due to concerns the drugs would be used for an abortion. And let’s be clear—these are drugs the FDA approved as safe and effective for their condition years ago.“There are also cancer patients who may be unable to start chemotherapy until they can get an abortion.“And then there are people who have a miscarriage. Abortion bans could jeopardize their health and stop them from getting the care they need to end their miscarriage. And afterwards, they could still face another nightmare: being reported by someone who thinks they got an abortion.“Imagine going through the heartbreak of losing your pregnancy, and then being put in prison for it.“And this doesn’t have to be an exercise in imagination.“From 2006 to 2020 over a thousand women in this country were investigated, detained, or arrested because of their pregnancy outcomes.“That is horrific. It’s a problem we should be trying to solve—and instead, thanks to Republicans, it’s about to get dramatically worse.“That’s why people across the country are so scared, so heartbroken, and so angry—and I am too.“Because the stakes could not possibly be higher.“That’s why I led Senate Democrats in pushing President Biden and his Administration to do everything they can to protect access to abortion and reproductive health care.“And President Biden’s executive order on abortion last week was a good, important step: but this fight is far from over.“As we continue living through a post-Roe health care crisis, I’m still urging the President to continue fighting back.“But with limited executive authority, ultimately: we need more pro-choice senators in the Senate willing to waive the filibuster so we can protect women. “If we can get that: we can codify Roe as well as put in law key protections for women. It’s as simple as that.“We also need to hold Republicans accountable for the harsh reality they have created.“That’s why I’m holding this hearing today.“It’s why later this week we will call for unanimous consent to pass a bill to protect women who travel to another state for abortion care to show the stark contrast between Republicans’ cruel agenda and Democrats’ steadfast commitment to ensuring women can get the reproductive health care they need.“And it’s why I’m going to continue standing with women and lifting up patients’ voices.“And anyone who thinks I’m going to stop? Any Republican who thinks people will forget about this in a few months?“You still do not get it.“How do you forget being denied your prescription because of this? Or being denied your birth control?“How do you forget having to drive across states to end a pregnancy so you can fight for your life against cancer?“How do you forget being forced to choose between saving your patient, and going to jail?“How do you forget your dream of starting a family through IVF becoming a legal nightmare?“How do you ever in your life forget being investigated for your miscarriage? Or driving your 10 year old daughter across state lines after she was raped and couldn’t get an abortion otherwise?“And how little do you have to care about women to think anyone will forget the people who are killed by this? Women who can’t get an abortion but need one, who turned to unsafe misinformation because they were denied access to safe medical care. People who couldn’t get their prescription filled, couldn’t start chemo, or died in a maternal health care desert since doctors don’t want to be treated like criminals for doing their jobs.“People will not forget those losses. They will sit across from that empty chair every day. They will sleep next to that empty space every night.  “Mark my words, they will not forget.“And Democrats will not let Republicans ignore them either.“We will not let Republicans whistle past the graveyard they have spent so long digging.“And we will absolutely not stop fighting with everything we’ve got to end this chaos, save lives, and codify the right to abortion into law.“We will never stop fighting for women’s rights to control their own bodies.“Never.”###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/senator-murray-statement-on-the-confirmation-of-steve-dettelbach-as-atf-director/,"Senator Murray: “After a years-long vacancy, the ATF will finally have a permanent director that will help enforce the gun laws on the books and give law enforcement the tools they need to prevent and prosecute gun crimes.”ICYMI: Senator Murray Helps Pass Bipartisan Gun Safety Bill, Calls to Do More to Keep Students, Families Safe – MORE HERE(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee issued the following statement following the confirmation of Steve Dettelbach as the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The ATF, the primary government agency charged with regulating the firearms industry, has been without a permanent, Senate-confirmed director since 2015.“After a years-long vacancy, the ATF will finally have a permanent director that will help enforce the gun laws on the books and give law enforcement the tools they need to prevent and prosecute gun crimes. I am proud to help confirm Steve Dettelbach as ATF Director and know that he will do everything in his power to curb gun trafficking, hold the gun industry accountable, and fulfill the ATF’s duty to publicly release critical gun tracing data,” said Senator Murray.  “I fought hard to pass the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and now, with Director Dettelbach’s leadership, we can work together to protect students and families across the country from gun violence.”As Chair of the HELP Committee and a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Murray has repeatedly fought to invest federal resources in gun violence prevention research—notably, in 2020 Murray helped usher in the first federal funding for gun violence prevention research in decades and has successfully fought to sustain that funding every year since. Murray has been a strong supporter of common-sense gun safety reforms. For years, Senator Murray has pushed for popular reforms such as universal background checks, an assault weapons ban, extreme risk protection orders, and more. Senator Murray voted to help pass the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act last month.While Washington state already has many of these measures in place at the state level, Senator Murray has made clear that the epidemic of gun violence in America cannot be fully addressed without federal action. Senator Murray has cosponsored important firearm legislation proposals in this Congress. Murray is a cosponsor of the Background Check Expansion Act, the Assault Weapons Ban Act, and the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act (ERPO is another term used for red flag laws). Senator Murray also applauded President Biden’s decision to treat ghost guns as the deadly weapons they are and is a cosponsor of the 3D Printed Gun Safety Act. Following the Uvalde school shooting, Senator Murray delivered a speech on the Senate floor, calling on Republicans to answer the call of the American people and come to the table to make progress on gun violence prevention.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/murray-cortez-masto-introduce-bill-to-protect-womens-right-to-travel-across-state-lines-to-seek-abortion-care/,"(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP), and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) led a group of their Democratic colleagues, including Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), in introducing the Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act of 2022 to protect every woman’s constitutional right to travel across states lines to receive abortion care—and the providers who care for them.“Republicans have ripped away every woman’s right to decide whether or not to keep a pregnancy, and now some Republican lawmakers want to hold women captive in their own states by punishing them for exercising their constitutional right to travel within our country to get the care they need,” said Senator Murray. “Restricting women’s right to travel across state lines is truly radical—and un-American. Our bill would protect Americans’ constitutional right to travel across state lines to get a lawful abortion—and protect the providers who care for them. Even as Republicans go to the ends of the Earth to strip away our constitutional rights, Democrats are fighting back to protect them.”“As women’s reproductive rights are attacked across the country, we must do everything we can to protect women who will be forced to cross state lines to receive abortion services,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “This legislation would make it clear that anti-choice states can’t prosecute women who travel to another state for reproductive care, and it would also protect reproductive health care providers and others who help women travel for the care they need and deserve.” Legislation introduced in Missouri and draft legislation proposed by anti-choice extremists make clear that interstate travel for reproductive health care is under attack. The Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act of 2022 underscores the Constitutional protections for interstate travel and provides redress for women whose rights are violated. The legislation would also protect health care providers in pro-choice states like Washington from prosecution and lawsuits for serving individuals traveling from other states.In addition to Senators Cortez Masto, Whitehouse, Murray, and Gillibrand, the legislation is also cosponsored by Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Jon Tester (D-Mont.).  Since the leaked draft revealed the Supreme Court was planning to overturn Roe, Senator Murray has been a leader in the Senate pushing back: immediately calling the decision a “five alarm fire,” pushing for a vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act so every Republican Senator was forced to show the American public where they stood, and leading her colleagues in the fight to protect everyone’s reproductive rights. Senator Murray has led her colleagues in urging the Biden administration to craft an all-of-government plan to protect abortion rights. She called out data brokers’ collection and sale of sensitive location data that could put those seeking abortion care at risk—and introduced legislation to ban the practice outright. She introduced legislation condemning the criminalization of the full range of reproductive and sexual health care. Senator Murray also introduced legislation to expand access to affordable, over-the-counter birth control—and has led efforts in Congress to ensure patients can get the birth control they need without being forced to jump through unnecessary hoops or pay out-of-pocket.In the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling, Senator Murray has led her colleagues in calling on the Biden administration to take bold action to protect Americans’ reproductive rights—and will hold a hearing tomorrow on reproductive health care in a post-Roe America and the barriers, challenges, and threats it poses to women’s health.Read full text of the legislation here.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

With Republicans stripping women of their fundamental reproductive rights, I’m fighting hard to ensure everyone can get the birth control they want—without extra hoops or extra costs. It’s amazing to see today’s announcement of the first-ever FDA application for an over-the-counter birth control pill—because it means it may soon be easier than ever for women to get birth control without needing a prescription. That’s huge.“But it’s not enough for an over-the-counter birth control pill to be available to women—it has to be affordable, too, and that’s why we need to pass my Affordability is Access Act. Once the FDA determines an over-the-counter option to be safe and effective for use without a prescription, it should be approved without delay and must be fully covered by insurance just like other FDA-approved birth control—and that’s exactly what my bill will do.”The Affordability is Access Act ensures that people across the country can access and afford over-the-counter birth control options and plan their own reproductive lives, on their own terms.

https://www.murray.senate.gov/senator-murray-urges-department-of-justice-to-issue-new-rules-to-ensure-protections-for-people-with-disabilities-on-the-internet/,"(Washington, D.C.) – U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, joined a group of 12 senators in calling on the Department of Justice (DOJ) to support online protections for Americans with disabilities. The senators asked DOJ to restart a rulemaking process under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to establish new rules to enforce ADA protections online.“The United States has invested billions of dollars to develop technology and provide connectivity to all parts of the country, but it is of little value to the Americans who are unable to access the online services that the rest of us so heavily rely on,” the senators wrote to Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who leads the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division. “When Congress enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, the Internet and digital technologies were at a nascent stage. More than thirty years later, these technologies are now ubiquitous and we rely on them for daily activities—such as communicating with friends and family, conducting business, accessing government resources, and obtaining health care. New rules are necessary so that individuals with disabilities are provided equal access to the digital world.”In addition to Schatz, the letter was signed by U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Bob Casey (D-PA), Ben Schatz, (D-HI), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), Ed Markey (D-MA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).In their letter, the senators cited a study analyzing the top one million most-visited websites which found the overwhelming majority of these websites were inaccessible in some way to people with disabilities. More than 4,000 cases were filed in federal and state courts referencing ADA compliance last year, but their verdicts remain uncertain without DOJ regulations.Last month, Senator Murray also called on the Department to provide better guidance and regulations to help state and local governments better comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act’s (ADA) accessibility requirements on their websites, mobile applications, and other platforms. The full text of the letter is available here and below:Dear Assistant Attorney General Clarke:We are writing to you to urge the Department of Justice to restart the rulemaking process under Titles II and III of the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) and ensure that it includes protections to stop the persistent exclusion of people with disabilities from the Internet. The United States has invested billions of dollars to develop technology and provide connectivity to all parts of the country, but it is of little value to the Americans who are unable to access the online services that the rest of us so heavily rely on.The ADA is landmark civil rights legislation that guarantees people with disabilities have an equal right to employment, commerce, and government services. Unfortunately, the digital world has not granted these protections consistent with the physical world. An analysis of the top one million visited web sites found that the overwhelming majority are inaccessible in some way. Even the largest and most successful online companies have failed to incorporate basic features, such as alt text, to make their products accessible.The Department of Justice has the authority and ability to initiate a rulemaking and establish rules that make it clear that the ADA applies to the Internet. We appreciate the Department’s stated position on the issue and the recently published guidelines on “Web Accessibility and the ADA”. However, without rules from the Department, courts have had differing interpretations on when and how the ADA should apply to the Internet. Over 4,000 cases were filed in federal and state courts referencing ADA compliance in 2021, but their verdicts are uncertain without the Department’s regulations.As you are aware, a similar rulemaking to the one we are urging you to prepare was initiated in 2010 under the Obama administration, but rules were never issued and the Trump administration withdrew the proposed rulemaking. It is critical that the Department restart the rulemaking and include strong protections clarifying the applicability of the ADA to the Internet. Individuals with disabilities cannot afford to wait any longer for the Department to affirm their civil rights.When Congress enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, the Internet and digital technologies were at a nascent stage. More than thirty years later, these technologies are now ubiquitous and we rely on them for daily activities—such as communicating with friends and family, conducting business, accessing government resources, and obtaining health care. New rules are necessary so that individuals with disabilities are provided equal access to the digital world.Thank you for your attention to this important matter.Sincerely,###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

These kinds of investments will also help strengthen our supply chains as we work to get goods where they need to go as quickly as possible to lower costs on shelves. As Washington state continues to lead and grow as a hub for travel and commerce, I’m going to keep working to make sure our airports have the resources they need to deliver world class service for everyone who lives in and passes through our state.”“As our airports are seeing a pre-pandemic level of passenger demand, it’s important that we continue to invest in our airport infrastructure to prepare for future growth,” said Senator Cantwell. “This $32.8 million in new funding to upgrade airport terminals will expand service in Spokane by adding gate capacity that will bring new flights to additional destinations, construct a brand new airport terminal building in Pullman, and improve the traveler experience in Seattle.”The following Airport Terminal Program grants were awarded:Last year, Senators Murray and Cantwell worked hard to secure funding for air travel infrastructure nationwide as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. With their support, the infrastructure package provided a total of $25 billion for airport improvements, including $5 billion for the Airport Terminal Program, $5 billion for Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control facilities, and $15 billion in Airport Infrastructure Grants. Senators Murray and Cantwell also helped to secure $16 million for Spokane Regional Airport in Airport Rescue Grants to help weather the COVID-19 pandemic.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/statement-from-senator-murray-on-biden-issuing-an-abortion-executive-order-following-murray-led-push-from-senate-democrats/,"(Washington, DC) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, released the following statement in response to news that President Joe Biden is issuing an executive order on protecting abortion access in light of the Dobbs decision. The executive order comes following a push from Senate Democrats, led by Senator Murray, urging the Biden Administration to “fight back and lead a national response to this devastating decision.”“Republicans have just dragged this country back 50 years, ripped away the constitutional right to abortion, and put women’s lives on the line: so this is really an all-hands-on-deck moment. That’s why I’ve pushed so hard for President Biden to do everything in his power to protect abortion access in America—because people across our country are scared, in need of guidance, and in need of care. After leading the charge urging the Biden Administration to act boldly and push the envelope following the Dobbs decision, I’m glad to see the President issue an executive order today to take steps to protect access to medication abortion, protect patients’ private information, safeguard access to emergency medical care, and help organize protection for women under legal threat just for getting the care they need.“These are good, important steps: but this fight is far from over. As we continue living through a post-Roe health care crisis, I urge the President to continue doing everything he can to fight back—and I’ll continue the fight here in Congress and work to make clear to voters what’s at stake this November. The reality is that the President’s executive authority is limited—so the surest way to protect every woman’s right to abortion is electing two more pro-choice Democratic senators and protecting our pro-choice majority in the House so that we can codify Roe.”Senator Murray has led the push urging the Biden Administration to act to protect abortion rights. During a hearing she led in May, Senator Murray pressed Secretary Becerra on the Administration’s plans to protect the right to abortion and noted that, “I have been warning for years that this is Republicans’ goal, and … [people] need to see leadership from the Biden Administration on this too. So I hope to hear more from you today about the Administration’s plan to respond to this latest attack, and protect women’s health because make no mistake: women’s lives are on the line.”Since then, she has continued urging action, leading a letter—alongside Senator Warren—calling on President Biden to immediately issue an executive order to launch an all-of-government response to protect abortion access, including by increasing access to medication abortion, providing resources for those seeking abortion care in other states, protecting sensitive data, and using federal property and resources to increase access to abortion. She has been outspoken in urging the President to act, saying in a press conference: “We’re going to be loud. We’re going to be relentless. Because, Mr. President, we need a plan to protect reproductive rights in America—and we need it now.”###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

During the event, Senator Murray underscored the heavy toll the system rollout has taken on veterans and VA staff, and reaffirmed her commitment to ensuring veterans in Eastern Washington can access high-quality, timely health care. Senator Murray visited the Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center to speak directly with patients and providers on the ground about their experiences.“I have heard countless stories of veterans receiving the wrong medication in the mail, doctors not being able to see as many patients as they could, and, as we’ve all seen, near total shutdowns of the hospital, all because this system was not ready to go live,” said Senator Murray. “I appreciate that this system was designed to help veterans and increase their access to care here in Eastern Washington. But the faulty rollout of this system has resulted in serious patient safety risks—and that is not acceptable under any circumstance. We have a serious obligation to our veterans to make sure that they can get timely, high-quality medical care. For me, this is personal. My dad was a veteran and when he got sick with Multiple Sclerosis, the VA helped our family out. And that’s how it should be.”In her remarks, Senator Murray highlighted steps she has taken to hold VA and Oracle Cerner accountable for the recurring outages and degradations happening at Mann-Grandstaff. During the press conference, Senator Murray stressed that her message to previous and current administrations regarding the rollout has stayed consistent: VA must resolve these issues.“It doesn’t matter if this began under the Trump administration—it matters that VA fixes this broken system and fixes it as quickly as possible. I have spoken to Secretary McDonough and other senior VA officials about this many times—both in public and private—and I have also recently spoken to senior leadership at Oracle. I have made clear that it is absolutely critical that the EHR system be fixed immediately before any other patients slip through cracks because of a broken electronic record system,” continued Senator Murray.  “Now, I am glad I was able to convince VA to delay its rollout of the EHR system from expanding any further in Washington state—not just because similar failures at even larger, more complex facilities like in Puget Sound would be really catastrophic—but because the top priority and focus right now needs to be fixing things here in Spokane—period.”“I have visited and met with VA staff in every part of Washington state. The doctors and nurses and everyone else working here at Mann-Grandstaff really care about this work and their mission, but right now they’re bogged down by a faulty electronic health record system that isn’t working for them. So my job as I see it: is to fight just as hard for them as they fight for our patients—our veterans—by taking their stories, their concerns, and their perspectives directly to Secretary McDonough and anyone else who can make this right,” said Senator Murray in closing.Following her remarks, Murray toured the Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center and then met directly with veterans and providers in-person to get their perspective as she continues her oversight of VA and Oracle Cerner.Senator Murray has been conducting oversight on the EHR rollout at Mann-Grandstaff VAMC for years. She pressed then-VA Secretary Wilkie about the EHR rollout in September of 2018 and wrote a letter in January 2020 to VA leadership expressing her concern on reports of staffing and facility issues at Mann-Grandstaff VAMC, and how those issues could affect the EHR rollout. Following Senator Murray’s actions, VA initially delayed rollout of the EHR program at Mann-Grandstaff until March 2020. In July of 2021, Senator Murray pressed Secretary McDonough on patient safety in light of reports of veterans receiving incorrect medications, the need for more staff support from VA, and how VA will avoid the issues that have arisen at Mann-Grandstaff VAMC moving forward and at other VA medical centers. Senator Murray has since raised the need to resolve issues with care at Mann-Grandstaff with Secretary McDonough and other VA officials multiple times in private meetings and public hearings.In December of last year, Senator Murray pressed Secretary McDonough for solutions and transparency during a Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee hearing. During the hearing, Senator Murray underscored VA’s responsibility to address the problems that veterans are seeing at Mann-Grandstaff VAMC, and pressed Secretary McDonough for assurances that these issues would be resolved quickly and would not arise at other VA medical centers in Washington state, such as Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VAMC in Walla Walla. Importantly, Senator Murray pressed Secretary McDonough for concrete steps being taken to address the challenges in Spokane and secured a commitment from him that VA would share clear indicators of readiness before deploying the new EHR program at any other sites in Washington state, specifically Walla Walla.In March of this year, Senator Murray issued a statement demanding a pause of the Cerner Electronic Health Record system rollout in Washington state, citing patient safety risks, and demanding the concerns laid out in reports from the VA OIG – and previous reports over the last two years – be resolved first before the EHR program be deployed at any other sites in Washington state. Last month, during a Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee hearing, Senator Murray pressed VA Secretary McDonough to halt the rollout of the Cerner Electronic Health Record System rollout in Washington state until the program’s ongoing issues are fixed. On June 7 of 2022, Murray and SVAC Chairman Jon Tester (D-MT) urged Secretary McDonough to address and fix repeated failures of Cerner’s Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) program at VA facilities in Washington state and across the country.Last month, Senator Murray responded to VA’s announcement of its decision to delay its rollout of the EHRM program at four of its upcoming sites. The announcement follows reporting on a draft report by the VA OIG which claims that almost 150 veterans have been harmed due to EHR system failures. Furthermore, the draft report found that while Cerner Corporation was aware of flaws in its EHR system, it still proceeded to move forward with its rollout and neglected to repair it or inform the VA before its launch in October 2020. This follows months of pressure by Senator Murray in response to alarming reports by the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) of serious patient safety risks due to recurring failures of the Cerner system at VA’s pilot location of Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane, Washington. Additionally, Senator Murray helped pass the bipartisan VA Electronic Health Record Transparency Act into law. The legislation she helped introduce will increase transparency at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) by requiring the Secretary to submit periodic reports to Congress regarding the costs, performance metrics, and outcomes for Oracle Cerner electronic health record (EHR) system rollout.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Wade affects their ability to care for patients—particularly with Idaho’s abortion ban set to go into effect in just a matter of days.During her visit, Senator Murray highlighted how the Dobbs decision and Republicans’ extreme abortion bans in states like Idaho are creating health care crises as patients are forced to travel across states lines to get the care they need. In particular, Senator Murray noted that five times as many patients might soon seek abortion care at clinics in Eastern Washington when Idaho’s extreme abortion ban goes into effect in a matter of days. Senator Murray also stressed that a national ban on abortion—threatening access to essential reproductive care in every state, including Washington—is a very real and current threat to women’s health being pushed by prominent Republican leaders at every level of government.“The staff here is already seeing an uptick of patients, and are preparing for a surge of patients seeking care from Idaho because just a few miles from here, abortion bans are about to take effect that will force women to travel across state lines just to get the care they need. Because of this horrific ban, we could have five times as many people seeking abortions at this clinic and clinics like it,” said Senator Murray. “And Republicans have made it abundantly clear they won’t stop here—they want a federal ban on abortion. They want to overrule abortion protections in states like ours to ban abortion everywhere. So make no mistake: we are on the frontlines of a looming health care crisis. One that will be devastating for patients from Idaho and Washington state alike. One that will cost women their lives. And it is caused entirely by Republicans who have spent nearly five decades to this very end: taking away our rights.”“We’re now a little over two weeks into this awful new reality, and I just want everyone here to know while I am furious, while I am heartbroken, I will never back away from this fight,” continued Senator Murray. “I’m fighting hard, with everything I’ve got, and I’m so thankful to be here today with such amazing partners. These providers are doing incredibly important work—even in the face of harassment and intimidation. The care they provide is essential. It saves lives. And I can’t thank them enough for the work they do.” “We are already seeing the impacts of harmful legislation with 62% of our patient visits for abortion care in Pullman travelling from Idaho this year,” said Paul Dillon, Vice President of Public Affairs for Planned Parenthood of Greater Washington and North Idaho. “But know this: Our health centers in Washington – with our supportive and expert clinical staff — continue to provide the care and resources you’ve come to rely on. We believe all people — no matter where they live — should have the right to control their own body, life, and future. It is unjust and unacceptable that more than half of the states in the US, including our neighbors in Idaho, are moving to rob patients of that right, forced to overcome unjust barriers simply to access the abortion care they need and deserve.”Since the leaked draft revealed the Supreme Court was planning to overturn Roe, Senator Murray has been a leader in the Senate pushing back: immediately calling the decision a “five alarm fire,” pushing for a vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act so every Republican Senator was forced to show the American public where they stood, and leading her colleagues in the fight to protect everyone’s reproductive rights. Senator Murray has led her colleagues in urging the Biden administration to craft an all-of-government plan to protect abortion rights. She called out data brokers’ collection and sale of sensitive location data that could put those seeking abortion care at risk—and introduced legislation to ban the practice outright.

Senator Murray also introduced legislation to expand access to affordable, over-the-counter birth control—and has led efforts in Congress to ensure patients can get the birth control they need without being forced to jump through unnecessary hoops or pay out-of-pocket.In the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling, Senator Murray has announced that she will use her gavel as chair of the Senate Health Committee and hold a hearing on the decision’s devastating impacts on women’s health—and she has led her colleagues in once again calling on the Biden administration to take bold action to protect Americans’ reproductive rights.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

The DOJ is awarding $500,o00 to each of the six newly selected sites, including the City of Yakima. This is part of the DOJ’s ongoing effort to help communities across the country reduce domestic violence homicides and injuries committed with firearms.“As we work to end gun violence and domestic violence in our communities, these federal dollars will help save lives,” said Senator Murray. “I’m glad to see Yakima selected as a Firearms Technical Assistance Project site. By providing funding directly to communities, DOJ is giving cities like Yakima the resources and support they need to keep people safe in their own home. In Congress, I’m proud to have recently helped close the boyfriend loophole to finally keep firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers and I’ll keep working to build safer communities every way that I can.”Yakima and the other new FTAP sites will receive direct financial support as well as technical assistance designed to help each site implement best practices for preventing the use of firearms in domestic violence and incorporate community partners into their efforts to implement effective responses to firearms and domestic violence. FTAP is a part of the DOJ’s comprehensive strategy for reducing violent crime and was included in the White House’s Fact Sheet on Highlights from the Biden Administration’s Historic Efforts to Reduce Gun Violence. Senator Murray has been a longtime champion of preventing domestic violence and supporting survivors. Senator Murray voted to help pass the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which became law last month, and includes provisions to closes the boyfriend loophole. Senator Murray was a coauthor of the original Violence Against Women Act and has continued to fight for its reauthorization and to expand protections and resources for more women in at-risk communities, including tribal women, LGBTQ+ people, immigrants, and women on college campuses. Senator Murray has also reintroduced the Security and Financial Empowerment (SAFE) Act to help break down economic barriers for survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

That’s why I fought to pass pension relief that has already saved the benefits of over a hundred thousand workers and retirees. Today’s announcement from the Biden Administration will ensure we continue to build on that progress so this program can serve even more struggling pensions, help all plans by getting the entire multiemployer pension system on stronger footing, and protect even more workers from having their hard earned benefits cut at the worst possible time,” said Senator Murray.“We need to continue doing everything we can to take stress off families’ shoulders and put people on solid financial footing. Which is why I’m going to continue pushing for additional steps to bring down costs for essentials like child care, health care, and more. And I’m working to pass my legislation to strengthen everyone’s retirement and emergency savings—which passed out of Committee with broad bipartisan support—into law.”Senator Murray fought for the American Rescue Plan to provide relief for struggling pension plans across the country by creating the SFA program for multiemployer pensions within the PBGC. According to the Multiemployer Pension Rescue Tracker launched by the House Education and Labor Committee earlier this year, the SFA program has already saved over 127,000 pensions and protected an estimated 562 businesses.The rule from the Biden AdministrationFor more information, see the Biden Administration’s Fact Sheet HERE.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

The significant increase in resources for NOAA will help prepare communities for extreme weather and adapt to climate-driven events. Last November, Senator Murray visited the Skagit County Flood Wall in Mount Vernon after severe flooding devastated the region, during her visit, Senator Murray underscored the need to secure more federal resources for Washington state to help local communities invest further in similar projects to boost climate resilience.“Washington state’s coastline is an integral part of our state’s culture and economy. We’ve seen the impacts of the climate crisis in our own backyard and understand what is at stake,” said Senator Murray. “Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law I helped pass, NOAA now has the means necessary to make serious investments in climate resiliency along our coasts and help protect communities from the impacts of climate change. This funding will help make an important difference for countless families, our fisheries, and local economies along Washington state’s coasts.”NOAA will select high-impact projects will support three major initiatives: In the BIL, Senator Murray secured $1 billion for culvert removal, replacement, and restoration; $172 million for the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund (PCSRF); and $400 million for fish passage restoration at NOAA, and $200 million for the USFWS National Fish Passage Program, among other habitat investments. The BIL also helps fund Washington state’s transition to cleaner energy and electric vehicles, make the electric grid more reliable, help prevent and fight wildfires, and more—all while creating good-paying, union jobs. Investments will be approved through a competitive grant process.

https://www.murray.senate.gov/senator-murray-statement-on-supreme-courts-harmful-ruling-in-west-virginia-v-epa/,"(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) released the following statement following the Supreme Court’s ruling in West Virginia v. EPA. The ruling sharply limits the EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gases and fight climate change, gutting the Clean Air Act, which passed both chambers of Congress with broad, bipartisan support nearly 60 years ago.“Today’s ruling is yet another example of Republican-backed Justices rewriting the law to fit a far-right extremist agenda that is deeply out of touch with the mainstream American public—the consequences of this decision belong to every Republican politician who fought to appoint these judges. With the Clean Air Act and the measures since, Congress passed laws ensuring our communities had clean air to breathe and protecting our environment. The Court takes the place of Congress and the Executive Branch in how it can and can’t fight climate change. This deeply harmful ruling underscores the urgent need for Congress to pass a bold climate plan—I’m fighting as hard as I can to deliver a landmark investment in climate action and clean energy to President Biden’s desk as soon as possible.”###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

And I’m doing everything in my power to fight back.”(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), hosted a virtual roundtable with Washington state abortion providers to hear directly about their experiences in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe, thank them for their critical work, and reiterate that she will never stop fighting to protect the right to an abortion in Washington state and across the country. While Washington state has taken great steps to protect the right to an abortion, the Dobbs decision will impact everyone: with Washington state providers set to see a tremendous strain given Idaho’s extreme abortion ban—and with Republicans already eyeing a national abortion ban, which would overrule protections like those in Washington state.“We knew this ruling from the Court was coming, but knowing it was on the way didn’t make the news less enraging or less devastating,” said Senator Murray. “Republicans’ extremism—and, really, their cruelty—knows no end. They want to overrule abortion protection in states like Washington to ban abortion everywhere. So make no mistake: Democrats are not backing down from this fight. And I’m doing everything in my power to fight back.”“I am devastated by the Supreme Court decision.  The loss of 50 years of bodily autonomy and decision-making for those capable of pregnancy is soul crushing,” said Dr. Deb Oyer, Medical Director of Cedar River Clinics located in the greater Seattle area. “Exactly what the future will bring is unclear.  Yet we have always known we are in the long game here.  We will continue to see patients, do abortions, and fight the legal battles.”“Having agency over one’s own body is the most basic element of freedom. When we allow a subset of our society to be stripped of the right to make decisions about their bodies and their healthcare, we lay down the fundamental building blocks for inequality and discrimination,” said Dr. Anna Dowling, Medical Director of the Mt. Baker Planned Parenthood. “We cannot pride ourselves on being a country that champions freedom and the individual pursuit of happiness if we are not willing to ensure this for all members of society. The dismantling of Roe versus Wade destroyed the American promise of freedom for half of the population of our country. You simply cannot be free when someone else controls what you can and cannot do with your own body.”“We are already seeing the impacts of harmful legislation with 62% of our patient visits for abortion care in Pullman travelling from Idaho this year,” said Paul Dillon, Vice President of Public Affairs for Planned Parenthood of Greater Washington and North Idaho. “But know this: Our health centers in Washington – with our supportive and expert clinical staff — continue to provide the care and resources you’ve come to rely on. We believe all people — no matter where they live — should have the right to control their own body, life, and future. It is unjust and unacceptable that more than half of the states in the US, including our neighbors in Idaho, are moving to rob patients of that right, forced to overcome unjust barriers simply to access the abortion care they need and deserve.”Senator Murray has long been a leader in Congress in the fight to protect and expand access to reproductive health care and abortion rights. Since the Supreme Court agreed to hear Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, Senator Murray has vowed to fight back and protect Roe v. Wade and everyone’s reproductive rights—including by building support and fighting to hold a vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA), which would protect the right to abortion nationwide.Since the leaked draft revealed the Supreme Court was planning to overturn Roe, Senator Murray has been a leader in the Senate pushing back: immediately calling the draft a “five alarm fire,” pushing for a vote on WHPA so every Republican Senator was forced to show the American public where they stood, and leading her colleagues in the fight to protect everyone’s reproductive rights. Senator Murray has led her colleagues in urging the Biden administration to craft an all-of-government plan to protect abortion rights. She called out data brokers’ collection and sale of sensitive location data that could put those seeking abortion care at risk—and introduced legislation to ban the practice outright. She introduced legislation condemning the criminalization of the full range of reproductive and sexual health care. Senator Murray also introduced legislation to expand access to affordable, over-the-counter birth control—and has led efforts in Congress to ensure patients can get the birth control they need without being forced to jump through unnecessary hoops or pay out-of-pocket.In the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling, Senator Murray has announced that she will use her gavel as chair of the Senate Health Committee and hold a hearing on the decision’s devastating impacts on women’s health—and she has led her colleagues in once again calling on the Biden administration to take bold action to protect Americans’ reproductive rights.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/senator-murray-applauds-bill-to-extend-school-and-summer-meal-programs-for-children-being-signed-into-law/,"(Washington, D.C.) – U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, celebrated President Biden signing the bipartisan Keep Kids Fed Act into law on Saturday. The Keep Kids Fed Act, which passed the Senate unanimously, will provide critical funding and flexibility to get children healthy meals this summer and support schools and daycares through supply chain challenges and high food prices in the school year to come. This bill became law as key flexibilities for these programs were set to expire on June 30, leaving millions of kids across the country without access to healthy, nutritious meals.“Kids can’t thrive in school or at home if they are going hungry—plain and simple,” said Senator Murray. “Thanks to this bill, countless families from Seattle to Spokane will not have to worry about where their kids will get their next meal from this summer and can breathe a little easier knowing their kids will have food to keep them healthy and strong. This is a good step, but there is a lot more that needs to be done so I’ll keep fighting to expand and improve our child nutrition programs and end child hunger in America.”In April, Senator Murray helped introduce the bipartisan Support Kids Not Red Tape Act with Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) that would extend all USDA school meal flexibilities from June 30, 2022 to September 30, 2023. These flexibilities have been crucial to feeding children throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. With 90% of our schools still facing many challenges as they return to normal operations, these flexibilities give our schools and summer meal programs much-needed support to deal with ongoing food service issues and keep kids fed.Senator Murray, a former preschool teacher, has been a leading advocate for kids and families in the United States Senate, especially during the pandemic, carrying legislation to stop child hunger every Congress since 2014 with the introduction of her Stop Child Summer Hunger Act. As COVID-19 has shone a harsh light on the failures of the existing system to meet the nutritional needs of children, Senator Murray’s legislation is more vital, and closer to passing, than ever. Having relied on food stamps for a brief time during her childhood, Senator Murray knows firsthand the difference a helping hand can make in the lives children.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

The announcement comes after the closure of the former Chehalis VA Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) last fall. The Chehalis Veterans Memorial Museum will host the MMU when it arrives in Lewis County.Since its closure, Senator Murray pushed VA officials to address how they would ensure veterans across Washington state can get the VA care and services they need. In a  letter to VA, Senator Murray emphasized VA must get care to veterans when and where they need it, and urged the Department to keep the needs of underserved veterans in rural areas in mind.“Veterans in rural Washington deserve the same exact quality of care as veterans in Seattle—that’s why I teamed up with local leaders and veterans here in Lewis County to convince VA to bring this Mobile Medical Unit down to Southwest Washington,” said Senator Patty Murray. “I am overjoyed that we made this happen so that local veterans won’t have to drive hours out of their way just to get the care they have absolutely earned—and I am so grateful to the Chehalis Veterans Memorial Museum for partnering with VA to host this mobile clinic. As a voice for Washington state veterans, I’ll keep fighting to make sure VA is always working to provide our veterans the best possible care.”As a fierce advocate for Washington veterans in the Senate and daughter of a WWII veteran, Senator Murray is deeply committed to fighting for local veterans. Earlier today, Murray joined a bipartisan group of senators in a statement opposing the VA Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission process moving forward, signaling the end of the commission and preventing any proposed clinic closures or cuts to service for Washington state veterans as a result.VA Puget Sound Health Care System’s Mobile Medical Unit care is available by appointment only and cannot accept walk-ins. While the schedule is being finalized, the first weekly visit to the Chehalis Veterans Memorial Museum is in August. The MMU adds an additional option to the VA and community care options already in place.Veterans interested in getting care through VA Puget Sound should call 206-277-1469 or enroll online @ How To Apply For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Patients should not have to jump through hoops or pay extra just to get the birth control they need to stay healthy and plan a family on their own terms—especially when we already have laws on the books to stop that.“This is an encouraging step, but if we are going to defend women and patients from the wave of harsh restrictions already crashing down after the Supreme Court struck down Roe—it must be one of many. Because Republicans have not only struck down Roe and ripped away the right to an abortion, but they have also made it clear they have their sights on the right to birth control next. I am going to keep pressing for a whole-of-government response to this crisis, and for people to fight for reproductive rights this November with their voice and their vote.”Senator Murray has long been focused on ensuring people can get the birth control they need. She sent a letter to the Secretaries last year calling for them to protect access to birth control and take action against insurers failing to provide coverage as required by law.Senator Murray also led a letter earlier this year demanding answers from the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits managers amid ongoing reports of illegally delaying or denying patient insurance coverage for birth control.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/senator-murray-helps-prevent-va-clinic-closures-and-cuts-to-services-in-washington-state/,"Senator Murray: “As a voice for Washington state’s veterans, I have been unequivocal my entire Senate career—our veterans deserve the very best care VA has to offer. So when I heard about recommendations from the AIR Commission to cut in-patient services in Eastern Washington, I let VA know I would not stand for it.”ICYMI: Senator Murray, McMorris Rodgers Statement on VA Recommendation to Reduce Services in Walla Walla – MORE HERE(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee (SVAC), released the following statement along with a bipartisan group of senators opposing the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission process moving forward, signaling the end of the commission. The statement was also signed by Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Jon Tester (D-Mont.), and U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-W.V.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.V.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), and Rob Portman (R-Ohio).“As Senators, we share a commitment to expanding and strengthening modern VA infrastructure in a way that upholds our obligations to America’s veterans. We believe the recommendations put forth to the AIR Commission are not reflective of that goal, and would put veterans in both rural and urban areas at a disadvantage, which is why we are announcing that this process does not have our support and will not move forward. The Commission is not necessary for our continued push to invest in VA health infrastructure, and together we remain dedicated to providing the Department with the resources and tools it needs to continue delivering quality care and earned services to veterans in 21st century facilities—now and into the future.”The decision follows recommendations by VA to the AIR Commission to reduce services at Walla Walla VA Medical Center (VAMC) for primary care and mental health, which would result in the VAMC being reclassified as a Community-Based Outpatient Clinic while moving services to Spokane – forcing many veterans to drive over long distances in extremely tough conditions. Senator Murray also issued the following statement on what this means for Washington state.“As a voice for Washington state’s veterans, I have been unequivocal my entire Senate career—our veterans deserve the very best care VA has to offer. So when I heard about recommendations from VA to the AIR Commission to cut in-patient services in Eastern Washington, I let VA know I would not stand for it,” said Senator Murray.“There are thousands of veterans who count on services offered at Spokane and Walla Walla VA hospitals for clinics for everything from routine exams to mental health care. To cut back on these services or make them harder to reach would be a slap in the face to veterans who are just trying to get the care they’ve earned. I’m going to keep pushing VA officials to refocus on improving and expanding services to reach every veteran—especially those living in rural areas—and I’m going to keep working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure VA has the resources it needs to do exactly that.”In 2018 Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed into law the VA MISSION Act. Among its many provisions, the law required the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to research, develop and publish a list of recommendations intended to modernize VA medical facilities and health care delivery—including through facility expansions, relocations, closures or changes in services. The law further directed those recommendations to be reviewed by a presidentially-appointed and Senate-confirmed Commission, which would then report its views of the recommendations to the President who could end the process or present recommendations to Congress for a vote. Without the Senate’s approval of the nominees, no Commission will be established and the process as outlined by the VA MISSION Act will not move forward.A longtime champion for Washington state veterans, Senator Murray has been pushing to ensure VA lives up to its mission in delivering veterans the care and services they have earned. In March, she released a joint statement with Eastern Washington Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA-05) in response to VA’s recommendations to the AIR Commission to realign the VA health care system. Just last month, Senator Murray pressed VA Secretary McDonough on alleged plans to cut services at Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane. During the hearing, Senator Murray made clear that veterans living in Washington state should not receive fewer services or have to jump through hoops to get the care they need. ###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

Wade and Republicans made this generation of women the first with fewer rights than their mothers.“We appreciate that in your speech yesterday, you acknowledged the reality that the ‘health and life of women across this nation are now at risk.’ Now is the time for bold action to protect the right to an abortion. You have the power to fight back and lead a national response to this devastating decision, so we call on you to take every step available to your Administration, across federal agencies, to help women access abortions and other reproductive health care, and to protect those who will face the harshest burdens from this devastating and extreme decision,” wrote the Senators.The letter comes as 22 state have laws in place to ban or severely restrict access that are trigged by the courts’ decision—with seven statewide abortion bans already in effect as of yesterday. Meanwhile, Republicans have made clear they will not stop with overturning Roe: next, they will push for a national abortion ban. Former Vice President Mike Pence even said yesterday that Republicans “must not rest and must not relent” until abortion rights are gone in “every state in the land.”“There is no time to waste: nearly half of the states already had laws in place to ban abortion or severely restrict access as soon as the Supreme Court decision came down. Many states enacted those laws immediately, and at least a dozen are set to follow suit in the coming days and weeks. Those laws will leave millions of Americans without access to essential reproductive health care. The chilling reality is that our daughters and granddaughters now have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers. Women across the country are now being told by states what choices they can and cannot make when it comes to their own health and reproductive choices.  This is dangerous and horrifying and it will endanger women’s lives,” continued the Senators. “We cannot stand idly by as Republicans rip away women’s rights. And we know they will not stop with this decision—they are already eyeing a national abortion ban.”In addition to Senator Murray, the letter was signed by Senators Markey (D-MA), Wyden (D-OR), Merkley (D-OR), Hirono (D-HI), Heinrich (D-NM), Gillibrand (D-NY), Blumenthal (D-CT), Rosen (D-NV), Duckworth (D-IL), Bennet (D-CO), Brown (D-OH), Warren (D-MA), Klobuchar (D-MN), Schatz (D-HI), Van Hollen (D-MD), Hassan (D-NH), Reed (D-RI), Kaine (D-VA), Smith (D-MN), Cortez Masto (D-NV), Murphy (D-CT), Carper (D-DE), Stabenow (D-MI), Kelly (D-AZ), Feinstein (D-CA), Hickenlooper (D-CO), Kaine (D-VA), Cantwell (D-WA), Sanders (I-VT), Shaheen (D-NH), Booker (D-NJ), Whitehouse (D-RI), Baldwin (D-WI), and Durbin (D-IL).Senator Murray has led the push urging the Biden Administration to act to protect abortion rights. During a hearing she led in May, Senator Murray pressed Secretary Becerra on the Administration’s plans to protect the right to abortion and noted that, “I have been warning for years that this is Republicans’ goal, and … [people] need to see leadership from the Biden Administration on this too. So I hope to hear more from you today about the Administration’s plan to respond to this latest attack, and protect women’s health because make no mistake: women’s lives are on the line.”Since then, she has continued urging action, leading a letter—alongside Senator Warren—calling on President Biden to immediately issue an executive order to launch on all-of-government response to protect abortion access, including by increasing access to medication abortion, providing resources for those seeking abortion care in other states, protecting sensitive date, and using federal property and resources to increase access to abortion. She has been outspoken in urging the President to act, saying in a press conference: “We’re going to be loud. We’re going to be relentless. Because, Mr. President, we need a plan to protect reproductive rights in America—and we need it now.”The letter is available HERE and below:Dear Mr. President:Yesterday, the Supreme Court decided Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, whichoverturned Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey and held that the right to abortion is no longer protected by the Constitution. This decision eliminates nearly 50 years of settled law and allows states to curtail access to abortion in any circumstance beginning at the moment of conception. This is an unprecedented assault on women and the result of decades of activism by Republican extremists. We call on you to combat these attacks and take immediate action to use the full force of the federal government to protect access to abortion in the United States.There is no time to waste: nearly half of the states already had laws in place to ban abortion or severely restrict access as soon as the Supreme Court decision came down.

This bill does not do everything we need to end gun violence, but doing nothing was the most extreme option on the table. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act will save lives—and that matters,” said Senator Murray. “With this bill, we are finally cracking down on gun dealers skirting the rules, closing the boyfriend loophole, and taking steps to keep guns out of the hands of individuals who have no business owning a gun.”“This bill also makes critical investments in mental health services but let me be clear: our gun violence crisis is a gun problem, not a mental health problem,” continued Senator Murray. “Passing the Safer Communities Act is important and meaningful progress—but we have to do more: we need universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons, and a stronger commitment to community violence intervention programs.” The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is a bipartisan proposal that will help protect children, keep schools safe, and reduce the threat of violence across the country. Specifically, this bill: As Chair of the HELP Committee and a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Murray has repeatedly fought to invest federal resources in gun violence prevention research—notably, in 2020 Murray helped usher in the first federal funding for gun violence prevention research in decades and has successfully fought to sustain that funding every year since. Murray has been a strong supporter of common-sense gun safety reforms. For years, Senator Murray has pushed for popular reforms such as universal background checks, an assault weapons ban, extreme risk protection orders, and more. While Washington state already has many of these measures in place at the state level, Senator Murray has made clear that the epidemic of gun violence in America cannot be fully addressed without federal action. Senator Murray has cosponsored important firearm legislation proposals in this Congress. Murray is a cosponsor of the Background Check Expansion Act, the Assault Weapons Ban Act, and the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act (ERPO is another term used for red flag laws). Senator Murray also applauded President Biden’s decision to treat ghost guns as the deadly weapons they are and is a cosponsor of the 3D Printed Gun Safety Act. Following the Uvalde school shooting, Senator Murray delivered a speech on the Senate floor, calling on Republicans to answer the call of the American people and come to the table to make progress on gun violence prevention.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/president-biden-signs-murray-cosponsored-bill-increasing-transparency-of-va-electronic-health-record-modernization-into-law/,"Senator Murray: “The rollout of the EHR system has been totally unacceptable—we’re talking about real patient safety risks that have gone unresolved for entirely too long. I’m pushing VA and Oracle Cerner for solutions and accountability because our veterans deserve the best possible care we can offer.”ICYMI: Senator Murray Statement on Delay of Electronic Health Records Rollout in Washington State, Continues Push for Solutions and Accountability – MORE HERE(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, released the following statement on President Biden’s signing of the bipartisan VA Electronic Health Record Transparency Act into law.The legislation she cosponsored will increase transparency at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) by requiring the Secretary to submit periodic reports to Congress regarding the costs, performance metrics, and outcomes for Oracle Cerner electronic health record (EHR) system rollout.Senator Murray helped introduce the bill in December following three reports released by the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) that raised concerns surrounding the deployment of the electronic health record modernization (EHRM) program. Two of the reports raised issues with cost estimates and reporting. Earlier this month, the OIG released another report indicating that the VA has not been collecting and reporting metrics in a way that would provide an accurate picture of the EHRM program at the Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center (VAMC) in Spokane, Washington.“The rollout of the EHR system has been totally unacceptable—we’re talking about real patient safety risks that have gone unresolved for entirely too long. I’m pushing VA and Oracle Cerner for solutions and accountability because our veterans deserve the best possible care we can offer. That’s why it’s good to see President Biden sign our legislation. This is a good step to ensure greater transparency and accountability to Congress, but there is a lot more work to do to make sure VA and Oracle Cerner are delivering the high-quality care our veterans deserve.”Senator Murray has been conducting oversight on the EHR rollout at Mann-Grandstaff VAMC for years. She pressed then-VA Secretary Wilkie about the EHR rollout in September of 2018 and wrote a letter in January 2020 to VA leadership expressing her concern on reports of staffing and facility issues at Mann-Grandstaff VAMC, and how those issues could affect the EHR rollout. Following Senator Murray’s actions, VA initially delayed rollout of the EHR program at Mann-Grandstaff until March 2020. In July of 2021, Senator Murray pressed Secretary McDonough on patient safety in light of reports of veterans receiving incorrect medications, the need for more staff support from VA, and how VA will avoid the issues that have arisen at Mann-Grandstaff VAMC moving forward and at other VA medical centers. Senator Murray has since raised the need to resolve issues with care at Mann-Grandstaff with Secretary McDonough and other VA officials multiple times in private meetings and public hearings.In December of last year, Senator Murray pressed Secretary McDonough for solutions and transparency during a Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee hearing. During the hearing, Senator Murray underscored VA’s responsibility to address the problems that veterans are seeing at Mann-Grandstaff VAMC, and pressed Secretary McDonough for assurances that these issues would be resolved quickly and would not arise at other VA medical centers in Washington state, such as Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VAMC in Walla Walla. Importantly, Senator Murray pressed Secretary McDonough for concrete steps being taken to address the challenges in Spokane and secured a commitment from him that VA would share clear indicators of readiness before deploying the new EHR program at any other sites in Washington state, specifically Walla Walla.In March of this year, Senator Murray issued a statement demanding a pause of the Cerner Electronic Health Record system rollout in Washington state, citing patient safety risks, and demanding the concerns laid out in reports from the VA OIG – and previous reports over the last two years – be resolved first before the EHR program be deployed at any other sites in Washington state. Last month, during a Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee hearing, Senator Murray pressed VA Secretary McDonough to halt the rollout of the Cerner Electronic Health Record System rollout in Washington state until the program’s ongoing issues are fixed. On June 8 of 2022, Murray and SVAC Chairman Jon Tester (D-MT) urged Secretary McDonough to address and fix repeated failures of Cerner’s Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) program at VA facilities in Washington state and across the country.This week, Senator Murray responded to VA’s announcement of its decision to suspend its rollout of the EHRM program at four of its sites. The announcement follows reporting on a draft report by the VA OIG which claims that almost 150 veterans have been harmed due to EHR system failures. Furthermore, the draft report found that while Cerner Corporation was aware of flaws in its EHR system, it still proceeded to move forward with its rollout and neglected to repair it or inform the VA before its launch in October 2020. This follows months of pressure by Senator Murray in response to alarming reports by the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) of serious patient safety risks due to recurring failures of the Cerner system at VA’s pilot location of Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane, Washington.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
https://www.murray.senate.gov/at-hearing-murray-highlights-how-democrats-american-rescue-plan-is-helping-get-students-back-on-track/,"Senator Murray: “I want parents to know this—I am in your corner fighting for you and your kids.”***WATCH SENATOR MURRAY’S OPENING REMARKS HERE***(WASHINGTON, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, led a hearing on supporting schools, educators, parents, and students to get our kids back on track after the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic.At the hearing, Senator Murray highlighted how the American Rescue Plan—which Democrats passed without a single Republican vote—is delivering resources to every state across the country to help schools stay open safely, support students’ academic, social, and emotional learning, and help our kids get back on track given data showing students are months—or years—behind with their learning. Senator Murray pushed to require American Rescue Plan investments to include funding specifically for addressing learning loss.“We need to do everything we can to help these students recover. This is something I’ve been focused on since the earliest days of this crisis. That’s why I was glad we were able to work across the aisle at the start of this pandemic, to make sure our early bipartisan relief packages got schools the resources they needed to help keep students connected during remote learning, and reopen for in-person learning as soon as public health officials deemed it safe. And, given the scope of this crisis, I also fought hard to invest $122 billion dollars for schools in the American Rescue Plan—which Democrats passed without a single Republican vote, because recovering from this pandemic and ensuring kids get the resources they need won’t just take days. It’s going to take months and years. And we cannot shortchange our public schools, parents, or our kids.”“I worked with members on this committee to ensure the American Rescue Plan included specific resources to address learning loss. Because it was so clear to me—from talking with just about any parent or teacher back in Washington state—that getting our kids’ learning back on track was not going to be like flipping on a switch. These are resources that were badly-needed and are being put to good use in all kinds of ways, like school districts providing additional tutoring, and addressing the social and emotional needs of students. But let’s be clear, our work is far from over,” continued Senator Murray.At the hearing, Senator Murray continued to urge her Republican colleagues to join her in working to pass emergency COVID funding—highlighting how communities will need critical resources like tests, treatments, and vaccines to be ready for the looming threat of new variants and a fall surge, and how we need to be preparing now to help schools be ready for back-to-school and ensure they can keep kids safely in the classroom.“We have to protect the hard-fought progress we have made—including keeping schools safely open for in-person learning. That means passing additional COVID funding so our communities and schools can prepare now, to keep students and families safe from whatever this pandemic throws at us next,” said Senator Murray. “So, I encourage my Republican colleagues to work with Democrats to make sure schools safely stay open for in-person learning this fall. We need to work together to give our communities more than just empty words: we need to get this COVID funding done immediately. Because our schools and communities can’t afford to wait until there is a new variant or another surge.  Schools and educators need action from Congress now, and support and expertise from the Administration so they can plan ahead for the fall to keep students safely in the classroom.”Senator Murray also continued to make clear that ensuring every parent can be involved in their kids’ education is critical as we work to get our students back on track.“I want parents to know this—I am in your corner fighting for you and your kids. I got my start in politics as a parent advocate. I organized moms and dads across my community to save a preschool program. I served on my local school board. I know how valuable it is to have parents involved. I want to make sure every child in this country can get an excellent public education that prepares them to succeed in life, and every parent can have their voice heard and be involved in their kids’ school—our schools are better off that way.”Senator Murray’s opening remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below:“When COVID-19 upended daily life, the disruption for schools and families—and our students—was especially severe. “I mean seriously, put yourselves in the shoes of any kid from Washington state to North Carolina.“These kids lost valuable time in the classroom with their friends and teachers; they had to confide in a counselor or teacher over Zoom or a phone; after school activities, like sports or band, cut totally short; and some kids faced the earth-shattering loss of a loved one.“I hope we can all agree we need to do everything we can to bring stability to our kids’ lives, which means keeping our communities safe, and preparing better for the fall so our kids can safely learn and grow.“Now I’ve been talking to parents, educators, and students back in Washington state about what they are going through, and every single conversation drives home how critical it is we provide the support kids need to recover from the many ways this pandemic affected them.“And I think it’s important we recognize how this pandemic has really made things harder for a lot of kids, particularly students of color and students from families with low incomes, who often lack access to resources.“These students have faced decades of inequitable resources at the schools they attend, undermining these schools’ ability to hire experienced teachers, and provide advanced coursework options for their students.“Kids living in rural communities have also struggled—I believe very strongly that children in the rural Yakima Valley deserve the exact same opportunities as kids in Seattle.“I also want to note today is the anniversary of the landmark Olmstead decision, which affirmed people with disabilities have the right to an integrated life in their communities—at home, work, and at school, too.“We have to keep working to make the promises of Olmstead a reality for everyone—and to me that means considering, and meeting, the needs of students with disabilities in our policymaking.“Now, while we are still learning the full extent of how COVID has impacted our kids’ learning—we know enough to know this needs to be a top priority for all of us.“Data shows kids months, or even years, behind where they would be in a typical year.“And a deepening educational divide between majority-white schools, and majority-Black schools, between wealthier school districts, and higher poverty districts.“The results of this year’s statewide exams made abundantly clear what other data is showing as well, our students—across every demographic—have been affected by this pandemic.“And we need to do everything we can to help these students recover.“This is something I’ve been focused on since the earliest days of this crisis.“That’s why I was glad we were able to work across the aisle at the start of this pandemic, to make sure our early bipartisan relief packages got schools the resources they needed to help keep students connected during remote learning, and reopen for in-person learning as soon as public health officials deemed it safe.“And, given the scope of this crisis, I also fought hard to invest $122 billion dollars for schools in the American Rescue Plan—which Democrats passed without a single Republican vote, because recovering from this pandemic and ensuring kids get the resources they need won’t just take days. It’s going to take months and years.“And we cannot shortchange our public schools, parents, or our kids.“That funding we passed, both in our bipartisan work and through Democrat’s American Rescue Plan, has been critical to getting us where we are today.“To getting the vast majority of schools safely back open for in-person learning.“To getting schools additional tests, masks, and better ventilation.“To supporting mental health and counseling services for our students.“To providing students with summer learning, tutoring, and other opportunities to address the impacts of this pandemic.“And that last part is critical: I worked with members on this committee to ensure the American Rescue Plan included specific resources to address learning loss.“Because it was so clear to me—from talking with just about any parent or teacher back in Washington state—that getting our kids’ learning back on track was not going to be like flipping on a switch.“These are resources that were badly-needed and are being put to good use in all kinds of ways, like school districts providing additional tutoring, and addressing the social and emotional needs of students.“But let’s be clear, our work is far from over.“What happens next in this pandemic isn’t a given, especially amid the threat of a fall surge and new variants.“We have to protect the hard fought-progress we have made—including keeping schools safely open for in-person learning.“That means passing additional COVID funding so our communities and schools can prepare now, to keep students and families safe from whatever this pandemic throws at us next.“These are resources we desperately need.“So, I encourage my Republican colleagues to work with Democrats to make sure schools safely stay open for in-person learning this fall.“We need to work together to give our communities more than just empty words: we need to get this COVID funding done immediately.“Because our schools and communities can’t afford to wait until there is a new variant or another surge.“Schools and educators need action from Congress now, and support and expertise from the Administration so they can plan ahead for the fall to keep students safely in the classroom.“Because our kids cannot afford to deal with another major setback in their schooling.“Especially after the hardships of the past few years—the learning loss that has set so many students months and years behind through no fault of their own, the trauma and mental health challenges our kids are facing, the burnout that’s causing so many educators to think about leaving a field they love, and the stress on parents’ shoulders as they try to get their kids the support they need.“Democrats are working to deliver real solutions for students, schools, parents, and educators on these issues.“So I want parents to know this—I am in your corner fighting for you and your kids. I got my start in politics as a parent advocate. I organized moms and dads across my community to save a preschool program. I served on my local school board. I know how valuable it is to have parents involved.“I want to make sure every child in this country can get an excellent public education that prepares them to succeed in life, and every parent can have their voice heard and be involved in their kids’ school—our schools are better off that way.“That’s why I fought to pass the American Rescue Plan—to deliver the resources our students, educators, and public schools need.“And let’s be clear: these resources are helping schools in every single state—because kids in every state have been affected by the pandemic.“That is why I am focused on working to support families, lower costs, and deliver good-paying jobs.“We are focused on the economy and tackling inflation, so parents actually have the time to ask their kids about school, help with homework, and stay involved.“And I’m glad we are working in a bipartisan way to make progress on so many of the challenges families are facing right now too.  “Earlier this month we passed bipartisan legislation on this committee to lower drug prices, address the formula shortage, and strengthen families’ emergency and retirement savings.“And we are in the process right now of passing meaningful, bipartisan steps to save lives, and keep kids and families safe from gun violence.“I’d like to thank Senator Murphy in particular for his hard work and leadership on this.“Now, this package is not everything we need to end gun violence—not by a mile. But the most extreme option on the table is doing nothing at all. “This package will close the boyfriend loophole at the federal level. An important step we can take to protect people—especially women—from abusive partners“And its investments in access to mental health will help stem the mental health crisis our country is experiencing.“But let me be clear: we have to treat America’s gun violence crisis as a gun problem, not a mental health problem—we need universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons, and more investment in community violence intervention programs.“With that in mind, I am continuing to work with Senator Burr to negotiate a bipartisan mental health package as well to address the stress, depression, anxiety, suicide, and so many other mental health challenges this pandemic has made so much worse.“And there is so much more we need to do, and so many other challenges our families and students are facing…“And I look forward to hearing from all of our witnesses today, about how we can tackle one of the biggest ones—the learning loss caused by this pandemic.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "

I have already spoken with senior officials at Oracle and impressed upon them the importance of making this right immediately. I have raised this issue with increasing urgency in both public and private settings with Secretary McDonough—at numerous Senate hearings and over many calls and meetings with him and other VA officials—and I won’t stop pressing for solutions and accountability until this gets fixed.”Senator Murray has been conducting oversight on the EHR rollout at Mann-Grandstaff VAMC for years.

https://www.murray.senate.gov/senator-murray-renews-call-to-pass-her-toxic-exposure-safety-act-following-scotus-decision-striking-down-wa-compensation-law-2/,"ICYMI: Senators Murray and Manchin, Representative Smith Reintroduce Legislation to Expand Worker’s Compensation for Toxic Exposure at Hanford and Other Nuclear Sites – MORE HERE(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) issued the following statement, calling for passage of her Toxic Exposure Safety Act in light of the disappointing Supreme Court opinion that struck down Washington state’s bipartisan state law designed to make it easier for workers to access the compensation benefits they earned when they develop certain illnesses from working at a site contaminated with radioactive waste. In 2022, Washington state passed Senate Bill 5890, that would improve access to compensation and benefits for radioactive waste site workers; as a result of that law, Hanford workers are still protected, and the 2022 law has not been challenged by the Biden Administration.Murray’s Toxic Exposure Safety Act would ensure cleanup workers at the Hanford Nuclear Site and other Department of Energy (DOE) environmental management sites can more easily claim worker’s compensation benefits when they suffer from certain medical conditions as a result of exposure to toxic substances. Murray reintroduced her Toxic Exposure Safety Act with Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) and U.S. Representative Adam Smith (D, WA-09) in March of 2021.“It’s critical to me that Hanford workers are protected and that we make it easy for them to get the care and support they are entitled to—in light of today’s disappointing Supreme Court opinion, passing my Toxic Exposure Safety Act is all the more important,” said Senator Murray. “My legislation takes the right steps to ensure Hanford workers and those at other nuclear clean-up sites can obtain the full benefits they’re entitled to when they’ve contracted illnesses as a result of workplace exposure. This is just the right thing to do—and we need to get this done. As a voice for Hanford workers in the Senate, I will keep fighting to get this legislation to President Biden’s desk as soon as possible.”Senator Murray and Representative Smith originally introduced the Toxic Exposure Safety Act in July of 2020 after the Seattle Times ran an investigative story profiling a worker who suffered from seizures after being exposed to toxic substances at the Plutonium Finishing Plant on the Hanford site, as well as the financial problems the worker encountered following their diagnosis.Currently, Hanford workers can file for worker’s compensation claims when they have health issues through both the Washington state Department of Labor and Industries and DOE’s third-party insurer, Penser. The Toxic Exposure Safety Act seeks to make such claims at the federal level easier to access, and allow Hanford workers and workers at similar DOE sites to collect the full worker’s compensation benefits they’re entitled to. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA) provides cash benefits and medical coverage to civilian employees who became ill as a result of exposure to radiation or toxic substances while working in the nuclear weapons industry EEOICPA is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs (OWCP).The Toxic Exposure Safety Act would expand covered employees and covered illnesses under Part E to specifically include employees exposed to toxic substances at cleanup sites. EEOICPA Part E provides cash and medical benefits for DOE contractor and subcontractor employees who contracted an illness or died as a result of exposure to any toxic substance, as well as their eligible survivors. A person is eligible for Part E benefits if it is “at least as likely as not” that exposure to a toxic substance at a DOE facility caused, contributed to, or aggravated the worker’s illness or death.Because toxic exposures at DOE sites have been understudied, and without sufficient clinical and epidemiological research there is no way to create an accurate causal correlation for EEOICPA Part E, similar to what has been effectively established for Part B of the program, which involves radiological exposures. As a result of the lack of this knowledge, federal law provides very little remedy to workers who suffer illness from these toxic exposures. To that end, the Toxic Exposure Safety Act of 2020 would amend Part E of the EEOICPA to establish a presumption of occupational disease exposures, create a research program to determine exposure-disease correlation, and direct the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate scientific evidence regarding chemical exposures—making it easier for Hanford clean-up workers and workers at other DOE nuclear clean-up sites to claim federal worker’s compensation benefits.###Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the workshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.  "
