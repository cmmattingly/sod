https://www.stabenow.senate.gov/news/senator-stabenow-announces-over-2-million-for-michigan-fruit-and-vegetable-growers,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, today announced that Michigan will receive $2,153,501 in federal funding to support Michigan specialty crop growers who produce fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, hops, nursery plants, and flowers. “Michigan leads the nation in the production of many fruits and vegetables and is one of the top states in agricultural diversity. Our fruits, vegetables and nursery crops are not only a source of great pride – they are critical to our state’s economy.” said Senator Stabenow. “This new support is a big win for Michigan agriculture. It will help our farmers keep their competitive edge and continue to provide healthy fruits and vegetables to American families.”  ""Michigan's food and agricultural industry is unique and innovative. We're home to a wide variety of specialty crops, from asparagus to cherries to onions,"" said MDARD Director Gary McDowell. ""I deeply appreciate USDA’s continued support for Michigan producers through the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program. These investments will allow for more innovative research and new market opportunities in Michigan's specialty crop sector."" “Senator Debbie Stabenow understands agriculture and she knows how each Farm Bill affects our country.  Senator Stabenow is proud of the immense diversity in Michigan Agriculture.  This diversity puts Michigan's specialty crop growers into the position where they find extreme value in Michigan's Specialty Crop Block Grants.  The Grants are used for so many marketing and research projects here in Michigan.  Without these Grants, our specialty crop industry would suffer,” said Greg Bird, Executive Director of Michigan Vegetable Council and Michigan Onion Committee. “Specialty Crop Block Grants allow the Michigan Bean Industry to stretch grower’s assessment dollars by helping fund valuable research that continues to successfully add to the bottom-line of today’s edible bean producers.  This added funding has and continues to produce high yielding, high quality, nutrient dense edible beans that today’s health-conscious families are consuming in many different ways these days.  We are certainly grateful for this program and appreciate the continued support for our industry,” said Joe Cramer, Executive Director of Michigan Bean Commission. ""With the funds, we receive from the Speciality Crop Block Grant, the Michigan Ag Council will be able to further our goal of increasing sales of Michigan-grown food and products. We want to meet consumers where they are, and by placing advertisements on streaming services, we're able to reach them in their homes, mere feet from their dinner tables, where they'll hopefully spend time-consuming nutritious and wholesome food grown right here in our state. The Ag Council and our partners appreciate the support of our elected officials to encourage all Michiganders to buy local,"" said Noelle Nachreiner Executive Director of Michigan Ag Council. “The Cherry Marketing Institute (CMI) is a national research and promotion organization that works on behalf of Michigan, Utah and Wisconsin cherry growers.  Michigan producing 75% of the tart cherry supply for the U.S.  CMI is grateful for the awarded USDA Specialty Crop Grant that they received to enhance the Michigan cherry industry.  These funds leveraged with grower assessments provide an opportunity to expand our mission to showcase Michigan cherries on a national platform.  The partnership with the USDA and the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) is a tremendous asset for Michigan cherry growers,” said Julie Gordon, President of Cherry Marketing Institute. “Michigan’s asparagus and carrot growers are keenly aware of the important information these projects provide that aid in the long-term viability of their farms.  This applied research helps them address new diseases and provides additional management practices and strategies for existing pests and diseases,” said Jamie Clover Adams, Executive Director of Michigan Asparagus and Michigan Carrot. “The financial resources provided from this grant will help Canton Township plant a variety of apple, pear, peach, kiwi, and nectarine fruit trees, as well as over two dozen blueberry bushes in Preservation Park, which is home to our Farmers Market,” said Canton Township Supervisor Anne Marie Graham-Hudak.  “We appreciate this opportunity for our Leisure Services staff to be able to champion the numerous benefits of these diverse Michigan Specialty Crops through increased education, awareness, and marketing efforts, as well as to help reduce food insecurity in the Canton community by providing access to these healthy locally-grown foods to those in need.” “The Michigan State Horticultural Society is pleased to use 2022 Specialty Crop Block Grant funds to target two important issues in Michigan fruit growing, the cost of apple production and sustainability and fungicide resistance in strawberry and raspberry. Apple growers need to know what future costs they will be incurring before they plant an orchard.  Additionally, environmental sustainability is important to all Michigan fruit growers. This grant will measure the carbon captured in an apple orchard and evaluate how this could benefit the industry.  Fungicide resistance is a difficult problem growers face.  Knowing which chemistries are starting to develop resistance helps growers make better management decisions,” said Ben Smith, Executive Secretary of Michigan State Horticultural Society. Prior to 2008, the federal Farm Bill focused mostly on traditional commodity crops and had no section dedicated to fruits and vegetables. In 2008, Senator Stabenow changed that by authoring the first-ever fruits and vegetables section of a Farm Bill to provide support for specialty crops. Specialty crops include fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, hops, nursery products and floriculture which are so important to Michigan’s economy. Senator Stabenow has leveraged her position as Chair of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee in subsequent Farm Bills to strengthen support for these crops and make major investments in organic crops and local and regional food systems. The 22 Michigan projects being announced today are made possible by the funds Senator Stabenow secured in the 2018 Farm Bill. The program is administered through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Specialty Crop Block Grant Program.  The funds will help growers sell more products, protect crops from pests and diseases, and market products to boost competitiveness.  The 22 grant projects include:  ###"

https://www.stabenow.senate.gov/news/senators-stabenow-young-introduce-bipartisan-early-pell-promise-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Todd Young (R-IN) today introduced bipartisan legislation to help make sure that students who work hard to get into college can enroll regardless of their financial circumstances. Under current law, students only find out how much financial aid they will receive right before attending college. The Early Pell Promise Act provides more financial certainty for families by pre-qualifying certain students for full Pell Grant support starting as early as the eighth grade. It also ensures that families and students who pre-qualify for aid receive additional information about the cost of college attendance and student financial aid.“Too many young people in Michigan aren't aware of the resources available to help them find the right college, let alone how to make it a reality,” Senator Stabenow said. “Every child in America, no matter their financial situation, should know that if they work hard, study hard, and get good grades, the opportunity to attend college will be available after high school.” “Many Hoosier families would benefit from knowing how much financial aid they can count on receiving long before their child’s first day of college. The Early Pell Promise Act works to ensure young Hoosiers are set up for success in our higher education system through pre-qualification for Pell grants as early as the eighth grade. This will help more students to afford higher education and plan for a prosperous future,” said Senator Young. This legislation is inspired by the Kalamazoo Promise, created in 2005, which provides hope and inspiration to students who have attended Kalamazoo Public Schools by paying for their college tuition at any of Michigan's state colleges or universities. According to a recent study, the Kalamazoo Promise increased student post-secondary enrollment and has spurred many other states and localities to start their own promise programs. # # # "

Thanks to this major federal investment and commitments by MDOT and the City of Detroit, this project has the potential to create economic opportunities for our local businesses and residents.” “This investment is going to make a big difference for families and businesses in downtown Detroit by reconnecting neighborhoods to key economic hubs and improving the quality of life for area residents,” said Senator Peters. “I advocated for this project to be funded because it will not only spur economic growth and opportunity, but also help the city modernize critical infrastructure along the I-375 corridor, improve access to public transit, and address deep-rooted social and environmental justice concerns.”  The Michigan Department of Transportation will realign the ramps and freeway near I-375, convert I-375 to a slower speed boulevard, install calming traffic measures, remove weaving and merging areas along I-375 and I-75, remove the Jefferson Avenue curve, and incorporate LED lighting in the project area. The project will also remove fifteen bridges and two stormwater runoff pump stations that are currently dividing the community, rehabilitate one remaining stormwater runoff pump station, construct wider sidewalks and bike lanes with pedestrian crossings, and reconnect neighborhood streets to the boulevard in the project area. ###"

In addition, it increases help for low-income seniors on Medicare, provides free Medicare coverage of all vaccines, and penalizes drug companies for price hikes in Medicare that exceed the rate of inflation. It also lowers costs for people who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.  “Americans pay the highest prices in the world for their prescription drugs and it’s outrageous! To add insult to injury, taxpayers provide hundreds of billions of dollars in funding for the basic research that brings the new drugs to market. That’s why lowering the cost of life-saving medicine has been a major priority for me for years,” said Senator Stabenow. “I am very proud that my Democratic colleagues joined me in standing up to Big Pharma to get Michiganders and all Americans the help they need so they can afford their medicine.” “At Northwest Michigan Health Services, Inc. we see firsthand how high-cost prescriptions for our senior patients is a barrier to their care. The great work done by Senator Stabenow removes these barriers to provide low-cost prescriptions to our most vulnerable,” said Northwest Michigan Health Services CEO Heidi Britton.“With the ability of the Secretary of Health & Human Services to negotiate the prices for a number of high-priced drugs, we have the beginnings of real substantive change. For the first time I feel as we’ve taken a giant step in gaining control of a system that has been the ruination of many. It’s because of the efforts of Senator Stabenow and her colleagues that these first steps have moved from a dream to a reality. On behalf of my clients and myself, I thank you,” said Certified Senior Advisor and Owner of Senior Benefit Solutions Fred Goldenberg.“Senator Stabenow has worked long and hard for Michigan.

https://www.stabenow.senate.gov/news/president-biden-signs-historic-bill-to-lower-costs-for-americans,"WASHINGTON—President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law today to lower costs for people in Michigan and across the country. Senator Stabenow led the effort to include provisions to cut the cost of prescription drugs, combat the climate crisis, and create new good-paying clean energy jobs in Michigan. “This is a historic day for people in Michigan and across the country. Price-gouging is taking a big chunk out of Americans’ wallets. This law takes on Big Pharma to lower prescription drug costs for Americans. The over 2 million Michigan residents who rely on Medicare will see their prices drop because Medicare can finally negotiate with drug companies. The law also takes on Big Oil to lower energy costs and tackle the climate crisis while creating good-paying jobs and ensuring we lead the clean energy future. And the great news is that this law is fully paid for and reduces the deficit by making corporations pay taxes like everyone else,” said Senator Stabenow. The Inflation Reduction Act: LOWERS HEALTH CARE COSTS Prescription DrugsThe law empowers Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, which will cut costs dramatically for the over 2 million Michigan residents who rely on Medicare. It caps Medicare beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket costs at $2,000 per year and allows people to spread their costs over monthly payments. It increases help for low-income seniors on Medicare, and provides free Medicare coverage of all vaccines. The law also penalizes drug companies for price hikes in Medicare that exceed the rate of inflation by requiring drug companies to pay the Medicare program for excess increases. Insulin CostsThe law caps the out-of-pocket price of insulin for patients on Medicare to $35 per month. One in every three Medicare beneficiaries has diabetes, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Health Insurance CostsThe law lowers costs for people who purchase insurance through the ACA marketplace. CREATES NEW JOBS WHILE COMBATTING THE CLIMATE CRISIS JobsAn analysis found the Inflation Reduction Act will create more than 9 million jobs over the next decade. Clean Energy Tax CreditsSenator Stabenow led efforts to secure key provisions in the law to address our supply chain shortages and drive investment in clean energy and manufacturing. The law includes important new tax credits for battery manufacturing, solar manufacturing, electric vehicles, and other clean energy manufacturing. This law ensures that America – not China – will lead the way in the clean energy revolution. Support for Rural CommunitiesThe law gives farmers the resources they need to tackle the climate crisis by reducing carbon pollution and other greenhouse gas emissions. Farmers, foresters, and rural communities will have the necessary tools to be a part of the solution and invest in good-paying clean energy jobs to grow their local economies. The law also lowers energy costs for rural families and businesses by investing in renewable energy. Emissions ReductionThe law is the strongest federal climate legislation in U.S. history and will put the country on track to reduce emissions by about 40% in the next 8 years. REDUCES THE DEFICIT BY CLOSING CORPORATE TAX LOOPHOLES These critical investments reduce the deficit by curbing price-gouging and making billion-dollar corporations pay taxes like everyone else. ###"

In 2009, my mother was diagnosed with Stage IV ovarian cancer – and she did not have health insurance. She had let it lapse to pay other bills. So at the same moment that my family was desperately trying to get her emergency surgery and the care she needed, we were filling out the paperwork for her to declare bankruptcy. That desperate feeling of figuring out how to pay for the care and prescriptions one needs to live is that same desperate feeling that is being addressed with the IRA,” said Congresswoman Slotkin. “For the millions of people getting their healthcare from the ACA marketplace, this bill protects access to healthcare by keeping premiums low, and caps spending at 8.5 % of your income. And critically, after years of pushing, this finally allows Medicare to directly negotiate on drug prices with pharmaceutical companies – driving down costs and breaking the big pharma’s stranglehold on Congress.” “Individuals should be able to afford medications to treat and prevent the spread of diseases such as Hepatitis C or HIV and have access to vaccines, regardless of the cost,” said Linda Vail, Ingham County Health Officer. “Lowering the cost of prescription drugs and removing the cost barrier to vaccines keeps everyone in our community safe.” “The price of my asthma and osteoporosis medications have skyrocketed these past couple of years. I am so glad Senator Stabenow and Congresswoman Slotkin took swift action to lower these costs by passing the Inflation Reduction Act,” said Gloria Kovnot, Tri-County Office on Aging Advisory Council Representative. “The cost of medication continues to rise and rise in our country.

Lowering the cost of prescription drugs will help decrease this pressure – seniors should not have to choose between life staples, including medications that improve their health, wellbeing and quality of life,” said Yaushica Aubert, President & CEO of Valley Area Agency on Aging. To learn more about the Inflation Reduction Act, click here. ###"
https://www.stabenow.senate.gov/news/president-biden-signs-chips-and-science-act-to-lower-costs-bring-jobs-home-and-strengthen-our-national-security,"WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law today, which includes key provisions that U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Gary Peters (D-MI) secured for the U.S. auto industry. The Senators led the effort to provide specific support for the U.S. production of semiconductor technologies for the auto industry. This critical law will lower costs for the products American families depend on, bring high-quality jobs home, rebuild the U.S. semiconductor industry, and strengthen America’s national security. “From cars to home appliances to cellphones, our everyday lives depend on semiconductor chips. This shortage has hurt Michigan autoworkers, businesses and families,” said Senator Stabenow. “That’s why I led the effort with Senator Peters to secure dedicated funding for chips used by the auto industry. With President Biden’s signature today, we’re going to make important investments in American manufacturing while lowering costs, bringing hundreds of thousands of jobs home, and strengthening our national security.” “The CHIPS and Science Act is a gamechanger for Michigan workers, manufacturing and our economy,” said Senator Peters. “I was proud to lead the charge with Senator Stabenow to secure funding that will boost domestic manufacturing of semiconductor chips, including for our auto sector, and officially get this critical legislation across the finish line. Now that President Biden has signed this into law, we will strengthen our supply chains, support more good-paying jobs, lower costs for families, and bolster our national security.” The CHIPS and Science Act invests $54.2 billion to bring chip manufacturing back home including: The law also invests $170 billion in research and development for cutting-edge scientific advancements. According to a recent study, an investment of $50 billion to incentivize domestic semiconductor manufacturing would create 280,000 new jobs in the U.S. economy, of which 42,000 would be directly employed in the semiconductor industry. It would ultimately add an estimated $24.6 billion annually to the U.S. economy over the next five years. # # #"

https://www.stabenow.senate.gov/news/chairwoman-stabenow-and-senator-murkowski_lead-bill-to-extend-school-and-summer-meal-flexibilities-to-feed-children,"WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, and Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) along with 50 of their colleagues introduced the Support Kids Not Red Tape Act.  The bill extends USDA school meal flexibilities from June 30, 2022 to September 30, 2023. These flexibilities have been crucial to feeding children throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. With 90% of our schools still facing many challenges as they return to normal operations, these flexibilities give our schools and summer meal programs much-needed support to deal with ongoing food service issues and keep kids fed. The bill will also help schools transition back to normal meal operations under the National School Lunch Program. USDA requested this authority be extended in the omnibus.  “We should make it easier for kids to get the meals they need – not harder. Our bill cuts red tape and keeps the priority on giving children the healthy meals they need and deserve,” said Senator Stabenow. “As we come out of this pandemic, schools are doing their best - but it takes time for them to transition back to their operations before COVID. We can’t let hungry kids get caught in the middle. Without this support, up to 30 million kids who get food at school will see their essential breakfast and lunch meals disrupted. And millions of hungry kids who rely on summer meals may have nowhere to go to get food.” “For far too many children in Alaska and across the nation, hunger is a daily reality. For many students, the meals served at school, and in summer or afterschool programs, may be the only meals they can count on,” said Senator Murkowski. “Following the widespread disruptions caused by COVID, life is beginning to feel more ‘normal’ for some. However, many Alaskans are still working to overcome the economic fallout from the pandemic and many schools continue to struggle with supply shortages and higher prices. That’s why I’m glad to join Senator Stabenow and my Senate colleagues in a push to allow USDA to extend vital support for school nutrition programs and preventing barriers that may prevent students from receiving a healthy meal.” In addition to Sens. Stabenow and Murkowski, this legislation is cosponsored by Sens. Heinrich (D-NM), Collins (R-ME), Manchin (D-WV), Gillibrand (D-NY), Casey (D-PA), Van Hollen (D-MD), Smith (D-MN), Brown (D-OH), Baldwin (D-WI), Booker (D-NJ), Lujan (D-NM), Klobuchar (D-MN), Durbin (D-IL), Warnock (D-GA), Markey (D-MA), Hirono (D-HI), Duckworth (D-IL), Sanders (I-VT), Reed (D-RI), Leahy (D-VT), Wyden (D-OR), Shaheen (D-NH), Hassan (D-NH), Bennet (D-CO), Merkley (D-OR), Warren (D-MA), Padilla (D-CA), Warner (D-VA), Murray (D-WA), Cardin (D-MD), Coons (D-DE), Cortez Masto (D-NV), Carper (D-DE), Schatz (D-HI), Peters (D-MI), King (I-ME), Feinstein (D-CA), Rosen (D-NV), Menendez (D-NJ), Kaine (D-VA), Blumenthal (D-CT), Murphy (D-CT), Hickenlooper (D-CO), Whitehouse (D-RI), Kelly (D-AZ), Sinema (D-AZ), Ossoff (D-GA), Tester (D-MT), Schumer (D-NY), and Cantwell (D-WA). Anti-hunger and nutrition advocates reiterated the importance of these flexibilities and applauded the Senators’ bill to keep critical flexibilities for school nutrition programs to feed children. “School meal programs, a crucial source of nutritional support for millions of families nationwide, face tremendous immediate and long-term challenges in the absence of these child nutrition waivers,” said Beth Wallace, president of the School Nutrition Association. “Acute supply chain disruptions, persistent labor shortages and escalating costs make it impossible for these programs to return to normal operations next school year. This legislation is absolutely critical to sustaining school meal programs, ensuring children have access to nutritious school meals and preventing substantial financial losses for schools nationwide.” “Without Congressional action, the child nutrition waivers will end on June 30, 2022, causing millions of children to face a hunger cliff when they lose access to summer and school meals. Furthermore, schools and community-based organizations that feed our nation’s children need time to recover from the impact of the pandemic,” said Luis Guardia, president of the Food Research & Action Center. “We applaud Senator Stabenow for her leadership on this issue and strongly endorse this bill which would extend waiver authority through September 30, 2023. Hungry children can't wait.""  ""As our country continues to experience challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including supply chain and labor shortages as well as increased food costs, access to healthful school meals remains of the utmost importance,” said Kevin L. Sauer, registered dietitian nutritionist and the 2021-2022 President of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “Without crucial waivers in place, more children will be at risk for food insecurity and schools will no longer have flexibilities they badly need to operate successful, financially solvent programs. The Academy thanks and supports Sen. Stabenow, who is championing the Support Kids Not Red Tape Act, which would ensure continued access to healthful meals for students.” “The sooner the USDA is authorized to extend child nutrition waivers, the sooner schools and community organizations can plan meal programs for summer and next school year,” said Lisa Davis, senior vice president of Share Our Strength’s No Kid Hungry campaign. “Schools and community meal providers continue to face extreme pandemic-related challenges like supply chain disruptions, rising food prices and staffing shortages. Without waivers, they will have a difficult time responding to these challenges in real-time, impacting their ability to safely and effectively reach kids with the nutrition they need and stunting their ability to transition to normal operations as those challenges subside.” “Nearly 12 million children struggle to know where their next meal will come from, disrupting their ability to reach their full potential. Fortunately, child nutrition waivers have helped provide year-round access to much-needed nutrition. If the waivers aren’t extended, millions of children will lose that access, with Black, Latino, and Native American children, and children in rural areas, being hit hardest,” said Vince Hall, chief government relations officer, Feeding America. “Because of the delay in extending the waivers, some site sponsors will have to close summer and after-school meal sites, translating to taking away meals that families are relying on to keep their kids nourished. Feeding America, the nation’s largest hunger-relief organization, applauds the introduction of this bill to extend child nutrition waivers, continuing this critical lifeline for children. We urge Congress to act immediately to ensure our children don’t face hunger this summer and beyond.” A broad spectrum of groups sent in letters to Congress to extend the child nutrition waiver authority.

https://www.stabenow.senate.gov/news/senator-debbie-stabenow-statement-on-president-bidens-budget-request,"WASHINGTON—Senator Debbie Stabenow, senior member of the Senate Budget Committee, released the following statement on President Biden’s FY 2023 Budget request. “A budget is a statement of our nation’s values and priorities. President Biden’s budget builds on the strongest economy in decades by making investments that will help businesses create jobs, lower costs for Americans, and reduce our deficit.“President Biden understands that building a better America means making more things in America. By investing in American manufacturing, electric vehicles, and registered apprenticeship programs, Michigan workers and businesses will be able to make products here in America—and bring jobs home from overseas.“The President’s historic investment in mental health and addiction services shows how much he understands that health care is health care – whether it is above the neck or below the neck. This budget includes a nationwide expansion of my mental health and addiction initiative and includes more funding for clinics already providing these services in Michigan. More funding will make sure no person has to sit in jail or the emergency room when what they really need is immediate, quality health care services in their community.“Like he has in the past, President Biden continues to show up for our Great Lakes and Michigan’s way of life. This budget continues our investment in the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, and I applaud his commitment to keeping our Great Lakes healthy for future generations.“President Biden rightly proposes that we pay for these priorities that improve the quality of life for every American by making sure billionaires pay their fair share of taxes.”In 2014, Senator Stabenow authored and passed her bipartisan Excellence in Mental Health and Addiction Treatment Act with Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO). It is the biggest step forward in expanding community mental health and addiction services in decades. Her legislation created high-quality standards for services and a nationwide demonstration program that is setting the standard for care and permanently closing the gap in funding between physical and behavioral health care in communities around the country. With Senator Stabenow’s leadership and support, Michigan joined this demonstration program in 2020. Senator Stabenow’s bill, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act, was signed into law in December 2020. The law reauthorized the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which was set to expire at the end of FY 2021, for another five years. Senator Stabenow authored the original Great Lakes Restoration Initiative in 2010.### "

https://www.stabenow.senate.gov/news/stabenow-peters-urge-us-treasury-department-to-leverage-small-business-assistance-from-american-rescue-plan-to-strengthen-domestic-manufacturing,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (MI) and Gary Peters (MI) urged the U.S. Treasury Department to work with states to use American Rescue Plan Act relief funds for small businesses to restore and strengthen domestic manufacturing, helping to prevent further delays and disruptions to U.S. supply chains and lower prices for Americans. In a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen with 13 of their Senate colleagues, Peters and Stabenow stressed the need to utilize the American Rescue Plan-funded State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) to bolster financial support for small- and medium-sized manufactures to help revive American manufacturing and fill supply chain shortages for critical technologies like semiconductors.  Stabenow and Peters championed the original language that established the program in the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 as members of the U.S. House and Senate, respectively. The Senators additionally authored legislation as part of the American Rescue Plan Act that reauthorized and provided $10 billion in federal funding for the SSBCI to help small businesses in Michigan and across the country hit hardest by the pandemic to grow and create jobs. “We write to request that the Department of the Treasury work with states to use funds from the American Rescue Plan Act-funded State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) to address the urgent need to bring manufacturing back to the United States to strengthen domestic supply chains, prevent delays and disruptions, and lower prices for American families,” said the Senators. “The manufacturing sector accounted for the largest share of total loans and investments under the previous round of SSBCI funding, and we hope to see robust investments in domestic manufacturing using the funding provided through the American Rescue Plan.” “The SSBCI is an important tool for strengthening America’s small manufacturers, including providing the capital to expand the domestic production of critical goods that can fill immediate and future supply chain gaps in technologies like semiconductors, batteries, and other innovation industries,” the Senators continued. “We have already worked together on reviving American manufacturing, and our collective efforts have delivered real results: 367,000 new American manufacturing jobs were created last year, the most in nearly 30 years, fueled by an expansion of manufacturing activity every month that has recovered domestic manufacturing growth to pre-pandemic levels… We believe that funding from the SSBCI will support more resilient domestic supply chains and lead to a stronger manufacturing sector that will strengthen our economy and communities for generations.” Stabenow and Peters have been leading the charge in the Senate to strengthen U.S. manufacturing and address supply chain shortages, particularly the ongoing semiconductor shortage that has hurt workers and industries across the country – including the Michigan auto industry. In the U.S. competitiveness package that passed both the Senate and House of Representatives, Peters and Stabenow authored and secured a provision to create a $2 billion supplemental incentive fund to support the domestic production of mature semiconductor technologies in the coming years and ensure that semiconductor projects that support critical manufacturing industries are given priority status, which would include the automotive sector. This was in addition to $50 billion already in the bill to incentivize the production of semiconductors of all kinds in the U.S.—for a total of $52 billion. Congress must now work to finalize the competitiveness the bill, negotiating differences between the House and Senate-passed bills. You can read the full text of the letter below and here. Dear Secretary Yellen: We write to request that the Department of the Treasury work with states to use funds from the American Rescue Plan Act-funded State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) to address the urgent need to bring manufacturing back to the United States to strengthen domestic supply chains, prevent delays and disruptions, and lower prices for American families. The manufacturing sector accounted for the largest share of total loans and investments under the previous round of SSBCI funding, and we hope to see robust investments in domestic manufacturing using the funding provided through the American Rescue Plan. Treasury has taken an important step in the right direction by including in the initial SSBCI guidance direction to states to consider the benefits of investments in small and mid-size enterprise manufacturing and supply chain resiliency as they design other capital support programs. We appreciate that the Administration recently expressed an interest in convening a roundtable of key stakeholders, and we ask that Treasury consider hosting regional workshops to share best practices for helping states adopt investment strategies targeting supply chain weaknesses, particularly investment in minority-owned and rural small businesses. We have already worked together on reviving American manufacturing, and our collective efforts have delivered real results: 367,000 new American manufacturing jobs were created last year, the most in nearly 30 years, fueled by an expansion of manufacturing activity every month that has recovered domestic manufacturing growth to pre-pandemic levels. Challenges remain, however, especially for smaller and disadvantaged manufacturers. Manufacturers have larger capital requirements than many other sectors and need access to ready capital. Small and medium-sized manufacturers, which account for 98 percent of domestic manufacturers, face particular difficulties accessing capital to invest in equipment and facility upgrades, affecting their productivity. A National Science Foundation-funded study found that only 0.4 percent of private venture capital dollars invested in the U.S. went to manufacturing, starving the sector of the investment needed for scaling production here in America. Minority owned, rural, and other socially and economically disadvantaged manufacturers face additional hurdles in accessing the capital they need to succeed. The SSBCI is an important tool for strengthening America’s small manufacturers, including providing the capital to expand the domestic production of critical goods that can fill immediate and future supply chain gaps in technologies like semiconductors, batteries, and other innovation industries. Along with encouraging venture capital investments, the SSBCI can also provide collateral support programs, loan guarantee, and loan participation programs which can support smaller manufacturers. In addition to regional roundtables to help states make use of the SSBCI to support manufacturing, we request that Treasury help coordinate other federal resources to support state efforts like the Commerce Department’s Manufacturing Extension Partnership, Manufacturing USA institutes, and Minority Business Development Agency centers. State agencies implementing the SSBCI can turn to intermediaries, working with federal partners to help educate lenders and venture capital investors about the unique needs of manufacturers, to support capital flowing to manufacturing and supply chain needs. For example, states should plan interventions that deploy SSBCI towards ownership transitions among the estimated 125,000 small manufacturers that are at risk of closure when their owners are expected to retire, helping to prevent the loss of these companies. Treasury should also consider support for jurisdictions adding innovative financing tools to deploy SSBCI program dollars effectively in supporting the unique cash flow attributes of manufacturers and supply chain industries. The SSBCI application for technical assistance (TA), due in late June 2022, also creates a window of opportunity to target support to small manufacturers. Congress gave Treasury the flexibility to deploy these funds, including the authority to partner with the Commerce Department, on issues like manufacturing and diverse ownership. We believe Treasury should incorporate advice for manufacturers specifically in the forthcoming TA guidelines. TA funds will also be an important opportunity to strengthen the role of Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) in manufacturing, as they will likely be one of the key entities deploying SSBCI-backed debt products. CDFIs also provide, or have strong partnerships with organizations that provide, technical assistance to support growing manufacturing businesses, particularly those in rural areas or those owned by Americans in traditionally-marginalized communities. We believe that funding from the SSBCI will support more resilient domestic supply chains and lead to a stronger manufacturing sector that will strengthen our economy and communities for generations. We thank you for considering our perspective and we look forward to your response. ###"
https://www.stabenow.senate.gov/news/senator-stabenow-announces-new-funding-to-expand-mental-health-and-addiction-services-in-greater-lansing-area,"LANSING — US. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today announced $3,366,000 in funding from the recently passed federal budget to expand mental health and addiction services provided by the Community Mental Health Authority of Clinton, Eaton, and Ingham Counties. This funding will be used to establish a Crisis Stabilization Unit to provide short-term behavioral health services to those who need it. The unit is expected to divert people into treatment and out of jails and emergency rooms. This funding builds on Senator Stabenow’s effort to transform the way we fund mental health and addiction treatment in America through her signature Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics. There are currently 33 locations being funded in Michigan, including the Community Mental Health Authority of Clinton, Eaton, and Ingham Counties. “The Community Mental Health Authority of Clinton, Eaton, and Ingham Counties is transforming the way we deliver behavioral health services in the Greater Lansing area,” said Senator Stabenow. “This investment will help make sure no person has to sit in jail or the emergency room when what they really need is immediate mental health or addiction services.”“Senator Stabenow has been a tireless champion of the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) Model and of adequately funding and sustaining behavioral health services. As a CCBHC Expansion Grantee and State CCBHC Demonstration Project Site serving the Capital Area of Michigan, we offer an array of crisis and specialty behavioral health services to the community,” said Sara Lurie, Community Mental Health Authority of Clinton, Eaton, and Ingham CEO. “To take another important step toward better serving the needs of the community, we submitted a community project proposal to Senator Stabenow’s office for start-up of a Crisis Stabilization Unit (CSU) for the Capital Area. Increased demand, coupled with a shortage of local and state community psychiatric hospital beds, has put a strain on our existing Crisis Services Units, on hospital emergency departments, and has added to the incarceration of individuals with serious, untreated mental health issues. Establishment of a CSU will allow us to reposition, enhance and expand the existing youth and adult Crisis Services, offering a secure environment where individuals can immediately begin treatment. We are excited and ready to accelerate our planning efforts to make this a reality for our community and grateful to Senator Stabenow for her unwavering support for the overall health and well-being of all Michigan Citizens.” “Michigan’s Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics have powerfully and dramatically improved access to mental health care in communities across the state. The funding that Senator Stabenow secured in the federal budget for these clinics is welcome news for the hundreds of thousands of Michiganders who are served by that them every year,” said Robert Sheehan, Community Mental Health Association of Michigan CEO.  “County jails all across this country have become the single largest mental health facilities. Projects like Crisis Stabilization Units will ensure the proper short term mental health care for people while looking for better long term mental health solutions,” said Scott Wrigglesworth, Ingham County Sheriff.  For years, Senator Stabenow has been leading the effort to fund health care above the neck the same way we fund health care below the neck. She authored the bipartisan Excellence in Mental Health and Addiction Treatment Act with Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO), which was signed into law in 2014. Senator Stabenow’s legislation accomplished two critical needs:·         Created high-quality standards through Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics. These clinics are required to provide a comprehensive set of behavioral health services to anyone who walks through their door, including 24/7/365 crisis services; outpatient mental health and substance abuse treatment services; immediate screenings, risk assessments, and diagnoses; and care coordination with emergency rooms, law enforcement, and veteran groups. ·         Established a nationwide initiative to permanently close the gap in funding between physical and behavioral health care. Rather than depend on grant funding, Senator Stabenow created a completely new model where Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics will receive reimbursement through Medicaid for the full cost of services they provide at higher, more competitive rates than community mental health centers currently receive. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, people who receive services at Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics:·         Had 63.2% fewer emergency department visits for behavioral health.·         Spent 60.3% less time in jails.·         Saw a 40.7% decrease in homelessness. ###"

https://www.stabenow.senate.gov/news/stabenow-peters-secure-1-million-for-michigan-avenue-corridor-improvements-in-lansing,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (MI) and Gary Peters (MI) successfully secured $1 million in federal funding to make major improvements and enhance the Michigan Avenue corridor that is a vital transportation thoroughfare in the Lansing area. This federal investment awarded to the City of Lansing was included in the bipartisan government funding bill for Fiscal Year 2022, which Stabenow and Peters helped pass out of the Senate last week. It was signed into law by President Biden. “Michigan Avenue is an iconic corridor in the region linking Michigan State University in East Lansing to our State Capitol in the City of Lansing,” said Senator Stabenow. “This investment will make critical upgrades and improvements to this important corridor and provide an economic boost to the region.” “The Michigan Avenue corridor connects some of the Greater Lansing area’s most vital assets: from the state capitol – to Sparrow Health System – to Michigan State University,” said Senator Peters. “Thousands of people rely on this corridor to live, work, and commute each and every day. Supporting some of the incredible work to modernize this corridor will make travel in the region safer, easier and able to adapt for the future. I had the opportunity last year to see some of improvements made along Michigan Avenue and how federal help will help ease traffic movement along this important route. I’ll continue working to ensure this project is completed and that Michigan Avenue continues being an economic lifeline to the community.” “Lansing is a vibrant city, and Michigan Avenue is one of our most visible corridors. We have a plan to work on the infrastructure and are investing in this area, and these dollars will be crucial to boost the excitement of the Capital City,” said Lansing Mayor Andy Schor. “It is urgent to bring these federal dollars back to Michigan, and these funds will make the needed upgrades and improvements for the City of Lansing. I greatly appreciate the hard work of Senator Peters and Senator Stabenow to fight for Lansing and Michigan, and for recognizing the importance of these improvements to Michigan Avenue.” “We are deeply grateful for Senator Peters’ and Senator Stabenow’s advocacy and to our national Congress for acknowledging the immense impact these funds will have on this backbone regional corridor,” said Bob Trezise, president and CEO of the Lansing Economic Area Partnership (LEAP). “The Lansing region is one of the nation’s most prominent opportunities for future-focused mobility industry growth, including electric vehicle (EV) production and supply chain manufacturing. This investment in EV and autonomous vehicle infrastructure will accelerate our ability to support and leverage these advancements locally.”   “Michigan Avenue links some of our region's most populous communities and economic assets, including downtown Lansing and East Lansing, the Capitol Complex, Sparrow Hospital, and Michigan State University,” said Jim Snell, executive director of the Tri-County Regional Planning Commission. “Efficient, multimodal access to these pillars in our region is crucial for the success of our urban core, and this funding will supplement the financial package we have assembled to rebuild one of the most significant transportation corridors in the Greater Lansing region. Thank you to Senator Peters and Senator Stabenow, and all community leaders in Michigan's capital region, for recognizing the magnitude of this investment into our infrastructure, and ultimately, quality of life and economy.” This federal investment will be used to enhance the Michigan Avenue corridor, including modernization of traffic signals and implementation of signal communications that will enable transit priority, enhance emergency vehicle pre-emption, special event timing plans as well as establish a framework to support autonomous and connected vehicles. Providing improved corridor infrastructure with better pedestrian and non-motorized access, combined with existing transit service, will help strengthen multimodal transportation options and stimulate commercial district revitalization, including the redevelopment of vacant properties by small businesses.  The Michigan Avenue corridor sees approximately 20,000 drivers daily and is one of the most heavily used thoroughways in the region for transit – and includes a mixture of Lansing and regional residents that work, shop, eat, learn, and receive world-class healthcare along the corridor. Coupled with significant foot and public transportation traffic, the corridor serves as a connector for some of the region’s most critical assets, including the state capital, the Sparrow Health System and Michigan State University. The enhancement of the Michigan Avenue corridor is among dozens of high-impact public local projects in Michigan that can benefit from federal assistance, which Peters and Stabenow successfully secured in the government funding bill.

It was signed into law by President Biden. “Michigan businesses are ready to hire,” said Senator Stabenow. “I am excited that this investment will expand career paths for young people and create new opportunities for workers looking for new challenges. Alpena Community College has been at the cutting edge of innovative workforce training. This investment is a win for the College, workers and businesses who are ready to grow their business and create new good-paying jobs.” “I’ve heard from small businesses and families across the state about the need to expand skills training and apprenticeship opportunities to ensure our workforce is equipped to succeed in a 21st century economy,” said Senator Peters. “Alpena Community College continues to serve as a regional hub for economic and workforce development – and this funding will support their robust efforts to better prepare Michiganders for good-paying, sustainable jobs.”  “Alpena Community College is grateful for the great support provided by U.S. Senator Gary Peters and U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow in this process,” said Alpena Community College President Dr. Don MacMaster. “Both senators and their staffs spend time in Northeast Lower Michigan and on the campus of Alpena Community College. Both are deeply knowledgeable about the challenges and opportunities faced by the citizens of this region. Thanks to both for their efforts on behalf of Alpena Community College and the constituents we serve. Their support makes a difference, as this funding demonstrates.” More information on this funding included in the FY22 omnibus appropriations law can be found here: https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/congressionally-directed-spending-requests  ###"
https://www.stabenow.senate.gov/news/stabenow-peters-introduce-heal-act-to-expand-mental-health-resources-for-students-affected-by-school-shootings,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (MI) and Gary Peters (MI) today announced their introduction of legislation to expand federal mental health resources to support students in the aftermath of violent and traumatic events – such as school shootings like the tragic shooting at Oxford High School in November. The Help Education After Loss (HEAL) Act would strengthen support from the federal government for schools across the country, allowing schools affected by shootings to receive federal grants to enable them to hire additional school-based mental health providers such as counselors, psychologists, and social workers. The bill would also direct the U.S. Department of Education (ED) and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct a joint study evaluating how violent and traumatic events can affect students’ mental health, and the potential risk they face for developing chronic psychiatric disorders. Lastly, the bill would require the Department of Education and HHS to develop best practices for schools that are returning to learning after experiencing a crisis. This bill was developed in coordination with Oakland Schools. “The mental needs of adults and children who have experienced trauma from violence are unique and urgent. The community of Oxford experienced this kind of trauma when the High School community was shattered by unspeakable violence,” said Senator Stabenow. “This bill will ensure that students in Oxford and others schools across our country receive the critical services they need.” “No student should have to live through the fear, pain and grief caused by gun violence in schools – let alone struggle with the mental health effects in the aftermath of school shootings. Sadly, there continue to be school shootings, and it’s clear that more can be done to provide federal resources to these schools. We must ensure that students, school staff, and families in Michigan and communities across the country affected by tragedy have the support they need when they are experiencing this unimaginable trauma,” said Senator Peters. “This commonsense bill would help expand needed mental health resources at schools.” “Gun violence in schools is an unacceptable, preventable tragedy. Far too many communities, including our neighbors in Oxford, know the unimaginable pain of school shootings, and we all have to act to ensure that school is a safe place where kids can learn and teachers and staff can stay focused on empowering their students. As a parent, I am grateful to Michigan’s own Senators Peters and Stabenow for introducing this bill to help schools hire more on-campus mental health professionals, research the mental health impact of gun violence, and keep all of our children safe,” said Governor Gretchen Whitmer. “This bill would ensure children can get the mental health support they need at school.” “Our mission is to provide visionary leadership and quality services to strengthen teaching and learning for all citizens,” said Oakland Schools Superintendent Dr. Wanda Cook-Robinson. “We appreciate Senator Peters and Senator Stabenow for introducing legislation to help protect the health and well-being of all students. The HEAL Act offers a direct response to our children and schools that have been impacted by trauma.” “When school communities experience a violent tragedy, it is absolutely critical for all impacted to have access to comprehensive mental health care and support,” said National Association of School Psychologists President Dr. Laurie Klose. “School psychologists play a critical role in delivering short- and long-term interventions and responding to demonstrated psychological needs of those impacted by a crisis. The HEAL Act helps ensure no students go without the mental health care they need in the wake of a tragedy.” Studies show that children exposed to violence, injury, and other potentially traumatic events are at risk for developing traumatic stress reactions. According to the National Center for PTSD, an estimated 28 percent of people who have witnessed a mass shooting develop PTSD, and one-third develop acute stress disorder. This type of impairment can have lasting effects on academic achievement, as well as the social and emotional growth of impacted students. Research has also shown that youth with access to mental health services in school are 10 times more likely to seek care for mental health or substance abuse than youth without access. But according to the Education Trust, nearly 1 in 5 students do not have access to a counselor in their school at all, and many of those students have only limited access to other school support staff, such as school psychologists or social workers. The Help Education After Loss (HEAL) Act would help fund grants to increase specialists and licensed professionals in impacted schools to effectively support students, teachers, and school staff.   ###"

The Act was signed into law on November 15, 2021, and includes the largest investment ever made to repair our bridges. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave Michigan a D+ on its latest infrastructure report card. There are 1,219 bridges rated in poor condition. “Thanks to the leadership of President Biden and his partnership with Congress, we are making the largest investment ever to finally fix our bridges. It will transform how Michiganders get around the state and strengthen the safety of our bridges for future generations. This funding is a game changer for Michigan and one critical piece of the investments in infrastructure coming for our state,” said Senator Stabenow. “The bipartisan infrastructure law will bolster our economy by rebuilding roads and bridges that are in desperate need of repair and create good-paying jobs along the way,” said Senator Peters. “It’s unacceptable the United States ranks 13th in the world in infrastructure quality, which is what makes this federal investment essential. Thanks to the passage of this law, we will rebuild our infrastructure with resiliency in mind so that it reduces costs on taxpayers and increases our economic competitiveness. I’m proud to have helped make this investment a reality and will keep working to support Michigan’s economic recovery.” Working with Republicans and Democrats, Senators Stabenow and Peters were instrumental in passing the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The Act is transformational for Michigan. It includes unprecedented funding—to rebuild our long-neglected roads and bridges, to keep our drinking water safe, to bring high-speed internet to every Michigan community, to invest in electric vehicles, to finish modernizing the Soo Locks, and to make the largest single investment ever in the Great Lakes. The Act also strengthens our Buy American laws. ###"

The Capitol Police, National Guard, other first responders and Capitol staff who were there that day are heroes, and they deserve our thanks and our continuing support. The violence that cost American lives was sparked by a Big Lie, concocted by someone who lost an election and fueled by a network of his supporters. Today is a day to be grateful for all of those who stood up for our Democracy on January 6, 2021, and those who have the courage to stand up every day.” ###"

These waters support jobs, commerce, agriculture, transportation, and tourism for millions of people across the country. As Senators representing Great Lakes states, we thank you for signing into law the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and we ask that you work to ensure that the following projects of critical importance to the Great Lakes Region receive the funding they require. ·         Soo LocksThe Soo Locks in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan serves as a gateway to transport nearly 80 million tons of goods and raw material that supply the region's manufacturing, mining, and agricultural industries. The Soo Locks facility currently consists of four parallel locks: the Poe, the MacArthur, the Sabin, and the Davis. However, only the Poe and MacArthur locks are operational, and only the 1,200-foot Poe is of sufficient size for the passage of the vessels that carry 70% of all iron ore between Lake Superior and the lower Great Lakes.  It is for this reason that an unscheduled outage of the Poe Lock would devastate the regional and the national economies, harm our manufacturing sector, and threaten our national security. The June 29, 2018, Economic Validation Study and Post Authorization Change Report for the Soo Lock project noted that ""the strategic importance of the Soo Locks cannot be overstated."" And a report by the Department of Homeland Security concluded it was ""hard to conceive"" of a single piece of infrastructure more consequential in terms of impact to the economy from an unexpected and sustained closure. Building a second Poe-sized lock will provide the resiliency needed to ensure this critical infrastructure remains open for commerce, and work on this project – spearheaded by the Army Corps of Engineers – is already underway. As you know, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides $11.6 billion in construction funds to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Given the importance of the Soo Lock project to the Great Lakes region and the national economy as a whole, we urge you to provide in Fiscal Year 2022 the full amount of funding needed to complete the Soo Locks project. Providing this funding up front will not only ensure the project’s timely completion, but also reduce its overall cost. ·         EPA Areas of Concern (AOCs)The Great Lakes face serious and urgent threats as decades of environmental damage threaten public health, economic development, and the waters we all rely on. This legacy of pollution is no more clearly felt than in sites of extreme toxic contamination and environmental degradation known as Areas of Concern (AOCs). These 31 sites found across the region, together with degraded former industrial sites or brownfields, are significant impediments to community and economic revitalization. The threats they pose have too often disproportionately impacted our most vulnerable low-income, tribal, and communities of color. Through the Great Lakes Legacy Act, supplemented by the GLRI, the EPA has successfully accelerated the restoration of AOCs. Since 2004, the EPA has mobilized strong collaborative partnerships with states, federal agencies, municipalities, and businesses while leveraging millions of dollars from non-federal sponsors to clean up six of these sites. Over the next 5 years, the agency has identified construction and restoration projects likely to move forward across 14 AOCs requiring an estimated $1.5 billion in federal funding, potentially leveraging over $650 million in non-federal investment. Without an increased federal commitment, this potential could go unmet as existing funding trends are estimated to only meet a third of the identified federal need in the coming years, prolonging public health threats and delaying community and economic revitalization. As such, we ask that your Administration allocate sufficient funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to enable EPA to complete its work on cleaning up the next set of Areas of Concern. ·         GLMRIS Brandon Road Study – Preconstruction Engineering and Design (PED)The USACE is undertaking multiple efforts to stop invasive carp from reaching the Great Lakes.

The lawmakers authored the legislation that invests $52 billion to create semiconductors in the United States. This legislation is included in the bipartisan United States Innovation and Competition Act, which will invest in American workers, technology and innovation so the United States can remain a leader in global manufacturing. “As the authors of the $2 billion fund, we request that you ensure that this essential support remains in the final legislative package which emerges out of the conference process,” said the lawmakers. The global semiconductor shortage has hurt the Michigan auto industry and this funding is critical to support workers and manufacturers. The letter can be found here and below. The Honorable Nancy Pelosi                                   The Honorable Chuck Schumer                        Speaker of the House                                               Majority Leader                                              U.S. House of Representatives                                United States Senate                                  H-222, U.S. Capitol                                                 S-221, U.S. Capitol                            Washington, D.C. 20515                                         Washington, D.C. 20515                                     The Honorable Nancy Pelosi                                   The Honorable Chuck Schumer                        Speaker of the House                                               Majority Leader                                              U.S. House of Representatives                                United States Senate                                  H-222, U.S. Capitol                                                 S-221, U.S. Capitol                            Washington, D.C. 20515                                         Washington, D.C. 20515                                                 Dear Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Schumer:  We write in regards to your recent agreement to convene a bipartisan process to conference the Senate-passed United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA). This critical piece of legislation to address American competitiveness currently includes $52 billion to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing, $2 billion of which will be dedicated exclusively to increasing production of “mature” semiconductors that are desperately needed by manufacturers that employ millions of Americans, especially in the automotive industry. As the authors of the $2 billion fund, we request that you ensure that this essential support remains in the final legislative package which emerges out of the conference process. The global semiconductor shortage has impacted a number of sectors in our nation’s economy, with the automotive industry being the hardest hit. In the first three quarters of 2021 alone, automakers in North America lost an estimated 2.2 million vehicles from planned production. In Michigan, the semiconductor shortage has idled production at auto plants, forced automakers to cut back shifts for employees, and driven up car prices for working families. The long-term growth of the automotive industry is dependent on a healthy supply of semiconductors, but too often these vital components are made in foreign countries. That is why we first spearheaded the congressional effort to ensure that federal incentives to increase semiconductor production directly support union workers and create jobs in America while benefiting American manufacturers—including in the automotive industry—and advancing our national security interests. As you work to conference the Senate-passed USICA, we urge you to maintain the $52 billion in funding for domestic semiconductor manufacturing, including the $2 billion for mature semiconductors that we authored and secured in the Senate-passed legislation. We stand ready to work with you on this important piece of legislation. ###"

It is up to us to be your partners and we are. “Electric charging stations are now being built. Now we got to create the tax incentives to build our supply chains here and bring our jobs home.

Yes, we want you to receive a bonus if it’s made by the workers who built the middle class of our country, the UAW. “You may have heard, there are some foreign auto makers led by Toyota who are fighting our efforts. And I think it takes a lot of nerve for an auto company based in Japan where they make it almost impossible for us to sell to them in Japan, where they receive government funding and consumer rebates in Japan, where they have a union labor force in Japan, in fact everywhere except in America by the way where they fight tooth and nail against Americans who try to organize. “It takes a lot of nerve for them to fight our effort to have a consumer bonus for buying vehicles made by the United Auto Workers. “I call this just ‘leveling the playing field.’ And I am committed to supporting the home team and leading this effort in the Senate! “Thank you GM.

https://www.stabenow.senate.gov/news/senator-stabenow-announces-over-4-million-for-michigan-fruit-and-vegetable-growers-,"WASHINGTON D.C. - U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, today announced that Michigan will receive over $4 million in federal funding to support Michigan specialty crop growers who produce fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, hops, nursery plants, and flowers. “Michigan leads the nation in the production of many fruits and vegetables and is second in diversity of our crops only to California.  Our fruits, vegetables and nursery crops are not only a source of great pride – they are critical to our state’s economy.” said Senator Stabenow. “This new support is a big win for Michigan agriculture.  It will help our farmers keep their competitive edge and continue to provide healthy fruits and vegetables to American families.” “I appreciate USDA’s?commitment to?investing in?Michigan’s?robust?food and agriculture sector,” said Governor?Gretchen Whitmer. “These grants are a win-win for our farmers, producers, distributors and consumers as we look to increase access to Pure Michigan food and agriculture. I appreciate the USDA and Senator Stabenow’s leadership to secure this critical funding in support of Michigan’s vibrant specialty crop industry.”  ""The programs supported by these federal grants helps strengthen local and statewide distribution channels giving Michigan’s specialty crop farmers access to more markets supporting the Governor’s New Michigan Economy plan”, said Gary McDowell, Director, Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. “The grants focus on marketing, training, certifications, food safety, pest control, and plant health for specialty crops, including fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, plants and/or flowers. Additionally, this funding enhances the competitiveness of the state’s specialty crops.” “Michigan asparagus growers were reminded again this year of the positive impact the Farm Bill’s Specialty Crop Block Grants can have on their bottom line. Outcomes from these research grants will expand the management practice toolbox enabling yield increases, lengthening asparagus stand longevity and supporting data driven decisions,” said Jamie Clover Adams, Executive Director of Michigan Asparagus Advisory Board. “The USDA Specialty Crop Block Grant program is an integral part of the Michigan Potato Industry Commission’s (MPIC) mission to help promote Michigan Potatoes and also further fund the Commission’s ongoing efforts into potato research. MPIC relies on this generous funding to help further an economically viable potato industry in Michigan. In recent years we have utilized USDA SCBG funding in a number of marketing efforts reaching thousands of consumers and grow new audiences. We could not accomplish these marketing efforts without the available funding provided by USDA. In addition, the Specialty Crop Block Grant program has also helped fund cutting edge research by Michigan State University scientists into Potato Early Die disease, potato breeding, and research into invasive weeds that directly impacts our farmers’ ability to grow the highest quality potatoes possible. In thanks to the USDA, these programs have helped the Michigan Potato Industry Commission tremendously and we look forward to more successful Specialty Crop Block Grant programs in the future,” said Kelly Turner, Executive Director of Michigan Potatoes. “Michigan is so very diverse in the vegetables we grow.  The Specialty Crop Block Grants are the most important slice of the Farm Bill to Michigan's vegetable industry.  These grants are flexible and can be used in a multitude of ways.  The industry can get a Specialty Crop Block Grant submitted in the spring and start receiving funds in the fall.  The funds are used to research and improve many aspects of the vegetable system we have here in our state,” said Greg Bird, Executive Director of Michigan Vegetable Council. “USDA’s investment in Michigan’s dry bean industry through SCBGs continue to help the bottom line of our dry bean growers.  Continuous improvement in genetics, disease management, etc. helped growers realize record yields this year in many parts of the production area.  We are certainly grateful for this program and appreciate the continued support for our industry,” said Joe Cramer, Executive Director Michigan Bean Commission. MBG Marketing and its member-owners are very appreciative of the financial support from the USDA and MDARD as we continue with research and development efforts to improve production yields and fruit quality to remain competitive in a global marketplace,” Brad Moorer, CFO of Michigan Blueberry Growers Association. “The Michigan State Horticultural Society greatly values the Specialty Crop Block Grant program.  These funds provide opportunity to conduct fruit industry research that otherwise would not be affordable. An important aspect of doing the research is getting the results out to the ag community. The SCBG program allows funding for extension programs which help speed the adoption of the research findings. The SCBG program is a wonderful continuation of industry and government partnering to improve fruit growing in Michigan,” said Ben Smith, Executive Secretary of Michigan State Horticultural Society. “Michigan produces about 75% of the total U.S. supply of tart cherries. We are very excited that the Michigan Cherry Committee’s 2021 SCBG Application “Branding Montmorency Tart Cherries with a Geographical Indication (GI): Legal and Consumer Research and Development” was awarded funding. This will provide the cherry industry a registered GI branding logo that can be used to identify and market Michigan Montmorency tart cherries both domestically and abroad. These funds leveraged with grower assessments provide an opportunity to expand our mission to showcase, validate and market Michigan Montmorency tart cherries on a global platform.  This partnership opportunity with the USDA and the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) is a tremendous asset for cherry growers,” said Julie Gordon, Executive Director of Michigan Cherry Committee. Prior to 2008, our federal Farm Bill focused mostly on traditional commodity crops and had no section dedicated to fruits and vegetables. In 2008, Senator Stabenow changed that by authoring the first-ever fruits and vegetables section of a Farm Bill to provide support for specialty crops. Specialty crops include fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, hops, nursery products and floriculture which are so important to Michigan’s economy. Senator Stabenow has leveraged her position as Chair of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee in subsequent Farm Bills to strengthen support for these crops and make major investments in organic crops and local and regional food systems. The 18 Michigan projects being announced today are made possible by $1,955,693 million secured by Senator Stabenow in the Farm Bill.  The program is administered through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Specialty Crop Block Grant Program.  The funds will help growers sell more products, protect crops from pests and diseases, and market products to boost competitiveness. Michigan also received an additional $2,587,724 for specialty crops growers which Senator Stabenow secured in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021. The projects receiving this additional assistance will be announced later this month. The 18 grant recipients include:  ###"

https://www.stabenow.senate.gov/news/senators-stabenow-cardin-and-booker-introduce-new-bill-to-expand-dental-coverage-for-women-during-pregnancy-and-after-delivery,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Ben Cardin (D-MD) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) today introduced their new bill to expand dental coverage and improve oral health care for women during pregnancy and after delivery. The Oral Health for Moms Act would require Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program to cover dental health care for pregnant and postpartum women. It would ensure that pregnant and postpartum women getting their coverage through health insurance marketplaces were eligible for dental care by making oral health services an essential health benefit. Pregnancy-related dental coverage is optional in state Medicaid programs, which means dental care is often unaffordable for many expectant families. “Pregnant women are at a higher risk for serious dental problems like gum disease which can lead to pregnancy complications like premature birth. This is why dental care should be an important part of prenatal care. Unfortunately, dental care is not affordable for so many pregnant women in the United States, especially Black, Hispanic and Indigenous women. The Oral Health for Moms Act would make dental care more affordable and address these disparities,” said Senator Stabenow.   “The U.S. has made great strides in expanding and enhancing oral health coverage for children, but we must start sooner and provide this coverage to pregnant and postpartum women,” said Senator Cardin. “We know there is no health without oral health, and we know that tooth decay and oral health problems disproportionately impact mothers and families from at-risk communities. The Oral Health for Moms Act addresses disparities in oral health care by expanding coverage to pregnant women and moms nationwide.” “Oral health is an important part of a pregnant person’s overall health and well-being,” said Senator Booker. “It is essential that as we work to address the maternal mortality crisis in America -- a crisis that puts Black and Indigenous women especially at risk -- we are also addressing the need to expand access to oral health care for pregnant and post-partum people. This legislation takes a vital step in addressing expanding moms’ access to oral health care.”  Good dental care or oral health is important to a healthy pregnancy and to giving newborns a strong start. Mothers who have problems with their teeth or gums are at a greater risk for health complications such as pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, low birth weight, and depression. Good oral health during pregnancy can also impact a child’s future dental health, because oral bacteria can be transferred from a mother to her child after birth. Children are three times more likely to develop dental disease if their mother did not receive dental care during pregnancy. The Oral Health for Moms Act would: The Oral Health for Moms Act is supported by Families USA, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Community Catalyst, Association of Maternal & Child Health Programs, First Focus Campaign for Children, and March of Dimes. “Families USA is pleased to support the Oral Health for Moms Act as oral health is essential to the health and well-being of pregnant women, new mothers, and their babies. The pandemic and economic downturn has put oral health coverage and oral health care even further out of reach for many who already struggle to afford it. This bill is a critical step toward improving oral health at a time when its needed most,” said Melissa Burroughs the Associate Director, Oral Health Campaign at Families USA. “We are pleased to support the Oral Health for Moms Act that will require coverage of oral health care for pregnant and postpartum women enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP, fund Community Health Centers so they can deliver oral health services to pregnant and new moms, and improve the maternal and postpartum oral health services offered through the Indian Health Services to American Indians and Alaskan Native populations. These steps, along with several others in the bill, will help improve the oral health of pregnant women and new mothers as well as the oral health of their children. This bill is a critical step in the right direction,” said Bruce Lesley, President, First Focus Campaign for Children. “Oral health is connected to physical and mental health and is important throughout the lifespan, especially during pregnancy, when physiologic changes may impact oral health,” said Maureen G. Phipps, MD, MPH, chief executive officer of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). “One of the biggest barriers to access to oral health care during pregnancy is the lack of coverage, especially for those covered by Medicaid and CHIP. The Oral Health for Moms Act would increase oral health coverage for pregnant and postpartum individuals and help eliminate health inequities while also supporting education and training for clinicians. ACOG thanks Senator Stabenow for her leadership and is proud to support this bill.” ###"
https://www.stabenow.senate.gov/news/senator-stabenow-introduces-new-bill-to-boost-clean-energy-and-automotive-manufacturing-in-america-and-create-jobs-in-michigan,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow today introduced her new bill to boost manufacturing by providing a 30% tax credit for manufacturers to retool or build new facilities to produce advanced energy parts or technologies. The American Jobs in Energy Manufacturing Act would incentivize manufacturers in Michigan to create jobs that draw on existing skilled workforces and reinvest in communities experiencing high unemployment.  This is part of Senator Stabenow’s American Jobs Agenda. Last week, Senator Stabenow announced her Make It in America Act to strengthen the country’s Buy American laws. “Transitioning to a clean energy economy creates significant opportunities for Michigan to put people to work in good-paying jobs in industries that are key to combatting the climate crisis. Unfortunately, we have fallen behind countries like China, and the COVID-19 crisis has exposed gaps in our domestic manufacturing. The good news is, we can do something about it. I introduced the American Jobs in Energy Manufacturing Act to address our supply chain shortages and drive investment in clean energy, automotive and battery manufacturing. This bill ensures that America – not China – will lead the way in the clean energy revolution,” said Senator Stabenow.   During the economic crisis in 2009, Senator Stabenow created the 48C Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credit as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which helped boost U.S. manufacturing. This new bill builds on the successful 2009 program by providing new resources for businesses that create jobs making a wide range of energy products such as automotive energy parts, batteries and components. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) is also an author of the bill and joined Senator Stabenow today to introduce it.  The American Jobs in Energy Manufacturing Act of 2021 would: Strengthen American manufacturing by providing $8 billion for a 30% tax credit to manufacturers that retool, expand or build new facilities that make parts and technologies needed to reduce carbon emissions. Companies eligible to apply for the tax incentive include those making batteries, electric and fuel cell vehicles, semiconductor chips, components to produce renewable energy, carbon capture and many others. Half of the funding would be set aside for projects located in communities where coal mines or coal plants have been closed and did not receive the original 48C tax credit. Provide assistance to applicants and create jobs where they’re needed most. The bill provides new guidelines and technical assistance for projects in areas of the country that did not receive a 48C tax credit more than a decade ago. The following organizations have endorsed the American Jobs in Energy Manufacturing Act: Third Way, BlueGreen Alliance, National Wildlife Federation, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, Environmental Defense Fund, United Steelworkers, Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, Electric Drive Transportation Association, Zero Emission Transportation Association, Stellantis, United Mine Workers of America, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Information Technology Industry Council, League of Conservation Voters, American Automotive Policy Council and Alliance for Automotive Innovation. ###"
