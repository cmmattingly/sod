https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-scott-lead-bipartisan-effort-to-designate-september-2022-as-national-childhood-cancer-awareness-month,"Washington,
DC – Today, U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Tim Scott (R-SC) led a
bipartisan resolution to designate September 2022 as National Childhood Cancer
Awareness Month. This resolution recognizes the impact of cancer on the lives
of children, urges stakeholders at every level of government to increase public
awareness about the risks of cancer and reminds Americans of the bravery of
children who are diagnosed with and recover from cancer.“Far
too many children in West Virginia and across the country are bravely fighting
a cancer diagnosis or have lost loved ones to this devastating disease, and
childhood cancer is especially heartbreaking,” said Senator Manchin. “I
am proud to lead this bipartisan effort to ensure September is dedicated to
raising awareness for the terrible battle that many of our children face every
day. Gayle and I will continue to keep all cancer patients and their families
across West Virginia and the country in our prayers.”“I am proud to co-lead a resolution designating September as
National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month,"" said Senator Tim Scott. ""Childhood
should be filled with vibrant memories of family gatherings, sports, school,
and holiday parties. Children who battle cancer have these memories
overshadowed. That’s why my Senate colleagues and I will continue to support
these little heroes and their families who endure cancer battles every
day.""""Each year in the U.S. an estimated 16,000 children are
diagnosed with cancer, and unfortunately, cancer remains the most common cause
of death by disease for children in America. The Alliance for Childhood Cancer
thanks Senator Manchin for introducing a resolution to designate September,
2022 as Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. This resolution will raise awareness
and encourage research into cures for pediatric cancers,"" the Alliance
for Childhood Cancer said in a statement.Senators Manchin and Scott were joined by Senators Jack Reed
(D-RI), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Bob Casey (D-PA), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV)
and Josh Hawley (R-MO).

Rescue Plan investments that drive economic development and create
good-paying, long-term jobs, and today’s announcement is great news for our
entire state,” said Senator Manchin. “It is a testament to our
hardworking fellow West Virginians and forward-thinking communities that West
Virginia was one of just 21 recipients of the EDA’s Regional Challenge program.
I’m pleased the EDA is investing nearly $63 million in communities across
southern West Virginia to strengthen local economies, support our energy
industries and expand job opportunities. This is an incredible opportunity and

https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-capito-announce-53-million-for-green-bank-telescope-repairs,"Charleston, WV – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley
Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today
announced $5,300,000 from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for foundation
repairs to the Green Bank Observatory (GBO) Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in
Pocahontas County, West Virginia. The GBT is a vital tool for astronomical
researchers and one of the world’s largest moving structures, with 16 wheels
carrying 17 million pounds on a steel track that rotates to pinpoint planets,
stars, asteroids and other astronomical phenomena.“West Virginia has a long history with groundbreaking space
research, from Katherine Johnson to the Rocket Boys. The Green Bank Telescope
is a critical tool for the national and global astronomical community, and I am
pleased NSF is investing $5.3 million to upgrade its foundation and replace key
equipment,” said Senator Manchin. “I look forward to seeing the positive
impacts of this funding, and I will continue working with NSF to support
scientific research opportunities across the Mountain State.”“This commitment from the National Science Foundation to the Green
Bank Telescope is welcomed, needed, and worthwhile,” said Senator Capito.
“I have long advocated for the capabilities and opportunities for discovery
that exist at the Green Bank Observatory. I am thankful for the NSF’s
assistance in stabilizing the Green Bank Telescope so that the pursuit of
scientific discovery can continue in Pocahontas County.”
Since the GBT’s completion in 2000, the Green Bank Observatory
(GBO) staff perform annual maintenance to ensure the structural integrity of
the telescope, but many components are nearing the end of their planned
lifetime, including the track’s top layer of “wear plates” and epoxy grout
between the plates and foundation. The funding announced today will be used to
purchase 48 new wear plates, and grout will be replaced in sections through
2026. Additionally, two new techniques to mitigate cracking in the wear plates
will be tested and, if successful, implemented.  "

battery manufacturer, decision to manufacture zero-cobalt batteries in Taylor
County, West Virginia. The plant will create 350 good-paying, long-term jobs.
“Engaging
our strong and capable workforce here in West Virginia to manufacture batteries
domestically is critical to our energy independence and stability. The Sparkz
facility will create 350 good-paying, long-term jobs, and I look forward to
seeing this initiative grow. We will continue to work closely together to bring
more battery manufacturing here to the United States so we don’t have to rely

https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-joins-announcement-for-new-capital-sports-center-in-charleston,"Charleston, WV – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) joined
officials from the City of Charleston and the Kanawha County Commission to
announce a transformational project for Charleston and the region, the new
Capital Sports Center which will replace the Charleston Town Center.“Sometimes, there are transformational projects that come at the
right time, in the right place. This is one of those projects that will
completely reinvigorate downtown Charleston, bringing unheard of amenities that
will draw visitors and tournaments from all over the state and region,” said
Senator Manchin. “Thank you to the City and the County for your hard work
and diligence in making this transformation a reality. You can feel the buzz in
Charleston with Slack Plaza and the new restaurants and shops downtown. The
Capitol Sports Complex is the shot in the arm that our state needs and I look
forward to supporting this endeavor and enjoying the new complex when it is
complete.”Background:The proposed Capital Sports Center will feature an aquatic center,
six basketball courts or 12 volleyball courts, an indoor turf field, two
wrestling mats, eight pickleball courts, an elevated running/walking track and
more.According to the most recent study by the Sports Tourism and
Events Association – State of the Sports Industry Report 2021, the participant
driven part of the domestic sports tourism sector was responsible for more than
$39 billion in direct spending at the end of 2021, as compared to $15 billion
in 2019.The CCVB, with funds received through the City of Charleston’s
ARPA funds, contracted with The Huddle Up Group to conduct an audit of the
current sports tourism work of the CCVB and an analysis of the area’s sporting
venues. The study identified facility enhancement/development as an opportunity
to grow sports tourism in Charleston. More specifically, it noted the
importance of having “anchor” and “tournament friendly” facilities to attract
“top tier participant focused championships and their related tourism dollars.”

DC – U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), member of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, questioned U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg on
completing Corridor H, upgrading the Harmony Grove Interchange in Morgantown
and protecting American supply chains of batteries, electrodes and battery
cells.On
completing Corridor H:“A
high priority in my state is Corridor H. We've been trying to build it for 56
years and we have about 90% completed or either funded to be completed…The
language of one federal decision requires each project to have an agency that
takes the lead on it, and that would be under the Department of Transportation.
We're hearing that those rules haven't been set yet or haven't been drafted,
and it's supposed to be a two-year deadline…If you would look into that, we're
worried we're going to miss the opportunity to finish this highway,” said
Senator Manchin.On
upgrading the infrastructure of the Harmony Grove Interchange:“A
good friend of mine, Congressman McKinley from West Virginia, has been really
leading the charge on this and it's something that is desperately needed. It’s
the interchange on Interstate 79 in Morgantown, and it's called the Harmony
Grove Interchange. If your agency can look into that, if it's doable, if it can
be fast tracked, if we can make something happen or if we have to reroute something
or do something differently. That would help us tremendously,” said Senator
Manchin.On
protecting American supply chains of batteries, electrodes and battery cells:“China
is responsible for 80% of the world’s battery and material processing, 60% of
the world's cathode production, 80% of the world's anode production and 75% of
the world's lithium ion battery cell production. They've actually cornered the
market. And I've got to be very honest with you, I see what’s going on with
Putin weaponizing energy in Europe right now and I'm afraid that China could do
the same thing. And we're not up and ready to run… We're getting ourselves into
a situation that we're not going to be able to supply the continued electrodes
and anodes and cathodes and everything that's going to be needed. So, do you
all have the same concerns?” questioned Senator Manchin.
