https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-responds-to-dr-fauci-hot-mic-situation/,"(Washington, D.C., January 11, 2022) – U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. today questioned Dr. Fauci at a hearing about a number of issues including his financial disclosures and investments. Contrary to what Dr. Fauci said, Dr. Fauci’s financial disclosures for the years of the COVID pandemic are not public. Therefore, Senator Marshall requested them during today’s hearing. Clearly distraught by the line of questioning which included prior questions on Dr. Fauci’s plummeting approval ratings and his involvement in funding gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Dr. Fauci was caught on a hot mic calling Senator Marshall a “moron.” Senator Marshall issued this statement:“I understand that Anthony Fauci had a very frustrating day: having a bombshell report show he in fact did award U.S. tax dollars for gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and being called out about his personal financial disclosure during the COVID pandemic NOT being publically available must be very frustrating. Calling me a moron during a Senate hearing may have alleviated the stress of the least trusted bureaucrat in America, but it didn’t take away from the facts,” said Senator Marshall.Questions regarding Dr. Fauci’s financial disclosure come a day after a third Federal Reserve official stepped down as a result of questionable financial trades made during the COVID pandemic.Senator Marshall’s line of questioning that led to Dr. Fauci’s hot mic situation:Question 1: Dr. Fauci, 59% of Americans do not have a favorable opinion of you. Frankly, honestly, you’ve lost your reputation. The American people do not trust the words coming out of your mouth. Every day you appear on TV, you do more damage than good when it comes to educating the public on COVID. Suppose you were leading a team in an effort to try to get people to stop smoking cigarettes, but every time your spokesperson gets on television, over half of the nation goes out and buys a pack of Marlboros. Wouldn’t you stop that person from appearing on national television?Senator Marshall followed up with Dr. Fauci and said, “Perception is reality and you are hurting the team right now. You are hurting the team right now.” FOX News covered this back and forth – you may click HERE or on the image below to watch.Question 2: Dr. Fauci, you have previously told this committee, under oath, that NIH and NAIAD have never funded gain-of-function research with the EcoHealth Alliance. However, a report to the Department of Defense Inspector General released yesterday states that EcoHealth Alliance approached DARPA in 2018 seeking funding to conduct gain-of-function research on bat-borne coronaviruses. The proposal, named Project Defuse, was rejected by DARPA because the project didn’t address the research’s potential to violate the gain-of-function moratorium. “The proposal does not mention or assess potential risks of Gain-of-Function (GoF) research,” a direct quote from the DARPA rejection letter. This same proposal rejected by DARPA for gain-of-function potential was not rejected by NIAID under your leadership. You funded Project Defuse and its research that took place at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Why did you tell the Committee that your agency has not funded gain-of- function research? Why did your agency award this grant despite it being rejected by DARPA due to concerns about violating the moratorium that was in place? Finally, will you commit today to release all records – fully un-redacted – by the end of this week – so Congress and the American people can know the truth about NIH’s role and the origin of COVID-19? You may click HERE or on the image below to watch this exchange.Question 3: Dr. Fauci, according to Forbes your annual salary in 2020 was $434,312. You oversee $5 billion in federal research grants. As the highest paid employee in the entire federal government, yes or no, would you be willing to submit to Congress and the public a financial disclosure that includes your past and current investments? After all, your colleague Dr. Walensky and every member of Congress submits a financial disclosure that includes their investments.Following the line of questioning, Dr. Fauci proceeded to call Senator Marshall a “moron” and said, “Jesus Christ.” You may click HERE or on the image below to hear Dr. Fauci on hot mic.###"

The report, sent to the Department of Defense (DOD) Inspector General, stated EcoHealth Alliance approached the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 2018 seeking funding to conduct gain of function research on bat borne coronaviruses. The proposal, named Project Defuse, was rejected by DARPA because the project didn’t address the research’s potential to violate the gain-of-function moratorium. The report also states that the same research rejected by DARPA for gain of function potential was carried by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) under Dr. Fauci’s leadership. In turn, research took place at the Wuhan Institute of Virology with the same personnel and virus variants proposed for experimentation under Project Defuse.

The Senate passed a bipartisan amendment offered by Senator Marshall and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) calling for a transparent investigation into the COVID-19 outbreak mandated by the World Health Assembly during its current session, which ends on Monday. Additionally, if China continues on its path of cover-up and obfuscation, the Marshall-Gillibrand Amendment demands a full, transparent investigation to include the U.S. and our allies and partners around the world. In fact, Senators Marshall and Gillibrand held the first joint bipartisan Senate briefing on the origins of COVID-19 bringing together healthcare, national security, medical, and academic experts.Senators Marshall and Gillibrand joined forces with Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) to introduce bipartisan legislation to create a 9/11-style commission to investigate COVID-19 origins and identify lessons learned regarding U.S. preparedness, response, and recovery to improve our ability to respond to future outbreaks. Senators Marshall and Gillibrand were on MSNBC’s Morning Joe to discuss the legislation.Senator Marshall was the first U.S. Senator to demand answers from the DOD and HHS on possible COVID-19 infections of U.S. Army troops who participated in the 2019 World Military Games that took place in Wuhan, China from October 18-28, 2019.Senator Marshall released a multi-step path forward on getting to the bottom of the origins of COVID-19 and holding China accountable for its actions surrounding the earliest days of the outbreak. Since then, he has introduced the Chinese Communist Party Accountability Act to place sanctions on the top two Chinese health officials with early ties to the COVID-19 outbreak who obfuscated actionable information; the Viral Gain of Function Research Moratorium Act to place a moratorium on all federal research grants to universities and other organizations conducting gain-of-function research and risky research on potential pandemic pathogens; and the National BioSecurity Improvement Act to ensure federally-funded research involving potentially dangerous pathogens does not compromise national security.

In part the story reads,“Dr. Roger Marshall, now Sen. Roger Marshall (R-KS), is more than an obstetrician and politician — he’s a fifth-generation farm kid, U.S. Army Reserve veteran, avid hunter and conservationist… The Senator is considered one of the most ardent conservations on the Hill, and he is happy to talk about it rather than some more contentious political issues…”You may click HERE or scroll below to read the story in its entirety.Putting his conservation money where his mouth isDr. Roger Marshall, now Sen. Roger Marshall (R-KS), is more than an obstetrician and politician — he’s a fifth-generation farm kid, U.S. Army Reserve veteran, avid hunter and conservationist.“I grew up in the outdoors,” he said. After medical school at the University of Kansas, he began his medical practice in Great Bend, Kansas and hunted whenever he could, owning Labradors and Vizlas. In 1999, he bought land between two wetland areas, the Cheyenne Bottoms and the Quivera National Wildlife Refuge.“Rattlesnake Creek flows through the property by the refuge,” Marshall said. “It was covered in salt cedar. We worked with the refuge to eliminate it. There were no chemicals used — it was all dozers, axes and chain saws.”At Cheyenne Bottoms, the largest wetlands in the interior U.S., Blood Creek is the source of water for the area — a major passageways for birds on the Central Flyway.“We fenced off the creek to keep cattle out,” Marshall said. “Duck hunters from 1900s figured out how to back flood about 60 acres and obtained water rights that predated the establishment of Cheyenne Bottoms. We worked with Ducks Unlimited and shored up the dikes to store the water and let it egress out. It has tremendous duck hunting and the work was good for the wetlands and the wildlife.”Sen. Marshall took on one more land project — 320 acres in nearby Stafford County consisting of a wheat field and a few small ponds and a modest cabin.“We worked with the NRCS (Natural Resources Conservation Service) to plant 20,000 seedlings from the Kansas Forestry Department, and we created food plots and put shrubs with berries all around the outside. It has turned it into a haven for pheasants, quail, turkey and deer.”The work was done by hand, with some help.“It was a great project for my kids,” Marshall said. “When the baseball team or church kids needed to raise money, we put them to work. We replanted trees when some died — it was 4 to 5 years of hard work.”The Senator hosted a “Team Marshall” hunt in early November, including spending a day in Great Bend hunting ducks in the morning at his property, followed by a few hours chasing pheasants at his farm.“I hunt as often as I can,” Marshall said. “I get home and hunt maybe on Friday and then on Saturday, and then head back to Washington, D.C. on Sunday.”The Senator is considered one of the most ardent conservations on the Hill, and he is happy to talk about it rather than some more contentious political issues.“I embrace conservation,” he said. “The air and water are cleaner today than I was growing up.”While there are some great governmental programs, like CRP and EQUIP, Sen. Marshall said it’s not programs that produce the real results.“It’s not the federal government that breeds conservation,” he said. “It’s not a carbon tax that breed conservation. It’s the innovating thinking and practices implemented by the American farmers and ranchers.”###"

https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-op-ed-why-high-fertilizer-prices-on-the-farm-could-hit-consumers-on-their-forks/,"(Washington, D.C., January 7, 2022) – U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. penned an op-ed for AgriPulse on the fertilizer crisis farmers are currently facing and the lasting impacts that will be passed onto consumers. You may click HERE or scroll below to read the op-ed in its entirety. In the op-ed Senator Marshall said in part,“It’s no secret farmers are faced with a fertilizer crisis. Prices for phosphorus-based and potassium-based (potash) fertilizers have more than doubled in Kansas while Nitrogen-based fertilizers have more than quadrupled. Fertilizer is vital to feeding not only the country, but the world. It contains essential nutrients for plant life, and without it, American agricultural yields will quickly suffer as well as food prices in local grocery stores…The unfortunate reality is this is only the beginning. It may take more than a year before the effects felt by fertilizer prices at the farm will also be felt at the fork.”Why high fertilizer prices on the farm could hit consumers on their forksBy: U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D.AgriPulseJanuary 6, 2022There is a great deal to discuss surrounding the inflation that is ripping through America. However, few people are focused on what inflation means to farmers and those who benefit most from a bountiful harvest: the hungry, those that live in poverty, as well as the food stamp budget and USAID budget.It’s no secret farmers are faced with a fertilizer crisis. Prices for phosphorus-based and potassium-based (potash) fertilizers have more than doubled in Kansas while Nitrogen-based fertilizers have more than quadrupled. Fertilizer is vital to feeding not only the country, but the world. It contains essential nutrients for plant life, and without it, American agricultural yields will quickly suffer as well as food prices in local grocery stores.There are three main types of fertilizer, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Depending on the crop and soil, a farmer may need one or all three types. Nitrogen fertilizers like Anhydrous Ammonia are made by mixing nitrogen in the air with the hydrogen from natural gas at high temperatures. Sixty percent of the natural gas is used as the ingredient while 40% is used as the energy source. Phosphorus and potash fertilizers are made from mostly imported mined rock, which then go through a chemical process to create several different compounds.The US only makes up for 10% of global fertilizer use, despite producing 35% of its corn and soybeans. Even with our efficiency we are a major importer of fertilizer therefore our market price is largely driven by global supply and demand. This means both international and domestic issues have a significant impact on our fertilizer prices – all suffer to some extent from supply disruption policies like paying more for people to stay at home than work. This is also complicated by weather disruptions that put a dent in U.S. production of nitrogen.Sixty percent of total U.S. ammonia production capacity is in Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas because of their large reserves of natural gas. Natural gas prices are up more than 150% in North America, and are up around 500% in Europe. Since natural gas makes up 70 percent of production costs for anhydrous ammonia, so follows the price of fertilizer. Many European fertilizer producers have shut down, curtailed operations, or dramatically increased their price. At this rate, Europe will starve themselves before they die from pollution.At the same time, just like they did with medical supplies during the worst days of the COVID pandemic, China has significantly curtailed its fertilizer exports – a common trick they use to artificially create shortages and raise prices. This means fertilizer producers outside of Europe and China are seeing significantly higher demand, pushing prices upward. The U.S. has countervailing duties on phosphate from Russia and Morocco and several other major global producers are also limiting exports which exacerbate the supply shortage globally.As global prices rise around the world, the costs of U.S. imports continue to climb. The price of goods produced in the U.S. also increases as local demand competes with foreign demand to keep products in the U.S. – a vicious cycle of a dog chasing its tail, a tail that’s on fire as those on the left continue to borrow and print money like a drunken sailors.Make no mistake, President Biden’s disastrous policies are equally to blame for the cost of fertilizer in the U.S. His energy policy curtails the production and transport of natural gas and has impacted every facet of production. Moving away from energy independence affects domestic transportation costs. Vaccine mandates limit the labor supply. The extra unemployment dollars kept people at home rather than at work. Extra regulation continues to constrain business. At every step, the president has made a bad situation worse. In a time of crisis you don’t create roadblocks, you get out of the way and let business do what they do best.Inflation means so much more than just increased fertilizer costs for farmers. The cost of food is up almost 10 percent since 2019, and the fertilizer shortage will increase this even further. Biden-flation is hitting the hungry the hardest. For example, our McGovern-Dole Funding reached 1.3 million people in 2020 and cost taxpayers $215 million. In 2021, we reached 220,000 less people and spent $33 million more. If we want to help people in need the best play is to get inflation under control and to encourage economic growth – not stifle it. Instead of continuing down this path of reckless spending, we need to keep up the pressure to halt vaccine mandates, get our financial house in order, cut back on out-of-touch regulations, and avoid raising taxes.The unfortunate reality is this is only the beginning. It may take more than a year before the effects felt by fertilizer prices at the farm will also be felt at the fork.###"

https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-introduces-bona-fide-beef-branding-act/,"(Washington, D.C., January 5, 2022) – U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. (KS) introduced the Bona Fide Beef Branding Act to help ranchers distinguish their product in the meat case in grocery stores nationwide. This legislation would direct the U.S. Depart of Agriculture (USDA) to eliminate the “Product of the USA” meat label and instead create three new voluntary labels to address consumer confusion.“To me, it is clear that the current ‘Product of the USA’ label for beef does not convey accurate information to consumers and fails to help American ranchers distinguish their product in the meat case,” said Senator Marshall. “Not only are descriptive labels more accurate, but they will help U.S. ranchers differentiate the wholesome, safe, and nutritious beef they raise. It is preeminently important that meat labels are clear and accurate in a way that leaves little question in consumers’ minds.”Background:This legislation follows the White House’s announcement on upcoming “Product of USA” labeling rules so that consumers can better understand where their meat comes from. Senator Marshall also sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack in September, encouraging him to eliminate the label and replace it with more specific labels. In July, USDA announced the initiation of a top-to-bottom review of the “Product of USA” label to help guide the upcoming rulemaking on the subject.###"

https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-fights-to-defend-kansas-way-of-life-in-first-year/,"(Washington, D.C., January 3, 2021) – Exactly one year ago today, U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. was sworn in to represent Kansas in the U.S. Senate. He’s been hard at work fighting to defend the Kansas way of life and protect the values Kansans hold so dear. From having numerous pieces of legislation signed into law to fighting to halt Joe Biden’s unconstitutional vaccine mandates, Senator Marshall accomplished a great deal in his first year in office.“As I traveled our great state this past year, I heard loud and clear that I was sent to D.C. to fight for the people of Kansas, for all Americans, but more than anyone else, I was sent here to fight for our children and grandchildren. It’s a great honor, and a greater responsibility as this Senate seat belongs to the people of Kansas,” said Senator Marshall. “While we face many challenges ahead as a nation, and given the failed policies of this Administration, I will never stop fighting for our Kansas way of life.”You may click HERE or on the image below to watch a highlight video of Senator Marshall’s first year.Being Responsive and Solving Issues Kansans have with the Federal Government:Senator Marshall hosted 71 public town hall meetings as well as six telephone town hall meetings that reached over 800,000 Kansans.Senator Marshall opened offices in Garden City, Wichita, Pittsburg, Salina, Topeka, and Overland Park to better serve all Kansans. Additionally, the Senator communicated with Kansans more than 265,000 times through the office’s robust mail program.Senator Marshall’s office submitted dozens of letters in support of grant applications for a variety of funding opportunities including for Kansas small businesses, economic development, and COVID recovery. The Senator also helped Kansans from 410 different Kansas zip codes interact with nearly 40 federal agencies on almost 3,000 cases dealing with issues with the federal government. The Senator’s office has a 95% favorability rating in his efforts to get Kansans the help they need. You may click HERE or on the image below to see how Senator Marshall’s office helped get two Kansans the money they were owed from the IRS.Following President Biden’s chaotic withdrawal of U.S. Military troops from Afghanistan, Senator Marshall launched an email address for Kansans seeking evacuation assistance from the region. The Senator’s efforts helped evacuate dozens of Americans and SIV applicants. You may click HERE or on the image below to see one of those success stories.Fighting to Put a Stop to Joe Biden’s COVID Vaccine Mandates:While Senator Marshall supports the vaccine, he has been leading the fight in the U.S. Senate to put a stop to Joe Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate. In fact, Senator Marshall’s legislation to prevent servicemembers from receiving a dishonorable discharge for choosing to not get the COVID vaccine was signed into law by President Joe Biden as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). You may click HERE or on the image below to watch a highlight video of Senator Marshall’s fight against these dishonorable discharges.Senator Marshall’s additional efforts to put a stop to the mandates include:Fighting for Better and Affordable Healthcare for Kansans:Senate Republican Leader McConnell named Senator Marshall to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee. Earlier this year, President Biden signed into law Senator Marshall’s Ensuring Innovation Act, which lowers prescription drug prices. This was the 7th bill President Biden signed into law, and Senator Marshall was the first freshman Republican to have a bill signed into law.Senator Marshall helped introduce and pass in the Senate HELP Committee, the Maternal Health Quality Improvement Act to improve maternal and infant health. He also introduced the Protect Act, legislation to protect Kansans with pre-existing conditions and ensure they will never be denied health care coverage or be charged more because of a pre-existing condition. And, introduced the Lower Costs, More Cures Act to lower prescription drug prices, bring greater transparency to the prescription drug industry, and encourage American ingenuity in the development of new treatments and cures. Finally, he introduced the Improving Seniors’ Timely Access to Care Act, bipartisan legislation that would improve timely access to quality care for seniors under Medicare Advantage.Senator Marshall fought to get COVID-19 booster shots into the arms of senior citizens and vulnerable people – he even joined forces with a bipartisan group of doctors in Congress on a radio PSA to encourage Americans to get their boosters. Earlier in the year, Senator Marshall led a group of Republican doctors and other health care providers in Congress to launch a PSA to boost COVID-19 vaccine participation. He also launched a PSA encouraging patients to get a flu shot.Fighting to Lower Kansas Energy Prices:Senate Republican Leader McConnell named Senator Marshall to the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Since then, he has been leading the effort to get to the bottom of the spike in natural gas and propane prices that impacted communities and residents across Kansas last winter. The Senator continues to push for answers on how situations like these can be avoided in the future. In fact, he called for and was successful in seeking a Senate hearing to examine the reliability and resiliency of the electric grid in extreme weather events like the arctic blast.Senator Marshall introduced the Defending Keystone Jobs Act and other legislation to continue construction of the pipeline and protect important American jobs. He also introduced the Protecting our Wealth of Energy Resources (POWER) Act to prohibit the Biden Administration from blocking energy or mineral leasing and permitting on federal lands and waters without Congressional approval.Fighting to get Economy Back to Pre-Pandemic Levels:Senate Republican Leader McConnell named Senator Marshall to the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. The Senator introduced the Get Americans Back to Work Act to repeal the increase in unemployment benefits brought on by President Biden and the Democrats, which were paying people to stay at home unemployed instead of getting back to work. He fought against President Biden and the Democrats’ out-of-control spending that has led to rampant inflation hitting Kansans and all Americans, as well as introduced an amendment to the Senate Rules to require all bills passed by Senate committees include inflationary impact statements so Americans can see the true impacts of government spending.Fighting For Kansas Farmers and Ranchers:Senate Republican Leader McConnell named Senator Marshall to the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee. Shortly thereafter, he received the ‘Friend of Farm Bureau Award’ from the Kansas Farm Bureau for his work on behalf of Kansas farmers, ranchers, and producers.The Senator led an effort on a Senate resolution that expresses the need for the U.S. Senate to stand with farmers and businesses by upholding the Trump Administration’s Navigable Waters Protection rule, which replaced the Obama-era Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule. He also introduced the Death Tax Repeal Act to permanently repeal the federal estate tax, finally ending this purely punitive tax that has the potential to hit family-run farms, ranches, and businesses as the result of the owner’s death. Senator Marshall successfully fought against the Biden Administration’s directive to conserve at least 30% of our private lands and waters by 2030 commonly known as 30 by 30.He introduced legislation to ensure all farmers and ranchers categorized as a partnership – many of which are small family partnerships – are able to use gross income when applying for Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funds. The Senate passed the Growing Climate Solutions Act, which Senator Marshall helped author that breaks down barriers for farmers interested in participating in carbon markets so they can be rewarded for climate-smart practices. He continues to work on numerous pieces of legislation to deliver needed flexibility for livestock and ag haulers, increase market access for E15 and other higher-ethanol fuel blends year-round, ensure a level playing field for our nation’s cattlemen and to return to fair prices for both cattlemen and consumers, and prohibit radical state and local governments from interfering with the production or manufacturing of agricultural products in other states.Fighting for Kansas Values:Senator Marshall joined the Senate Pro-life Caucus, and received an A+ rating from the Susan B. Anthony National List for his work in the 116th Congress on pro-life issues. Additionally, Senator Marshall’s first bill as a U.S. Senator was the Protecting Life in Crisis Act that would prohibit any funds that are authorized or appropriated for the purposes of preventing, preparing for, or responding to the COVID–19 pandemic – domestically and internationally – from going toward abortions or abortion coverage. In total the Senator has cosponsored a total of 15pieces of legislation to continue his fight to protect unborn children and their mothers.Senator Marshall introduced the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, legislation to protect athletic opportunities for female athletes. The legislation was introduced just days after President Joe Biden issued an Executive Order forcing schools to allow student athletes to compete in sports based on their gender identity instead of their biological gender. He also introduced the Protecting Children from Experimentation Act, which would prohibit doctors from performing experimental gender reassignment treatments on children as well as the End Taxpayer Funding of Gender Experimentation Act to protect taxpayers’ conscience by prohibiting federal funding for gender reassignment surgeries and treatments. This bill provides exceptions for the treatment of patients with medically verifiable sex development disorders.Senator Marshall and his GOP colleagues also successfully fought against the Democrats’ attempts to let the federal government take over our elections with H.R.1/S.1.Fighting to Protect our Kansas Way of Life:Senator Marshall successfully fought for the Office of Management and Budget to reconsider their plans to change Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Area definitions from 50k to 100k. This change would have significantly impacted Manhattan, St. Joseph, MO/KS, and Lawrence as a Metropolitan Statistical Area and in turn disqualify the cities from receiving federal funding for programs that rely on these definitions for qualifications.Senator Marshall was named 2020 Federal Legislator of the Year by Safari Club International, a leading organization dedicated to protecting hunting opportunities and promoting wildlife conservation worldwide. He introduced the Home Defense and Competitive Shooting (HDCS) Act to put an end to obsolete, prohibition-era regulations on short-barreled rifles (SBR) and the Firearms Safety Act to encourage Americans to engage in increased firearm safety practices by offering a tax credit following the completion of a firearms safety course or the purchase of a gun safe.The Senator also called for an investigation into the allegation that ESPN is encouraging and working to ensure the University of Texas in Austin and the University of Oklahoma in Norman move to the Southeastern Conference (SEC) considering reports saying they recently acquired 100% of the television rights to all SEC games from CBS.He cosponsored the Tax Gap Reform and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Enforcement Act and introduced the Prohibiting IRS Financial Surveillance Act to stop the IRS from monitoring Americans’ bank account transactions.Fighting to Secure Southern Border:Senator Marshall toured along the Rio Grande River and received a briefing on the growing migrant crisis. This was his third trip to the southern border since becoming a member of Congress. He introduced an amendment to the NDAA to block President Biden’s plan to give $450,000 in taxpayer money to thousands of illegal immigrants. Additionally, his amendment to prohibit the transportation of migrants who have not received a negative COVID test passed the U.S. Senate.Fighting to get to the Bottom of the Origins of COVID-19:Having been the first member of Congress to sound the alarm on the House floor about the spread of COVID-19 and later serving on the frontlines as a volunteer treating patients in Wyandotte County and Seward County, Senator Marshall has been leading the effort in the U.S. Senate to get to the bottom of the origins of COVID-19.The Senator introduced a resolution calling for a bipartisan Select Committee to investigate the origins of COVID-19. The Senate passed a bipartisan amendment offered by Senator Marshall and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) calling for a transparent investigation into the COVID-19 outbreak mandated by the World Health Assembly during its current session, which ends on Monday. Additionally, if China continues on its path of cover-up and obfuscation, the Marshall-Gillibrand Amendment demands a full, transparent investigation to include the U.S. and our allies and partners around the world. In fact, Senators Marshall and Gillibrand held the first joint bipartisan Senate briefing on the origins of COVID-19 bringing together healthcare, national security, medical, and academic experts.Senators Marshall and Gillibrand joined forces with Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) to introduce bipartisan legislation to create a 9/11-style commission to investigate COVID-19 origins and identify lessons learned regarding U.S. preparedness, response, and recovery to improve our ability to respond to future outbreaks. Senators Marshall and Gillibrand were on MSNBC’s Morning Joe to discuss the legislation.Senator Marshall was the first U.S. Senator to demand answers from the DOD and HHS on possible COVID-19 infections of U.S. Army troops who participated in the 2019 World Military Games that took place in Wuhan, China from October 18-28, 2019.Senator Marshall released a multi-step path forward on getting to the bottom of the origins of COVID-19 and holding China accountable for its actions surrounding the earliest days of the outbreak. Since then, he has introduced the Chinese Communist Party Accountability Act to place sanctions on the top two Chinese health officials with early ties to the COVID-19 outbreak who obfuscated actionable information; the Viral Gain of Function Research Moratorium Act to place a moratorium on all federal research grants to universities and other organizations conducting gain-of-function research and risky research on potential pandemic pathogens; and the National BioSecurity Improvement Act to ensure federally-funded research involving potentially dangerous pathogens does not compromise national security.

https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/marshall-and-cassidy-lead-colleagues-in-urging-administration-to-implement-surprise-medical-billing-law-according-to-congressional-intent/,"(Washington, D.C., January 3, 2022) – U.S. Senators Roger Marshall, M.D. (KS) and Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) led a group of 24 Senate Republicans in urging the Biden administration to revise the recently released interim final rule (IFR) for the No Surprises Act, legislation that ends the practice of surprise medical billing by taking patients out of the middle and establishing a comprehensive independent dispute resolution process. The text of the legislation requires that all factors listed in the text be given equal weight to ensure a level playing field for all parties. However, the IFR ignores congressional intent and disrupts the level playing field by establishing the median in-network rate as the presumed rate.The No Surprises Act passed as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 last December and is set to go into effect on January 1, 2022.“With the passage of the No Surprises Act, Congress established an [independent dispute resolution] framework that took patients out of the middle while not tilting the scales in favor of one party over the other,” wrote the senators. “In no way does the statute privilege any one rate in the [independent dispute resolution] process, but rather establishes an open and robust dispute resolution process in which each factor is given equal weighting.”“Unfortunately, the [interim final rule] that the departments released in September departs from this carefully crafted approach, putting almost exclusive emphasis on the median in-network rate,” continued the senators.Marshall and Cassidy were joined by Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), John Barrasso (R-WY), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Mike Braun (R-IN), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Rob Portman (R-OH), Mike Rounds (R-SD), John Hoeven (R-ND), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Thom Tillis (R-NC), John Boozman (R-AR), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Rand Paul (R-KY), Jim Risch (R-ID), Mike Crapo (R-ID), James Lankford (R-OK), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), and Todd Young (R-IN).Read the full letter HERE or below.Dear Secretaries Becerra, Yellen, and Walsh,We worked diligently to find a bipartisan and bicameral solution to end the practice of surprise medical billing, a process which took over 2 years and culminated in the passage of the No Surprises Act in December 2020. We write now to express concern regarding the independent dispute resolution (IDR) framework outlined in the interim final rule (IFR) released on September 30, entitled “Requirements Related to Surprise Billing: Part II” and ask that you amend it to align with the law that Congress passed.According to the statute, in addition to the information brought forth by either party or requested by the arbiter and excluding billed charges and public payor information, these proceedings shall include consideration of:With the passage of the No Surprises Act, Congress established an IDR framework that took patients out of the middle while not tilting the scales in favor of one party over the other. In no way does the statute privilege any one rate in the IDR process, but rather establishes an open and robust dispute resolution process in which each factor is given equal weighting.Unfortunately, the IFR that the departments released in September departs from this carefully crafted approach, putting almost exclusive emphasis on the median in-network rate. The IFR states that the IDR entity is only allowed to deviate from the median in-network rate when there is “credible information about additional circumstances [that] clearly demonstrates that the [median in-network rate] is materially different from the appropriate out-of-network rate,” This was not a threshold established by Congress and is not reflected in statute.We are very concerned that the outcome of this approach will be markedly like that of a benchmark payment in clustering all rates around the median-in network or below, a policy which Congress debated and ultimately rejected because of concerns it created around rural access and narrow networks. We have heard significant pushback from providers, hospitals and physicians alike, that the agencies’ approach gives certain stakeholders too much control over the outcome of IDR in a manner that does not reflect the careful balance that we agreed to last December.We urge you to revise the IFR released on September 30 to better reflect the law that Congress passed in developing a framework that protects patients while being fair to stakeholders. ###"

In total, Senator Marshall secured 14 NDAA wins in his first year as a U.S. Senator to protect our national security.“As a former Army doctor, I am proud the NDAA was signed into law and included my amendment to ensure servicemembers will be protected from a dishonorable discharge for choosing not to get the COVID vaccine.

https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sens-marshall-grassley-inhofe-blackburn-and-ernst-introduce-national-biosecurity-improvement-act/,"(Washington, D.C., December 23, 2021) – U.S. Senators Roger Marshall, M.D. (KS), Chuck Grassley (IA), Jim Inhofe (OK), Marsha Blackburn (TN), and Joni Ernst (IA) introduced the National Biosecurity Improvement Act, legislation to ensure federally-funded research involving potentially dangerous pathogens does not compromise national security. This legislation follows congressional inquiries and various news investigations revealing national security issues including federal agencies authorizing dangerous research with certain foreign entities.“The COVID-19 pandemic revealed many vulnerabilities in our federal programs, but none has been more troubling than the type of dangerous research we fund and the international partners that are involved,” said Senator Marshall. “I believe we need to put a full moratorium in place on gain-of-function, we also need our watchdog agency to look under the hood and evaluate HHS’ policies that could jeopardize global public health. If this research is to continue, we need to understand how to do so safely, put proper protections in place and ensure federal agencies are held accountable to the American people.”“The more we learn about the potential origins of the coronavirus pandemic, the more questions we have about the role of state actors and even our own government in researching dangerous pathogens. As we continue to investigate, Americans deserve answers on the extent to which the U.S. government engages in or funds risky research and what policies are in place to ensure it is done safely and in a way that doesn’t jeopardize our national security. This bill brings about much needed transparency into the government’s policies and past actions regarding such risky research,” said Senator Grassley.“The COVID pandemic has highlighted the need for safeguards to ensure federally-funded research does not pose a threat to national security. This legislation will provide much needed oversight on how agencies evaluate risk when making decisions about federal funding to support research in other countries,” said Senator Blackburn.“If COVID-19 has taught us anything, it’s that we need more transparency surrounding federal agencies’ funding of various research, particularly regarding potentially dangerous pathogens. This bill will increase oversight and help ensure research is conducted safely and securely, both in the United States and overseas, to protect the safety of Iowans and all Americans,” said Senator Ernst.Background:The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is an independent agency tasked with making recommendations to improve all federal agencies’ integrity, efficiency, and effectiveness. As such, the legislation would require the GAO to conduct a program evaluation on the following:1. How federal agencies that fund research involving the enhancement of potential pandemic pathogens and related risky research with potentially dangerous pathogens, ensure this research is conducted safely and securely and without compromising national security.2. Efforts to establish a common domestic and international approach to ensuring the safety and security of research involving the enhancement of potential pandemic pathogens and related risky research with potentially dangerous pathogens.3. The extent these agencies consider national security information when making decisions about federal funding to support research in other countries.The National Biosecurity Improvement Act of 2021 is part of Senator Marshall’s multi-step path forward on getting to the bottom of the origins of COVID-19. In October, he introduced the Viral Gain of Function Research Moratorium Act, legislation that would place a moratorium on all federal research grants to universities and other organizations conducting gain-of-function research and risky research on potential pandemic pathogens.###"

With COVID cases back on the rise and only about a quarter of eligible Americans having taken the booster, I urge you to talk with your trusted doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible about taking action.Sen. Barrasso: This holiday season, I have three reasons why you should consider getting a COVID vaccine booster – especially if you are a senior or someone with underlying health conditions. First, the effectiveness of your COVID vaccination drops to about 50 percent after 6 months of getting the jab.Rep. Ruiz: Second, with the booster, you are 14 times less likely to end up being hospitalized if you get sick with COVID. And third, with the booster, you are 10 times less likely to die. For now, it appears the Delta variant will still dominate. But, the good news is we know the booster will help prevent hospitalizations and save lives.Rep. Bera: And Omicron? Well, we don’t know as much about it but you will likely benefit from the COVID booster as well. Finally, please consider this friendly advice: whether you are exposed to Delta or Omicron, the flu, or common cold… healthy eating , daily exercise, seven hours of sleep nightly, and avoiding stress all will serve you well.Sen.

https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/marshall-cassidy-smith-legislation-to-lower-prescription-drug-costs-passes-senate/,"(Washington, D.C., March 11, 2021) – The U.S. Senate last night passed the Ensuring Innovation Act, which was introduced by U.S. Senators Roger Marshall, M.D., Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), and Tina Smith (D-MN) last month to help lower prescription drug prices. The legislation will provide clarity for drug exclusivity to prevent awarding market exclusivity to products that do not represent true innovation and unduly delay cheaper generics from entering the market.“As a physician, and now a U.S. Senator, I believe innovation and competition can have a profound impact on driving down the cost of health care,” said Senator Marshall. “The current regulatory landscape unnecessarily delays patient access to FDA-approved generics. Our bipartisan legislation ensures affordable life-saving medicine while preserving innovation for cutting-edge medicine.”Background:Currently, the FDA grants five years of exclusivity to drug products that are determined to be a New Chemical Entity (NCE). In order to be an NCE, a drug product must contain an “active moiety” that has not been used in a product previously approved by the FDA. This legislation will codify the FDA’s current “active moiety” approach to granting NCE exclusivity.###"
https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-presses-officials-on-kansas-energy-issues-during-deep-freeze/,"(Washington, D.C., March 11, 2021) – Today, U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. pressed witnesses during a Senate Committee on Energy & Natural Resources hearing about the energy and financial issues that occurred during the deep freeze across Kansas last month. Senator Marshall requested the hearing in a letter to Chairman Joe Manchin and Ranking Member John Barrasso in February. Additionally, last month, Senator Marshall and Representative Sharice Davids urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to investigate the cause of system failures during the February cold snap and determine if any wrongdoing caused Kansans’ energy bills to skyrocket. You may click HERE or on the image below to watch Senator Marshall question the officials.“I am here with the weight of three million Kansans who are waking up to utility bills which are just through the roof. I have the weight of a hundred different municipalities who are buying natural gas on the spot market, municipalities who in three days’ time spent more than they were planning on spending in the next five years. The questions I am going to ask you are questions I have been asked dozens of times that I don’t have answers to yet,” said Senator Marshall.Background:The recent cold weather impacting much of the Midwest and eastern U.S. put extreme pressures on the nation’s natural gas and propane supply. Freezing conditions prevented new energy generation in many sectors, putting additional pressures on natural gas supplies for electrical generation. A sharp increase in demand causes natural gas prices to jump more than 100-percent of normal costs. As a result, natural gas and electrical rates paid by Kansas communities, businesses and homeowners reached record levels.  Text of Senator Marshall’s letter requesting the hearing:February 18, 2021The Honorable Joe Manchin, ChairmanSenate Committee on Energy & Natural Resources304 Dirksen Senate BuildingWashington, DC 20510The Honorable John Barrasso, M.D., Ranking MemberSenate Committee on Energy & Natural Resources304 Dirksen Senate BuildingWashington, DC 20510Chairman Manchin and Ranking Member Barrasso,For more than a week, Kansas has experienced record-breaking cold temperatures with ice and snow accumulating over much of the state. Temperatures have set new record-lows and multiple cities in Kansas have set new days-below-freezing records. Additionally, multiple states across the Great Plains and Midwest have also endured unseasonably cold temperatures and continued freezing conditions.Kansas Governor Laura Kelly issued a state disaster declaration and the Kansas Corporation Commission issued an emergency order directing utilities to do everything possible and necessary to ensure continued delivery of electricity, natural gas, and propane to Kansas customers. Kansas companies have seen their power cut and Kansans have experienced rolling blackouts.I respectfully request that the Senate Committee on Energy & Natural Resources hold a hearing to exam the reliability and resiliency of the electric grid in extreme weather events like the arctic blast. More specifically, I believe it is prudent to exam the affordability of electricity and natural gas when the system is stressed. The Midwest and Great Plains have seen cold weather before. Electricity generators and natural gas producers in the north consistently operate in extreme cold weather. The ultimate questions become, “Why weren’t we prepared?” and “What can we do to ensure this doesn’t happen again?”Thank you for your time and consideration.Sincerely,Roger Marshall, M.DUnited States Senator###"

The Death Tax Repeal Act of 2021, would finally end this purely punitive tax that has the potential to hit family-run farms, ranches, and businesses as the result of the owner’s death.“There is a saying in Kansas that farmers live poor but die rich. That’s because much of a farmer’s net worth is in land assets that appreciate in value,” said Senator Marshall. “After spending years paying off land with income already taxed each year, farmers are taxed again, at death, trying to pass the land on to their children. The death tax only punishes the hard work of working families trying to keep their farms or small businesses generational.”Background:The Death Tax Repeal Act of 2021 is supported by the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Cattleman’s Beef Association, NFIB, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Family Business Coalition, the Family Business Estate Tax Coalition, the Policy and Taxation Group, the Associated General Contractors of America, the National Taxpayers Union, and many others.###"

You may click HERE or on the image below to hear the interview.You may click HERE or scroll below to read Senator Marshall’s op-ed in its entirety.One Shot Is Better Than NoneGiving more people a single dose of mRNA Covid vaccines saves more lives than giving fewer people two doses.Op-ed By: U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D.March 8, 2021In my four years in Congress, the phrase I’ve heard most regularly abused is “Follow the science.” Politicians, bureaucrats and reporters in Washington—many of whom, based on their comments, seem to have last attended science class in eighth grade—have a penchant for developing policies and then lecturing the opposition on the “science” that follows their agenda. Like my granddad used to say, “figures lie and liars figure.” Covid-19 policy is no exception.In medical school, my classmates and I were taught to apply the science practically to the messy world around us, not merely follow theories as if we practiced medicine in a vacuum. Once we got out of the classroom, many of us quickly found that not every patient’s clinical course was exactly what the textbooks said. The medical school graduates who quickly became the best physicians were those who listened to their patients, called on their experience, and, yes, applied the science only as made sense in particular circumstances.Nothing is harder for a physician to manage than a virus. Human papillomavirus, for example, often causes cervical precancer and cancer. Our obstetrics and gynecology residency program studied HPV as far back as my internship in 1987. From 1997 to 2003, by combining pap smears with HPV strain identification, doctors could employ technology that identified which patients were truly at risk for cancer, versus those who should merely be observed. But finding the correct application took roughly a decade, and as doctors struggled to use the data to distinguish who was at high and low risk, I observed the condition was often overtreated.It took real-world trial and error to tailor the right approach. Along with the approval of the HPV vaccine in 2006, medical researchers over the past decade have consistently shown enough scientific data for physicians to know with confidence which patients should be monitored and which need cervical procedures or hysterectomies. This eliminated millions of unnecessary surgeries, preserved fertility, and decreased extreme premature delivery in some instances. I can say as a physician that what we’ve seen developed over the past year regarding diagnosis and treatment and vaccines for Covid is truly a miracle. But the medical community is still developing its understanding of treatments and risk factors.Similarly, viral infections during pregnancy are completely unpredictable. Even understanding risk factors, you never know how an individual patient’s physiology will react. How well patients fight off a virus depends on their natural immunity, which depends on all sorts of largely unknowable criteria. Whether it’s hepatitis, chickenpox, West Nile or the common flu, my professor once told me, “If you’ve seen one case of a particular virus in pregnancy, you’ve only seen one case.” His point? Apply the science as best you can, but each case has its own complexities. Developing better treatments takes a long time and real-world data from treating patients.It’s impossible to follow the science of most any virus with great certainty, especially a novel virus. The medical community knew from day one that the science on Covid would be predictably unpredictable and constantly changing. When government scientists—let alone politicians and journalists—present a hasty, incomplete hypothesis as indisputable fact, they’re acting contrary to science—and often driving a preconceived agenda. Science is a systematic enterprise that organizes knowledge into predictions about the universe. It is not a gospel of indisputable, never-changing truth. Just as cancer treatments have changed over time, doctors will discover countless false hypotheses that were put forward as fact by government agencies and healthcare experts from all fields surrounding Covid-19. Science is never settled.Take the notorious subject of mask mandates. The overly certain “science” of bureaucrats first told Americans not to wear masks. Then we had to wear them indoors. Then this was extended to include outdoor mask wearing. Now, a good American needs to don two, maybe three masks even if you’ve had the virus or the vaccine to “follow the science”—unless you are seated at a restaurant, or with a small group that also is vaccinated. Then you’re safe.There is little scientific logic behind these shifts. But out of an abundance of caution, please keep wearing your masks in public.Now let’s talk about applying science. Real-world evidence suggests that the effectiveness of one shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine ranges between 72% to 92.6% after two weeks. Further evidence suggests the second shot could be given 12 weeks later instead of three or four weeks and be equally effective. After every senior citizen and high-risk individual gets their two shots, applied science would suggest we could save tens of thousands of lives if we give one shot to as many people as possible and came back for a second dose as more vaccines are available. This is assuming that robust real-world evidence finds a second shot even necessary, which it’s possible won’t be borne out by the evidence.Consider this: If you had 200 Pfizer vaccines and 200 family members, and it was up to you, how would you allocate them? The current emergency-use authorization tells you to give 100 people two shots. Assuming it will be 95% effective, only 100 people would be vaccinated, and 95 would be protected. Alternatively, you could give 200 people one shot, assuming 75% effectiveness, 150 people at a minimum would be protected. This approach has the potential to address the relative limitations in supply and the hiccups we are seeing ramping up in mass vaccination sites right now. Each day that applied science is delayed, more people than otherwise will die from Covid-19, and the opening of businesses and schools will be unnecessarily delayed.I’m not trying to be too prescriptive. The Food and Drug Administration is tasked to ensure the safety, efficacy and security of all medical products. Congress should clarify how and when the FDA considers real-world evidence in emergency-use authorizations during pandemics—and make sure that practical realities are accounted for.State and local officials and healthcare providers across the country need to do the scientific thing and apply theory to the world practically, not blindly follow it as if we exist in a vacuum.Dr. Marshall, a Republican, is a U.S. senator from Kansas.

https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/senator-marshall-announces-funding-for-ukmc-breast-cancer-research/,"(Washington, DC, March 8, 2021) – Today, U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. announced the University of Kansas Medical Center received more than $850,000 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to study the effectiveness of combining menopausal and hormone therapies to reduce the risk of breast cancer, while also alleviating menopausal symptoms in women.“As an OBGYN, I understand the complexity of women’s health, especially the risks that develop as they age from their reproductive years to menopause,” said Senator Marshall. “Sadly, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death among women. It’s utterly relentless, especially for those where it’s hereditary or have a pre-cancerous condition. This is why prevention and early detection efforts are so important. The researchers at the University of Kansas Medical Center developed an ingenious approach at reducing the risk of breast cancer while also alleviating common symptoms that occur as women go through menopause. And the symptoms of menopause can be debilitating if not under good care. I applaud their work and hope that these trials yield promising results.” Background: The project, funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), aims to prevent cancer in women by studying the effects of a combination of hormonal and non-hormonal treatment. Specifically, this clinical trial builds on a successful pilot trial that applied medication to preserve bone mass and a mixture of estrogen hormones to prevent breast cancer. The combination therapy also helps in alleviating menopausal symptoms like developing brittle and weak bones. Over the next five years, this research team will use breast imaging to evaluate its effectiveness in preventing breast cancer. This year, over a quarter-million women nationwide will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, including 2,380 women in Kansas. Women with an increased risk, especially those with a family history, are prescribed anti-estrogen drug therapy. Still, few women take it due to side effects like hot flashes. However, women are more likely to consider drug therapy in their 40s and 50s. Women often enter the menopause transition in this age range.  The clinical trial is expected to begin early this summer and will enroll 120 women ages 45-60 with hot flashes and at increased risk for breast cancer from five NCI-designated Cancer Centers. In total, the University of Kansas Medical Center received $852,459.Throughout his time in Congress, Senator Marshall has served as a strong advocate for women’s health including breast cancer research at NCI. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, supported by Senator Marshall, included increased federal research funding and prevented harmful reimbursement cuts from physicians treating breast cancer patients under Medicare.###"

Only nine percent of the package is focused on helping Americans weather the pandemic. Meanwhile, the other 91 percent is allocated to Democrat pet projects.“Having passed each of the previous COVID packages on a bipartisan basis, it is disappointing this $1.9 trillion bill has been a totally partisan process from the start. Forcing hardworking Kansans to pay for democrat pet projects and to bail out blue states who over reacted and totally shut down their economies and their schools is not fair and it’s not American,” said Senator Marshall. “Without question we need to help those who truly need the help now but cheating Kansas of $400 million in state and local relief does the exact opposite. I remain focused on what will defeat this virus: getting shots in arms, getting people back to work, and getting kids back to school.”Senator Marshall supported Senator Susan Collins’ alternative to the Democrat’s bill, which would have provided fair, direct, and targeted relief to Americans in need.

https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/energy-committee-grants-sen-marshall-request-to-hold-hearing-on-kansas-energy-issues/,"(Washington, D.C., March 5, 2021) – Today, the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy & Natural Resources announced it will hold a hearing to examine the reliability and resiliency of the electric grid in extreme weather events like the recent arctic blast. The hearing comes at the request of U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D., who sent a letter to Chairman Joe Manchin and Ranking Member John Barrasso. You may click HERE to read Senator Marshall’s letter in its entirety.“I appreciate Chairman Manchin and Ranking Member Barrasso for agreeing to hold this important hearing. The Midwest and Great Plains have seen cold weather before. Electricity generators and natural gas producers in the north consistently operate in extreme cold weather. The ultimate questions become, ‘Why weren’t we prepared?’ and ‘What can we do to ensure this doesn’t happen again?’” said Senator Marshall. “While we continue to do all we can at the federal level to confirm no foul play or price gouging has occurred and to support our utility companies and community leaders as they worked diligently to keep Kansans warm, I believe it is prudent to exam the reliability, resiliency, and affordability of electricity and natural gas when the system is stressed.”Background:The recent cold weather impacting much of the Midwest and eastern U.S. put extreme pressures on the nation’s natural gas and propane supply. Freezing conditions prevented new energy generation in many sectors, putting additional pressures on natural gas supplies for electrical generation. A sharp increase in demand causes natural gas prices to jump more than 100-percent of normal costs. As a result, natural gas and electrical rates paid by Kansas communities, businesses and homeowners reached record levels.  Text of Senator Marshall’s letter:February 18, 2021The Honorable Joe Manchin, ChairmanSenate Committee on Energy & Natural Resources304 Dirksen Senate BuildingWashington, DC 20510The Honorable John Barrasso, M.D., Ranking MemberSenate Committee on Energy & Natural Resources304 Dirksen Senate BuildingWashington, DC 20510Chairman Manchin and Ranking Member Barrasso,For more than a week, Kansas has experienced record-breaking cold temperatures with ice and snow accumulating over much of the state.

The college provides diesel and automotive technician training and EDA funding will allow the school to grow the number of students served annually by nearly 300.“It is through job training and education that we will truly get people back to work and rebuild our great economy,” said Senator Marshall. “NWKTC provides hands-on training and services to folks across northwest Kansas, providing opportunities for high-wage, high-skill positions that meet regional needs in agriculture, trucking, and logistics fields. The expansion of NWKTC will equip graduates with the real-life job skills that allow them to enter the workforce and fill a growing need in the surrounding region.” Background:More than $1.5 billion in funding from the CARES Act was provided to the EDA to be used for economic development assistance programs to help communities prevent, prepare and respond to coronavirus. Funding awarded to NWKTC will allow the school to increase the number of diesel and automotive technicians trained and hired into distressed communities. The expansion of NWKTC’s program will benefit the 17-county region the college currently serves by providing opportunities for students to enter high-wage, high-skilled positions currently available in communities across the region.

https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-deeply-concerned-with-the-vaccine-distribution-efforts-in-kansas/,"(Washington, DC, March 4, 2021) – U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. questioned Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) Secretary Lee Norman yesterday on a video conference regarding vaccine distribution efforts in the state. Troubling reports out of Kansas recently highlighted the disparities saying, “About 4.8% of Black Kansans have gotten vaccinated against COVID-19… a figure that is half the vaccination rate for white residents, roughly 10% of whom have gotten their shots. About 4% of the state’s American Indian population and 5% of Asian-American residents have gotten their vaccine, according to the numbers, which were publicly disclosed Friday for the first time. Around 7% of those who identify as Hispanic or Latino have been immunized.” Additionally, as of yesterday, the CDC ranks Kansas 46th for distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines. “Whether it is the disparity amongst various communities or the fact that our state ranks 46th for doses administered, I am deeply concerned with the vaccine distribution efforts in Kansas,” said Senator Marshall. “What your background is, where you live, or your income should never be a barrier to receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. From day one, I have supported efforts to ensure all Americans that want a vaccine can have a vaccine at no cost.  It is only through outreach to all communities and inclusion of all Americans that we will reach herd immunity by April or May and truly defeat this virus once and for all.”Background:Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Senator Marshall has been focused on ensuring equal access to testing, treatment, and the vaccine – regardless of race, age, income, and zip code. On the call, Senator Marshall also encouraged Secretary Norman to engage the state’s community health centers (CHCs) more as they are well-positioned to help close the disparity gap and reach underserved populations.While in Wichita last week, Senator Marshall toured HealthCore Clinic, a CHC that provides physical and mental health care to Wichita’s underserved population. During the visit, the Senator and HealthCore staff discussed ways the center was working to better serve minority populations including outreach and education on preventative measures, available treatment, and the COVID-19 vaccines that have received Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.CHCs provide affordable, high-quality primary health care to their local community and also aim to reduce racial and ethnic disparities. Given their success in delivering comprehensive primary care, CHCs have also called upon to support various public health initiatives including the opioid crisis, chronic disease management, and the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Last year, Senator Marshall volunteered at a CHC in Wyandotte County, working with minority and low-income populations in need of testing and care for COVID-19, and has toured testing and vaccine facilities in the Kansas City region, aimed at serving minority populations.The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) launched the Health Center COVID-19 Vaccine Program and will ship vaccine doses directly to CHCs, as part of their commitment to ensure equity in vaccine distribution. Two CHCs in Kansas are part of the initial phase – one received doses yesterday and is administering them today. A second clinic will receive their direct shipment on Monday. HRSA plans to expand the program to other CHCs in the very near future.As a member of the House of Representatives, Senator Marshall was a cosponsor and supported the passage of the $2 trillion CARES Act – legislation that included $1.32 billion in supplemental funding for CHCs on the front lines of testing and treating patients for COVID-19. He also supported the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which continued funding for CHCs and allowed them to grow their services. The bipartisan package also included Senator Marshall’s legislation authorizing a public advocacy campaign to promote COVID-19 vaccine participation and providing science-backed information.###"

But today, the issue of getting our kids back in school feels like parents vs. the teachers union and it shouldn’t be.

We know that when it comes to legitimate science, we must never tolerate incomplete evidence gathering and political motivations to inform clinical decisions…”You may click HERE or scroll below for the full text of the op-ed.WHO Must Actually Demonstrate Independence from ChinaWashington TimesMarch 2, 2021By: U.S. Senators Roger Marshall, M.D. and John Barrasso, M.D., and Representatives Andy Harris, M.D., John Joyce, M.D., and Brad Wenstrup, D.P.M.With the stroke of a pen, President Joe Biden rejoined the United States, as a paying member, to the World Health Organization (WHO). President Biden’s own National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan stated, “Re-engaging with the WHO also means holding it to the highest standards… We have deep concerns about the way in which the early findings of the COVID-19 investigation were communicated.”Before putting U.S. taxpayers on the hook for the WHO’s budget, we should have laid out the standards that must be followed and demanded that reforms be made before agreeing to rejoin the WHO. After all, it’s been over a year, and we still have more questions than answers about the WHO’s transparency, independence, and ability to address global pandemics.In the early days of 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak was primarily contained within China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) took multiple deceitful actions to hide the morbidity and the rate of transmission of the virus. Instead of sounding the alarm, the CCP silenced journalists and doctors, destroyed early samples of the novel coronavirus, blocked foreign investigations – including by U.S. health officials, and launched a sophisticated misinformation campaign to deflect responsibility as the virus spread across the globe. Sadly, the WHO amplified these messages and partnered with the CCP to cover up the origins of the virus. On January 14, 2020 after failing to independently verify China’s reporting, the official WHO Twitter account repeated China’s false talking points stating that “preliminary investigations conducted by the CCP authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transition.” The very next day, America’s first documented coronavirus patient was identified in Washington, a man who recently traveled to the Wuhan region. Two weeks later, the Director-General of the WHO, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus – a candidate supported by China to run the WHO – traveled to China to meet with President Xi and lavished the Communist leader with praise for his transparency and handling of the outbreak.After returning from Beijing, Director Tedros even said that China was “setting a new standard for outbreak response” and while feigning ignorance to China’s own intra-country travel ban, lambasted countries issuing travel bans stating they could “have the effect of increasing fear and stigma, with little public health benefit.”As we’ve begun to pass the one year anniversary for many of the first milestones of the COVID-19 outbreak, the CCP continues their smoke and mirrors, and the WHO continues to throw their hands up in the air. In addition to perpetuating false claims about the virus’ origin, CCP authorities also refused information requests from WHO investigators who had recently completed a mission to China between January and February of this year. The WHO investigators were seeking raw data surrounding nearly 200 COVID-19 cases believed to have existed during the earliest phases of the Wuhan outbreak. Conclusions extolled by China, without the WHO seeing the raw – and hopefully real data – are untrustworthy at best. An investigation based off limited and tampered information is not a real investigation. This is not how science should be shared. It hinders the development of multivalent vaccines and further prolongs the scourge of this plague.Unfortunately, the January-February 2021 findings of the WHO investigators, as well as the omissions should astonish no one. The fact that the WHO continues to run interference for the CCP should not either. Their probe demonstrates the continued unwillingness of the CCP to share information with the world about the origins of the outbreak. It also shows the WHO raced to conclusions and conducted a public spectacle to share their findings, which included not only ruling out the possibility of a leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, one potential source of the virus, but also gave veracity to the lie that the virus originated in another country and entered China through contaminated frozen food.The WHO’s willful blindness when it comes to the CCP, leads many to remain skeptical of them and the information they provide to the world. And it’s another reason we are concerned with the Biden Administration’s decision to rejoin the WHO without resolving its major problems and fund it using American taxpayer dollars.Without independent investigations, complete access to decade’s old data from scientists like Dr. Shi Zhengli who studied this virus found in bat droppings, and a complete understanding of all the facts on the ground, we will never fully understand this virus or how it started. As variants emerge and we enter the next chapter of this battle, the world needs answers. Understanding the virus’ start will help public health leaders combat new strains and rapidly develop effective vaccines and therapeutics. More importantly, it can help us in preventing future pandemics through preventive measures.We are doctors who happen to serve as U.S. Senators and Congressmen, not U.S Senators and Congressmen who happen to be doctors. We know that when it comes to legitimate science, we must never tolerate incomplete evidence gathering and political motivations to inform clinical decisions.The only way forward for an international public health organization to successfully function is if it can actually demonstrate independence from political influence and work with all partner nations to uncover and share the information experts need. Humankind needs a functioning science-driven organization – not a politically driven one. And, we need the WHO to get back to their original objective stated in the organization’s constitution: attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health. The clock is ticking.

https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-applauds-state-legislatures-support-for-rural-emergency-hospital-designation-legislation/,"(Washington, DC, March 2, 2021) – Today, U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. issued a statement following the Kansas State Legislature voting favorably on a bill that would provide a new option for struggling rural hospitals to continue serving their communities. Senator Marshall had previously submitted written testimony to the Kansas Senate Committee on Public Health and Welfare in support of the legislation.“We never want to see a rural community be forced to close the doors of its hospital and lose access to health care,” said Senator Marshall. “This new hospital designation creates a more cost-efficient alternative so that rural communities can maintain immediate access to quality care. I am pleased that Kansas legislators support this meaningful legislation so hospitals and community leaders can choose what best fits their financial needs.”Background:The Rural Emergency Hospital (REH) designation was established under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. Signed into law last December, this legislation allows critical access hospitals to convert into a voluntary new designation under Medicare for rural communities that cannot support a Critical Access Hospital (CAH) with mandatory inpatient care. CAHs that convert to an REH would not provide inpatient care but focus on emergency and outpatient care, in addition to primary care. Specifically, they would need to maintain 24-hour emergency services, maintain transfer agreements to regional hospitals, and more.Most rural hospitals in Kansas are CAHs, a designation that requires them to maintain acute care beds. Since 2010, seven hospitals in Kansas have either closed or converted, and many more may follow the same path. Studies have shown that rural hospitals are financially vulnerable, with several at risk of closing. Declines in inpatient care was found to be a common denominator in hospitals that closed.Full Text of Letter:February 17, 2021The Honorable Richard Hilderbrand, ChairCommittee on Public Health and Welfare                             Kansas Senate                                                                                  Statehouse, Room 118-M                                                            Topeka, KS 66612                                                                             Senator Hilderbrand:Thank you for your continued efforts on combating the COVID-19 pandemic and addressing the financial struggles physicians and other health care providers are currently facing. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed existing vulnerabilities in our health care system, and none were more exposed than health care facilities serving rural communities. To ensure access to health care in rural communities in the long term, we must think outside the box and provide options for alternative financing and organizational structures that eliminate inefficient overhead costs while maintaining necessary health services in rural communities. To this end, I write in support of SB 175/HB 2261, legislation that would establish the Rural Emergency Hospital (REH) designation in Kansas statute.Most rural hospitals in Kansas are Critical Access Hospitals (CAH), a designation that requires them to maintain acute care beds. Since 2010, seven hospitals in Kansas have either closed or converted, and many more may follow the same path.  It is estimated that 31 Kansas hospitals are financially vulnerable, 12 are most vulnerable, and 19 are at risk of closing.  Federal agencies and Congress have been working to address this problem by identifying trends the precede hospital closures. Last year, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) examined claims data from 40 rural hospitals that closed and found declines in inpatient care.  Specifically, there was a 53 percent decline from all payers and a 61 percent decline under Medicare, and most of the Medicare declines were due to beneficiaries bypassing the local hospital or a shrinking market for inpatient services. However, emergency services were relatively stable and outpatient services decreased only slightly. MedPAC also found in an earlier study that higher reimbursement rates for inpatient care did not improve financial stability of CAHs because the extra payments were absorbed by high inpatient costs per day of care.  Overall, data suggests that specializing in emergency and outpatient services may be a more viable option in cases where providing inpatient care is too costly to maintain with insufficient demand.I have sought to mitigate these financial difficulties at the federal level by working with the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and my colleagues in Congress on bipartisan initiatives that would help rural hospitals improve financial sustainability and access to quality care. More recently, I supported creating the Rural Emergency Hospital designation under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021.  This designation creates a new option for rural communities that cannot support a CAH with mandatory acute care beds.The new law includes guardrails to ensure quality care, and stakeholders will have an opportunity to help shape implementing regulations through notice-and-comment rulemaking and guidance. To enroll in this new category, CAHs will not provide inpatient care nor exceed an annual per-patient length of stay more than 24 hours. To maintain quality care for emergency services, REHs must maintain a transfer agreement with a Level I or II trauma center and have an around-the-clock staffed emergency department including a physician, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or physician assistant – pursuant to state scope of practice laws. They must also maintain Medicare Conditions of Participation from their previous designation to ensure patient health and safety in the hospital setting. Finally, they must meet applicable state licensing requirements.The voluntary REH designation may offer a sustainable payment system. Similar to MedPAC’s recommendations, REH payments will be made under the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System with a 5 percent add-on payment for covered services. Hospitals will also receive a fixed monthly payment based on a modified reimbursement formula for CAHs, and it will be subject to the hospital market basket percentage increase. This designation will go into effect on January 1, 2023. As a fellow Kansan and physician from Great Bend, I supported this section of the legislation as it presents an option for health care providers with a passion for rural health to continue serving their community. This new payment model offers a new option that mitigates the binary choice of running a full inpatient hospital and shutting doors completely in rural communities.  I want to give CAH administrators and their patients the opportunity to evaluate all available options and select a model that best meets their local needs. As you consider this legislation, please know that I will prioritize our rural hospitals and will advise CMS to develop practical and feasible regulations.

https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-covid-package-full-of-so-much-pork-its-dripping-grease/,"(Washington, D.C., March 2, 2021) – Today, U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. spoke on the Senate floor about the $1.9 trillion “COVID relief” legislation currently making its way through Congress of which only nine percent is focused on helping Americans weather the pandemic. Meanwhile, the other 91 percent is allocated to Democrat pet projects.In part, Senator Marshall said, “I’m without question here to fight for those who truly need the help now, but I’m also called to protect the future of this country… Call this bill what you want: a boondoggle, a Christmas tree, packed with ear marks, and full of so much pork it’s dripping grease. My friends across the aisle focused 91% of their attention in this bill to pay for things like a bridge from New York to Canada, an underground rail project in Silicon Valley, money for Planned Parenthood, and stimulus checks for illegal immigrants and violent criminals… This is what will defeat this virus: getting shots in arms, getting people back to work, and getting kids back to school.”You may click HERE or on the image below to watch Senator Marshall’s speech.Background:On a bipartisan basis, Congress has already allocated over $4 trillion in COVID relief – $1 trillion of that has yet to even get out the door.Democrats have set aside 91 percent of this $1.9 trillion legislation for pet projects like:According to nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, much of the money would not be spent for several years. The bill includes $128.6 billion for schools but only spends 5% of it by the end of this fiscal year – just $6.4 billion. It would take another seven years for the rest of the money to be spent.A recent analysis from Moody’s Analytics concluded that, after accounting for federal aid already provided, 31 states will have no revenue shortfall at all, and net shortfalls across the country will total just $56 billion. The authors noted, “Any additional aid to states and local governments should be smaller and more targeted than what has been proposed to date.”The economy is improving:###"
https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-announces-55-million-for-conservation-projects-in-kansas/,"(Washington, D.C., March 2, 2021) – Today, U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. announced $55 million for regional conservation projects in Kansas. Funding will be used to support both regional conservation and outdoor recreation safety and educational opportunities.“I grew up hunting and fishing with my father and have spent countless hours doing the same with my sons and grandsons,” said Senator Marshall. “I want to leave our world better than we found it and by improving habitats and our environment, we not only care for fish and wildlife but provide better outdoor recreation opportunities for everyone. These dollars are an important part of the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks efforts to provide not only conservation efforts but help a new generation of Kansans learn to love the outdoors.”Background:A total of $1 billion is being allocated to state wildlife agencies through the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program (WSFR).  Through the Pittman–Robertson Act of 1937, the Dingell–Johnson Act of 1950, and the Wallop–Breaux Amendment of 1984, the WSFR program establishes a conservation partnership among state wildlife agencies, the outdoor industry and the Service. When hunters, anglers and boaters purchase equipment and fuel, the manufacturers, producers and importers of those goods pay into the Wildlife Restoration, Sport Fish Restoration and Boating trust funds. These funds are distributed by the Service to ensure wildlife agencies in all states, commonwealths and territories receive support.###"
https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-votes-against-nomination-for-education-secretary/,"(Washington, D.C., March 1, 2021) – Today, U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. voted against President Joe Biden’s pick to be U.S. Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona primarily for his support for allowing boys to compete in girls’ sports. Following the vote, Senator Marshall issued this statement:“As a doctor and a former coach, I find it un-American to allow biological boys to compete against girls when it comes to athletics. Growing up, sports taught me that there was a level playing field and that we all had equal opportunity to compete and win. Letting biological boys compete in girls’ high school and college sports is not equal, it doesn’t level the playing field, and it’s certainly not fair,” said Sen. Marshall. “Secretary Cardona’s unwillingness to provide alternatives or confirm he would not allow genetic boys to compete against girls in sports is concerning. It gives me great pause that this is the person President Biden is entrusting our kids with.”Today, Senator Marshall penned an op-ed for FOX News about President Biden’s efforts to allow biological boys to compete in girls’ athletics, saying in part, “On the very first day of his presidency, Joe Biden took one giant leap backward for women’s rights when he issued an executive order forcing schools to allow student athletes to compete in sports based on their gender identity instead of their biological sex… While those who are transgender are entitled to their rights, so too are girls who are just looking for an opportunity to compete against their peers, the genetically female ones… There is nothing fair about President Biden’s executive order. It shows no common sense and will bring about the destruction of women’s sports.”On Saturday, Senator Marshall appeared on the Mike Huckabee Show and discussed the issue as well. You may click HERE or on the image below to watch a portion of the interview.Background:Last month, Senator Marshall joined Senator Mike Lee (UT) to introduce the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, legislation to protect athletic opportunities for female athletes. The legislation comes just days after President Joe Biden issued an Executive Order forcing schools to allow student athletes to compete in sports based on their gender identity instead of their biological gender. Senator Marshall spoke about the legislation during an interview on Newsmax. You may click HERE or on the image below to watch Senator Marshall’s interview.Additionally, Senator Marshall introduced a budget amendment to address this issue. You may read the amendment HERE. At the committee hearing on Mr. Cardona’s nomination, Senator Marshall asked him if there were other alternatives than allowing boys to compete against girls in sports.

With wins over the past few years on the China Phase One Deal, USMCA, KORUS, and the Japan-Free Trade Agreement combined with efforts to roll back the red tape that was hampering Kansas farmers, ranchers, and producers, we know that the sky is the limit,” said Senator Marshall. “While we accomplished a great deal for Kansas agriculture over the last two years, my hope is that we can build on those efforts in the 117th Congress and deliver even more wins.”“We appreciate the support from then Rep. Marshall on important issues to Farm Bureau in the 116th Congress. The passage of USMCA will help Kansas producers export more of the agricultural commodities they grow and raise for years to come,” said Rich Felts, President of the Kansas Farm Bureau.Background:The Friend of the Farm Bureau Award is given to members of Congress who have supported Farm Bureau’s position on policy issues, as demonstrated by their voting records, and who were nominated by their respective state Farm Bureaus and approved by the American Farm Bureau Federation. ###"

This grant will provide opportunities for employees to move into new positions and new industries.”Background:The funding will be used to support the organization’s ongoing training programs designed to help employees learn new skills and move into positions in new or growing industries such as IT, cybersecurity and manufacturing.The Workforce Alliance operates under the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), which is under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. Department of Education and Health and Human Services, and offers career counseling, job training and support services to adults in South Central Kansas.The Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration awarded a total of $145 million in grant funding to 19 different recipients.

We need groundbreaking treatments. We need a cure,” said Senator Marshall. “I believe in the power of American innovation, and I know that our medical researchers will someday have the answers to this debilitating disease. I’m pleased my alma mater is receiving this critical funding to help research and combat Alzheimer’s.”Background:It is estimated that Alzheimer’s and other dementias will kill 1 in 3 seniors, and kills more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined. In addition to the emotional and physical toll is has on affected Americans, it costs the economy $305 billion. Without groundbreaking therapies, by 2050, the costs are expected to rise as high as $1.1 trillion.  Since joining Congress, Senator Marshall has prioritized robust federal funding at the National Institutes of Health to help spur innovation, as well as federal grant funding for Kansas to educate family members, businesses, and community members on assisting Alzheimer’s patients. As a strong supporter of the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act, Dr. Marshall seeks to improve the training of health professionals in palliative care, increase the size of this workforce, and enhance research in this field to build best practices.This $189,375 grant specifically will help the University of Kansas target how the energy maker of our cells – mitochondria – can be applied to Alzheimer’s disease.  The University of Kansas Alzheimer’s Disease Center has done previous work in studying mitochondria dysfunction – how it plays a role in the loss of brain function, and if and how treatments could be developed by targeting it.###"

The funding will go to the Kansas State Department for Aging and Disability Services and provide for help with mental health and substance use disorder.“We in Congress have a responsibility to provide our communities with the resources necessary to fight mental health and substance abuse disorders – particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Senator Marshall. “Over the past year we have seen organizations across Kansas doing the important work of helping people escape addiction and find hope. This critical grant will help KDADS in this ongoing fight as well.”Background:The emergency grants issued by HHS will go towards Kanas’ efforts to address mental health and substance use disorders during COVID-19. Specifically, the purpose of this program is to provide crisis intervention services, mental and substance use disorder treatment, and other related recovery supports for children and adults impacted by COVID-19. KDADS developed a comprehensive plan of evidence-based treatment services including medication-assisted treatment, inpatient treatment, medical/psychiatric assessments, 24-hour mobile crisis teams, peer recovery support services, and more. Telehealth and virtual services will be provided.Congress passed monumental legislation to curb the opioid epidemic but the COVID-19 outbreak stalled America’s road to recovery. Nationwide, reported substance use disorders and mental health issues have been on the rise. The CDC reports that over 40 percent of respondents in a 2020 study self-reported adverse mental or behavioral health condition, including anxiety, depression, trauma or stress-related disorder, substance abuse, or suicide ideation. Compared to 2019, reports of anxiety were approximately three times higher and reports of depression four times higher in 2020.###"

Whether it is fighting COVID-19, or other diseases and outbreaks, it is crucial that Congress invests more in vaccine efforts,” said Senator Marshall.Background:The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) program allows for increased access to vaccines for eligible children, reduces vaccination coverage disparities for those uninsured, and protects vulnerable populations. This program also helps in maintaining the state’s public health immunization infrastructure. The state is responsible for health care provider and public education, vaccine distribution and inventory management, supporting immunization outreach, and conduct surveillance laboratory testing, and more. In total, Kansas received $26,324,277.Currently, two COVID-19 vaccines received Emergency Use Authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Following his vote, the Senator issued this statement:“Mr. Blinken is weak on China, he’s weak on Iran, and he’s Biden’s right-hand man when it comes to rejoining the Paris Climate Accords – a deal which will kill jobs and raise the price of energy, hurting Kansans when many are struggling to stay on their feet,” said Senator Marshall. “As the champion for rejoining the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, Blinken’s repeat Obama-era efforts will give Iran a free pass at developing their ballistic missile program, spreading state-sponsored terrorism across the Middle East, and threatening our number one ally, Israel. We simply can’t afford another soft-on-China official in the Biden administration, particularly at a time when we should be holding China’s feet to the fire with regard to their lies and cover ups of the Coronavirus, intellectual property theft, and trade with the U.S. that impacts Kansas agriculture and jobs. The hallmark of the Obama Administration was to lead from behind when it comes to foreign policy – with re-tread nominees like Mr. Blinken, President Biden is already reverting back to his copy-paste days.”###"

The REINS Act is a common-sense piece of legislation that would ensure Congress has a say in any new major regulation that would have a significant economic effect of $100 million or more. We must ensure that unaccountable and unelected regulators do not hamper our economy with burdensome regulations as we try to come back from the hardship caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus,” said Senator Roger Marshall, M.D.Background:The bill defines a “major” rule as one that the Office of Management and Budget determines may result in an economic impact of $100 million or greater each year; “a major increase in costs or prices” for American consumers, government agencies, regions, or industries; or “significant adverse effects” on the economy.Under the REINS Act, once major rules are drafted, they must then be affirmatively approved by both chambers of Congress and then signed by the President, satisfying the bicameralism and presentment requirements of the Constitution. Currently, regulations ultimately take effect unless Congress specifically disapproves.You can read the bill—S. 68 in the 117th Congress—in its entirety HERE.Additional cosponsors of the REINS Act include Sens.

https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/senator-marshall-keep-wotus-repealed/,"(Washington, D.C., January 27, 2021) – U.S. Senator Roger Marshall is helping lead an effort on a Senate resolution that expresses the need for the U.S. Senate to stand with workers, farmers, manufacturers, and businesses by upholding the Trump Administration’s Navigable Waters Protection rule, which replaced the Obama-era Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule. “As Kansas farmers, ranchers, businesses and even municipalities know all too well, WOTUS dramatically expanded the reach of the federal government with minimal improvements in water quality. The Trump Administration’s Navigable Waters Protection rule served as a tremendous relief to Kansans and provided the regulatory certainty we need to grow,” said Senator Marshall. “Members of our state’s agriculture community spent the better part of the last decade trying to operate under the burdensome and uninformed regulations imposed by the Obama administration with WOTUS – we can’t allow the Biden Administration to take us backward yet again.”Supporters of the resolution include Senators Joni Ernst (Iowa) Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Deb Fischer (Neb.), Ben Sasse (Neb.), Jerry Moran (Kan.), Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), Kevin Cramer (N.D.), John Hoeven (N.D.), Mike Rounds (S.D.), James Risch (Idaho), John Barasso (Wyo.), Cynthia Lummis (Wyo.), Steve Daines (Mont.), Dan Sullivan (Alaska), Josh Hawley (Mo.), Roy Blunt (Mo.), Thom Tillis (N.C.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Tom Cotton (Ark.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (Miss.), Roger Wicker (Miss.), Rand Paul (Ky.), Mike Crapo (daho), Mike Braun (Ind.), and Ron Johnson (Wis.).Background:In 2015, the Obama Administration finalized a rule that expanded the definition of the Waters of the United States—giving the federal government authority to regulate water on much of the land in Kansas—and creating confusion and burdensome red tape for Kansas’ agriculture industry and many others.The Trump Administration released a proposed rule to replace the Obama Administration’s 2015 WOTUS rule with a new rule that provided much-needed predictability and certainty for farmers by establishing clear and reasonable definitions of what qualifies as a “water of the United States.” The new Navigable Waters Protection Rule was finalized last year.Now, on day one of his administration, President Biden signed an executive order that would roll back the Trump Administration’s executive order which began the process of rescinding Obama’s WOTUS rule. That’s why Senator Marshall supported this resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the Navigable Waters Protection Rule should not be withdrawn or vacated.###"

Senator Marshall attended the hearing in person.  “Former Secretary Tom Vilsack’s background as a governor and of course as the former Secretary of Agriculture make him a good fit to lead the USDA during these unprecedented times for our farmers and ranchers,” said Senator Marshall. “While Former Secretary Vilsack and I have a relationship going back to his time at the U.S. Dairy Export Council, yesterday we had a great meeting about the state of Kansas agriculture, the importance of trade, biofuels, and reducing regulations. While we may have our differences on a handful of issues, I look forward to working hand-in-hand with Former Secretary Vilsack and the entire USDA team as we help producers navigate COVID-19 and as we look toward crafting the next farm bill. I was particularly glad to hear his priority for CCC funding is our Title I Farm Bill Programs.

Fixing municipal potholes and managing bus routes in no way equates to what he will oversee at DOT,” said Senator Marshall. “It is troubling that Pete Buttigieg has openly talked about using his post as a pulpit for social agenda items and supports the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline, a move that will drive up the price of gas at the pump, cost thousands of jobs, crush our energy industry and put our country back on a path to dependence on foreign oil.

Prolonged and extreme cold temperatures across much of the Midwest have contributed to unprecedented demand for natural gas and propane, which has pushed prices to more than 100-times their average costs.“I appreciate the dedication of officials in Kansas to ensuring our businesses and residents have the natural gas and propane needed to continue powering their homes and businesses through this cold weather,” said Senator Marshall. “We will be doing all we can at the federal level to confirm no foul play or price gouging has occurred and continue to support our utility companies and community leaders as they work diligently to keep Kansans warm. In the meantime, I urge my fellow Kansans to do everything they can to conserve energy and keep energy costs low.”Background:The current cold weather impacting much of the Midwest and eastern U.S. has put extreme pressures on the nation’s natural gas and propane supply. Natural gas is the state’s largest energy source, accounting for more than 30 percent of the state’s portfolio. Kansas maintains a robust natural gas storage system, which has been tapped to fill elevated demand. Additionally, freezing conditions have prevented new energy generation in many sectors, putting further pressure on the state’s utility companies. Energy costs are expected to increase in the coming days as demand continues to outpace supply. Utility companies and community leaders are asking all Kansans to do their part to conserve energy and keep their own energy costs low by doing the following:Keep warm, not hotWhen possible wear additional layers of clothing, consider turning down your thermostat and check your programmable settings.Seal leaks around doors and windowsApply weather stripping or caulk to seal gaps and cracks around windows and doors to stop air leaks and prevent energy loss. If that is not an option, you can also cover windows with towels, sheets or plastic to help keep the warm air in your house.Reduce the temperature on your water heaterSet the temperature on your water heater to 120 degrees Fahrenheit or put it on the “warm” setting. If your home will be vacant for two days or more, set the dial to the pilot position for even more savings.Close blinds and curtainsThis helps keep warm air inside, especially if the sun is not shining.Change or clean filtersA clean filter on your furnace can lower your energy consumption by 5% to 15%. Dirty filters cost more to use and overwork the equipment.Hold off on doing choresDoing laundry and washing dishes can both use natural gas to heat the water and your dryer. If you can, wait until the extreme cold weather passes to complete these activities. If you cannot wait, use the cold setting where possible.Install foam gaskets on electrical switches and outletsElectrical switches and outlets can account for up to 10% of your home’s energy loss.###"

Trump on the Article of Impeachment presented against him:(You may click HERE or on the image above for Senator Marshall’s video response)“This impeachment trial has kept us from doing the work we need to be focused on: getting the COVID-19 vaccine in to peoples’ arms, opening our economy back up, getting Americans back to work, as well as confirming an agriculture secretary to get the $1.5 billion in CARES funding out to farmers, ranchers, and folks who need help putting food on the table.“This trial has brought to light just how much was known about the planning of the riot prior to January 6th and questions now linger as to what was known by Nancy Pelosi and security officials in the Capitol and across federal agencies ahead of time. One question does not remain and that is: What was the motivation of this trial? The motivation was political hatred and was simply a continuation of the four-year impeachment fixation on the part of the House Managers and the Democrat Party.“Let me be clear, both sides of the aisle are guilty of heated rhetoric. But, equally guilty are the House Managers and the Democrats for their hypocrisy, and President Trump’s defense team painted that picture clearly. “While I believe this entire trial was unconstitutional from the start, I hope that the failure to convict will put an end to the Democrat’s obsession and allow temperatures to finally settle and for us to work in a bipartisan fashion moving forward. It’s true, we face many challenges ahead as a nation. But, I remain confident there are brighter days ahead for Kansas and our entire country. It’s time for congress to get back to the work of the American people.”Background:Yesterday Senator Marshall asked a question during the impeachment trial, which called attention to the fact that the Democrat managers contradicted their very own impeachment charge.

https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-announces-1-4-million-to-kansas-for-maternal-and-child-health-block-grant/,"(Washington, D.C., February 12, 2021) – Today, U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. announced the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) received over $1.4 million in block grant funding to improve maternal and child health. “After working as an OBGYN in rural Kansas for nearly three decades, I know this federal-state partnership makes a positive impact on Kansas mothers and youth,” said Senator Marshall. “These programs support coordinated care for mothers before, during and after pregnancy as well as optimize infant health through feeding and sleeping best practices and providing physical and behavioral health services for children.”Background:The Maternal and Child Health Block Grant is a federal-state partnership that provides comprehensive access to care for almost 35,000 mothers, children, and their families annually across the state. Specifically, program funds are used to reduce infant mortality, reduce adolescent pregnancy, support screening and health assessments for children, prenatal and postnatal care, and more. KDHE’s first amount received is $1,430,306.This funding is provided by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021. Each year, Dr. Marshall supports robust funding for this program and similar programs – Healthy Start, Safe Motherhood and Infant Health, and the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network – that seek to improve maternal and child health. For more information on how this program helps Kansans, click here. ###"

Wyandotte Center in Kansas City, Kan., received nearly $4 million in funding.  “Increasing Kansans’ access to behavioral health services is absolutely vital,” said Senator Marshall. “The public health emergency has heightened needs as people struggle with isolation and stress, so it is more important than ever to ensure our communities have mental health resources for their residents.”Background: Funding was provided under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 to expand patient access to mental health and addiction treatment services. Specifically, CCBHCs provide crisis care, residential treatment, medications for serious mental illness, outpatient mental health and primary care services, and community re-entry support.CCBHCs have proven to reduce hospital emergency services by providing timely access to coordinated care, and they have also provided aid to local law enforcement agencies by providing 24 hour mental health crisis response.The 2021 Report of the Special Committee on Kansas Mental Health Modernization Reform listed funding and accessibility for certified community behavioral health clinics as a top priority to improve integrated care for mental illness or substance use disorders.Below is a list of the CCBHCs awarded in Kansas and the award amount:###"
https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-continues-to-push-back-on-the-job-killing-paris-climate-agreement/,"(Washington, D.C., February 22, 2021) – U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. joined Senators Marsha Blackburn and Steve Daines to introduce legislation to prohibit U.S. taxpayer dollars from being used to rejoin the job-killing Paris Climate Agreement. He also joined them to introduce a Senate resolution calling on President Joe Biden to submit the Paris Agreement to the Senate for review as required under the Constitution.“The Paris Agreement is a bad deal for America and a bad deal for Kansas. The deal will kill jobs and raise the price of energy, hurting Americans when many are struggling to stay on their feet. It will punish American energy providers with expensive regulations, dole out U.S. taxpayer money to foreign countries, and let China off the hook for their role as the world’s largest polluter,” said Senator Marshall. “This bill and resolution will ensure not a single dime of American’s hard-earned money goes toward the Paris Climate Agreement.”BACKGROUND:In 2019, Heritage Foundation analysts studied what would happen if the United States stayed in the Paris Agreement and found there would be an overall loss of nearly 400,000 jobs, half of which would be in manufacturing. The Heritage analysis also found the Paris Agreement would result in an average total income loss of more than $20,000 for a family of four; and an aggregate GDP loss of over $2.5 trillion.###"

For 48 of the past 50 years, Kansas has had a voice on the Senate Ag Committee. Why? Because agriculture is the No. 1 industry in Kansas and is responsible for 40% of the state’s economy. This assignment will keep Kansas’ voice at the table to help ensure our farmers, ranchers and producers remain profitable and our rural communities prosperous.Where I’m from people work per acre, not per hour. My earliest and fondest memories growing up were spending time on our family farm. While it’s true growing up a Kansas farm boy is mostly having fun, I learned some of life’s most important lessons: an appreciation for the land and environment, a hard work ethic, and the value of a strong handshake. Those life lessons will guide my work in the Senate Ag Committee, and here are just some of the priorities I have my sights set on:First, we have to stay on top of our push to reduce the regulatory burden on famers and ensure the new administration doesn’t increase this burden. We made great strides in the previous administration on this front—whether it was repealing Waters of the United States rule or waiving electronic logging device mandates—and we can’t afford to go backward and hamper Kansas farmers, ranchers and producers with bureaucratic red tape.Second, I will work with the new administration and my colleagues to advance the mission of free and reciprocal trade in order to open new international markets for Kansas farmers and ranchers. With the China Phase One Deal, the Japan Free Trade Agreement, and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, we’ve modernized nearly 50% of our export markets. We must enforce our existing agreements and continue to seek new export opportunities around the globe.Third, we must continue to fully protect and preserve crop insurance. I’ve seen first-hand how harsh Mother Nature has been on our Kansas producers, and during these times we must ensure our producers continue to have access to crop insurance and other tools. Quite frankly, securing the next farm bill starts now.Fourth, we must do everything we can to continue the revitalization of rural communities in Kansas and expand cleaner, more affordable options at the pump—support for our biofuel producers will do just that. The 10 biofuel plants operating in Kansas utilize corn, sorghum and soybeans to produce clean-burning fuel, while contributing to the economic health of rural communities across the state. Under the previous administration we made great strides to increase demand, both domestically and abroad, and grow consumer access to biofuels with common sense regulatory adjustments. We must continue this work in the new administration.Fifth, we have to make progress so consumers can be sure that the meat products they are buying are indeed real meat. Consumers should be able to rely on the information on food labels they see on the shelves to be truthful and not deceptive. For years now, alternative protein products have confused many consumers with misleading packaging and creative names for products. I will continue to advocate for greater transparency in labeling to protect terms like “meat” and “beef” and help consumers better differentiate real meat from non-meat products. Additionally, on the meat front, local butchers and small meat processors who have state-inspected facilities and the livestock producers who use their services should have better access to consumers across the country. I will push for changes to provide those producers with more options to market directly to consumers across state lines.Sixth, while we must continue to secure our borders, we need to make common sense reforms for our immigrant agricultural workers. We can do both. The previous administration finalized H2A visa changes making that program more flexible and efficient. However, the current system still is not workable for dairy farms and livestock producers needing year-round help. I will work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help get legal ag workers our producers back home need for continued success.And finally but certainly not least, we must continue to invest in rural communities by deploying more broadband across rural Kansas. My parents grew up in an era when 160 acres of good Kansas land, hard work, and a sharp pencil could support a family. But today’s producer has to be as much of a sharp business person as they are a mechanic, a master of technology, and a soothsayer of the markets. They’ve turned the pencils into high tech precision agriculture, and in order to remain successful, they need access to a fast and reliable broadband connection. Whether it’s a farmer out on his combine at dawn, a small business owner working on payroll, or a child virtually learning, increasing the availability and quality of broadband for rural areas is critical to keep Kansans connected and economically viable.It is crucial that those of us in Washington do absolutely everything in our power to provide farmers, ranchers, and producers with the tools necessary so that they can continue to feed, fuel, and clothe this nation and the world. The vastness of Kansas agriculture can’t be overstated, and I look forward to providing leadership for all Kansans on this important committee.Roger Marshall, M.D., is a U.S. senator for Kansas.###"
https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-announces-funding-for-university-of-kansas-medical-center/,"(Washington, DC, February 19, 2021) – Today, U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. announced the University of Kansas Medical Center received more than $338,000 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to examine liver recovery following an overdose of Acetaminophen, a common over-the-counter drug.“Acute liver failure is caused by one of the most common over-the-counter drugs, and could potentially affect anyone if not taken as directed.” said Senator Marshall. “It’s alarming that something as common as acetaminophen can be misused or that its active ingredients be underestimated. As a physician and a proud alumni of the University of Kansas School of Medicine, I am very hopeful that this research will lead to other life-saving antidotes and reduce the need for liver transplants.”Background: Over the next four years, researchers at the University of Kansas Medical Center will study how other therapeutics can improve liver recovery following an Acetaminophen overdose. Acetaminophen is a common over-the-counter medication used to treat minor aches and pains, and reduce fever. It is generally safe when taken as directed. However, overdosing on this drug is the leading cause of acute liver injury and the most common cause of acute liver failure nationwide. When overdose symptoms start, patients must seek emergency or intensive care.The current antidote was last developed in the 1970s and is effective if administered early, but its efficacy decreases if given beyond eight hours after an overdose. If left untreated beyond eight hours and liver failure occurs, patients may require a liver transplant. Currently, the need for transplants far exceeds supply. These researchers will examine how other available therapeutics can trigger a faster immune reaction to induce liver regeneration and recovery and save lives.In total, the University of Kansas Medical Center received $338,800.###"

You may click HERE to read Senator Marshall’s letter in its entirety.“I appreciate the dedication of officials in Kansas to ensuring our businesses and residents have the natural gas and propane needed to continue powering their homes and businesses through this cold weather. While we continue to do all we can at the federal level to confirm no foul play or price gouging has occurred and to support our utility companies and community leaders as they work diligently to keep Kansans warm, I believe it is prudent to exam the reliability, resiliency, and affordability of electricity and natural gas when the system is stressed,” said Senator Marshall. “The Midwest and Great Plains have seen cold weather before. Electricity generators and natural gas producers in the north consistently operate in extreme cold weather. The ultimate questions become, ‘Why weren’t we prepared’” and ‘What can we do to ensure this doesn’t happen again?’”Background:The current cold weather impacting much of the Midwest and eastern U.S. has put extreme pressures on the nation’s natural gas and propane supply. Natural gas is the state’s largest energy source, accounting for more than 30 percent of the state’s portfolio. Kansas maintains a robust natural gas storage system, which has been tapped to fill elevated demand. Additionally, freezing conditions have prevented new energy generation in many sectors, putting further pressure on the state’s utility companies. Energy costs are expected to increase in the coming days as demand continues to outpace supply. Text of Senator Marshall’s letter:February 18, 2021The Honorable Joe Manchin, ChairmanSenate Committee on Energy & Natural Resources304 Dirksen Senate BuildingWashington, DC 20510The Honorable John Barrasso, M.D., Ranking MemberSenate Committee on Energy & Natural Resources304 Dirksen Senate BuildingWashington, DC 20510Chairman Manchin and Ranking Member Barrasso,For more than a week, Kansas has experienced record-breaking cold temperatures with ice and snow accumulating over much of the state. Temperatures have set new record-lows and multiple cities in Kansas have set new days-below-freezing records. Additionally, multiple states across the Great Plains and Midwest have also endured unseasonably cold temperatures and continued freezing conditions.Kansas Governor Laura Kelly issued a state disaster declaration and the Kansas Corporation Commission issued an emergency order directing utilities to do everything possible and necessary to ensure continued delivery of electricity, natural gas, and propane to Kansas customers. Kansas companies have seen their power cut and Kansans have experienced rolling blackouts.I respectfully request that the Senate Committee on Energy & Natural Resources hold a hearing to exam the reliability and resiliency of the electric grid in extreme weather events like the arctic blast. More specifically, I believe it is prudent to exam the affordability of electricity and natural gas when the system is stressed. The Midwest and Great Plains have seen cold weather before. Electricity generators and natural gas producers in the north consistently operate in extreme cold weather. The ultimate questions become, “Why weren’t we prepared?” and “What can we do to ensure this doesn’t happen again?”Thank you for your time and consideration.Sincerely,Roger Marshall, M.DUnited States Senator###"

I am the luckiest person on earth to have him as one of my greatest role models, a mentor, and a dear friend.“Most every day as I walk the halls of the Capitol, I recognize the boots I wear now, were once worn by Senator Dole and on days like this, those boots look mighty large. From his signature legislation for people with disabilities, to helping feed hungry children at schools in impoverished nations across the world, he has been a positive influence for our nation and the world.“I have zero doubt in my mind Senator Dole will take this challenge head on the same way as other challenges he faced in his life. Just as he did as one of the heroes from our greatest generation, in this battle, Senator Dole will continue to show us the way through hope, resiliency, and perseverance. “Senator Dole, just as you taught me that when there is ‘any problem too big, just go listen to the people of Kansas,’ please know that the state we both love is behind you, and Laina and I and my entire family of course are behind you. We join all of Kansas in praying for God’s comfort and His healing hand, and peace for you, for Elizabeth, for Robin, and for your entire family during this difficult time.”###"
https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-15-per-hour-minimum-wage-would-kill-kansas-jobs/,"(Washington, D.C., February 25, 2021) – U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D., a member of the Senate Small Business Committee, joined his Senate colleagues yesterday at a press conference to discuss the recent job-killing Democrat proposal to increase the minimum wage nationwide to $15 per hour. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, a $15 per hour federally mandated minimum wage would kill 1.4 million jobs. An additional study found that it would increase child care costs on average by 28% per year for Kansas families. Another study found that Kansas is projected to lose 34,000 jobs by 2027 due to a $15 per hour minimum wage. You may click HERE or on the image below to watch Senator Marshall’s remarks.Excerpts of Senator Marshall’s Remarks:“…Like some of my friends, Tim and Joni and John said, my first job was also working for minimum wage at a sale barn. $1.60 an hour in 1976. That’s right. I was scooping cow manure for a $1.60 an hour. But within a month’s time, I worked myself up. I got a dime raise. I worked with about 15 other high school classmates through high school and junior college with a great part time job, and it was a great supplement to my income and helped me not have any debt when I finished college as well… What you can buy with the dollar in Kansas is different than what you could buy with the dollar in New York City, just like Cynthia said. So one size doesn’t fit all. I think that’s very, very obvious… What frustrates me, though, is issues like this take our eye off the real ball. This long, cold, dreary winter is almost over. I can see spring coming. There’s so much great news out. Our economy is recovering. Our unemployment in Kansas is around 4% across the nation it’s around 6%. We’re predicting a GDP growth this quarter of over 9%. Great healthcare news out there in the past week, we discovered that our vaccines with one shot gives you have 75% to 80% vaccination rates to protect people from the virus. We could have herd immunity by April or May if our president’s team does their job and our local governors do their jobs. That’s what we need to get this economy going and this country going again is getting shots and people’s arms, getting people back to work and getting our kids back in school. That’s where our focus needs to be right now.”###"
https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/icymi-marshall-presses-becerra-on-abortion-drugs-covid-19-is-no-excuse-for-sloppy-medicine/,"(Washington, D.C., February 24, 2021) – Yesterday, U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. pressed President Joe Biden’s nominee to be U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), Xavier Becerra on his radical stance on abortion and in particular his efforts to increase access to chemical abortion drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Senator Marshall in response fired back saying, “COVID is not an excuse for sloppy medicine.” You may click HERE or on the image below to watch the exchange.Marshall Presses Becerra on Abortion Drugs: ‘COVID-19 is No Excuse for Sloppy Medicine’National ReviewFebruary 23, 2021Brittany BernsteinCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra defended his previous efforts to increase access to chemical abortion drugs amid the coronavirus pandemic during his confirmation hearing to become Health and Human Services secretary on Tuesday.Senator Roger Marshall (R., Kansas), who is an OB/GYN, questioned Becerra’s support for “removing current safety regulations” that require people to obtain abortion drugs in-person. The senator said that while he had never prescribed RU-486 himself, he had cared for people suffering from its complications in the emergency room.In March, Becerra led a coalition of 21 attorneys general in asking the FDA to increase access to reproductive telehealth care, including lifting the in-person restriction on chemical abortion, the most common method of abortion in the first ten weeks of pregnancy.He asked for Becerra’s position on the issue, adding that he has concern for both the physical and emotional care of anyone who has taken RU-486, also known as mifepristone, one of two drugs used in chemical abortions.“These drugs do have serious complications,” Marshall added. “I do want women to have access to family planning but RU-486 very much concerns me.”“When I took action along with many of my state agent colleagues it was to try to make sure that all Americans had access to the care they needed without having to worry about COVID becoming a danger,” Becerra replied. “The fact that we are able to dispense care without having to have our families actually show up at the doctor’s office now through telehealth and other means is something we should really build on and any obstacles to getting safe care should be removed.”“Our letter that we directed on RU-486 was to make sure that women who wanted to take advantage of health services that they had within their reach didn’t have to do so through risking the contraction of COVID in order to get that healthcare,” he said. “That was the purpose of that letter, was to make sure that like any American we don’t jeopardize the health through the contracting of COVID for Americans who need to access certain care.”Marshall shot back that while he is “in favor of telemedicine” that “COVID is not an excuse for sloppy medicine.”The restriction on RU-486, also called mifepristone, has been the subject of a months-long battle.“As communities across the nation shelter in place to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, we must ensure that women can continue to safely access essential health services including safe and legal abortion,” Becerra said in a statement in March 2020. “Forcing women to unnecessarily seek in-person reproductive healthcare during this public health crisis is foolish and irresponsible. That’s why we’re calling on the Trump Administration to remove red tape that makes it more difficult for women to access the medication abortion prescription drug.”The in-person requirement was initially suspended by a federal judge in July in response to a lawsuit by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.In August, Becerra joined an amicus brief supporting the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other groups in opposing the FDA’s motion for stay of the district court ruling halting the in-person restrictions.“It’s 2020, not 1920 – the FDA needs to join the 21st century and remove barriers to telehealth services, including care that women rely on for safe and legal abortion,” Becerra said in a statement then. “The FDA’s restrictive policy on Mifepristone targets women — and only women — forcing them to go in person to a doctor’s office to retrieve their prescription. These restrictions are dated and unnecessarily put women in harm’s way during this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. We’re proud to fight against these draconian restrictions and protect women’s healthcare, including the right to safe and legal abortion.”However, the Trump administration appealed the July ruling to the Supreme Court. Though the high court first declined to intervene in October, it voted 6-3 in January to reinstitute the restrictions.Now Democrats are urging the Biden administration to end restrictions on chemical abortions.Democrats on the House Oversight Committee earlier this month called on the Food and Drug Administration to “immediately eliminate” the in-person restriction. Some abortion-rights groups have called on the agency to permanently lift the restrictions.###"
https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/marshall-cassidy-smith-introduce-legislation-to-lower-prescription-drug-costs/,"(Washington, D.C., February 24, 2021) – U.S. Senators Roger Marshall, M.D., Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), and Tina Smith (D-MN) today introduced the Ensuring Innovation Act, which will help lower prescription drug prices. The legislation will provide clarity for drug exclusivity to prevent awarding market exclusivity to products that do not represent true innovation and unduly delay cheaper generics from entering the market.“As a physician, and now a U.S. Senator, I believe innovation and competition can have a profound impact on driving down the cost of health care,” said Senator Marshall. “The current regulatory landscape unnecessarily delays patient access to FDA-approved generics. Our bipartisan legislation ensures affordable life-saving medicine while preserving innovation for cutting-edge medicine.”“We must lower prescription drug costs. We can do this by increasing competition and closing loopholes which prevent generics from reaching the marketplace. This bill does both,” said Dr. Cassidy.“High prescription drug prices are forcing too many families to choose between the medications they need and other necessities, like groceries or rent,” said Senator Smith. “In this moment, as we navigate the public health and economic crisis of COVID-19, it’s especially important that we stand up for Americans who are struggling to afford life-saving prescription drugs. The bipartisan Ensuring Innovation Act makes clear that true innovation means taking steps to make medications more effective for Minnesotans and all Americans, and focusing on driving down costs for consumers.”Background:Currently, the FDA grants five years of exclusivity to drug products that are determined to be a New Chemical Entity (NCE). In order to be an NCE, a drug product must contain an “active moiety” that has not been used in a product previously approved by the FDA. This legislation will codify the FDA’s current “active moiety” approach to granting NCE exclusivity.###"

Whether it’s a farmer out on his combine at dawn, a small business owner working on payroll, or a child virtually learning, increasing the availability and quality of broadband for rural areas is critical to keep Kansans connected and economically viable.It is crucial that those of us in Washington do absolutely everything in our power to provide farmers, ranchers, and producers with the tools necessary so that they can continue to feed, fuel, and clothe this nation and the world. The vastness of Kansas agriculture can’t be overstated, and I look forward to providing leadership for all Kansans on this important committee.Roger Marshall, M.D., is a U.S. senator for Kansas.###"
https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-and-rep-davids-call-on-ferc-to-consider-gov-kellys-emergency-request/,"(Washington, D.C., February 22, 2021) – Today, U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. and U.S. Congresswoman Sharice Davids sent a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Chairman, Richard Glick asking him to consider expeditiously Governor Laura Kelly’s emergency request to protect Kansans from the potentially severe economic consequences following the arctic blast last week. Additionally, they asked Chairman Glick to review all relevant circumstances of this situation and take the necessary steps needed to address this crisis, and take timely steps to see that energy service is reliable and affordable no matter the freezing temperatures. In part, the letter reads:“The prolonged and widespread cold put outsized pressure on our nation’s natural gas supply… Governor Kelly, the Chairman of the KCC, and other Commissioners of the KCC have now submitted a request with the goal of protecting customers from the potentially severe economic consequences of this event. In Kansas, we are especially concerned that energy service is reliable and affordable.  We are keen to ensure that the integrity of energy markets is never compromised. We ask you to consider her request expeditiously. We also request that you review all relevant circumstances of this situation and take the necessary steps needed to address this crisis, and take timely steps to see that it does not recur.”Full Text of Letter:February 23, 2021The Honorable Richard Glick, ChairmanFederal Energy Regulatory Commission888 First Street, NEWashington, D.C. 20426Dear Chairman Glick,For more than a week, Kansas and multiple states across the Great Plains and surrounding region was hit with an arctic blast, with temperatures in Kansas setting new record-lows. The prolonged and widespread cold put outsized pressure on our nation’s natural gas supply. On February 8, natural gas traded for $3 MMBTus. On the 17th, that number ranged between $129 and $622 MMBTus. That put costs at more than 2000% to 20,000% their normal levels. Natural gas makes up more than a third of Kansas’s energy portfolio, making it a primary source of energy for many Kansas homes and businesses.Kansas Governor Laura Kelly issued a state disaster declaration and the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) issued an emergency order directing utilities to do everything possible and necessary to ensure continued delivery of natural gas, propane and electricity to Kansas customers. Kansas companies had their power cut and Kansans experienced rolling blackouts.Governor Kelly, the Chairman of the KCC, and other Commissioners of the KCC have now submitted a request with the goal of protecting customers from the potentially severe economic consequences of this event. In Kansas, we are especially concerned that energy service is reliable and affordable.  We are keen to ensure that the integrity of energy markets is never compromised. We ask you to consider her request expeditiously. We also request that you review all relevant circumstances of this situation and take the necessary steps needed to address this crisis, and take timely steps to see that it does not recur.Thank you for your attention to this matter and timely consideration of Governor Kelly’s request. Please call or write our offices should you need additional information, or if we can be of further assistance.Sincerely,Roger Marshall, M.D.United States SenatorSharice DavidsU.S. RepresentativeCc: Commissioner ChatterjeeCommissioner DanlyCommissioner ClementsCommissioner Christie###"
https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/marshall-moran-estes-laturner-mann-state-leaders-call-on-governor-to-improve-response-times-to-kansans-filing-for-unemployment/,"(Washington, D.C., February 26, 2021) – Today, U.S. Senators Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-Kan.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and U.S. Representatives Tracey Mann (KS-01), Jake LaTurner (KS-02) and Ron Estes (KS-04) joined Kansas President of the Senate Ty Masterson and Kansas Speaker of the House Ron Ryckman to call on Kansas Governor Laura Kelly to utilize available resources already provided by Congress to improve the Kansas Department of Labor’s (KDOL) response times to Kansans filing for unemployment insurance.“The Kansas Congressional Delegation has worked steadily in good faith with KDOL staff and followed their directives regarding where to send referrals,” the GOP delegation wrote. “We are very concerned to hear your office has ignored many unemployment benefit referrals sent over by our offices. The fact of the matter is Kansans’ livelihoods have been put on the line during the upheaval caused by the department’s instability with four different leaders over the past year, the false narrative that additional federal funding will solve the current issues, and playing politics rather than problem-solving. When Kansans are getting evicted from their homes or are unable to purchase groceries and are calling for help but receiving none, it is evident something must change immediately.“Governor Kelly, you told the State Finance Council on June 16, 2020 that you considered the Kansas unemployment trust fund to still be in a strong position, with $800 million remaining, and the federal government has consistently refilled state unemployment funds throughout the pandemic,” the GOP delegation continued. “It is not a solution to continue throwing money in a direction where the process is the problem. According to a House Oversight Committee report released on February 12, Kansas’ Executive Office still has $218 million unspent from the coronavirus relief packages passed last year, further showing Kansas is not in imminent need of additional resources.”The GOP delegation’s full letter to the governor can be found here and below.Dear Governor Kelly,As we approach nearly a year since COVID-19 arrived in Kansas, we are deeply troubled by the fact that many Kansans are still facing extreme difficulties receiving their unemployment benefits from the Kansas Department of Labor (KDOL). Our offices are fielding urgent pleas for assistance from constituents who, through no fault of their own, are finding themselves without the means to pay their bills. Kansans filing for unemployment benefits are often facing difficult timelines where lack of immediate assistance results in inability to put food on the table, keep a roof over their head, or pay for lifesaving medications. Kansans cannot continue to wait weeks or months before finally receiving their unemployment benefits from the state.The Kansas Congressional Delegation has worked steadily in good faith with KDOL staff and followed their directives regarding where to send referrals. We are very concerned to hear your office has ignored many unemployment benefit referrals sent over by our offices. In addition, Kansans referred to the new KDOL assistance email address have not been receiving calls back within a week, as promised. Instead, they are being sent emails directing them to call centers where no one is answering the phones. A press release[1] issued by KDOL on February 12, 2021 stated unemployment benefits extended under the Phase IV federal relief package, which was signed into law in December, would begin being distributed no later than February 19. Unfortunately, that date has come and gone without payments being sent to all who had applied.The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was passed by Congress in March 2020 and, among other unemployment provisions, created two major emergency unemployment benefit programs: the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) program and the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program. Together, these initiatives were created specifically to avoid the situation many Kansans are now facing amidst a sluggish job market that continues to be a barrier to steady income. While the federal government was able to quickly provide guidelines and deliver funding to state governments, Kansas remained far behind in processing the unemployment benefits to bank accounts. Kansas, like several other states, was utilizing systems that had not been updated in years and, consequently, was under-equipped to handle the large amounts of processing associated with the CARES Act unemployment benefits. The Coronavirus Relief Fund (CRF), another provision of the CARES Act, sent federal funding directly to states and metropolitan areas for purposes of responding to the COVID-19 public health emergency. The CRF deliberately provided state and local leaders with discretion for determining whether an expenditure from their CRF allocation is in response to the pandemic or not, instead of a rigid, one-size-fits-all approach. Using a portion of the CRF allocation to modernize outdated unemployment processing systems in order to efficiently handle the significant influx of federal unemployment benefits clearly fits within the congressional intent of being a necessary expenditure in response to the COVID-19 public health emergency under Section 5001 of the CARES Act.The federal government acted quickly to ensure state governments had the money necessary to provide the emergency unemployment benefits to those who applied. While some states found themselves struggling immediately with low funds in their unemployment trust funds at the onset of the pandemic, Kansas was not one of them. Governor Kelly, you told the State Finance Council on June 16, 2020 that you considered the Kansas unemployment trust fund to still be in a strong position, with $800 million remaining, and the federal government has consistently refilled state unemployment funds throughout the pandemic. It is not a solution to continue throwing money in a direction where the process is the problem. According to a House Oversight Committee report released on February 12, Kansas’ Executive Office still has $218 million unspent from the coronavirus relief packages passed last year, further showing Kansas is not in imminent need of additional resources.Given the unprecedented increase in individuals filing for unemployment, preventing fraud and identity theft needed to be a high priority to save Kansans from further stress. To address the challenges, last year the Department of Labor provided states with $100 million to combat fraud related to the unemployment benefit programs created under the CARES Act. The funding was permitted to be used to conduct fraud investigations, additional fraud detection-related services and to implement tools to increase prevention, detection and recovery of fraudulent payments in the PUA and PEUC programs. Of the $100 million allocated, Kansas received a total of $1,735,000, with $1,499,400 to be used for PUA and $285,600 for PEUC.The last year has been incredibly difficult for unemployed Kansans, and they are right to be upset at the slow, confusing responses from KDOL. The fact of the matter is Kansans’ livelihoods have been put on the line during the upheaval caused by the department’s instability with four different leaders over the past year, the false narrative that additional federal funding will solve the current issues, and playing politics rather than problem-solving. When Kansans are getting evicted from their homes or are unable to purchase groceries and are calling for help but receiving none, it is evident something must change immediately. In order to provide our constituents with the service they deserve, we suggest a few improvements to KDOL’s current unemployment benefits referral process:Again, our purpose is to ensure Kansans are receiving appropriate care and support from KDOL, which is not being accomplished by the status quo. Thank you for your consideration and we look forward to discussing our suggestions.# # #[1] https://www.dol.ks.gov/docs/default-source/home-page-news/2021/kdol-update-on-pandemic-emergency-unemployment-compensation-implementation.pdf"
https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-announces-usda-rural-development-telemedicine-grant-for-morton-county-health-system/,"(Washington, D.C., February 26, 2021) – Today, U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D announced Morton County Health System, located in Elkhart, was awarded $131,619 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to increase access to telehealth services for over 144,000 residents across eight counties in Kansas as well as patients in counties across four states.“Telehealth is revolutionizing the way we deliver health care. While I still very much value in-person appointments between doctors and patients, telemedicine affords new, efficient opportunities to connect,” said Senator Marshall. “I am committed to making telehealth a viable option, especially for rural communities, through funding for technical infrastructure and broadband connectivity, as well as payment mechanisms that reimburse providers appropriately.”Background:The project, funded through the USDA Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program, provides rural health care providers resources to install and modernize their telecommunications infrastructure to connect patients in remote communities to health care providers across all specialties. Specifically, this grant will serve approximately 144,000 residents in the eight counties in the southwest corner of the state, as well as patients coming from Colorado, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. Morton County Health System will be able to implement telemedicine systems in order to serve patients remotely. In addition to the funds received by USDA, Morton County Health System is contributing $19,750 towards this project.Telehealth can be used for elderly and vulnerable patients to check in with their local doctor remotely, eliminating the risk of exposure to COVID-19 or other illnesses. Telehealth also allows patients and local doctors to consult specialists that are not available in rural communities. CMS has granted additional reimbursement flexibilities for telehealth services in the wake of the COVID-19 public health emergency.###"
https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-announces-6-17-million-grant-for-newton-city-county-airport/,"(Washington, D.C., February 26, 2021) – U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. announced today a $6.17 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation for the reconstruction of existing taxiway pavement at the Newton City-County Airport in Harvey County. Improvements to the taxiway will allow the airport to continue to service both its local and regional business clients. “Municipal airports are an important part of our state’s infrastructure and economic development system,” said Senator Marshall. “The Newton airport is unique not only because of its history as a former air force base, but also because it serves both the local community, defense contractors, and others from the Wichita community. This is a critical piece of the regional infrastructure.”Background:Funding for the reconstruction of the taxiway comes from the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019. The existing runway pavement had reached the end of its useful life, and approximately 8,000 feet of runway pavement will be reconstructed.###"

https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-there-is-no-way-i-can-support-hhs-nominee-xavier-becerra/,"(Washington, D.C., February 25, 2021) – Today, U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. spoke out against President Joe Biden’s nominee to be U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), Xavier Becerra, for his radical views on abortion and for his lack of health care experience. You may click HERE or on the image below to view Senator Marshall’s remarks at this afternoon’s press conference.Senator Marshall also spoke out against Mr. Becerra yesterday on FOX News saying, “He wouldn’t have made it through an interview process in the real world with these types of positions. He really has no experience in health care. He has a $1.2 trillion budget on healthcare and really has zero experience.” You may click HERE or on the image below to watch Senator Marshall’s interview.Earlier this week, Senator Marshall pressed Mr. Becerra on his radical stance on abortion and in particular his efforts to increase access to chemical abortion drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Senator Marshall in response fired back saying, “COVID is not an excuse for sloppy medicine.” You may click HERE or on the image below to watch the exchange.ICYMI: Marshall Presses Becerra on Abortion Drugs: ‘COVID-19 is No Excuse for Sloppy Medicine’ (National Review)Background:Earlier this week, Senator Marshall joined several of his colleagues to introduce the Conscience Protection Act of 2021 to protect healthcare providers, including health insurance plans from government discrimination if they decline to participate in abortions. The Conscience Protection Act also provides a private right of action for victims of discrimination.Currently, if a healthcare provider, including insurance plans, refuses to provide abortions, the only recourse is to file a complaint with HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR). In 2014 California required that health plans must cover abortions, which forced religious employers to offer plans that violate their religious beliefs. In December 2014 under the Obama Administration, HHS opened an investigation, and in spite of then-current laws protecting conscience rights, in June 2016, HHS declared that California could force all its health plans to cover elective abortions, which President Biden’s nominee for HHS Secretary has advocated for and enforced as Attorney General of California.The bill is supported by the Christian Medical & Dental Associations, Concerned Women for America, Ethics and Public Policy Center, The Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, Family Research Council, Freedom2Care, Heritage Action, March for Life, National Right to Life, Susan B. Anthony List, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, and First Liberty.###"
