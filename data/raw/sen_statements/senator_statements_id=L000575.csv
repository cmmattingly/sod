https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/congressional-republicans_irs-should-extend-covid-19-filing-deadline-to-provide-taxpayers-much-needed-relief,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) along with Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-ID), and US House Ways and Means Committee Ranking Member Kevin Brady (R-TX) led Congressional Republicans in a bicameral letter urging Assistant Treasury Secretary for Tax Policy Lily Batchelder and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Charles Rettig to extend the COVID-19 related penalty deadline as taxpayers continue to face frustrating IRS customer service challenges. The Members wrote, “We have heard from both constituents and also large segments of the tax professional community that the deadline is simply too soon for some taxpayers. The Notice only provided 36 days (5 weeks) for self-filers and practitioners to check their records and file any outstanding 2019 and 2020 tax returns.“We therefore urge IRS to extend the Notice 2022-36 relief deadline to provide taxpayers, practitioners, and IRS more time to benefit from the relief, increase voluntary compliance, further reduce the IRS correspondence and paper return processing backlog, and help taxpayers who continue to feel the effects of the IRS’s customer service challenges.”Also joining Lankford, Crapo, and Brady from the Senate Finance Committee include John Barrasso (R-WY), Richard Burr (R-NC), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Rob Portman (R-OH), Steve Daines (R-MT), Bill Cassidy (R-LA). Members who signed from House Ways and Means Committee include Tom Rice (R-SC), Drew Ferguson (R-GA), Darin LaHood (R-IL), Adrian Smith (R-NE), Greg Murphy (R-NC), Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), Mike Kelly (R-PA), Carol Miller (R-WV), Ron Estes (R-KS), Jason Smith (R-MO), David Schweikert (R-AZ), Vern Buchanan (R-FL), Lloyd Smucker (R-PA).Read the full letter HERE or below:Dear Assistant Secretary Batchelder and Commissioner Rettig:While we appreciate that the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has provided some COVID-19 related penalty relief for certain return filers in Notice 2022-36 (Notice), we are writing to request that the deadline of September 30, 2022 for the application of this relief be meaningfully extended, such as through mid-to-late November 2022. We have heard from both constituents and also large segments of the tax professional community that the deadline is simply too soon for some taxpayers. The Notice only provided 36 days (5 weeks) for self-filers and practitioners to check their records and file any outstanding 2019 and 2020 tax returns. For those taxpayers who now realize they must file overdue returns, it will take time to gather information and other supporting documents and complete and file the applicable return, particularly if multiple years are involved. In addition, we have heard from a number of taxpayers who continue to wait for various predicate returns (e.g., an amended individual income tax return) to be processed by the IRS, and who simply cannot file yet.Taxpayer and tax practitioners are already busy during this condensed time period with existing return filing deadlines (such as the September 15 deadline for pass-throughs, September 30 for trusts, and October 15 for individuals and corporations). Inserting a September 30 deadline into this time period creates a significant burden for taxpayers and practitioners that will limit the ability of taxpayers to qualify for relief, increase the compliance and paper-filing burden on the IRS, decrease the number of taxpayers who come into full compliance, and harm taxpayers who are currently prevented from filing their tax returns.Extending the relief deadline through mid-to-late November 2022, with whatever appropriate procedural guardrails are determined to be necessary, would provide needed time for more taxpayers to come into voluntary tax compliance without unduly burdening the IRS. Given that IRS IT e-filing systems are still available during this period before they are shut down for reprogramming for the next filing season, it should also not impair the IRS’s efforts to prepare for and execute the upcoming 2023 tax filing season.We therefore urge IRS to extend the Notice 2022-36 relief deadline to provide taxpayers, practitioners, and IRS more time to benefit from the relief, increase voluntary compliance, further reduce the IRS correspondence and paper return processing backlog, and help taxpayers who continue to feel the effects of the IRS’s customer service challenges.Sincerely,###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/oklahoma-farm-bureau-recognizes-lankford-as-a-friend-of-farm-bureau,"OKLAHOMA CITY, OK – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) was presented the Oklahoma Farm Bureau “Friend of Farm Bureau” award for his leadership in supporting Oklahoma’s farmers and ranchers. He was nominated by the Oklahoma Farm Bureau and was selected by the American Farm Bureau Federation. Lankford participated in an informal ceremony last week and hosted a question and answer session with a few members from the Oklahoma Farm Bureau. “Our Oklahoma farmers and ranchers face way too many obstacles that they can’t control like the weather and big government regulations,” said Lankford. “This year our producers are faced with issues on trade, ongoing drought, high fertilizer prices, and more. It is the noble work of our Oklahoma farmers and ranchers that ensure that Oklahoma and the world are fed and clothed. My family is grateful for our Ag producers every day and the commitment they have to the land and our environment. I am grateful for the ways we get to partner with Oklahoma Farm Bureau to make sure we are fighting the right way on their behalf.”“The prestigious Friend of Farm Bureau award has long been given to members of Congress who understand and protect the important role agriculture plays in our nation,” said Rodd Moesel, Oklahoma Farm Bureau president. “Throughout his time in Washington, DC, Senator Lankford has been a staunch partner to agriculture and rural Oklahoma. His door is always open for discussion of important issues, and he often reaches out personally to hear the thoughts of Oklahoma’s farmers and ranchers. Oklahoma Farm Bureau could not be more proud to present Senator Lankford with the 2022 Friend of Farm Bureau award.”Earlier this year, Lankford joined his colleagues in an effort to eliminate duties on fertilizer imports to quickly remedy high costs before the 2022 planting season. He also pushed back on a proposed rule from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that would have placed unworkable climate disclosure regulations on farmers, ranchers, and agriculture producers, and as inflation soars, Lankford urged federal financial regulators to provide community banks, credit unions, and Farm Credit institutions with the regulatory flexibility they need to responsibly work with their agriculture clients as the profit margins of farmers and ranchers dramatically shrink because of higher input costs. ###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-colleagues-call-on-becerra-hhs-to-stop-illegally-promoting-abortions-for-pregnant-unaccompanied-minors,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) led a letter today along with Senators Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-KS), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Mike Braun (R-IN), and Steve Daines (R-MT) to send a letter to Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Xavier Becerra to share their opposition to HHS’ flagrant disregard for the law by applying “field guidance” that promotes abortion for pregnant unaccompanied alien children (UACs) in US custody, paid for by US taxpayers.The Senators reference the use of Field Guidance #21, which they say the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) under HHS to transfer pregnant minors to ORR facilities in other states in order to go around state laws that protect unborn life.The Senators write in their letter: “It is our understanding that these policies around transportation would require federal personnel to use federally-owned, leased, or contracted vehicles to transport pregnant unaccompanied minors to abortion clinics, wait in the parking lot during the procedure, and then drive the unaccompanied minor back to the ORR facility – all on the taxpayers’ dime… Additionally, it is our understanding that ORR facilitates the distribution of dangerous chemical abortion drugs within federal facilities. To allow vulnerable children in your care to receive dangerous chemical abortion drugs without direct medical supervision within federal facilities is not only a violation of the clear federal funding restrictions placed on ORR facilities, but also a complete dereliction of the duty to ensure the safety of children in your care.”Lankford remains the leading pro-life voice in the Senate to stand up against the Biden Administration’s obsession with abortion, especially after the Supreme Court’s ruling to return decisions about abortions to the people’s elected representatives. The latest episode of Lankford’s podcast, The Breakdown with James Lankford, was a conversation about the pro-abortion lobby spreading false rumors about miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, and what that means for the future of women’s health. Lankford and Marshall recently introduced the No Taxpayer Funds for Illegal Alien Abortions Act to prohibit any employee or contractor with US Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) or the HHS from transporting any illegal immigrant across state lines for the purpose of procuring an abortion.You can read the full letter HERE and below:Dear Secretary Becerra:We write today to express our ardent opposition to the US Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) disregard for the rule of law, which puts unaccompanied children, who are entrusted to the agency’s care, in danger.The unaccompanied children who come to our border must be treated with dignity and respect. When the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) refers these children to HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) for care, US law rightly prioritizes their safety while ORR searches for placement with vetted sponsors.Instead of providing care for each child, HHS has created and depended upon Field Guidance #21, which directs providers to promote and facilitate abortions for pregnant minors in violation of federal law. Since 1976, Congress has included the Hyde Amendment, which restricts HHS from funding elective abortion, on annual appropriations bills that fund the agency. Azar v. Garza is not license for federal staff to use taxpayer dollars, facilities, staff, and other resources to circumvent any state laws that protect life or federal prohibitions on funding abortions.Field Guidance #21 directs ORR staff to submit requests to transfer pregnant minors to ORR facilities in other states in order to circumvent state laws that protect unborn life. The guidance even notes that ground transportation to abortion clinics in neighboring states may be most appropriate in cases where the pregnant minor is past the gestational age in which she can fly safely. We are astounded that we have to explain the horror of driving a pregnant minor, whose unborn child is well past the point of viability, to a state where a provider will perform an elective late-term abortion. Driving a pregnant minor to another state for a late-term abortion is not a legal use of taxpayer dollars.It is our understanding that these policies around transportation would require federal personnel to use federally-owned, leased, or contracted vehicles to transport pregnant unaccompanied minors to abortion clinics, wait in the parking lot during the procedure, and then drive the unaccompanied minor back to the ORR facility – all on the taxpayers’ dime. Depending on the specific ORR facility and state laws concerning abortion, Field Guidance #21 may even require federally-funded transportation that would cross state lines, require hours-long travel, and require overnight accommodations. This is an illegal and offensive use of taxpayer dollars.Additionally, it is our understanding that ORR facilitates the distribution of dangerous chemical abortion drugs within federal facilities. To allow vulnerable children in your care to receive dangerous chemical abortion drugs without direct medical supervision within federal facilities is not only a violation of the clear federal funding restrictions placed on ORR facilities, but also a complete dereliction of the duty to ensure the safety of children in your care. The possible side effects of self-administered chemical abortion drugs include abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, fever, infection, and incomplete abortions that require surgical intervention. No child should take these drugs, especially without a licensed doctor’s supervision.ORR has the responsibility to ensure the safety of some of the world’s most vulnerable children. It is deeply concerning that in a time of such uncertainty and fear, they are entrusted to an agency that prioritizes its pro-abortion agenda over the health and safety of the children in its custody. A child’s referral to ORR is an opportunity to treat them with care while searching for appropriate, vetted sponsors, not an opportunity to encourage the taking of unborn life. Every life is worthy of protection, born or unborn.We urge you to swiftly reverse these illegal and horrific policies. Further, we ask that you thoroughly respond to each of the following questions no later than October 17, 2022.Sincerely,###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-finance-committee-republicans-irs-should-use-massive-funding-boost-to-help-taxpayers-fix-existing-issues,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) joined Senate Finance Committee Republicans to send a letter to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Charles Rettig requesting detailed plans for how the agency will spend the massive $80 billion injection of mandatory funding recently granted to it under the Inflation Reduction Act, including how it will fix existing problems while satisfying the critical need for improved customer service, transparency and accountability.  Rather than vague plans outlined by Treasury to date, the Senators request detailed information on how the IRS will: After strongly opposing the Democrats’ so-called “Inflation Reduction Act,” Lankford spoke on the Senate floor following time in Oklahoma during the August state work period, in which Oklahomans shared their dissatisfaction with Biden’s economic blunders and the hardships they face. Oklahomans continue to share that they are very wary of the potential increases in IRS audits coming for families at all income levels.Lankford published an op-ed in the National Review about the huge influx of IRS workers and what that spells for Americans at all income levels and their federal taxes. Lankford joined Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-ID) and all Finance Committee Republicans to introduce a bill to prevent the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from using its massive, $80 billion infusion of taxpayer dollars to squeeze more revenue out of American taxpayers who earn less than $400,000 per year. You can read the full letter HERE and below:Dear Commissioner Rettig:On August 17, 2022, Treasury Secretary Yellen asked you to work with Treasury’s Deputy Secretary to develop a detailed plan for spending nearly $80 billion in newly enacted mandatory IRS funding, which was part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The deadline for the plan is February 17, 2023.American taxpayers have a right to know exactly how the IRS will spend their money and a right to fair tax administration. As Members of the authorizing Committee charged with oversight responsibilities over both the IRS and Treasury, we are compelled to ask: how will the IRS fix its numerous existing problems while satisfying the critical need for transparency and accountability?Rather than vague plans by Treasury and the IRS on how it may spend $80 billion delivered to it in partisan legislation, we request detailed answers on how the IRS will: (1) prioritize taxpayer services, (2) guard against partisan targeting, (3) protect taxpayer privacy, (4) modernize technology, and (5) track and publish timely and reliable metrics, timelines, and milestones to establish comprehensive transparency and accountability, and allow for meaningful independent oversight.1. Prioritizing taxpayer serviceThese problems are serious and have lasted far too long. In 2021, taxpayers waited at length for their refunds and approximately 250 million calls to the IRS went unanswered. Millions of taxpayers should not wait well over a year for their refund or spend days trying to connect with the IRS. The situation is particularly dire for millions faced with 40-year high inflation and in need of their tax refund to support their families.Service prioritization items to addressThe IRS should use its additional funding to prioritize clearing the backlog of returns and correspondence, and expediently pay taxpayers who are owed a refund. The minimum performance standard should be refunds issued within four to six weeks after receipt of a qualifying paper tax return. The IRS needs to answer its telephones and hold times should average five minutes or less. No taxpayer should ever experience a “courtesy disconnect” from the IRS. These minimum performance standards need to be met to safeguard the integrity of our tax system. It is a fundamental requirement that the IRS timely process returns and refunds, and promptly answer its telephones.2. Stop biased targetingAmericans should be able to trust that the government will enforce the law without regard to political beliefs, religion, or party affiliation. Compared to other government agencies, the IRS has a broad and powerful reach into Americans’ daily lives. The American people have a right to expect the IRS will exercise its power in a fair, neutral, and impartial manner. There should be no hint of religious or political bias or partisanship; the IRS must take this responsibility seriously.Unfortunately, there has been and continues to be greater IRS scrutiny of conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status. This happened in 2010 and 2012, which led to the IRS paying a settlement of $3.5 million to Tea Party Groups. As recently as May 18, 2021, a religious organization was incorrectly denied 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status because it was, according to the IRS, “engaged in prohibited political campaign intervention.” Shockingly and inappropriately, the IRS wrote to the organization that “The bible teachings are typically affiliated with the [Republican] party and candidates. This disqualifies you from exemption under IRC Section 501(c)(3).” The IRS reversed its rejection, but only after significant scrutiny. Such additional scrutiny should be unnecessary if the IRS applies the law in a neutral, unbiased way. Attention by the IRS must also be paid to prohibition of indiscriminate targeting based on financial status.No-targeting items to addressThe IRS should never exercise its authority to chill the First Amendment rights of any American. Given the IRS has received extra appropriations of nearly $80 billion, and with the continuous line of IRS targeting problems, the agency must ensure partisanship is eliminated.We remind the IRS of the prohibition of financial status exams and the history that led to enactment of section 7602(e). Thus, if the IRS intends to draw artificial scrutiny thresholds based on arbitrary income thresholds, it must at least provide metrics to allow independent analysis of whether and how the political thresholds established are enforced.Relatedly, please provide details of the IRS’s plans for implementation of the unenforceable directive by the Treasury Secretary not to use the supersized near-$80 billion of additional appropriations to increase audit chances for households earning $400,000 per year or less, or small businesses, “relative to historic levels.” We request information regarding:3. Privacy protectionThe IRS must hold taxpayer information securely in order to preserve its confidentiality. The law protecting taxpayer information rests on sound principles that evolved from adverse experiences with the misuse of tax information.More than 15 months after the news and advocacy outlet ProPublica began disclosing confidential, private, and legally protected taxpayer information and named particular individuals in an ongoing series of articles, and despite announcements of various inquiries and investigations, nothing is known about the source of the massive leak or hack.In response to Senate Finance Committee inquiries made to the IRS Commissioner of this major data-security breach, the Commissioner responded, “We do not yet know whether there has been a data breach or a threat of a breach.”18 It is remarkable to learn that the IRS and Treasury do not believe there has even been a threat of a breach in light of numerous unchallenged public claims to the contrary by ProPublica.During a recent Senate Finance Committee hearing, when asked about the ProPublica leak, the Secretary of the Treasury replied that the administration had no new developments to report, the leak has been “very damaging,” and the Treasury Department is doing “everything in our power to make sure there is not inappropriate access to such data.” To date, everything in Treasury’s power seems limited to announcements of ongoing investigations.There have been many reasons for concern another leak will happen. Indeed, the IRS and Treasury recently revealed yet another lapse in safeguarding confidential, legally protected private taxpayer information on around 120,000 filers.20 The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) have also recently published reports with specific details on how taxpayer information held by the IRS might be at risk for a data breach from outside or inside.Privacy protection items to addressProPublica Leak: The American people remain in the dark about who was responsible and how it was allowed to happen. Although we understand TIGTA is investigating the leak to ProPublica, the IRS is not a bystander in this “very damaging” event. ProPublica is explicit, it received a “vast trove of Internal Revenue Service data” (emphasis added).Congress and the American people deserve answers from the IRS. We want to know:External threats: The IRS must place a high priority on implementing comprehensive security controls to protect confidential information. TIGTA’s July 18, 2022 annual report provides a valuable starting point.Internal threats: Protecting taxpayer privacy must be a top priority for the IRS.4. Information Technology (IT) modernizationConsidering technology’s importance and potential, the IRA allocates $4.75 billion, or six percent of its total funding, to “business systems modernization.” Returns on technological upgrades, which are presumably productivity enhancing, do not factor into Treasury or IRS discussions of funding and headcount requests for the IRS, at least not in analytically balanced ways.The IRS must carefully manage its investments in its technology infrastructure and make every effort to avoid the problems it has experienced in the past, including. Such failures include:IT items to addressModernizing the IRS’s technology infrastructure must be a top priority. With an additional $4.75 billion of the supersized IRS funding allocated to technological improvements, and with the IRS’s Integrated Modernization Business Plan providing loose sketches of what the IR wants to do and how it plans on doing it, there is room for realizing productivity gains and accompanying improved taxpayer service.Nevertheless, experience dictates a need for vigilance and multiple avenues of oversight because mistakes, such as FATCA IT, mail machines, and return processing, can quickly absorb the $4.75 billion and become another story in the 40-year history of the IRS being unable to modernize its technology.Refinement and clear articulation of metrics and milestones that independent overseers can objectively use for monitoring any IRS IT and/or business plan modernization are required.5. Transparency and accountabilityIn an August 17 letter, Treasury Secretary Yellen acknowledged the necessity for accountability mechanisms by stating the requested plan on utilization of supersized IRS funding “must include metrics for areas of focus and targets over the course of the coming years.” We agree that the IRS needs to be measurable, held accountable and, we would add, independently overseen. However, an IRS funding plan cannot be produced solely for the benefit and interests of one political party, administration, or class of taxpayer. The IRS should be transparent and accountable to all Americans.The IRS needs to report to Congress and the American people clear, reliable metrics for monitoring productivity improvements and related customer service improvements facilitated by its supersized budget.The IRS must be accountable by providing performance metrics that can be independently reproduced and verified by Congress, watchdogs and taxpayers.The IRS should report performance metrics regularly at meaningful intervals. The objectives, milestones, and timelines must be clear so that Congress can regularly monitor progress and quickly identify problems.The IRS must be open, transparent, and responsive in a timely way with oversight from Congress, TIGTA, the National Taxpayer Advocate, and the Comptroller General of the United States.We are concerned about whether the IRS will voluntarily comply with accountability and transparency standards.For example, on September 22, 2021, we learned through TIGTA, not the IRS, that IRS management destroyed 30 million paper-filed information returns without first processing them.Another example was learning from TIGTA about the underwhelming result of the $347 million FATCA IT “investment” discussed above.With an infusion of $80 billion of new funding, the IRS must be accountable, and accountability requires transparency and timely communication with its authorizing Committees. In the interest of learning of and helping shape IRS plans, we must know:How does the IRS propose it will show Congress and the American people that it will proceed by transparently using resources in a fair, neutral and optimal manner, rather than allocating resources in accord with politicized prioritization and policy goals, especially given that funding derived from a partisan legislative process:1. Non-filing taxpayers;2. Cash economy tax evasion;3. So-called gig economy workers;4. COVID-relief fraud and improper payments;5. FATCA enforcement;6. Earned income tax credits;7. American opportunity tax credits;8. Low-income housing tax credits;9. Net premium tax credits;10. Child tax credits (including the enhanced CTC);11. Sick and paid family leave tax credit; and12. Employee retention tax credit.We respectfully request prompt responses, by October 28, 2022, to all of our questions and information requests posed above with attention and details required in your response. We require timely responses, and expect that further inquiries regarding utilization of supersized IRS funding will be forthcoming, as oversight must commensurately increase relative to the outsized IRS funding increase.Sincerely,###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-strongly-opposes-democrats-election-donor-bully-bill,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today voted in strong opposition to the Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light On Spending in Elections (DISCLOSE) Act. The bill failed to advance in the Senate in a vote of 49-49.Originally included in the Democrats’ failed election-takeover bill, the so-called “For the People Act,” the DISCLOSE Act violates privacy rights by requiring organizations to disclose the names and addresses of their donors who give $10,000 or more during an election cycle. The DISCLOSE ACT invites people who disagree with an organization to intimidate donors into not giving. Not only does this raise privacy concerns, it will inevitably chill free speech.“This is now the sixth time the Democrats’ have tried to push their federal takeover of our elections. This bill would subject individual donors across the political spectrum to intimidation with the intent to silence,” said Lankford. “I support transparency and security in our elections, but we all know this bill just makes it easier to ‘dox’ political donors. Even the left-leaning American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) opposes the federal election takeover bill.”Earlier this year, Lankford spoke at length on the Senate floor and released a video to highlight the harm of passing legislation to federalize elections after Democrats’ fifth attempt to pass federal election takeover legislation failed earlier this year. Democrats were willing to blow up the legislative filibuster to pass this legislation. Lankford also pointed out Democrats' hypocrisy by reading their previous statements on protecting the filibuster, including Leader Chuck Schumer and then Senator Joe Biden.   Last year, Lankford strongly opposed the “For the People Act.” Lankford sounded the alarm on Democrats’ so-called “For the People Act” as it was being sold to the American people as necessary to protect election integrity, but is actually a massive federal takeover of state elections. Lankford joined Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to introduce the Don’t Weaponize the IRS Act to prevent the IRS from being used as a political weapon against conservative nonprofits. S.1 would repeal and undermine a Trump Administration rule that prevented the IRS from targeting certain tax-exempt groups based on political beliefs.Lankford and Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK) praised a letter from Oklahoma State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax regarding the dangers he sees posed by S.1 to Oklahoma’s free and fair election process. Lankford spoke on the Senate floor for a second time on the announcement that Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) planned to bring S.1 to the floor. Lankford also wrote an opinion piece to Oklahomans that Democrats’ federal election takeover bill is not “For the People. ###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-opposes-treaty-that-prioritizes-china-over-us,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today issued a statement after he opposed the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. Lankford supported an amendment that clarified China is not a developing country and directed the Biden Administration to work to revise China’s status, which passed by a vote of 96 to 0.“America has been voluntarily participating in reducing emissions of gasses. The focus of the treaty is to phase out certain chemicals—that in America we use in air conditioning units and refrigerators. My concern with this treaty is that it gives China an extra decade than the rest of the world to abide by the guidelines, marks it as a developing country, and sends billions of dollars to Beijing. We should not be shipping money to China. That is absurd. We cannot continue to put China, the worst offender of greenhouse gas emission, ahead of US manufacturing once again.”   ###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/democrats-block-lankfords-move-to-preserve-sanctions-on-iran,"CLICK HERE to watch Lankford’s remarks on YouTube.CLICK HERE to watch Lankford’s remarks on Rumble.WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today took to the Senate floor to ask the Senate to pass by unanimous consent his Iran Sanctions Preservation Act and to outline the importance of combatting the threat posed by the Islamic Republic of Iran and provide solutions on how US policy in the Middle East can address the regime’s support of terrorism, development of ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), human rights violations, and nuclear proliferation. Lankford’s request for unanimous consent to pass his bill was blocked.Lankford’s bill requires that the US maintain current sanctions targeting Iran’s oil industry, financial sector, and supporters of terrorism until Iran suspends all of its destabilizing terrorist activities. The bill would ensure sanctions remain in place until strict conditions are met by Tehran to suspend both its nuclear program and support for terrorism. The bill also expresses support for the people of Iran, who are the greatest victims of the regime’s destabilizing activities.Lankford is a leading voice on countering Iran’s nuclear program and terrorist activity as he continues to strongly oppose the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). He introduced the Iran Sanctions Preservation Act to prevent President Biden from lifting sanctions on the Iranian regime. In May, Lankford spearheaded a successful amendment to block President Biden from lifting sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Iran, requiring sanctions against Iranian oil exports to China.Lankford joined Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) and their colleagues to send a letter to the Department of Justice (DOJ) after Iranians with direct links to the country’s most prominent designated terrorist organization were detained in Argentina early last month. Lankford joined Ernst and fellow co-chairs of the Senate Abraham Accords Caucus, Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) to introduce the Deterring Enemy Forces and Enabling National Defense (DEFEND) Act to develop a strategic approach among countries included in the Abraham Accords, aimed at combatting Iranian aggression in the Middle East.TranscriptWhile we're standing here right now in Washington, DC, in the middle of an afternoon, protests are happening all over Iran right now. The latest news reports coming out from social media and the very limited media that can get out of Iran, massive protests are in the streets of 20 different cities in Iran right now. The latest count is nine people have been killed in those protests by Iranian forces trying to be able to shut down the protests that are now breaking out all over the country, including, by the way, protests in Tehran. What's going on?This has been a simmering issue for a long time in Iran, and as I’ve stated several times on this floor and in committee hearings, our opposition with Iran is not with the Iranian people. The Iranian people live in an oppression underneath the Iranian regime, which pushes their thumb down on them and limits their progress in their world and in their own country.The spark of this latest group of protests that are happening in the streets all over Iran is a young lady who was murdered in police custody in Iran named Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman who died in custody because she broke Iran’s hijab law. In other words, she wasn't wearing her head covering and so—brace yourself—the morality police arrested her, the morality police in Iran, detained her where she was apparently beaten to death while she was in prison.Now, the police and the regime have come out and said she had sudden heart failure, but with multiple injuries around her head, that's not sudden heart failure. And the nation once again of Iran is rising up to say: this has to stop.Americans would be surprised at the number of social media posts that are getting out of Iran right now where large crowds, large crowds are gathering in cities tearing down the pictures of the Ayatollah and chanting in the streets of Tehran, ‘Death to the dictator.’I have friends in Iran that have actually sent me some of the social media posts to be able to show me, this is what the street looks like today. This is breaking out across Iran. Now, what's interesting is at the same time the President of Iran has been allowed to be able to come into the United States, to be at the UN General Assembly, to be able to speak out for the regime's benefit to the rest of the world. He will be a remarkable side-by-side of what's happening in Iran on the streets right now and the Iranian leadership at the UN General Assembly.At this same moment as well, Iran is working with Russia and has delivered hundreds of unmanned aerial vehicles that are weaponized, little kamikaze drones, that are literally taking out Ukrainian artillery right now in the field in Ukraine, because the Iranians haven't just supplied these weaponized drones to Russia, they've brought Russian leaders into Iran to be able to train them on how to be able to attack Ukraine with these weapons.Right now as well, the Russians are calling up additional reservists to be able to fight the Ukrainians and to be able to continue to take the fight to them. Protests are also erupting in Russia right now from Russian moms that are furious that their husbands and their sons are being called up to be able to fight in Ukraine, to replace the thousands of casualties that Russia has suffered in Ukraine.Now, why do I connect the dots on all of these? What's happening in the streets in Russia and in Ukraine? Because at the moment of what's happening, the United States government has partnered with Russian diplomats to negotiate with Iran a restart of the nuclear deal with them. I can't make this up.So the United States is using Russia as its proxy to negotiate with Iran to be able to restart a nuclear negotiation with them. Listen, the JCPOA, this nuclear deal as its commonly called, that was put in place in 2015, was then set aside to say, it is to the accomplishing its purposes.In 2015 when it was put in place, let's just review real quick what happened in the days after that. Plane-fulls, iteral plane-fulls with palates loaded with cash were sent to Iran as soon as this deal was signed. It was a government suddenly flush with cash. How did that regime use that cash? They bought munitions to be able to fight against Americans in Iraq.From 2015 to 2017, that period immediate live the JCPOA was signed and plane-fulls of cash were sent to them, munitions fired against American troops in Iraq increased 341 percent. During that same time period, terrorist incidents increased 183 percent. There were 58 incidents involving Iranian vessels in the Gulf that put American troops at risk.Iran used its money not to be able to help the Iranian people but to attack us and to attack our allies.Our nation withdrew from this nuclear negotiation four years ago. After that happened, Iran’s exports of crude oil declined by more than two million barrels a day, cutting off a major supply of money into the regime. Iran's defense budget was then cut 28 percent because of those revenue shortfalls. Iran's currency lost 70 percent of its value as the pressure was applied to Iran to actually join in to nations around the world, to actually become a nation like the rest of the world.I'm bringing a sense of the Senate today. It's an issue that I brought multiple times. We should have ongoing dialogue with Iran. They are ambitious to become a nuclear weapons-capable nation. They are the single-largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. They are the destabilizing force in all of the Middle East. Every nation in that entire region has to prepare themselves for an inevitable, erratic, irrational attack from Iran, and every nation fears the day that they gain a nuclear-capable weapon. With the gaps in the nuclear negotiations are large.Let me list some of them.The nuclear negotiation excludes any conversation about their terrorist activities. It's just simply not limiting their terrorist activities, just limiting their nuclear capability. They're building long-range weapons capable of carrying a nuclear weapon. Why would you need to build a long-range heavy missile unless you're carrying a nuclear tip? The two are connected. Their terrorist activities, their missile ambitions, and their nuclear ambitions, we should connect those in all of our relationships.My amendment and my sense of the senate that I’m bringing is very clear today. One is to acknowledge what we all know is actually happening. The second is to say we cannot have any kind of sanctions relief especially preemptively in negotiation on lifting petroleum sales coming out of Iran. The next section of it, third section of it, is simply not releasing any of the sanctions on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. They are the core of the terrorist activities in the areas. They were the trainers for those that actually attacked Americans in Iraq. We should not lift sanctions on them.The fourth on this is not providing relief to the financial institutions in Iran so that they can’t continue to extend their terrorist activities and their financial activities behind the scenes. The goal of this is to be able to put pressure on the regime but to protect the Iranian people as much as possible.The final statement that's in this sense of the Senate is to affirm our long-term friendship with the people of Iran and our understanding that they are living under the thumb of this regime.My friend that I had mentioned before that is from Iran has reached out to me in the last 24 hours with this simple question: the Iran people are on the streets trying to gain their freedom, trying to be able to speak and live their faith as they choose to. And here's his question: what are the Americans going to do to stand with us? That is a fair question for this body.The Iranian people that are begging for their own freedom do not want the American response to be sending cash to the regime so they can oppress their people more or lifting the sanctions at this moment so that the regime can continue to advance its terrorist activities or just disengaging from its missile ambitions that destabilizes the region or to be able to continue to be able to use Russia as a proxy for the united states of America while Russia is literally using Iranian drones to attack the Ukrainians.Let's speak with a clear voice to the Iranian people on the streets. They want to hear the United States say we stand with your passion for freedom, not we stand with the regime and what they're trying to do to you.###"

This includes the US Constitution, Declaration of Independence, and the Bill of Rights. The letter demands that the alert be removed from the website immediately and presses for answers on NARA’s ideologically-motivated task force report. Lankford sent a letter to the current Archivist Ferriero to press him to continue to respect the rule of law and not unilaterally ratify the Equal Rights Amendment to the US Constitution. Lankford and his colleagues asked the Archivist to stand strong against, “ridiculous calls to ignore clear guidance from both the court and the Department of Justice and to unilaterally certify the ERA.”Lankford also continues to block nominees to the DC Courts until he receives a response to his letter to DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, Chief of the DC Metropolitan Police Department Robert Contee, and US Attorney General Merrick Garland regarding what legal action is being taken following a truly gut-wrenching and gruesome report of five babies whose lives were taken through late-term abortion in Washington, DC.ExcerptsOn the Archivist’s role in the ratification of the Equal Rights AmendmentLankford: Thank you for your very clear statements both to our staff in writing and to Senator Portman that the issue with the ERA is settled by the federal courts or by Congress, not by the Archivist…We want to make that very clear because obviously there were Members of Congress that have a disagreement on that. The previous Archivist disagreed and said, ‘No This is not the role of the Archivist to unilaterally make that decision.’ You’ve obviously agreed with that publicly, and I appreciate your engagement on that.On warning labels used on the National Archives website for our Founding documentsLankford: …[The Archives website] warns Americans or anyone reading our documents that there’s potentially harmful content. That this content could be offensive to individuals, whether it’s the United States Constitution or whether it’s autopsy photos from World War II. It doesn’t matter. It’s on everything, is that warning piece on that banner on it. My question to you in our conversation was, I don’t want it to be misunderstood in any way that the National Archives could consider the United States Constitution a potentially offensive document, which clearly it’s a Founding document. It’s not offensive. There are bits of our history that all of us as Americans look back on and are embarrassed who we were as Americans and decisions we have made. We don’t always get it right over our history, but we are working to make a more perfect union. But all of our history is our history. The important thing to me is there’s never a label on a single document and we reconsider labelling some of our documents ‘offensive,’ when they’re just our history on this…On the Archives’ role in the raid on President Trump’s Florida home.Lankford: …In an unusual situation, it wasn’t just the FBI carrying out the raid, but it was a request of the National Archives to be able to engage with these records to then trigger something with the FBI. Typically this would be a voluntary conversation. It’s my understanding that you’ve had dialogue with our staff to say all of your preferences of any disagreements in this document, this should be a voluntary conversation, rather than a legal conversation or a raid. A raid of a former president’s house is unprecedented, and it puts the entire process on full display to be able to say: how does this happen? Why does this happen? Everyone gets questions on it.###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/passed-lankford-rubio-effort-to-authorize-vital-commission-aimed-at-supporting-religious-freedom-internationally-,"WASHINGTON, DC – The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), created by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, is a bipartisan commission that monitors and reports on religious freedom internationally. The commission’s authorization is currently set to expire September 30, 2022. Less than two weeks before USCIRF’s authorization expires, the US House of Representatives passed Senator James Lankford (R-OK) and Senator Marco Rubio’s (R-FL) United States Commission on International Religious Freedom Reauthorization Act of 2022, which reauthorizes USCIRF through fiscal year 2024. The bill now heads to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law. Senators Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Jim Risch (R-ID), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Chris Coons (D-DE) joined Lankford and Rubio in introducing the bill.“USCIRF does invaluable work to help our nation protect and promote the unalienable human right of religious freedom for all people of every faith around the world. I’m glad to see the House finally take up/pass my bill to reauthorize this commission,” said Lankford“I’m grateful the House has voted to reauthorize USCIRF’s mission and reaffirm the importance of religious freedom everywhere. USCIRF does phenomenal work defending this sacred right around the globe, but its authorization will expire in just a matter of days. President Biden must sign our bill immediately,”  said Rubio “The House passage of our USCIRF reauthorization bill is an important step in ensuring the United States can properly promote religious freedom around the globe and investigate violations, including the persecution of Yazidis, Baha’is, Christians, and others in the Middle East, genocide of Uyghurs in China, and attacks on Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia. I hope the president will sign this legislation into law quickly,” said Risch “The United States has a long tradition of promoting religious freedom abroad, and this Commission is dedicated to advising Congress and the Executive Branch about how to successfully ensure religious freedom is protected and that religion is not exploited to justify human rights abuses. As the global refugee crisis worsens, the United States must do more to address the scourge of religious persecution, including holding perpetrators accountable and providing a safe haven to refugees. It’s heartening to see Congress come together on this pressing issue to ensure that the Commission can effectively fulfill its mission,” said Durbin“I’m proud to have worked to protect international religious freedom by passing the USCIRF Reauthorization in the Senate on a bipartisan basis, and I’m glad that our House colleagues have finally passed and sent the bill to President Biden for his signature. Around the world, communities like the Rohingya in Burma, Christians in Nigeria, and Uyghurs in China face horrific attacks because they practice their human right to freedom of religion. The United States is built on the founding value of religious freedom, and we must continue to work with our international partners to ensure the global community enjoys the same opportunity to peacefully worship,” said Coons ###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-blackburn-lummis-recommend-pulling-national-teachers-union-charter-for-pushing-woke-ideology,"WASHINGTON, DC – Following nationwide scandals about teachers' unions spying on parents, going on strike, and fighting to keep schools closed, Senator James Lankford (R-OK) joined Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) to introduce legislation to end the National Education Association (NEA)’s federal charter. Representatives Scott Fitzgerald (R-WI) and Jim Banks (R-IN) introduced a version of this bill in the House of Representatives.“As the son of a teacher and someone who really appreciated the teachers in my life and my children’s lives, I get incredibly frustrated when our schools get distracted by social issues and become political proving grounds,” said Lankford. “Oklahoma parents are tired of the woke ideology being pushed on their kids and the progressive values being forced into our schools by a giant teachers union, the National Education Association. The NEA created an ‘enemies list’ of parents willing to stand up to their tactics, and they work lockstep with the Biden Administration for their policy agenda. Unions should protect and preserve workers’ rights and speak out for the benefit of their members, not push a political agenda on our kids. The NEA is the only federally chartered union; it’s time to hold them to account.”“Over the past few years, teachers’ unions have demonstrated they will put their political priorities ahead of student wellbeing every chance they get,” said Blackburn. “The NEA is by all accounts a political organization and should not be rewarded for their left-wing activism with a federal charter.”“The National Education Association used to stand up for students. Unfortunately, it is now a federally chartered fundraising group for the Democratic National Committee. Students and parents in Wyoming deserve better than the NEA having a congressional seal of approval for its political efforts. Every other special interest group operates without a federal charter, and the NEA should be no different. Thank you to Senator Blackburn for leading this effort,” said Lummis.“The NEA is basically a partisan lobbying arm for the DNC that irreparably harmed students during the COVID pandemic and continues to push anti-American ideologies in classrooms. Congress shouldn’t condone its misbehavior. I’d like to thanks Senator Blackburn for leading Rep. Fitzgerald’s and my initiative in the Senate,” said Banks. “The National Education Association has strayed far from its original mission. Rather than supporting students, the NEA consistently put the interests of progressive teachers’ unions over the learning of students. It is time for Congress to say enough is enough and revoke the NEA’s federal charter. I support Senator Blackburn’s companion legislation and appreciate her dedication to putting students first,” said Fitzgerald.A federal charter lends an organization the legitimacy of being sanctioned by the federal government. There are approximately 100 organizations operating under a federal charter. The NEA is the nation’s largest labor union and the only labor union operating under a federal charter. More than a quarter of the NEA’s yearly expenditures are spent on political activities—overwhelmingly favoring Democrats. In California, the teachers’ union spied on parents who advocated to reopen schools.Lankford recently stood up against the NEA for proposing the creation of an “enemies list” at their recent conference based on those who don’t want to teach part of the progressive agenda.###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-finance-committee-republicans-demand-accountability-for-continued-late-release-of-medicare-social-security-trustees-reports,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) joined Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID), Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, to lead Finance Committee Republicans in a letter to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) requesting the agency monitor the managing trustee’s flagrant disregard for statutory deadlines. Required by law, the Medicare and Social Security trustees reports are to be issued no later than April 1, yet the 2021 and 2022 reports were issued August 31 and June 2, respectively. The Biden Administration has repeatedly ignored congressional inquiries as to why the trustees reports have not been submitted in a timely manner. Neither Treasury Secretary Yellen nor the board of trustees have signaled any intent to modify internal procedure regulating management of the report schedule, nor have they adopted previous GAO recommendations to improve communication with Congress. It is the responsibility of the Treasury Secretary to provide these reports to Congress in a timely manner, as required by law, or provide Congress and the American people with explanations for late work.The Senators wrote in their letter, “With respect to reporting on the financial conditions of trust funds, once again this year the reports were issued well beyond the statutory deadline, and there was no process followed by the Managing Trustee for informing the public or members of Congress about the delay or reasons for the delay….Late reporting on financial conditions of important trust funds that support multi-trillion-dollar Social Security and Medicare programs does not seem important to the administration, even in light of the striking decision by the President to politicize the Social Security Administration.”Read the full letter HERE or below:Dear Comptroller Dodaro:The Social Security Act requires that the Boards of Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, as one of their duties, “Report to the Congress not later than the first day of April of each year on the operation and status of the Trust Funds….” Disregarding the law, the 2021 trustees report was not issued until August 31 of last year, the latest issuance date relative to the statutory deadline since at least 1995. Subsequently, the 2022 report was once again issued, on June 2, beyond the statutory deadline. In both instances, the Managing Trustee, who also serves as the Treasury Secretary, provided no meaningful communication to either the public or Congress explaining the delay.The Biden Administration has ignored repeated Congressional inquiries demanding to know why the trustees reports have not been submitted on schedule. Neither the Managing Trustee nor the Boards as a whole have signaled any intent to modify internal processes and procedures, and perhaps even update Board bylaws, to improve (1) the timeliness of the reports’ delivery and (2) the communication with the public and Congress about the status of the reports’ due date.Of note, the Social Security Administration has unfortunately become politicized, as the President chose to remove without cause a Commissioner who had been duly appointed with the advice and consent of the Congress. In addition, there have not been the requisite public trustees to represent the public and help avoid a purely partisan Board composition since the 2015 reports were issued. Because of actions by the current administration, it unfortunately cannot now be said that management and oversight of the Social Security Administration or Medicare has representation from a significant share of the voting population who are not members of one political party.With respect to reporting on the financial conditions of trust funds, once again this year the reports were issued well beyond the statutory deadline, and there was no process followed by the Managing Trustee for informing the public or members of Congress about the delay or reasons for the delay. Your useful report (GAO-21-105413 Timeliness of Trust Fund Reports) of September 30, 2021, reiterated prior GAO recommendations, including that the Secretary of the Treasury, in the secretary’s capacity as the chairperson of the boards, “work with the other trustees to establish a policy to inform congressional committees of jurisdiction when the reports are expected to miss this deadline; we recommend that this outreach include the factors contributing to the delay and the updated expected issuance dates.” While your letter of September 30, 2021, identifies that “Treasury concurred” with GAO recommendations,” there is no evidence of concurrence in practice. For this year’s reports, the Managing Trustee, or her designee, failed to keep the congressional committees of jurisdiction regularly informed of the anticipated report delivery dates. There was no indication that the Boards anticipated missing the statutorily set report due date, nor was there any communication by the Managing Trustee or the boards about delays, let alone reasons for delays. Late reporting on financial conditions of important trust funds that support multi-trillion-dollar Social Security and Medicare programs does not seem important to the administration, even in light of the striking decision by the President to politicize the Social Security Administration.As Congress is increasingly compelled to rely on the Congressional Budget Office’s estimated projections of the financial condition of both the Social Security and Medicare trust funds as a source of nonpartisan, timely analysis, we recommend that GAO continue to monitor the Managing Trustee’s lack of adherence to statutory deadlines and urge significant improvements in transparency and communication with the public and Congress.Sincerely,###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-cornyn-31-senate-republicans-call-for-hunter-biden-prosecutor-to-be-given-special-counsel-authority-,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senators James Lankford (R-OK) and John Cornyn (R-TX), along with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and more than 30 other colleagues, today sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland demanding that U.S. Attorney David Weiss be extended special counsel protections and authorities to conduct the investigation into Hunter Biden: “There is no way of  knowing the entire scope of the investigation, but evidence seems to be mounting that Hunter Biden committed numerous federal crimes, including, but not limited to, tax fraud, money laundering, and foreign-lobbying violations,” the Senators wrote Attorney General Garland.“Given that the investigation involves the President’s son, we believe it is important to provide U.S. Attorney Weiss with special counsel authorities and protections to allow him to investigate an appropriate scope of potentially criminal conduct, avoid the appearance of impropriety, and provide additional assurances to the American people that the Hunter Biden investigation is free from political influence.”“Given the politicization of the DOJ under your watch and the importance of avoiding any appearance of impropriety, the undersigned request that you provide US Attorney Weiss the full protections and authorities of a special counsel.  This is one important action that you can take that will go a long way in restoring faith in our governmental institutions.”Along with Lankford, Cornyn, and Mitch McConnell, the letter was signed by Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), John Thune (R-SD), John Barrasso (R-WY), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Rick Scott (R-FL), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Mike Lee (R-UT), Steve Daines (R-MT), Ted Cruz (R-TX), James Risch (R-ID), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), James Inhofe (R-OK), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), John Kennedy (R-LA), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Shelley Moore-Capito (R-WV), Tim Scott (R-SC), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), John Hoeven (R-ND), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Ben Sasse (R-NE).  You can read the full letter HERE or below: Dear Attorney General Garland:We the undersigned write to request that United States Attorney David C. Weiss be extended special counsel protections and authorities to conduct the Hunter Biden investigation. During your confirmation hearing, you promised to keep politics out of the Department of Justice (“DOJ”). This promise has not been kept.  On October 4, 2021, you unleashed DOJ’s National Security Division and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), among other criminal components, on millions of concerned parents across the country, who were exercising their First Amendment rights to be involved in decisions about their children’s education, including mask mandates, school closures, and the inclusion of critical race theory in school curricula. We have received hundreds of pieces of correspondence detailing how your memorandum chilled constitutionally protected speech. To date, you have failed to rescind this memorandum despite the fact that it was primarily based on a false predicate: the now disavowed National School Board Association Letter.You have also taken numerous other steps that have shown the unfortunate politicization of the DOJ under your charge, including targeting conservative states and legislatures for common-sense ballot integrity measures, championing radical pieces of legislation that would federalize elections, and authorizing an unprecedented search warrant on a former President’s home and current political rival shortly before a critical election without providing sufficient transparency to better understand the justification.  Inexplicably, DOJ has neglected to take measurable efforts to protect Supreme Court Justices, pro-life advocates, and pregnancy resource centers, particularly in the wake of the leak of the draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. For months, radical abortion groups coordinated outside the homes of Supreme Court Justices to intimidate and influence the Justices in the discharge of their duties, a clear violation of federal law. Violent extremist groups like Jane’s Revenge and Ruth Sent Us have incited violence in our communities, including taking credit for bombings of pregnancy resource centers in Wisconsin, New York, and Oregon. And, on June 8, 2022, an armed man, influenced by the leak of the Dobbs’ draft opinion, attempted to murder Justice Kavanaugh outside of his home. Instead of taking measurable efforts to prevent and deter violence against Supreme Court Justices, pro-life advocates, and pregnancy resource centers, you opted to fan the flames of liberal outrage. Following the release of Dobbs, you claimed that the Supreme Court had ignored the Constitution and acted discriminately. Certainly, unhinged comments like this from our nation’s top law enforcement official contributes to political division in our country.     As you know, the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Delaware—led by US Attorney Weiss—has been investigating Hunter Biden. There is no way of knowing the entire scope of the investigation, but evidence seems to be mounting that Hunter Biden committed numerous federal crimes, including, but not limited to, tax fraud, money laundering, and foreign-lobbying violations. Indeed, Senators Grassley and Johnson have conducted an investigation for several years that has resulted in the public disclosure of facts that support those criminal concerns, including the disclosure of financial records showing the Biden family’s close financial connections to the communist Chinese government and questionable foreign nationals. It is clear that Hunter Biden thrived off of a “pay to play” culture of access to his father, then Vice President Joe Biden in exchange for financial compensation.Under Department of Justice regulations and federal law, you have the power to provide special counsel authorities and protections to US Attorney Weiss. Given that the investigation involves the President’s son, we believe it is important to provide US Attorney Weiss with special counsel authorities and protections to allow him to investigate an appropriate scope of potentially criminal conduct, avoid the appearance of impropriety, and provide additional assurances to the American people that the Hunter Biden investigation is free from political influence. Recent news reports paint a concerning picture of the handling of the Hunter Biden investigation. As detailed by Senator Grassley, “highly credible” whistleblowers have come forward to detail a “widespread effort within the FBI to downplay or discredit negative information about” Hunter Biden.  Senator Grassley has also detailed allegations that the FBI shut down investigative activity and avenues of information relating to potentially criminal information on Hunter Biden before the 2020 presidential election. Instead of encouraging FBI and DOJ whistleblowers to report crimes and promote government transparency, you took the inexplicable step of chilling lawful whistleblower activity. Indeed, on August 30, 2022, on the heels of whistleblowers approaching Members of Congress, you issued a memorandum prohibiting DOJ and FBI employees from communicating with “Senators, Representatives, congressional committees, or congressional staff without advance coordination, consultation, and approval by OLA.” Such a restriction is contrary to law and undermines the constitutional responsibility of Members of Congress to provide congressional oversight of the Executive Branch. Clearly, this memorandum will discourage and deter whistleblowers from sharing information to report potentially criminal activity and fraud, waste, and abuse by the government.Given the politicization of the DOJ under your watch and the importance of avoiding any appearance of impropriety, the undersigned request that you provide US Attorney Weiss the full protections and authorities of a special counsel.  This is one important action that you can take that will go a long way in restoring faith in our governmental institutions.Sincerely,###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-abraham-accords-were-a-remarkable-moment-in-us-history,"CLICK HERE to watch Lankford’s remarks on YouTube.CLICK HERE to watch Lankford’s remarks on Rumble.WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today honored the two-year anniversary of the historic signing of the Abraham Accords on the Senate floor. Earlier today, Lankford was joined by Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Joni Ernst (R-IA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) to introduce a resolution to commemorate the historic moment on September 15, 2020, for the US, Israel, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates. Lankford attended the signing at the White House with President Trump.The Senators launched the Senate Abraham Accords Caucus to build on the success of the historic Abraham Accords. For decades, Congress has played a key role in promoting peace between Israel and its neighbors. The Caucus provides an opportunity to strengthen the Abraham Accords by encouraging and partnerships among the existing Abraham Accords countries and expanding the agreement to include countries that do not currently have diplomatic relations with Israel.Earlier this year, the Senators introduced the DEFEND Act to establish an integrated air defense capability among Israel and Arab allies. The Senators also joined in a statement earlier this year following the signature into law of the Israel Relations Normalization Act, which builds on the success of the Abraham Accords by strengthening and expanding normalization and peace agreements between Israel and United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco, as well as previous agreement with Egypt and Jordan.TranscriptTwo years ago almost to the exact moment, I was sitting on the south lawn of the White House in the blazing sun where a redhead should never sit, getting a sunburn on a hot September day in DC, watching leadership of the UAE, Bahrain, Israel, and the United States all shake hands and sign an agreement called the Abraham Accords.It was a remarkable moment in American history.We've become so accustomed in the last two years to this discussion about the Abraham Accords, we lose track that it was just two years ago we had one of the greatest breakthroughs in Middle East peace that we've had in decades.In 1979 Egypt and Israel came together for a peace agreement under President Jimmy Carter and the Camp David Accords. Jordan and Israel normalized relationships under President Clinton. But for 26 years, there were no additional peace agreements and quite frankly very few conversations even. It stopped.All the conversation among foreign affairs was that you had to resolve the Palestinian conflict before anything else could be resolved in the Middle East. And for 26 years all the focus was on that. The Trump Administration came in and put the whole thing on its head and said: What if? What if we worked towards peace agreements outside of the Palestinian conversation, if we set that aside? Could we still normalize agreements? Again, most people said, ‘No, that's not possible’—until two years ago today.Two years ago today, when the leaders of UAE, Bahrain, Israel, and the United States met together and signed an agreement. They started not just a process, they started a conversation and a dialogue. They shook hands and signed an agreement that had remarkable statements in it about religious liberty, that we look at and think, ‘The Arab world would not sign that.’ But they did. Quite frankly because people hadn’t asked them to. There were conversations and agreements made about energy policy, about economic development, in a region of the world that many would say no one will ever meet and this will never get better.President Reagan once said, ‘Our involvement in the search for Middle East peace is not a matter of preference; it's a moral imperative. We are a people of peace. We are a people as a nation passionate about religious liberty. We're a people that want to see a nation joining other nations in economic development. That's who we are. That's who we've been from the beginning. And we're pat our best when we're expanding that.’Since the signing of that document, several things have happened since that two-year time period. The first thing that happened really was October of 2020, Sudan raised their hand and said, ‘I want to join that agreement.’ Then in December of 2020, morocco raised their hand and said, ‘I want to be in that agreement.’ And it quickly went from four nations to five to six, all this ongoing dialogue about peace in the region.The countries have exchanged ambassadors since then. Again that may not sound revolutionary, but it is in that region. The UAE, Morocco, Bahrain all opened up embassies in Israel, again rRevolutionary. Israel opened up its embassy, the first ever, in the gulf nations in Abu Dhabi, January of 2021. It opened up its next embassy in Bahrain in September of 2021.The UAE and Israel have signed a comprehensive free-trade agreement. It's now $10 billion worth of trade in the next five years that's been set is up between those nations. Trade has begun between Israel and Morocco. In fact, it's increased 94 percent in a year. Trade between the UAE and Israel has increased 88 percent in one year. Trade between Israel and Egypt even has increased 41 percent in the last year. And between Jordan, with a long-standing agreement, has increased 55 percent. The UAE and Morocco now have university students that are studying in Israeli universities. It’s something we thought we would never see. The UAE has overhauled its school curriculum to increase tolerance of other faiths and religious groups. Dozens of daily flights are now moving in those Abraham Accord countries, bringing business and tourism. There's even real conversations about water, about energy sharing and development, and large economic infrastructure projects.There are other countries even in the region that have started to take notice of this. Countries like Saudi Arabia, now allowing Israeli-bound flights to fly through Saudi airspace. Now again that may not seem revolutionary to some that planes get to fly over them. But you understand, two years ago, that didn't happen. The Saudis made every Israeli-bound flight go around their airspace.Israel and Saudi Arabia have also participated in multilateral naval and air drills alongside UAE, Bahrain, and other countries. It's an enormous shift. And if I can even say this, in the region, Israel and Lebanon are very close right now to forming an agreement on what they call the blue line, the border between Israel and Lebanon, including the maritime areas. What does that matter? It is a tremendous development for Lebanon, for their economic development, because there is a large natural gas field just off of Lebanon’s coast, but the border has been unresolved for years. And in the conflict between nations and the trust that has collapsed, the Abraham Accords have provided an opportunity and a moment for the nations in the region to say, ‘If peace can begin with UAE and Bahrain and Sudan and Morocco and Israel and recognition and economic development and ambassadors can be exchanged, who else can engage in economic development?’Let's start with their neighbor, Lebanon. To build trust is to also build clear borders. This is real progress in two years.My challenge to the Administration and to our State Department is the fan the flame. Keep going on this. We've seen nations begin to do economic development, families meeting other families, school curriculum changing to taking out antisemitic tropes basically out of their curriculum. We've seen real progress in this area. Keep going. Other nations should be welcomed to be able to join in the Abraham Accords. It is not closed. Other nations can join in that economic development.There are four of us that began the Abraham Accords Caucus. Myself, Senator Rosen, Senator Ernst, Senator Booker. We launched out the four of us and invited all of our colleagues to join in it. Our focus is to be able to work with the ambassadors of those nations to say, ‘How can we work together to bless what has already occurred and how can we expand into other nations? How can we encourage increased economic development?’Now there are still very real challenges. The work is not done by any means. But it has at least begun, and progress is taking off. This simple principle of economic engagement, going past all the government noise and saying, ‘What if we allowed infrastructure to be able to work together? What if we allowed tourism to be able to happen? What if we allowed businesses to work with other businesses in other nations that used to be hostile? How can we engage in such a way that would help?’The four of us in the Abraham Accords Caucus brought to the floor today a resolution to recognize this two-year anniversary, and it’s set before all 100 senators, and I don't know a single Senator that's opposed to that because we all want to see peace in the Middle East. We all want to see that kind of progress. And we all want to see this increase.So to our State Department: keep the work going. Keep the conversation is going. And to nations around the world recalled that used to be hostile to Israel and in the region: why don't we set down the past and prepare four families for the future. ###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-abraham-accords-caucus-members-honor-two-year-anniversary-of-abraham-accords-signing,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senators James Lankford (R-OK), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Joni Ernst (R-IA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) today honored the two-year anniversary of the historic signing of the Abraham Accords by introducing a resolution  to commemorate the historic moment on September 15, 2020, for the US, Israel, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates. Lankford attended the signing at the White House with President Trump.“Two years ago, I witnessed a historic moment among leaders from Israel, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates as President Trump held a White House signing of the once-thought-impossible Abraham Accords,” said Lankford. “Since then, we’ve added two other nations, Morocco and Sudan, to the Accords. As we build on that momentum together, we should remember that through reconciliation and common goals, even unlikely allies can find a way to come together. We continue to stand with Israel and should continue to lead in bringing nations together to further US national interests and the interests of our allies.”“The historic Abraham Accords have transformed the Middle East – paving the way for unprecedented cooperation between Israel and Arab partners in energy and water security, cybersecurity, defense, and trade,” said Rosen. “As we celebrate two years since this landmark agreement, I am proud to join my fellow Senate Abraham Accords Co-Chairs in introducing a bipartisan resolution to celebrate the Accords, call for their expansion and enhancement, and encourage other countries to normalize relations with Israel.”“The Abraham Accords was the most significant peace agreement of the 21st Century,” said Ernst. “This bipartisan measure seeks to honor the monumental effort achieved by the Trump administration in bringing together our Arab allies and Israel to forge an unprecedented and lasting peace deal that has made America and the world more secure. As co-chair of the Senate Abraham Accords Caucus, I remain committed to expanding upon the Abraham Accords and defending America, and our allies, from Iranian aggression.”“Over the past two years, the Abraham Accords have promoted greater economic opportunity and security for Israel and the greater Middle East,” said Booker. “As co-chair of the Senate Abraham Accords Caucus, I remain committed to building on this achievement to bring new countries into the fold, foster meaningful people-to-people engagement, continue integrating the agreements within the region, including with Jordan, Egypt, and the Palestinians, and advance progress towards a negotiated two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”The Senators launched the Senate Abraham Accords Caucus in order to build on the success of the historic Abraham Accords. For decades, Congress has played a key role in promoting peace between Israel and its neighbors. The Caucus provides an opportunity to strengthen the Abraham Accords by encouraging and partnerships among the existing Abraham Accords countries and expanding the agreement to include countries that do not currently have diplomatic relations with Israel.Earlier this year, the Senators introduced the DEFEND Act to establish an integrated air defense capability among Israel and Arab allies. The Senators also joined in a statement earlier this year following the signature into law of the Israel Relations Normalization Act, which builds on the success of the Abraham Accords by strengthening and expanding normalization and peace agreements between Israel and United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco, as well as previous agreement with Egypt and Jordan.###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-burr-wicker-introduce-resolution-calling-for-adoption-of-biden-administration-rail-recommendations-if-voluntary-agreements-are-not-reached,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) along with Richard Burr (R-NC), Ranking Member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, and Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS), Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, introduced a resolution that would prevent a disastrous rail worker strike if contract negotiations are not soon resolved.The Senate resolution would adopt the comprehensive recommendations made by President Biden’s appointees to the Presidential Emergency Board (PEB), which include significant wage rate increases for workers retroactive to 2020. Despite a broad consensus on the PEB’s recommendations, two labor unions continue to stymie contract negotiations. Without an agreement, America faces a potential rail worker strike as early as September 16th, which would cost an estimated $2 billion a day. “As the cost of everything continues to soar to a 40-year high and Oklahoma companies face major supply-chain issues, a rail-labor strike will make our bad economy even worse,” said Lankford. “President Biden’s Emergency Board negotiated with the labor unions and rail companies for months to reach an agreement, but now he will not stand by his own proposal. We are hours away from losing the entire nation’s rail service for passengers and freight. Every Republican Senator agreed today with the Emergency Board, but Senate Democrats blocked the bill to implement the proposal. We stand up for America’s families and our economy by resolving this labor dispute.” “A rail worker strike would be catastrophic for America’s transportation system and our already-stressed supply chain,” said Burr. “The Presidential Emergency Board recommendations are a fair and appropriate solution to a years-long negotiation process, but labor unions are continuing to hold the entire nation’s rail system hostage as they demand more. The Biden Administration should reject labor unions’ bullying tactics. This resolution would provide certainty for Americans who have a right to travel and work freely across state lines.” “A rail strike would be counterproductive for everyone involved and would have devastating impacts on our entire economy,” Wicker said. “While there is still time for the remaining parties to reach voluntary agreements to end this dispute, it is time to bring this matter to a close. This resolution would implement the recommendations as issued by the Presidential Emergency Board. They are balanced, comprehensive, and would ensure rail service is not disrupted further.”  Background: Since 2019, the railroad industry and rail unions have been engaged in negotiations for a new contract, failing to produce an agreement. In July 2022, following the process established by the Railway Labor Act, President Biden appointed a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) to investigate the dispute and make recommendations. In August 2022, the PEB released its recommendations, which were endorsed by the White House. The recommendations proposed a 24 percent wage increase, plus $1,000 annual bonuses, to be applied retroactively dating to 2020, as well as increased health care and other benefits. Eight of the 12 unions agreed to the recommendations; however, four remaining unions have not.  If the parties have not reached a tentative agreement by September 16th, the rail unions could engage in strike activity, which would cost an estimated $2 billion a day.  Under the Railway Labor Act, Congress has intervened to prevent rail disruptions at least 18 times in the past. This resolution further provides clarity and continuity to ensure the continued delivery of necessary goods to the American people.   ###"

In a two-panel Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing today, entitled, “Social Media’s Impact on Homeland Security,” Lankford questioned executives from Tiktok, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and more.Witnesses on today’s panels included: Alex Roetter, the Former Senior Vice President for Engineering (2014-2016) of Twitter; Brian Boland, Former Vice President (2018-2020) Partnerships Product Marketing, Partner Engineering, Marketing, Strategic Operations, & Analytics at Facebook; Geoffrey Cain, Senior Fellow for Critical Emerging Technologies at Lincoln Network; Chris Cox, Chief Product Officer at Meta; Neal Mohan, Chief Product Officer at YouTube; Vanessa Pappas, Chief Operating Officer at TikTok; and Jay Sullivan, General Manager of Bluebird at Twitter.Lankford continues to hold social media companies and Big Tech accountable for their participation in public discourse in our nation and in some cases for facilitating illegal activity on their platforms. This week, Lankford joined Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) to lead a group of  their colleagues to hold the CEOs of Instagram, TikTok, Snap Inc., and YouTube accountable for the illegal sale of fentanyl-laced pills to teenagers and young adults on their platforms, demanding to know what these platforms are doing to stop sales—a crisis created by President Biden’s southern border failed immigration policies. Lankford joined Senator John Thune (R-SD) and 24 of their Republican colleagues to introduce the Political Bias in Algorithm Sorting (BIAS) Emails Act. The straight-forward bill makes it illegal for Big Tech to automatically send emails to spam based upon a political preference and requires those companies publically disclose spam tactics that censor campaigns.In April Lankford sent a letter to the Chief Executive Officer of Google Sundar Pichai regarding YouTube’s removal of videos from the Conservative Political Action Conference’s (CPAC) channel. YouTube, which is owned by Google, claims the videos contain “misleading information” but did not disclose what information was “misleading” to CPAC. Lankford participated in a panel at CPAC on Big Tech censorship during the February 2022 conference. He separately uploaded clips from his talk at the conference to YouTube, which have not been censored by Google, yet. ExcerptLankford: You’ve all been very outspoken on dealing with sexual child predators, with different issues, drug trafficking. Those are all good things to be able to engage on. But it’s fascinating to me that the platforms have chosen to say there’s some illegal activities we’re okay with, in fact we’re going to facilitate—one of those is illegally crossing our southern border.It’s not hard for me to go to YouTube, and I just type in, ‘How to cross the border illegally,’ and I get a video that says, ‘How to illegally cross the US-Mexico border.’ It’s had 1.7 million views, and it’s been there for two years. And yes I watched it, and it showed where to be able to cross, what highways to avoid, where the Border Patrol typically puts up stations, how to be able to look for different aspects. I mean it, in detail, shows a video of ‘Here’s how to illegally cross the Mexico-US border and where to be able to cross and how to avoid Border Patrol. This has been up for two years, and it’s had 1.7 million views.As I mentioned on Facebook, Facebook has ads that I can actually show you that are human smugglers placing ads in Central America, so people will know how to be able to connect with them to be able to travel through Mexico to be able to pay the cartels, which are a ruthless drug organization, to be able to get into the United States.My confusion on this is: I don’t understand why the platforms look at illegally crossing the border as, ‘we’re going to look the other way,’ when you’re user agreements say, ‘We don’t promote illegal activity’…except for this one. Help me understand why that’s different.###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankfords-emergency-savings-bill-a-no-brainer-for-congress-to-pass-in-2022-says-national-taxpayers-union,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today applauded the National Taxpayer Union (NTU) for listing his Enhancing Emergency and Retirement Savings Act on their list of  ""No Brainer"" bills that Congress needs to pass as soon as possible in 2022. Lankford’s bill would help families save for retirement and prepare for emergencies by encouraging participation in retirement plans and giving individuals additional flexibility for penalty-free access to funds should a family emergency hit. Lankford provided remarks in support of his bill when it came before the Senate Finance Committee in June. The bill was included in the Senate Finance Committee’s broader retirement package, the Enhancing American Retirement Now (EARN) Act, which was approved unanimously by the Committee, 28-0. “I agree with the National Taxpayers Union that this bill is a no-brainer for Congress to pass to encourage Americans to keep and use more of their hard-earned money when they need it,” said Lankford. “Oklahomans need confidence that they can access their own money from their retirement account if an emergency strikes their family, and that confidence will actually encourage them to save more for retirement in the first place. Providing access and the ability to pay back some retirement funds to cover an unexpected medical expense, broken appliance, or a car that needs maintenance will give many families in my state and around the country the breathing room they need to keep their families going.”For more information on the NTU’s “No Brainer” list, CLICK HERE.""Helping Americans save up for emergencies is a true policy No Brainer for Congress. That's why NTU is proud to include Senator Lankford's Enhancing Emergency and Retirement Savings Act in our 12th annual No Brainers list of bipartisan bills Congress should pass in 2022. NTU thanks Senator Lankford for his leadership on this pro-taxpayer and pro-consumer legislation,” said Andrew Lautz, Director of Federal Policy at NTU.Background on the billThe legislation would provide a penalty-free “emergency distribution” option from employer-sponsored retirement accounts and IRAs. One emergency distribution would be permitted per calendar year, and that distribution would be limited to vested amounts over $1,000, with an annual maximum withdrawal of $1,000. Additionally, the legislation requires that the individual replenish the withdrawn amount back to the plan before an additional emergency distribution from that same plan is allowed. Together, this will provide flexibility while also ensuring that individuals continue to save for retirement.The bill is supported by the following groups:“We believe this excellent legislation will give savers comfort that they’ll have access to their money in the event of an emergency and will remove a significant barrier for low- and middle-income workers to save for retirement in the first place. Most critically, the ability to access a small amount retirement savings without a tax penalty will help prevent many people from digging themselves into a financial hole due to an unplanned emergency expense, “ said Eric Stevenson, President, Nationwide Retirement Solutions. View the full letter HERE.“The Enhancing Emergency and Retirement Savings Act smartly leverages the existing workplace-based retirement plan system to address this emergency savings problem while ensuring Americans continue to save for a secure retirement following an emergency. The legislation creates a new category of distribution in a 401(k) or similar plan that would allow workers who have a certain balance in these accounts to quickly access their savings to address a personal financial emergency without an additional tax penalty and a minimal amount of paperwork,” said Brian H. Graff, Esq. APM, Executive Director/CEO, American Retirement Association. View the full letter HERE.“We are writing on behalf of the American Benefits Council to thank you for your leadership with respect to emergency savings and the introduction of the Enhancing Emergency and Retirement Savings Act of 2021.

Through technological innovations, unique opportunities have been created for them to utilize animal waste for energy and electricity production through anaerobic digestion… If the alleged adverse environmental impacts of these operations is the true concern, why would we limit their ability to enhance their management practices? In a time where input prices are strangling agriculture operations and energy costs are deteriorating families’ financial standing, why would we attempt to limit opportunities that could help solve both of these problems?” You can read the full letter HERE or below:Dear Administrator Regan: We write you in response to a recent letter sent by Senate Democrats requesting you exclude methane biogas projects operated by Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) from being eligible to qualify as an eligible feedstock to generate electric renewable identification numbers (e-RINs) under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The allegations brought forth as the basis for their request are abjectly deceitful and the insinuation that these facilities operate with such wanton disregard for the public health is abhorrent.  CAFOs play a vital role in our nation’s ability to be food independent and have continually improved their efficiency to produce more with less, inherently making them more sustainable. Through technological innovations, unique opportunities have been created for them to utilize animal waste for energy and electricity production through anaerobic digestion. In 2021, CAFO anaerobic digestion systems reduced carbon emissions by 6.09 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent and generated 1.76 million megawatt-hours of electricity. All accomplished by little more than 300 facilities.  In fact, 52 of these installations currently provide renewable fuel and electricity to the states of the respective Senators condemning their existence. It is evident that this practice is a viable tool to create economic opportunity, embolden our energy security, and improve the overall environmental sustainability of our agriculture industry. If the alleged adverse environmental impacts of these operations is the true concern, why would we limit their ability to enhance their management practices? In a time where input prices are strangling agriculture operations and energy costs are deteriorating families’ financial standing, why would we attempt to limit opportunities that could help solve both of these problems? Why would we villainize those who are actively working to feed our nation while actively impeding their initiatives to address the very issues raised?  With all of this in mind we ask that you disregard the misguided, alarmist allegations made by our Democratic colleagues on this issue and would like to request information regarding:We appreciate your efforts in this area and look forward to your response. Sincerely,###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senate-republicans-unprecedented-drug-price-control-scheme-threatens-innovation-future-drug-costs,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senate Republicans, including Senator James Lankford (R-OK), are expressing concerns with the establishment of a permanent government price-setting program, funded by billions of taxpayer dollars, in the partisan Inflation Reduction Act, and raising questions regarding federal health agencies’ plans for program implementation.  In a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator (CMS) Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, the Senators highlight the outsize risks the impending government pricing initiative poses for patients, frontline health care providers, small businesses, and the American economy as a whole, and urge the officials to weigh impacts on health care access, research and development (R&D) and domestic manufacturing.   The Senators wrote, “As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has confirmed, the government price controls codified under the recently enacted reconciliation legislation have the potential to increase launch prices for new medications, as well as to trigger fewer new drug approvals in the coming years. “Other independent analyses have projected even more catastrophic consequences, from hundreds of thousands of domestic job losses to hundreds of billions in forgone R&D dollars. The innovation ecosystem that has made the United States the world’s unquestioned life sciences leader, bolstered by thousands of startups and small businesses, may wither under this partisan legislation, particularly in the absence of careful, deliberative implementation and assertive, consumer-oriented oversight.”The letter is signed by Senators Mike Crapo (R-ID), John Cornyn (R-TX), John Thune (R-SD), Richard Burr (R-NC), Rob Portman (R-OH), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Tim Scott (R-SC), Steve Daines (R-MT), Todd Young (R-IN), John Barrasso (R-WY), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Rick Scott (R-FL), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Rand Paul (R-KY),  Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Kevin Cramer (R-ND),  John Boozman (R-AR), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV). Full text of the letter is available HERE and below. Dear Secretary Becerra and Administrator Brooks-LaSure:Congress recently acted, on a party-line basis, to establish a permanent government price-setting program for prescription drugs, financed with billions of taxpayer dollars and enforced through an unprecedented excise tax of up to 95 percent. We write to express concerns with the disruptive and distortive administrative undertaking that the implementation of this far-reaching federal expansion will inevitably represent, as well as to raise a number of questions regarding your department’s plans for putting this new program into practice. Given the outsize risks that the impending government pricing initiative poses for patients, frontline health care providers, small businesses, and the American economy as a whole, we urge you to weigh both direct and indirect impacts on health care access, research and development (R&D), and domestic manufacturing as you take the first steps toward implementing this program. As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has confirmed, the government price controls codified under the recently enacted reconciliation legislation have the potential to increase launch prices for new medications, as well as to trigger fewer new drug approvals in the coming years. Scores of life-threatening conditions, from cancer to Alzheimer’s and sickle cell disease, could see a substantial decline in possible treatment options on the horizon. Moreover, based on CBO’s analysis, some manufacturers may choose to terminate participation in Medicare and Medicaid altogether as a result of the compulsory new price-setting program, jeopardizing access to a range of therapies and cures for the most vulnerable Americans. Other independent analyses have projected even more catastrophic consequences, from hundreds of thousands of domestic job losses to hundreds of billions in forgone R&D dollars. The innovation ecosystem that has made the United States the world’s unquestioned life sciences leader, bolstered by thousands of startups and small businesses, may wither under this partisan legislation, particularly in the absence of careful, deliberative implementation and assertive, consumer-oriented oversight. Given the profound health care, economic, and national security implications of this anomalous new federal program, we ask that you carefully consider these and other threats, from depressed drug discovery and development to diminished medical access and cascades of health care provider cuts. In light of the urgent importance of clarity and caution regarding the forthcoming implementation of this colossal government initiative, please provide the following information by the close of business on October 28, 2022: Sincerely,###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford_daines-colleagues-hold-social-media-giants-accountable-for-role-in-bidens-fentanyl-crisis,"WASHINGTON, DC –Senators James Lankford (R-OK) and Steve Daines (R-MT) today led a group of  their colleagues in an effort to hold the CEOs of Instagram, TikTok, Snap Inc., and YouTube accountable for the illegal sale of fentanyl-laced pills to teenagers and young adults on their platforms. The  Senators demanded answers on what these platforms are doing to stop these sales- a crisis created by President Biden’s southern border crisis.“We write to you today regarding reports that the use of your social media platforms has been linked to the sale of fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills that have caused the deaths of teens and young adults across the country. In light of the devastating rise in drug overdose deaths in the US, especially linked to fentanyl, we are requesting more information regarding steps your companies are taking to protect children and crackdown on illegal drug sales on your platforms,” the Senators wrote.“Social media platforms like yours provide a convenient venue for dealers to anonymously and discreetly peddle these counterfeit pills to a young audience.

In light of the devastating rise in drug overdose deaths in the U.S., especially linked to fentanyl, we are requesting more information regarding steps your companies are taking to protect children and crackdown on illegal drug sales on your platforms. According to recent data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drug overdose deaths reached a record-breaking level in 2021, with more than 100,000 Americans losing their lives to this awful scourge. A growing share of these deaths are coming from overdoses involving fentanyl. Last year, deaths involving illegally manufactured fentanyl rose 23 percent to 71,238. Among teenagers, the overdose death rate nearly doubled from 2019 to 2020—a deeply alarming climb that continued into 2021. Criminal drug networks are mass-producing fentanyl-laced pills and exploiting the ongoing crisis at our southern border caused by President Biden’s total inaction to smuggle thousands of pounds of fentanyl into our states. Drug dealers in our communities then market these deadly pills to unsuspecting buyers as legitimate prescription pills like Percocet, Xanax, and Adderall. Social media platforms like yours provide a convenient venue for dealers to anonymously and discreetly peddle these counterfeit pills to a young audience. With 4 in 10 of these pills containing a lethal dose of fentanyl, more and more of these online transactions are ending in tragedy. Recognizing the role your platforms play in the evolving illicit drug ecosystem, we respectfully request answers to the following questions and a follow-up meeting to discuss these important matters.  Sincerely,###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-thune-biden-administrations-overreaching-child-mask-mandate-must-end,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senators James Lankford (R-OK), John Thune (R-SD), and Richard Burr (R-NC) today sent a letter to Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra requesting that the department rescind its one-size-fits-all federal mask mandate on Head Start programs. Children six months to five years of age are currently eligible to be vaccinated against COVID-19, but a HHS interim final rule (IFR) still requires all staff and volunteers in Head Start educational facilities to be vaccinated and requires all staff, volunteers, and children two years of age and older to wear masks—even when they are outside on the playground. “This IFR continues to be an overly rigid, inflexible rule that complicates individual Head Start programs’ ability to operate and attract staff and volunteers – though there is a preliminary injunction against the IFR in multiple states – and we request that you immediately rescind it,” the Senators wrote. “The nation must continue to transition toward treating COVID-19 as an endemic condition and return to a sense of normalcy, and it is past time for Washington bureaucrats to allow Head Start programs to do the same.”  The Head Start program is a federal program that provides qualifying, low-income children with early education services. Program facilities are located throughout the nation and, up until the issuance of this IFR, individual locations had been able to set and enforce their own COVID-19 protocols. Although this rule has been halted by federal courts in several states, including South Dakota, the only way to ensure it never sees the light of day is to permanently rescind it nationwide.   The letter was also signed by Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), John Boozman (R-AR), Mike Braun (R-IN), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WA), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Jim Risch (R-ID). Marco Rubio (R-FL), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), and Thom Tillis (NC).  You can read the full letter HERE and below: Dear Secretary Becerra:Since November 2021, vaccine and mask mandates on Head Start and Early Head Start programs have been in effect as a result of a U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) interim final rule (IFR). We write to highlight how unnecessary these mandates continue to be and request that this IFR be rescinded immediately.As you know, as of January 31, 2022, this IFR requires Head Start staff and volunteers to be vaccinated against COVID-19. It also requires Head Start staff and volunteers to wear masks. But beyond these mandates, the IFR also requires students two years of age and older to wear masks despite the World Health Organization advising against mask mandates for children five years of age and younger.Up until the publication of this IFR in late 2021 – more than 18 months after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic – individual Head Start programs across the nation had the flexibility to implement their own precautions that effectively protected staff, volunteers, and students in these facilities. This flexibility afforded each individual program the opportunity to establish health and safety protocols and other mitigation strategies that were consistent with state and local laws and recommendations that worked best for their staff, volunteers, and students. In fact, according to a December 2020 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this flexibility was effective, as the CDC found that individual programs successfully implemented recommendations that limited the transmission of COVID-19 in their facilities.The application of inflexible federal rules on individual Head Start programs through this IFR and the forcing of toddlers enrolled in these programs to wear masks even caught the attention of Congress. On May 3, 2022, the U.S. Senate passed a joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of this IFR by a bipartisan vote of 55 to 41, with seven Democrats supporting the resolution and opposing the IFR.Prior to Senate consideration of the resolution, President Biden unfortunately committed to vetoing it. A primary reason for his opposition was because, at the time of Senate consideration, the CDC had not yet approved children five years of age and younger to be vaccinated against COVID-19. However, on June 18, 2022, the CDC approved certain COVID-19 vaccines for children six months through five years of age. Head Start-aged children are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine if their families so choose.This IFR continues to be an overly rigid, inflexible rule that complicates individual Head Start programs’ ability to operate and attract staff and volunteers – though there is a preliminary injunction against the IFR in multiple states – and we request that you immediately rescind it. The nation must continue to transition toward treating COVID-19 as an endemic condition and return to a sense of normalcy, and it is past time for Washington bureaucrats to allow Head Start programs to do the same.Thank you for your prompt attention to this request.   Sincerely,###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-hartzler-colleagues-challenge-department-of-education-on-its-progressive-gender-ideology-in-proposed-title-ix-rule-,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) was joined by 12 Republican Senators to file a public comment on Department of Education’s recently proposed rule regarding Title IX compliance in schools and to ask Secretary Miguel Cardona to withdraw the rule, citing that it undercuts the purpose of the law and promotes the left’s progressive gender ideology.Joining Lankford in sending the letter were Senators Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Steve Daines (R-MT), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Rick Scott (R-FL), Jim Risch (R-ID), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Roger Marshall, M.D., (R-KS), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mike Braun (R-IN), and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN). Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-MO) led the letter from members of the House of Representatives.The members write in their letter, “Congress enacted Title IX 50 years ago to provide women with equal opportunities in educational programs and activities. The Proposed Rule’s interpretation of Title IX runs afoul of the clear parameters of the statute, as well as congressional intent. In fact, if finalized, it would actually have the opposite effect of the law’s intent and further erode women’s equality, privacy and safety. As Members of Congress, we have a constitutional obligation to weigh in to ensure that any rulemaking issued by agencies is consistent with the underlying statute, which this proposal certainly is not. Further, we have a significant and unique interest in representing the well-being and safety of our constituents, particularly women and children, who are put at risk by the regulations in the Proposed Rule.”Lankford continues to fight to protect kids from being forced to participate in the left’s woke ideology, particularly at school, and against Biden’s attempted redefinition of Title IX. Lankford recently sent a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack and Administrator for the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) Cindy Long to oppose a recent move by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and FNS to redefine the Department’s definition of Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination to also prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.Lankford also recently stood up against the National Education Association (NEA) for proposing the creation of an “enemies list” at their recent conference based on those who don’t want to teach part of the progressive agenda. Lankford joined Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) and their colleagues to send a letter to Education Secretary Cardona criticizing the Administration’s proposed changes to Title IX and urging an extension of the public comment period by 30 days. Lankford also introduced the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2021, which would make it a violation of Title IX for a school that receives federal education funds to permit a biological male to participate in a program designated for the competition of women and girls.You can read the full letter HERE and below:Secretary Cardona,We write to express our grave concern with the intent and implications of the US Department of Education’s Proposed Rule: Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 87 Fed. Reg. 41390, RIN 1870-AA16 (Proposed Rule), and urge the Administration to immediately withdraw the rule. Among other harmful changes, the Proposed Rule expands the scope of Title IX’s prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex to include “discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.”Congress enacted Title IX 50 years ago to provide women with equal opportunities in educational programs and activities. The Proposed Rule’s interpretation of Title IX runs afoul of the clear parameters of the statute, as well as Congressional intent. In fact, if finalized, it would actually have the opposite effect of the law’s intent and further erode women’s equality, privacy and safety.As Members of Congress, we have a constitutional obligation to weigh in to ensure that any rulemaking issued by agencies is consistent with the underlying statute, which this proposal certainly is not. Further, we have a significant and unique interest in representing the well-being and safety of our constituents, particularly women and children, who are put at risk by the regulations in the Proposed Rule.1.     The Proposed Rule is inconsistent with the law, and is the latest attempt to erode the Congressional intent and statutory text of Title IX.On June 23, 1972, after in depth Congressional consideration and subsequent agreement, President Richard Nixon signed Title IX into law to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex in any educational program or activity that receives either direct or indirect federal funding.Title IX ensures women and girls are given the same opportunities in school afforded to men and boys. Unfortunately, over the past decade, two Administrations have attempted to undercut the statutory purpose of the law and to use it as a way to promote progressive gender ideology.In 2010 and 2011, the Obama Administration sent multiple Dear Colleague letters to every public school and university in the country to expand policies related to campus assault and harassment. Since it was merely a Dear Colleague letter and not a rule, these “regulations” were implemented outside of the formal federal rulemaking process, clearly in order to bypass such process.The Departments of Education and Justice subsequently sent another Dear Colleague letter in 2016, again to all public schools and universities in the country, claiming that, “[a]s a condition of receiving Federal funds,” schools must “treat a student’s gender identity as the student’s sex for purposes of Title IX.”As a result, schools were prohibited from maintaining separate locker rooms, shower facilities, and restrooms for male and female students based on their biological differences. Because the letters lacked foundation in Title IX’s statutory text, and it attempted to create federal policy outside of the public rulemaking process, they did not carry the force of law, and created a lack of clarity around the scope, application and enforcement of Title IX. The policies pushed in the letters caused mass confusion among states, schools, parents and children.Thankfully, both letters were swiftly revoked in 2017. Further, the Trump Administration issued a rule to prevent and respond to instances of sexual harassment and assault. Among other things, the rule respected Title IX’s statutory text and Congressional intent; it protected both victims and the accused, while also taking important steps to ensure that religious freedom protected by clarifying what institutions are exempt from compliance with Title IX.The current Administration has seized our nation’s primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities, to enact political, social and cultural change, with no regard for the harmful repercussions or the rule of law. On his first day in office, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation. Contrary to the protections Congress afforded to women and girls under Title IX, this Executive Order unfairly called for the elimination of equal opportunity for girls in sports and dangerously suggested that children in schools should not have access to sex-specific bathrooms, locker rooms and other private spaces.As if that wasn’t enough, the Department of Justice (DOJ) published a memorandum in March 2021 that further misinterpreted Title IX.  As a legal foundation for its misapplication of the law, DOJ cited the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which held that “an employer who fires someone simply for being homosexual or transgender has discharged or otherwise discriminated against that individual ‘because of such individual’s sex.’” Notably, the opinion in Bostock explicitly stated that it applies only to hiring and firing decisions under Title VII, leaving other issues and other laws for another day.The Department of Education followed DOJ’s lead by publishing a notice of interpretation to assert that Title IX’s protections extend to claims based on “sexual orientation and gender identity.” This interpretation, which rewrites the plain meaning of sex, is now in the Proposed Rule.The Proposed Rule would radically redefine discrimination on the basis of sex to include sexual orientation and gender identity (both of which are left without clear definitions), sex stereotypes, (defined as “fixed or generalized expectations regarding a person’s aptitudes, behavior, self-presentation, or other attributes based on sex”), and sex characteristics, (which includes “a person’s physiological sex characteristics and other inherently sex-based traits,” or “intersex traits”).The Proposed Rule claim that because the statute does not explicitly define sex as biological, “the Department does not construe the term ‘sex’ to necessarily be limited to a single component of an individual's anatomy or physiology.”To be clear, sex is biological. Unlike the assertions in the Proposed Rule, “sex” does not “encompass many traits.” Sex is not one’s self-asserted belief about himself or herself based on emotions, preference, self-presentation or behavior. Sex is binary. People are either male or female as demonstrated by their DNA, reproductive biology and other immutable characteristics. The proposed rule’s attempt to expand the definition of sex, while simultaneously neglecting to clearly define what the Department means by such an expansive definition, demonstrates that it is more focused on pushing an ideology rather than protecting individuals from discrimination.There is no question that this expansion of the meaning of sex goes far beyond the statute, Congressional intent, and Supreme Court opinions. Indeed, while the Proposed Rule attempts to find its footing in the holding of Bostock, the Court’s decision is based on the reality that sex refers “only to biological distinctions between male and female.”It’s clear that regardless of Title IX’s statutory text and the requirements of the rulemaking process, the Department of Education is pushing schools to apply Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination to sexual orientation and gender identity. This is antithetical to the statutory text and congressional intent of Title IX and should not be finalized.2.     The Proposed Rule undercuts equal opportunities and neglects the safety and privacy rights of women and girls in education. By passing Title IX, Congress recognized the need for explicit laws to protect women and girls and promote a level playing field for equal opportunities within education. In addition to its dissonance with the law, the Proposed Rule will disadvantage and harm women and girls, as we have already seen a number of times where similar policies have been in place. The Proposed Rule says that “preventing any person from participating in an education program or activity consistent with their gender identity would subject them to more than de minimis harm on the basis of sex and therefore be prohibited, unless otherwise permitted by Title IX or the regulations.” This scope reaches far and wide with little guardrails to protect women.Under the Proposed Rule, sex-specific spaces, including housing, bathrooms and locker rooms, at primary, secondary and post-secondary institutions will be based on undefined “gender identity.”The Proposed Rule rewrites the intent of Title IX in such a way that it could, and will, be used by those who desire to cause harm. The Proposed Rule will only make it harder for school officials to protect children, as child predators and those who are intending to cause harm to children could use these policies to gain access to private spaces such as bathrooms or locker rooms.The Proposed Rule should be clear that under Title IX, sex is biological and binary.A.    The Proposed Rule ignores First Amendment free speech and religious freedom protections and parental rights.Policies included in the Proposed Rule could require teachers, administrators, contractors and grantees to undergo training to “affirm” students’ sexual identities. This is a clear violation of the free speech protections guaranteed by the First Amendment. Such policies could also purportedly compel teachers and school personnel to participate in teaching gender ideology in the classroom, including using preferred pronouns and names. Children and educators would be forced to learn and accept curriculum that affirms a progressive and baseless ideology with contrary opinions shared because of the threat of such dissent being considered discriminatory. For example, in Virginia, a French teacher was fired for refusing to use a student’s preferred pronouns.The 2020 Title IX rule made clear that the Title IX does not restrict any rights guaranteed by the First Amendment, so it would not limit free speech or the free exercise of religion. The Department should similarly ensure that the Proposed Rule will not limit these Constitutional protections, especially for people of faith, at Title IX entities. Without such clarifications, it is possible that the Proposed Rule would have a chilling effect for people and groups of faith or those who hold prolife views, who will be afraid to speak about their beliefs at risk of being unjustly accused of harassment.Similarly, as the Proposed Rule promotes the affirmation of gender ideology and abortion, the Department should make clear that no student, teacher, administrator or employee of a Title IX covered entity will be compelled to affirm, teach or promote gender ideology in or out of the classroom.Neither the federal government nor any school, is in a position to govern the conscience and beliefs of students, parents, teachers or administrators. Traditional beliefs about gender, sex and marriage should be honored and respected in the public square, including schools. Our Constitution distinctly protects free speech and religious freedom. As such, the Department of Education must ensure these rights are afforded equal protection and respect.Further, parental rights must be foundational. Yet, the Proposed Rule seems to forget them. The Department should make clear that any attempt by a school to “affirm” a student’s gender identity that is incongruent with the child’s biological sex must be made known to the child’s parents, including anything related to social or medical transition. Schools and the government have never been and will never be a substitute for parents. All gender alterations – whether social or medical – could present serious, long-lasting physical, emotional and relational harm to children, such as infertility, bone development, brain development, and more. As such, schools should never hide such information from parents.B.    The Proposed Rule will harm women’s and girls’ athletic opportunities.The Proposed Rule claims to remain silent on the application of its policies to athletics, with the announcement of a separate, forthcoming rule. However, the policies outlined in the Proposed Rule have already and will continue to be a detriment to ensuring an equal playing field for women and girls in sports.The Department purports to claim that the Proposed Rule does not address women’s and girls’ athletics. Instead, the Department of Education said it “plans to issue a separate notice of proposed rulemaking to address whether and how the Department should amend the Title IX regulations to address students’ eligibility to participate on a particular male or female athletics team.” But nothing in the text of the proposed regulations state that the prohibition against limiting participation based on gender identity does not apply.It is obvious that the Proposed Rule, as written, will disadvantage women and girls in sports, regardless of future rulemaking specific to athletics.The Proposed Rule explicitly states that a “recipient's education program or activity would also include all of its academic and other classes, extracurricular activities, athletics programs (emphasis added), and other aspects of the recipient's education program or activity.”The Department claimed to remain silent on the issue of sports, but they ignore the plain text of the Proposed Rule, which will quickly erode the integrity of athletics by requiring biological males who identify as transgender to compete on girls and women’s teams. By doing this, the Department is putting women at a disadvantage. Both the law and public opinion are clear; women and girls should be afforded equal opportunities to men and boys, and should not be forced to compete against males in athletics.The effects of the Proposed Rule will eliminate women's athletics by allowing individuals to compete based on definition-less gender identity. Despite 50 years of progress toward achieving equal opportunities for women and girls in education, this Proposed Rule will force women to sacrifice, by allowing men to take, athletic opportunities, team participation, trophies, awards, scholarships and more on the altar of progressive gender ideology.For example, high school girl track athletes were disadvantaged in Connecticut after the state’s unfair, gender identity policies permitted two biological males to compete in, and subsequently win a combined fifteen girl’s track championship titles previously held by nine women. One of these participants set a first-place record for the girl’s track event. The males’ participating and success prevented the girls from advancing to regional meets, taking away an opportunity for the girls to compete in front of college scouts.Men and women are biologically and physiologically different, which is why there are different men’s and women’s sports in the first place. It is self-evident and a scientific fact.It is also important to note that it is not discriminatory to acknowledge the difference between men and women. Disregarding it would, in many instances, such as athletics and physical capability, subject women to unfair standards and limit their ability to fully participate in educational opportunities. The Department has an obligation to ensure that any policy it puts forward, including this Proposed Rule, does not discriminate against women. This Proposed Rule completely misses that mark.3.     The Proposed Rule should explicitly affirm the previous rule’s clarification on religious freedom.Religious freedom is fundamental to society, including education. Since our nation’s founding, our laws have reiterated the importance of protecting, upholding and advancing religious freedom. In addition to both the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment, Congress has enacted laws such as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to ensure that the government cannot substantially burden religious exercise without a compelling government interest.Congress explicitly included language in Title IX to ensure that no part of the law would require religious institutions to forfeit their sincerely held religious beliefs in order to partner with the government or provide educational opportunities to students, regardless of whether the students share those religious beliefs.The law states that Title IX “shall not apply to an educational institution which is controlled by a religious organization if the application of this subsection would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such organization.” As such, religious educational institutions are exempt from compliance with Title IX to the extent that compliance with Title IX is inconsistent with the religious tenets of the organization, even if the educational institution receives Federal financial assistance.Unfortunately, under the Obama Administration, religious schools were unfairly targeted. Schools were publicly shamed for living out their faith. They were also required to seek permission from the government to be exempt from Title IX.No law or policy should ever require religious organizations to seek permission from the government to live out their faith, nor should policies unjustly target or discriminate against schools based on religious status. The Proposed Rule should ensure that the integrity of the statutory exemption is upheld, and that the Department will not retaliate against schools that are exempt from Title IX by creating a public list, which will shame schools for living out the principles of their faith.When the current rule was proposed and finalized, it rightly clarified that Title IX applies only to recipients of Federal financial assistance. It expressly exempted educational institutions controlled by religious organizations from compliance with Title IX to the extent that compliance with Title IX is inconsistent with the religious tenets of the religious organization even if the educational institution does receive Federal financial assistance. It ensured that instead of actively having to seek an exemption that bureaucrats at the Department of Education get to evaluate, institutions can simply claim an exemption. The statute does not require schools to ask permission to live out their faith, so neither did the existing rule.It is notable that the Department does not address religious liberty in this rule, despite the fact that the “Religious Liberty and Free Inquiry Rule” is simultaneously pending with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). To the extent that the Department intends to propose changes in the Free Inquiry Rule that will impact the scope of which organizations qualify for religious exemptions under Title IX, the Free Inquiry Rule should be considered in conjunction with this Proposed Rule to ensure commenters and stakeholders have a fair opportunity to engage and comment. Further, we strongly encourage the Department to expressly maintain all of the protections afforded to religious institutions by the underlying statute and made clear by the 2020 regulation.4.     The Proposed Rule neglects to explicitly include and apply the abortion neutrality language in Title IX.In 1988, Congress amended Title IX to include abortion neutrality language to make clear that it does not confer a right to abortion. Congress clearly and deliberately, said that “Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require … any person, or public or private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit or service, including the use of facilities, related to an abortion.”Not surprisingly, the Administration is using this Proposed Rule, based in a law from 1972, to promote its pro-abortion agenda in the wake of the repeal of Roe v. Wade.We are concerned that the Proposed Rule’s definition of “discrimination on the basis of sex” includes “pregnancy or related conditions,” which is defined as ""(1) Pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or lactation; (2) Medical conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or lactation; or (3) Recovery from pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, lactation, or their related medical conditions""). This definition disregards the abortion neutrality language and attempts to use Title IX to promote, and confer a right to, abortion. Notably, the Proposed Rule makes no mention of the existing, statutory abortion neutrality language. Further, the proposed rule expands the scope of pregnancy discrimination to apply to all education programs and activities, rather than just admissions.While we agree that no woman should be punished or discriminated against on account of her pregnancy, it is concerning that the Department goes as far as redefining sex discrimination to include “termination of pregnancy,” essentially equating abortion to pregnancy and childbearing. As the Supreme Court recently affirmed in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, there is no federal right to abortion. That includes Title IX.The inclusion of this language in the proposed rule raises a number of unanswered questions, including whether educational institutions that refuse to provide access to abortion or abortion counseling will be deemed discriminatory. While we maintain that the Proposed Rule as a whole should be withdrawn, at a minimum, the Department must clearly define in the regulation that schools will not be compelled to promote abortion, and that speech, organizations, events and speakers that promote the sanctity of human life beginning at conception will not be considered to be in violation of Title IX.Further, regarding curriculum pertaining to reproductive health and sex education in schools, the Department must clarify that schools are not directed to promote abortion, including abortion counselling or referrals.While we oppose the inclusion of termination of pregnancy as part of the definition of sex, it is important to ensure that women are not prevented from equally participating in education programs or activities based on pregnancy, childbirth, or lactation.We maintain that the proposed rule should be withdrawn, but affirm the inclusion of lactation in this context. Schools should be required to reasonably accommodate pregnant and lactating women in accordance with Title IX to ensure that no woman is ever forced to choose between maintaining a healthy pregnancy or her education. The Department should take all steps necessary to ensure that its policies promote life and that no woman is ever pressured or compelled to seek an abortion by her educational institution. Notably, such action would explicitly be discrimination based on sex, as childbearing, childbirth and lactation are inherent, biological capabilities of women.5.     The Proposed Rule purports to preempt state law.Of additional concern due to the underlying policies, the Proposed Rule broadly defines any Program or activity under Title IX to mean all of the operations of (1) A department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or local government; or (II) The entity of a State or local government that distributes such assistance and each such department or agency (and each other State or local government entity) to which the assistance is extended, in the case of assistance to a State or local government.Further “recipient” is defined to mean, among other things, “any State or political subdivision thereof.”Regardless, Title IX does not give the Department the authority to compel states to disregard their own laws related to protecting children from harmful gender ideology, ensuring equal opportunities for women, and upholding the sanctity of human life.The Proposed Rule should make clear that no part of the regulation would preempt state laws that are contrary to the far-reaching and unsubstantiated attempts of the Proposed Rule to indoctrinate students.The Proposed Rule should explicitly acknowledge that no schools, students, teachers, parents, or states would be subjected to unfair or discriminatory practices or actions by the Department on the basis that such individual or entity understands sex to be binary and based in biology, or upholds equality for women in sports by ensuring that biological males are not allowed to compete against women and girls in female athletics.Similarly, the Proposed Rule should also ensure that those individuals and states that affirm protection of all life, including the lives of the unborn, do not face discrimination. The Department must make clear that Title IX does not preempt prolife state laws by encouraging and facilitating abortion tourism through enabling students to access abortion regardless of school policies, under the guise of Title IX protections.6.     The Proposed Rule will have a far-reaching, negative impact beyond education.As drafted, the Proposed Rule will have ripple effects in other nondiscrimination laws written by Congress, including Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, Food and Nutrition Services and more. We have already seen the harms causes by such policies, including compelling doctors to perform harmful, irreversible and experimental gender alteration procedures on minors, and strong-arming schools into adopting progressive policies by tying such policies to school lunch programs. The broad, harmful, and lasting impact that this Proposed Rule would have on other agency programs is just one reason that the Department should withdraw it.If the Department moves forward with the Proposed Rule, it must consider the impact in such areas and explicitly state that such regulation does not apply to these or any other area of law that is not clearly addressed in the Proposed Rule.7.     ConclusionThe Proposed Rule seeks to unilaterally expand the scope of the law contrary to the text of Title IX and Congressional intent. The proposal would harm women and girls, violate First Amendment free speech, religious freedom and parental rights, and promotes abortion. The Department of Education should promptly withdraw the rule and instead focus on upholding existing law and regulations consistent with our law. Sincerely,###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-finance-committee-republicans-move-to-protect-middle-class-small-businesses-from-supersized-irs,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today joined Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-ID) and all Finance Committee Republicans to introduce a bill to prevent the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from using its massive, $80 billion infusion of taxpayer dollars to squeeze more revenue out of American taxpayers who earn less than $400,000 per year. “With their so-called ‘Inflation Reduction Act,’ the Democrats just gave the IRS $80 billion dollars to hire thousands of new IRS enforcement agents to squeeze more money from taxpayers’ pocketbooks,” said Lankford. “Democrats needed billions to pay for their progressive Green New Deal climate-change policies in their bill, and their gimmicks and games are going to worsen our economic tailspin and higher costs for taxpayers in all income levels. I support letting Oklahomans keep more of the money they earn, not giving more of it to the government for who knows what at this point.”“Democrats cannot achieve their desired tax revenue goals without targeting the middle class, small businesses and taxpayers earning under $400,000 per year--taxpayers who cannot afford teams of lawyers and legal fees--which is why they rejected my original amendment,” said Crapo.  “While advocates promise they do not intend to increase audits on people making less than $400,000, the best way to protect those taxpayers is to turn that promise into law.”The legislation would prevent the IRS from using any of the supersized $80 billion of funding for audits on hard-working American taxpayers, including individuals and small businesses, with taxable incomes below $400,000. The bill has teeth, in contrast to unenforceable, nonbinding statements of intention or unenforceable, vague Treasury Department edicts to not squeeze more revenue out of the middle class.  After strongly opposing the Democrats’ so-called “Inflation Reduction Act,” Lankford spoke on the Senate floor following time in Oklahoma during the August state work period, in which Oklahomans shared their dissatisfaction with Biden’s economic blunders and the hardships they face. Oklahomans continue to share that they are very wary of the potential increases in IRS audits coming for families at all income levels. Lankford published an op-ed in the National Review about the huge influx of IRS workers and what that spells for Americans at all income levels and their federal taxes.###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-cruz-blackburn-push-to-combat-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-for-students-in-dc-schools-,"WASHINGTON, DC  – Senators James Lankford (R-OK), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) today introduced a bill that will protect students in Washington, DC public schools from the city’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Senators Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), and Roger Marshall (R-KS) also joined them.The DC school vaccine mandate would prohibit unvaccinated schoolkids from 12 to 15 years of age from attending school in person. The mandate is particularly harmful to black students, who are vaccinated at a lower rate than other students. DC’s vaccine mandate comes on the heels of two years of school shutdowns and remote learning—which led to substantial learning loss, particularly for students who were already struggling in school. If the DC vaccine mandate is enforced, many DC students may fall even further behind in school.“No family should be forced to choose between the health of their child and their child’s education,” said Lankford. “This not the early days of COVID, the vast majority of individuals have not only recovered from COVID, they have recovered from COVID multiple times. Parents should make health and education decisions for their children.” “DC public schools are blatantly discriminating against black students in our nation’s capital,” said Cruz. “The rate of vaccination for black students between the ages of 12 and 15 in Washington, D.C. is 60 percent – far lower than the city average. D.C. schools has already postponed enforcement of this racist policy until 2023 and they should simply scrap it. Until they do, I will fight for the students of D.C. and work to end this mandate.”“Right now, any news organization worth its subscription fee is running story after story with evidence that the left’s forever pandemic is destroying the mental and emotional well-being of children,” said Blackburn. “Yet somehow, right here in our nation’s capital, leaders are depriving students of a basic education if they don’t comply with the District’s highly-politicized vaccine mandate. Getting vaccinated should be a decision between a patient, parent, and doctor – not politicians pressured by big teachers’ unions and radical activists.”Lankford is a member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee which has jurisdiction of the Washington, DC. Lankford has lead efforts to protect Americans from sweeping vaccine mandates, including members of the military. Last week he sent a letter to the Department of Defense calling for immediate action on deplorable living conditions for service members with religious objections to the vaccine. Lankford also introduced the Stop Vaccine Mandates Act to repeal President Biden’s Executive Order that mandated vaccines for federal employees and federal contractors. He joined Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) and 12 of their colleagues to introduce the Allowing Military Exemptions, Recognizing Individual Concerns About New Shots (AMERICANS) Act of 2022, and he introduced the COVID-19 Vaccine Dishonorable Discharge Prevention Act to prohibit the Department of Defense from giving service members a dishonorable discharge for choosing not to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, which was ultimately solidified in the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, which Lankford supported and was signed into law. ###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-inhofe-move-to-protect-oklahoma-ag-land-from-foreign-purchases,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senators James Lankford (R-OK) and Jim Inhofe (R-OK) today introduced the Security and Oversight of International Landholdings (SOIL) Act in order to provide oversight and transparency of purchases of US agricultural land that threaten national security. Lankford continues to respond to concerns from Oklahomans about the multiple recent purchases of Oklahoma agricultural land by foreign entities.“The state’s ‘legal’ marijuana trade has also predictably attracted transnational criminal organizations to Oklahoma that are trafficking drugs and people,” said Lankford. “The transnational criminal organizations have partnered with Chinese nationals to buy land and businesses throughout Oklahoma. This is a national security issue and a human rights issue. We need to know who is buying our land, how they are using it, and if any criminal activity is occurring.”“Over time, foreign investors, including international criminal entities who are trafficking illegal drugs, have bought up large amounts of United States agricultural farmland – putting Oklahomans and Americans across the US at risk,” said Inhofe. “There is no question that caution must be taken when we consider who buys American land and what they plan to do with it. We need to be vigilant in implementing safeguards, like the Security and Oversight of International Landholdings (SOIL) Act, in order for our nation to maintain security, uphold human rights and increase transparency.”Following Lankford’s most recent trip to the border, he was briefed by the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics (OBN) on the rise of drug trafficking and drug overdoses in Oklahoma. OBN supports the SOIL Act. “The Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics is extremely grateful to Senator Lankford for his continued support of our agency’s efforts to target and dismantle drug trafficking organizations operating inside Oklahoma’s medical marijuana program. This legislation includes critical elements essential for identifying domestic and international criminals who are fraudulently obtaining Oklahoma licenses to appear legitimate on the surface while trafficking their marijuana to black markets throughout the United States. My agency is committed to working closely with Oklahoma’s Congressional Delegation, as well as our federal law enforcement partners to combat these drug trafficking organizations that are attempting to gain a foothold in our state,” said OBN Director Donnie Anderson.BackgroundThe SOIL Act deters criminal investment in US agriculture by:Lankford introduced an amendment to Democrats’ so-called “Inflation Reduction Act” that would end federal subsidies for farmland held by certain foreign entities. Lankford filed and spoke about an amendment during a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing that would give Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Title 21 authority to investigate drug crimes. The SOIL Act is supported by Heritage Action for America and the America First Policy Institute.###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-scott-push-back-on-anti-school-choice-rule-that-negatively-impacts-charter-schools,"WASHINGTON, DC  – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) joined Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) and 20 colleagues in introducing Congressional Review Act (CRA) legislation to nullify the Biden Administration’s new rules adding burdensome requirements to charter schools seeking funding.“It’s vital for parents to pick the best education outcomes for their children from charter, public, private, parochial, home school, and others to make sure students can get what they need to succeed,” said Lankford. “The left wants parents out of the process of choosing what’s best for their kids’ education and instead wants Washington, DC, bureaucrats and teachers’ unions to make those choices. Biden’s Department of Education continues to make burdensome rules and use intimidation tactics to remove and restrict choices for parents. We should address the needs of our public schools everywhere, but we cannot leave kids behind while they wait on us.”“Time and time again, this Administration has bowed to big-labor unions and liberal extremists at the expense of children’s futures. Now they are outdoing themselves with rules that will undermine charter schools — tuition-free, top-notch public education options that serve primarily disadvantaged students,” said Scott. “Support for these schools has never been a partisan issue. It’s time the administration put politics aside and joined parents in the fight for quality education.”Lankford and Scott were joined by Senators Richard Burr (R-NC), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Mike Braun (R-IN), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Rick Scott (R-FL), Steve Daines (R-MT), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), John Cornyn (R-TX), Jim Risch (R-ID), Mike Crap (R-ID), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Todd Young (R-IN), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Rand Paul (R-KY), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Bill Hagerty (R-TN).Earlier this year, the Department of Education announced new rules overhauling the 28-year-old, bipartisan Charter School Program (CSP). The changes would place federal, one-size-fits-all requirements on charter schools, making it difficult—if not impossible—for many of these high-quality public schools to receive funding. Despite substantial bipartisan backlash, the administration is moving ahead with its plans, which will strip families of education choice and give more power to big labor unions and bureaucrats in DC.Lankford remains a strong school-choice and parental rights advocate that puts parents at the helm of their kids’ education. When these new rules were under consideration, he urged the Department of Education to reconsider proposed rules redefining the Charter School Program. He stood firmly for parental rights and school choice when he called for the Senate to immediately pass his resolution to support parents having the freedom to choose the best educational environment for their kids and remain in control of whether or not they want their children exposed to “woke” ideologies at school, including Critical Race Theory and others. Democrats blocked the Senate from unanimously standing up for American parents. Lankford introduced the resolution to recognize the need to stand up for parents’ choices in their children’s education during National School Choice Week earlier this year. Lankford introduced a resolution supporting parents’ rights after the Biden Administration politicized and weaponized the Justice Department by threatening to use federal law enforcement resources to intimidate and silence parents who speak out to protect their children from harmful curricula like Critical Race Theory being pushed by Biden and the far left. Lankford joined his colleagues to send a letter demanding answers from US Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona on reports that he played a key role in orchestrating a letter from the National School Boards Association (NSBA) that called concerned parents “domestic terrorists.” Lankford led a letter to the Department of Justice demanding that the Attorney General rescind the memorandum that weaponized federal law enforcement against concerned parents.###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-says-oklahomans-dissatisfied-with-direction-dc-is-taking-our-nation,"CLICK HERE to watch Lankford’s remarks on YouTube.CLICK HERE to watch Lankford’s remarks on Rumble.WASHINGTON, DC – After traveling the state during August work-period, Senator James Lankford (R-OK) brought perspectives from across Oklahoma back to Washington, DC, on a variety of issues. During his travels around the state, Lankford visited with nursing homes, business owners, teachers, manufacturers, veterans, active duty service members, social services providers, agricultural producers, energy producers, and more. One common theme Lankford heard around the state is how worried Oklahomans are about our nation’s economic future as prices keep going up because of Democrat policies from Washington, DC, and particularly how they will affect those on a fixed income and businesses trying to keep their doors open.For example, compared to last year, according to the Joint Economic Committee, Oklahoma households are paying $593 more per month and $7,115 more this year for the same things, spending roughly $71 more on food a month, $58 more on shelter, $282 more on transportation, and $201 more on energy. According to Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, eggs are up 38 percent compared to this time last year. Baby food is up 15 percent. Butter is up 22 percent. As Lankford discussed in his remarks, those aren’t just national data points, Oklahomans continue to share the higher costs they’re paying for these goods and more.TranscriptI want to go into some comments about some things I heard from Oklahomans in August and thankfully a deep breath moment we were not in session here for a little while. But I first need to make a couple of quick comments for those who heard my colleague from Illinois say that Republicans believe that electric vehicles are socialism, if you promote electric vehicles, and we oppose electric vehicles and electrification. I actually just have to make a quick comment on that. I don't hear Republicans in opposition to electric vehicles. I hear Republicans in opposition to handing companies billions and billions of dollars of taxpayer money and saying, ‘If you’ll produce electric vehicles, then we're going to give you these billions of dollars to be able to do it.’And I also hear Republicans like myself in opposition to say, ‘85 percent of the lithium to run the electric vehicles come from China.’ So until we get our own supply of lithium, we shouldn't be running toward electric vehicles. Because if you run toward electric vehicles and then you’re dependent on communist China for your fuel, that's a bad idea. I also hear Republicans say that our infrastructure is not ready for this. And it’s not some fairy tale on it. Today in California, they're telling people to turn up their thermostats because they don't have enough electric and don't charge your electric vehicles.So what I hear is a little bit of common sense on our side of the aisle to say, ‘We don't have a problem with electric vehicles.’ People should be able to choose to drive whatever vehicle they want to be able to drive and that the consumer will actually purchase. But when you hand companies billions of dollars and say, ‘You only get this money if…’ and if you push people to use a fuel that's dominantly coming from a communist nation, and we don't have the infrastructure to actually support it but say, ‘You need to get it anyway,’ we think that's a challenge.The market is going to drive this. People will make choices. And the market will be able to keep up, but when government arbitrarily pushes that forward faster, that causes a problem in our economy. And we've seen it already.Now, as I traveled around the state, our state like several other states, go back to school early. It's always funny to me when I return after Labor Day and people are talking about their kids going to school this week, and I always smile and say, ‘Our kids returned to school three weeks ago, actually.’ So August is a great time to be able to see families getting organized, people heading back to school, talking to teachers and superintendents, and talking about their hope and prayer for a normal school year where there aren't mask mandates and all the things coming down on them. It's a time for me to actually have some evenings to be able to stand out in the yard and be able to talk to my neighborhoods.It's great to be able to visit and catch up. To be able to chat with someone in my Sunday school class and be able to hold their young child and to be able to look in the face of a new baby. To have the opportunity to be able to be home and stand in a funeral home with a law enforcement officer who was murdered in the line of duty.It's an opportunity to be able to talk to some of our our electric cooperatives, getting power to our rural areas and making such a difference. It’s an opportunity to stand and pray with a cancer survivor in Guymon who has had a really bad couple of years. That’s been tough.It’s the opportunity to be able to visit with an aerospace company in Oklahoma, in fact several, that are doing the technology and the innovation that are making quite a difference in both our national security and our own aerospace safety. To visit with small business owners that are making things work in a very tough economy based on their work, not based on what's happening in Washington, DC—based on their work.August is an opportunity to go visit stockyards, feed lots, get a chance to be able to talk to folks that are every day making our food supply work. It’s an opportunity to be able to visit with big companies based in Oklahoma that have large facilities like Amazon, Macy’s, major companies that are out there that are doing business across our state and quite frankly to be able to interact with companies that are just as large that are also coming towards my great state in Oklahoma because it's a great place to be able to do business.Those individuals that I got a chance to be able to visit with in the fire training center. Many of them volunteers that come to this fire training center that they want to be able to learn better about how to be able to fight fire because this is literally neighbors taking care of neighbors. I hear so much conversation in Washington, DC, about how Washington, DC, is solving all the problems of the country. But when I meet with volunteer firefighters, they know full well, it’s everybody taking care of everybody’s neighbors, doing what they can to be able to help each other.I had the opportunity to both sit in church and watch 25 people get baptized in one Sunday. I saw life change literally happening before my eyes. But also the opportunity to be able to visit with folks in nursing homes, and visit with their staff who are really struggling under some of the mandates that are on them still. I have to tell you—for many of the families that are living with nursing homes, and are dealing with CMS right now and some of the mandates that are still on them. It seems like life is returning to normal in many places, but the mandates are still on prisons, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and Head Start facilities. And for those kids, and for those seniors, it’s tough. And they’re looking for relief from DC.I had the opportunity to be able to go through No Man’s Land Beef Jerky, some of the best beef jerky in the country, you ought to try it sometime for folks that haven’t. You walk through No Man’s Land Beef Jerky, and there’s a lot of meat there, let me just tell you. As they’re hand-trimming each section, de-hydrating and preparing it, for customers all over the country and, quite frankly, many places all around the world.To be able to visit with VA Centers, talk with their staff, talk with veterans that are there getting care. To be able to go to our military bases, and to talk with leadership there about what do they need, as they work every day to protect our nation’s future. To be able to visit our inland water ports and yes, there are ports in Oklahoma for those of you all that are not tracking geography, Oklahoma is the farther, northernmost inland ports in the country. And it’s a vital link to the Midwest, getting fertilizer, taking care of heavy steel and supplies, they’re a vital part of our technology and our transportation.There are too many places to be able to name, but I do have to be able to call out some amazing folks that are at New Leaf. New Leaf is a group of people that have dedicated their lives to helping the developmentally disabled. There are hundreds of people that serve there, serving hundreds of people. These are developmentally disabled adults that have hopes and aspirations. They want to work. They have dreams and goals for their life as well—they want to get married, they want to engage, and they want to have friends. They’re a group of people that have wrapped around these families and are blessing them in ways that most folks would never know. It is neighbors helping neighbors.As I travelled around the state, literally from Guymon, all the way across to the east of my state, as I travelled across the state, I heard the same comment over and over and over again: ‘when is inflation going to come down?’ ‘When is the cost of living going to get better?’ From every small business I would talk to, they would talk about supply chain issues, cost, contracts, the prices that they’re selling things for and the prices that they’re getting things for and the challenges they face. NFIB works with a lot of small businesses around the country, they do an optimism index every year. Thirty-seven percent of small business owners now report their single biggest issue as a small business owner is inflation.I got into a lot of conversations with a lot of folks as probably many people in this room did. But I can’t even begin to tell you the number of conversations that I got into that within minutes, the conversation would turn to the price of eggs. To say ‘wow, have you bought eggs yet? They seem to go up every single week.’ If it feels that way for folks, I can tell you it actually is that way for folks. The data continues to be able to show that.Studies show in Oklahoma, relative to January of 2021, Oklahomans are paying $593 more a month right now than they were just in January of 2021. That equals out to $7,115 more a year that each family is paying this year, more than they were two years ago. $7,115—this is a real effect on families. And while all of us are grateful that the price of gas seems to be coming down little by little and everyone’s celebrating that gas prices are only $3.50 now, you understand that just a year-and-a-half ago, gas prices were a dollar-and-a-half less than they are now.The single biggest effect on our economy right now, the single biggest effect is the price of gasoline and the price of energy. As energy prices rise, and they continue to stay high, it continues to drive the cost of every other product, because you’ve got to move products to actually be sold or to be manufactured. Gasoline right now, this July, is 44 percent higher than it was last July—44 percent.And while it has come down, we forget how fast and how high it rose, and people seem to be relieved now that it’s only three-and-a-half bucks, knowing that that’s 44 percent higher than it was a single year ago.The cost of breakfast cereal, 16 percent higher than it was a year ago. The cost of chicken, 18 percent higher than it was just a year ago. The cost of milk, 16 percent higher than it what it was a year ago. The cost of coffee, 20 percent higher than what it was a year ago. The cost of butter, 22 percent higher than what it was a year ago. Baby food, 15 percent higher than what it was a year ago. And just household cleaning products? Eleven percent higher than what it was a year ago. Now, for many people that hear this outside of this room, they would say, ‘Yeah all those things are true, they’re obvious.’ But I have yet to run into a family as I’ve traveled around my state and engaged with so many great Oklahomans, I didn’t hear a single one say, ‘Man, I am so grateful that we’re going to have more IRS audits in the next couple years because that’s going to bring down inflation.’I didn’t have one. I didn’t have anyone say, ‘I’m so glad there’s going to be additional subsides for electric vehicles because that’s going to bring down the cost of eggs.’There’s a real concern here. People are worried because they don’t know what happens next. For retirees, the latest study that came out, $3.4 trillion has been lost from IRAs in the past year—$3.4 trillion.So the mix that we have right now are individuals that are worried about just paying for the next thing when the cost of living for them is $7,000 more this year than it was last year, just trying to be able to keep up. And the challenge for retirees watching the value of their retirement go down as many that are on a fixed income also realize costs have gone up dramatically.It’s real, and people do feel it. And while in Oklahoma I interacted with lots of folks that are neighbors taking care of neighbors, there’s a very real concern about Washington, DC, and what they will do to them rather than for them. And people are worried about it.I would tell you we as leaders have a responsibility to be able to set a direction, to be able to take care of other people’s money. That’s the tax dollars that are there. That’s other people’s money. To be able to manage the debt of this nation that is accelerating dramatically in the past several years, much of it due to COVID, much of it not.We have some responsibilities to take care of. And I hope everyone had the opportunity to be able to listen to people in their own states and to be able to hear what I was able to hear in August.###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-stands-up-to-protect-school-lunch-program-against-woke-ideology,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) sent a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack and Administrator for the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) Cindy Long to oppose a recent move by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and FNS to redefine the Department’s definition of Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination to also prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Lankford says the redefinition has no basis in statute and lacks evidence of congressional intent, saying it needlessly puts children at risk of losing access to lunch by excluding schools from the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) if they cannot affirm progressive gender ideology. Lankford writes in his letter, “Since the Department of Education issued a notice of interpretation and proposed a rule to greatly expand the definition of sex discrimination under Title IX programs and activities, children, parents and schools have experienced havoc as it relates to clear policies in athletics, locker rooms and bathrooms. This understanding of what constitutes sex discrimination has never been affirmed in law. Now, instead of focusing on ensuring kids in need can eat lunch at school, USDA has adopted an expansive and harmful understanding of the law in an attempt to scare schools into adopting progressive ideology.”Lankford continues to fight to protect kids from being forced to participate in the left’s woke ideology, particularly at school, and against Biden’s attempted redefinition of Title IX. Lankford recently stood up against the National Education Association (NEA) for proposing the creation of an “enemies list” at their recent conference based on those who don’t want to teach part of the progressive agenda. Lankford joined Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) and their colleagues to send a letter to Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona criticizing the Administration’s proposed changes to Title IX and urging an extension of the public comment period by 30 days. Lankford also introduced the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2021, which would make it a violation of Title IX for a school that receives federal education funds to permit a biological male to participate in a program designated for the competition of women and girls.You can read the full letter HERE and below:Dear Secretary Vilsack and Administrator Long,I write today to express my ardent opposition to the memorandum entitled “Application of Bostock v. Clayton County to Program Discrimination Complaint Processing – Policy Update” issued by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) on May 5, 2022 (CRD 01-2022). Further, I am seeking clarification on the implications of the document on schools.This memorandum states that USDA will expand Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination to also prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008. This redefinition has no basis in statute and lacks evidence of congressional intent. Beyond this blatant overstep of authority, the document needlessly puts children at risk of losing access to lunch by excluding schools from the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) if they cannot affirm progressive gender ideology. Since the Department of Education issued a notice of interpretation and proposed a rule to greatly expand the definition of sex discrimination under Title IX programs and activities, children, parents and schools have experienced havoc as it relates to clear policies in athletics, locker rooms and bathrooms. This understanding of what constitutes sex discrimination has never been affirmed in law. Now, instead of focusing on ensuring kids in need can eat lunch at school, USDA has adopted an expansive and harmful understanding of the law in an attempt to scare schools into adopting progressive ideology.While I appreciate USDA’s clarification that they will honor Title IX’s exemption for religious schools, concerns remain about the scope of this guidance into school policies unrelated to the administration of the NSLP. Schools that honor safety and privacy for children in sex-segregated spaces, such as in athletics and bathrooms, are concerned that their policies will place their eligibility in the NSLP at risk.It is for the above reasons that I ask for a prompt and thorough response to the following questions:I look forward to receiving your timely reply.In God We Trust,###"

The partnership between USMS and ICE is critical to ensure that dangerous, criminal aliens are detained and deported. Preventing USMS from communicating with ICE would be a dereliction of federal immigration enforcement, and we strongly discourage you from proceeding with this proposed policy.For years, cities and states across the country have pursued sanctuary city policies where they will refuse to cooperate with ICE. These sanctuary jurisdictions ignore ICE-issued detainer requests, and instead release potentially dangerous illegal immigrants into our communities.The Biden Administration’s failed immigration policies continue to fuel a crisis on our southern border. Since President Biden took office, CBP has had 3 million encounters with illegal immigrants at our southern border. Further, there continues to be a growing number of “gotaways” entering the country due to the chaos at the border. Recent reports indicate over 500,000 illegal immigrants evaded capture so far in fiscal year 2022 (FY22). These potentially dangerous, criminal aliens pose a significant risk to public safety, especially in states and communities that have adopted sanctuary policies.While the number of illegal immigrants crossing our southern border is shocking, there are also serious concerns about the number of these illegal immigrants with criminal records, gang affiliations, or terrorist records. So far in FY22, CBP has apprehended over 9,000 criminal aliens, including 53 for homicide or manslaughter, 283 for sex crimes, and almost 900 for assault, battery, and domestic violence. CBP also apprehended along the southern border 126 individuals on the terror watch list and 627 known gang members.Even Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has spoken out against dangerous sanctuary city policies.

As a matter of public safety and public policy, we request answers to the following questions by September 27, 2022:(1)  What specific changes to USMS are being considered regarding ICE detainer requests?(2)  Are you, in fact, contemplating a policy by which USMS would end cooperation with ICE and embrace sanctuary policies?(3)  Who at your agency, or any other federal agency, directed the review of this policy?(4)  Has there been consultation between USMS and its federal law enforcement partners at DHS and ICE? Do DHS and ICE support the proposed policy to no longer honor detainer requests? Why or why not?(5)  Have you collected data to justify this sanctuary policy? What information did you rely upon, and in what ways did you consider public safety and national security?Sanctuary policies pose a serious threat to our communities and to our country. We look forward to learning more about the proposed sanctuary policy at USMS, and hope you and agency leadership will reconsider this policy change.Sincerely,###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-demands-answers-on-new-dhs-disinformation-attacks-after-original-board-shut-down-by-public-outcry,"OKLAHOMA CITY, OK – Senator James Lankford (R-OK), lead Republican on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Government Operations and Border Management, sent a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, regarding the Department’s ongoing needless pursuit of a “disinformation board” after their first attempt failed. On August 24, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced—after being heavily scrutinized by Lankford and others for their vague scope and potentially dangerous objectives against Americans’ free speech—that they would terminate the highly controversial Disinformation Board of Governance.Lankford writes in his letter, “Despite the Homeland Security Advisory Council’s (HSAC) preliminary findings on July 18, 2022, that there is ‘no need’ for the Disinformation Governance Board’s existence, the Office of Inspector General recently made a recommendation that DHS establish a unified strategy to counter disinformation on social media and operate it through the Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans (PLCY). After the OIG report was made public, HSAC released its final recommendations that notably doesn’t recommend a role for PLCY. Therefore, I write to urge you to set aside the OIG’s recommendation and not add authority to PLCY’s broad mandate.”Lankford goes on to cite in his letter several questions that remain unanswered by the Secretary about their ongoing pursuits to address “disinformation.”From the beginning, Lankford stood firmly against the creation and continuation of the Board and demanded hearings from the Senate Homeland Security Committee to provide oversight after an alarming description of what the Board would be tasked to do. Lankford led a letter to Secretary Mayorkas requesting the immediate release of all documents related to the Board. Lankford has pushed to ensure that no funding for the Board is included in the Fiscal Year 2023 appropriations bill, and he introduced stand-alone legislation to stop federal funds from being used to establish it. Lankford grilled Secretary Mayorkas at a Homeland Security hearing about the questionable scope and nature of the Board’s creation. Following the hearing, DHS announced the resignation of the Board’s executive director and has paused all actions until an internal review is complete.  You can read the full letter HERE and below:Dear Secretary Mayorkas,I remain concerned by the US Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) ongoing efforts to centralize agency authority for countering disinformation. Despite the Homeland Security Advisory Council’s (HSAC) preliminary findings on July 18, 2022, that there is “no need” for the Disinformation Governance Board’s existence, the Office of Inspector General recently made a recommendation that DHS establish a unified strategy to counter disinformation on social media and operate it through the Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans (PLCY). After the OIG report was made public, HSAC released its final recommendations that notably doesn’t recommend a role for PLCY. Therefore, I write to urge you to set aside the OIG’s recommendation and not add authority to PLCY’s broad mandate.My growing concern with DHS’ efforts to combat “disinformation” stems from its evident politicized nature and attempt to silence certain viewpoints. Immediately upon his confirmation, Under Secretary of PLCY Robert Silvers started the framework for the Disinformation Governance Board, which was made public through whistleblower documents revealing that on September 13, 2021, the Under Secretary lead a memo to you with the subject “Organizing DHS Efforts to Counter Disinformation.” The additional documents show a lengthy paper trail of meetings and deliberations that, if implemented, would eventually end in PLCY being the central authority of disinformation for the Department.While I appreciate your direction to the Homeland Security Advisory Council (HSAC) to review the Disinformation Governance Board, which as I previously mentioned, affirmed that the Board is not needed, it’s clear that Under Secretary Silvers still believes this work should continue. It does not come as a shock that he publicly agreed with the OIG’s recommendation, pending the public release of the findings from HSAC, to give his office within DHS responsibility to coordinate a unified strategy to counter disinformation on social media over the course of the next year.  In fact, the whistleblower documents give us further insight into his efforts in this space. One specifically distressing revelation from the documents, specifically pertaining to social media was a scheduled meeting organized by the Under Secretary with Twitter executives to “discuss operationalizing public-private partnership” and an “analytical exchange” created by DHS. Regardless of whether the meeting ever happened, the intent of the Under Secretary and his office is extremely telling. It is only logical that DHS remain cautious and skeptical of the OIG’s recommendation to task PLCY with anything related to disinformation on social media.Considering the broad authority of PLCY in tandem with the Under Secretary’s publicly-known efforts to centralize the office’s authority over “combatting disinformation” Department-wide, it’s only a matter of time before PLCY turns this effort into a de facto Disinformation Governance Board. The American people do not need a sub-department to be the sole authority on what is true.Finally, it’s my understanding that much of the delay for getting information to Congress gets stuck within PLCY’s bureaucracy after it’s gone through clearance from the other Department components. I hardly think it is wise or reasonable to task this office with another job which will inevitably only cause further delays in Congressional responses.Notably, I have still not received answers to questions for the record I submitted from the May 4, 2022, HSGAC hearing where you were questioned and testified on the Disinformation Governance Board and DHS’s efforts to “combat disinformation.” As such, please provide your responses to the following questions no later than COB, September 9, 2022.In God We Trust,###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-demands-dod-take-immediate-action-on-deplorable-living-conditions-for-service-members-with-religious-objections-to-covid-vaccine,"OKLAHOMA CITY, OK – Senator James Lankford (R-OK), a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, sent a letter to Department of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin about concerns he has after reports surfaced revealing deplorable living conditions for service members who have religious objections to the COVID vaccine. Lankford has written to Secretary Austin several times to raise concerns about how the DoD has handled requests for religious accommodations to the COVID vaccine, and his letters have mostly gone unanswered. Lankford writes in his letter, “The news reports that surfaced on August 24 detailing the horrific living conditions of sailors with religious objections to the vaccine warrant immediate attention. At best, these reports demonstrate your lack of care for the service members you lead. At worst, it demonstrates an active distain for and hostility toward them.”He continued, “Sailors recount being transferred to living quarters covered in mold, sewage, and with no access to clean or running water. One sailor testified to organisms living in the stagnant water that surrounds her bathroom. Photo evidence revealed unlivable conditions that no person should be subjected to, let alone our men and women in uniform. These conditions render that of an authoritarian and abusive government, which falls far below the standard of the military of the greatest nation on earth.  “I urge you in the strongest possible terms to immediately take action to ensure that no service member is subjected to deplorable, illegal retribution for exercising their sincerely held religious beliefs. I demand your swift action in auditing and remedying the working and living conditions of these sailors.”Lankford has been working to defend service members against Biden’s vaccine mandate. He joined Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) and 12 of their colleagues to introduce the Allowing Military Exemptions, Recognizing Individual Concerns About New Shots (AMERICANS) Act of 2022, and he introduced the COVID-19 Vaccine Dishonorable Discharge Prevention Act to prohibit the Department of Defense from giving service members a dishonorable discharge for choosing not to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, which was ultimately solidified in the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, which Lankford supported and was signed into law. Regarding religious accommodations for service members, Lankford previously sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin demanding to know why, despite 19,979 known requests for religious accommodations from the COVID-19 vaccine, the Department had granted nearly zero religious accommodations among the service branches. The letter requested a response by February 1. When he did not receive a timely response, Lankford requested that the Acting Department of Defense (DOD) Inspector General Sean O’Donnell conduct an audit of DOD’s COVID-19 vaccine exemption process, and the IG responded 10 days later that an audit would be conducted.You can read the full letter HERE and below:Secretary Austin,Once again, I am writing to you with time-sensitive requests and grave concerns over the treatment of service members who have religious objections to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Just when I thought the Department of Defense’s mistreatment of service members with religious objections to the vaccine could not get worse, it has. Although many of my previous letters appear to have been ignored, recent reports necessitate that I write again, as the living and employment conditions have worsened for service members being unfairly treated by the stringent and uneven vaccine mandate policies forced upon them by this Administration.The news reports that surfaced on August 24 detailing the horrific living conditions of sailors with religious objections to the vaccine warrant immediate attention. At best, these reports demonstrate your lack of care for the service members you lead. At worst, it demonstrates an active distain for and hostility toward them. While I can only hope that these reports are incorrect and that you have in fact not mistreated or discriminated against service members with religious objections to receiving the COVID-19 vaccination by moving them to deplorable living conditions, and holding them there while the litigation surrounding their challenge to the COVID-19 accommodation process continues, I am extremely troubled by photos and reports detailing such actions. Sailors recount being transferred to living quarters covered in mold, sewage, and with no access to clean or running water. One sailor testified to organisms living in the stagnant water that surrounds her bathroom. Photo evidence revealed unlivable conditions that no person should be subjected to, let alone our men and women in uniform. These conditions render that of an authoritarian and abusive government, which falls far below the standard of the military of the greatest nation on earth.  I urge you in the strongest possible terms to immediately take action to ensure that no service member is subjected to deplorable, illegal retribution for exercising their sincerely held religious beliefs. I demand your swift action in auditing and remedying the working and living conditions of these sailors. Specifically, I insist you verify all service members with pending religious accommodation requests are in appropriate living conditions and relocate those who are not.  Sailors who have bravely given years of service and sacrifice to our country do not deserve to be treated as if they are worthless just because they hold a religious belief with which the Commander in Chief may disagree.  As I wrote to you in my last unanswered letter, the Navy’s treatment of religious service members is unconscionable, especially in light of their sacrifice in protecting our Constitution and the religious freedoms guaranteed by it. Rather than honoring their sacrifices and respecting their freedoms, your Department has time and again trampled on their rights with no respect to the oath, laws, and documents that govern its mandate. As each day passes, the COVID-19 vaccine is more irrelevant and the mandate is more oppressive. The mandate is clearly not about readiness, it is about compliance, even if it violates a service member’s sincerely held faith. I expect and look forward to your quick resolution of this matter. In God We Trust,###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-calls-out-biden-for-trying-to-finish-the-wall-under-the-radar-after-billions-in-waste,"OKLAHOMA CITY, OK – Senator James Lankford (R-OK), lead Republican of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Government Operations and Border Management, sent a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas seeking clarification on the Department’s recent decision to close four areas of the southern border wall near Yuma, Arizona, where Lankford visited in July 2022, after previously halting construction for more than two years and wasting billions of dollars.Lankford writes in his letter, “While I welcome any improvements to our national security at the border, I am concerned that the prior instances where CBP has completed gaps in the border wall have not adequately addressed the national security and public safety needs at our southern border or demonstrated effective stewardship of taxpayer resources. For example, when I visited the Rio Grande Valley sector in January 2022, I was surprised to see that the Biden Administration kept the materials acquired by the Trump Administration for completing the wall in a field and had instead opted for purchase and install smaller bollards that many individuals could easily climb.”In July 2021, Lankford released a bombshell report detailing more than $2 billion of wasted taxpayer dollars paid to defense contractors to babysit materials previously funded by Congress that waited in the desert because President Biden refused to finish the wall. Lankford continues to lead in the Senate to stand up against Biden’s open border policies and lack of law enforcement leadership, which he discussed directly with border law enforcement agents and officers in Yuma, Arizona, during his oversight tour in July.You can read the full letter HERE and below:Dear Secretary Mayorkas:I write to you today seeking clarification on your recent authorization of the Yuma Morelos Dam Project. It is my understanding that this project will seek to close four gaps along the border wall in Yuma, Arizona. I visited this section of the border wall in June 2022, and I was concerned to find that DHS had initially planned to close these gaps under the Trump Administration but that initiative had been halted on Day One of the Biden Administration.As you are aware, I published a report in July 2021 detailing that the Biden Administration had wasted over $2 billion from Department of Defense (DOD) accounts on not building the border wall. This amount wasted included costs for contractors to drive out to the worksites and guard the unused steel that had been acquired for the border wall but was left to rust in the desert.On July 28, 2022, you announced that US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) would be closing four gaps in the border wall in the Yuma Sector. The Department’s press release noted that these gaps were previously funded by the Department of Defense’s (DoD) military construction appropriation” that was detailed in my July 2021 report. When I was in Yuma earlier this year, I saw that the border wall materials that had already been acquired under the prior Administration were still sitting unused in lots near the border wall.While I welcome any improvements to our national security at the border, I am concerned that the prior instances where CBP has completed gaps in the border wall have not adequately addressed the national security and public safety needs at our southern border or demonstrated effective stewardship of taxpayer resources. For example, when I visited the Rio Grande Valley sector in January 2022, I was surprised to see that the Biden Administration kept the materials acquired by the Trump Administration for completing the wall in a field and had instead opted for purchase and install smaller bollards that many individuals could easily climb. I also learned from agents on the ground that the materials purchased by the Trump Administration were still in the government’s custody and therefore likely were still costing taxpayers for site security costs for the storage and protection of these materials.In light of the Biden Administration’s continued waste of taxpayer resources, I ask the following questions:I request your response by no later than 5:00 pm on October 6, 2022. Thank you for your attention to this matter.In God We Trust,###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-sounds-the-alarm-on-the-vas-proposed-plan-to-illegally-provide-abortions,"OKLAHOMA CITY, OK – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today sent a letter to Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) Denis McDonough to share his concerns with a not -yet-public Interim Final Rule (IFR) recently submitted by the VA to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) pertaining to “reproductive health services” at the VA, that may attempt to usurp federal law and provide abortions at VA medical facilities.In his letter, Lankford raises his concerns about the rule because of the Biden Administration’s ongoing obsession with abortion and Secretary McDonough’s recent concerning statements about how the VA wants to offer a “full slate” of women’s health services after the decision in Dobbs.Despite McDonough’s troubling statements, Section 106 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 prohibits the VA from providing abortions.  Lankford warns in his letter, “Only Congress can change federal law, and Congress has held for the past 30 years that the VA is not permitted to offer abortion services… Abortion is not and will never be healthcare. Healthcare protects life. Abortion takes life. Instead of promoting the taking of human life, I would challenge you, and others within the VA, to respect the dignity of our veterans and all of their family members, including unborn children, by ensuring services provided and funded by the VA are focused on true healthcare consistent with federal law.”Lankford remains a leading pro-life voice in the Senate to stand up against the Biden Administration’s obsession with abortion, especially after the Supreme Court’s ruling to return decisions about abortions to the people’s elected representatives. The latest episode of Lankford’s podcast, The Breakdown with James Lankford, was a conversation about the pro-abortion lobby spreading false rumors about miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, and what that means for the future of women’s health.You can read the full letter HERE and below:Secretary McDonough,As you are aware, on August 4, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) submitted an Interim Final Rule (IFR) to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pertaining to “Reproductive Health Services.”While the contents of the proposed IFR are not yet publicly available, this step forward in the regulatory process raises significant concern due to statements made by you and other officials within the VA asserting that the agency is seeking to provide abortion services to veterans and their families, despite it being prohibited under federal law.When recently asked whether the VA will provide abortions in states where it’s illegal you stated that “there are 300,000 women veterans of child bearing age who rely on us for their reproductive healthcare. We’re going to make sure that they have access to the full slate of that care (emphasis added) because that’s what we owe them... My preference is that they not face risk to their lives as a result of this decision from the Court. We are going to make sure we are in a position to take care of them.”Current federal law and regulation, however, contradicts these statements and prohibits the VA from providing abortion services. Section 106 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 directs the VA to provide women with “general reproductive health care … not including … abortions.”Despite constant attempts by President Biden and his Administration to promote and pay for abortions, I strongly urge you and all VA officials to ensure that any regulatory actions proposed or issued by your agency are consistent with laws enacted by Congress, including Section 106 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. Only Congress can change federal law, and Congress has held for the past 30 years that the VA is not permitted to offer abortion services. While activists and even my colleagues in Congress—including some who have written to you to encourage you to promote abortions in states where unborn children’s lives are protected, such as Oklahoma—may desire for you to use your authority to usurp Congress to allow the VA to provide, or even pay for abortions through rulemaking, that would be a direct violation of the laws you swore to uphold and follow. Additionally, such action would further erode the integrity of the rulemaking process.Abortion is not and will never be healthcare. Healthcare protects life. Abortion takes life. Instead of promoting the taking of human life, I would challenge you, and others within the VA, to respect the dignity of our veterans and all of their family members, including unborn children, by ensuring services provided and funded by the VA are focused on true healthcare consistent with federal law.In God We Trust,###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-marshall-seek-to-prohibit-taxpayer-funded-abortions-for-illegal-immigrants,"OKLAHOMA CITY, OK – Senators James Lankford (R-OK) and Roger Marshall (R-KS) recently introduced the No Taxpayer Funds for Illegal Alien Abortions Act to prohibit any employee or contractor with U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) or the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) from transporting any illegal immigrantacross state lines for the purpose of procuring an abortion. “In a new low, even for the most pro-abortion President in US history, President Biden apparently only wants pregnant women, including minors, who illegally cross our southern border to be placed in states where they can get an abortion,” said Lankford. “His priority seems to be increasing abortions in America, rather than stopping illegal immigration or protecting the lives of children.”“No American’s tax dollars should pay for any illegal alien’s abortion, just like they should not pay for any American citizen’s abortion. Deportations are the only form of government-funded travel ICE should be providing to illegal immigrants. Additionally, with a major strain on resources and manpower on the southern border, we should be prioritizing activities performed by ICE and HHS that keep Americans safe,” said Marshall. “We’ve seen President Biden and his cabinet secretaries repeatedly abuse their power to enact a radical agenda that is failing the American people. The deterioration of our country will not stop unless Congress acts to put a check on this far left administration”Joining Lankford and Marshall as original cosponsors are Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mike Braun (R-IN), Steve Daines (R-MT), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), James Inhofe (R-OK), Mike Lee (R-UT), Rick Scott (R-FL), and Roger Wicker (R-MS).“A massive wave of illegal immigration is providing cover for human smugglers and sex traffickers. We know that thousands of vulnerable women and girls have fallen victim to these criminals, yet the Biden White House has done nothing to stop it. It’s up to Congress to step in. Joe Biden’s taxpayer-funded welcome package already includes a free phone, free plane ticket, and free baby formula – this legislation will stop the administration from adding free abortions to the list,” said Blackburn “American taxpayer dollar should never go to fund abortion, and definitely should never be spent on transporting illegal immigrants across state lines for abortions,” said Braun.“Rather than getting control of the southern border crisis President Biden created, he wants to ship illegal immigrants across the country to get taxpayer funded abortions. This is a gross abuse of Montanans’ taxpayer dollars and should never be allowed,” said Daines. “The Biden administration’s willingness to act outside the law makes this legislation necessary.  The Hyde Amendment restricts the use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions.  Whether it be ICE personnel or any other executive branch employee, spending American tax dollars to escort illegal immigrants across state lines for abortions is a clear violation of the law.  It must be stopped,” said Hyde-Smith.“The Biden administration continues to push their liberal agenda on hardworking Americans and it has to stop,” said Inhofe. “As if trying to use taxpayer dollars to fund American citizens’ abortions was not enough, the Biden administration now wants to use taxpayer dollars to fund illegal migrants’ abortions. To protect our nation’s integrity and safety, we must ensure that ICE and HHS cannot sponsor transportation for illegal immigrants to obtain an abortion.” R. Scott said, “Taxpayers should never be on the hook to pay for abortions, and the thought of forcing Americans to foot the bill for transportation so illegal immigrants can get abortions is horrific. Just when you think that the Biden administration couldn’t get any more radical, it doubles down by pairing its failed open borders policies with its extreme anti-life agenda. I’m proud to join Senator Marshall and our colleagues in introducing this good bill to protect the unborn and prevent this gross misuse of taxpayer dollars.”“Abortion is wrong, and American taxpayers should never have to pay for it, whether for citizens or illegal immigrants,”said Wicker. “I am proud to stand with my fellow pro-life legislators to protect the sanctity of all human life.”The bill  has received endorsements from premiere organizations that advocate for pro-life causes, including the Family Research Council and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.Background:Specifically, the No Taxpayer Funds for Illegal Alien Abortions Act would:###"

https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankfords-pushes-simplified-application-process-for-federal-disaster-assistance-through-committee-to-full-senate,"OKLAHOMA CITY, OK  – A bill by Senator James Lankford (R-OK) along with Senator Gary Peters (D-MI) to simplify the process to apply for federal disaster recovery aid has advanced in the Senate. The bill would require the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to establish a universal application across federal agencies for disaster survivors who are seeking federal assistance to recover from disasters. The bill was approved by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and now moves to the full Senate for consideration.“Oklahomans are familiar with disasters and the hoops people have to jump through to get federal disaster assistance,” said Lankford. “I’ve consistently heard from disaster victims about how difficult and disjointed the grant application process was in an already burdensome situation. Our bill creates one application on disasterassistance.gov to use across federal agencies to ensure disaster victims can easily apply for assistance while they continue to clean up. This is a government customer service issue we can solve to make it easier for Americans to access the help they need. ”“Victims of natural disasters and emergencies in Michigan and across the nation who are trying to recover should not have to face burdensome, complicated processes to apply for federal aid,” said Peters. “This commonsense, bipartisan legislation will establish a simple, universal application for families who are seeking federal help to rebuild their lives. I urge the Senate to pass it as soon as possible.”“BPC Action thanks Sens. Gary Peters and James Lankford for their bipartisan efforts to streamline the application processes for those seeking access to federal disaster recovery assistance,” said Michelle Stockwell, Executive Director of the Bipartisan Policy Center Action. “The Disaster Assistance Simplification Act is a needed step toward establishing a federal disaster recovery process that is quicker and more responsive to the needs of citizens in their hour of greatest need. BPC Action looks forward to working with Congress to enact this legislation.”“This legislation is an important step toward advancing forward-looking, whole-of-government approaches needed to help communities confront the climate crisis,” said Natalie Snider, Associate Vice President of Climate Resilient Coasts and Watersheds at the Environmental Defense Fund. “We thank Sens. Peters and Lankford for their leadership and foresight, and we look forward to continuing to work with them and the rest of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs to advance similar solutions in the future.”“Across the country, SBP works tirelessly to reduce the time between disaster and recovery for survivors and communities. The Disaster Assistance Simplification Act will streamline federal assistance and drastically reduce the burden of application for survivors in need,” said Reese May, Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer at SBP, a nonprofit that works to rebuild homes following disasters.  “America’s framework for disaster recovery is confusing and frustrating and it prevents many survivors from receiving they help they need - or even requesting the assistance at all. We applaud Senators Peters and Lankford for bringing forth this long overdue legislation.” “The National Emergency Management Association enthusiastically endorses the Disaster Assistance Simplification Act of 2022 which will create a universal application for disaster survivors to apply for assistance,” said Erica Bornemann, President of the National Emergency Management Association. “Such an effort allows for seamless interagency data sharing to significantly increase efficiency, communication and coordination, and substantially decrease lengthy wait times for disbursement of desperately needed assistance to survivors. The universal application process will vastly improve oversight while simultaneously create a more equitable, less burdensome process for survivors already experiencing the most difficult and tragic moments in their lives. This is a long awaited and entirely welcome improvement to disaster public assistance.”The International Association of Emergency Managers strongly supports the Disaster Assistance Simplification Act of 2022,” said Brad Gilbert, Chair of the International Association of Emergency Managers Government Affairs Committee. “The opportunity to create a universal application for disaster survivors to apply for assistance is overdue and will provide quicker, more equitable and efficient assistance to those affected by disasters. It will lessen the burden on the disaster victims as well as the local jurisdictions who assist them. The Disaster Assistance Simplification Act will result in better oversight of assistance and help the disasters survivors receive the help they need to rebuild their lives in a timelier manner.”BACKGROUNDCurrently, individuals seeking federal aid to recover from a disaster must fill out separate and detailed applications depending on the agency they need help from, which can take weeks or even months. Lankford’s bill would significantly streamline this process to reduce the burden on disaster survivors.After a disaster, there are various types of federal disaster assistance that may become available to disaster survivors. For example, FEMA’s Individuals and Households Program can provide financial or direct assistance for housing and the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Real Property Disaster Loans and Personal Property Loans are available to eligible homeowners and renters who have incurred uninsured or underinsured damage to their home or personal property located in a declared disaster area. However, recent analysis found that more than 50 percent of the questions on the application forms for both of these programs are duplicative. These burdensome applications can overwhelm some survivors, causing many to simply give up trying to access desperately needed assistance and pushing survivors beyond their breaking point.The Disaster Assistance Simplification Act amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to require FEMA to establish a universal disaster application across federal agencies for disaster survivors and victims who are seeking federal recovery aid.

A year ago today, the US was humiliated on the world stage when thousands of American citizens and allies were left behind in Afghanistan. We remember well the images of desperation and the pain of our nation as we watched the chaos erupt in Afghanistan. As a nation, we honor the 13 Americans who gave their lives protecting the lives of others.  “Today, the Taliban celebrates their dominance over the people of Afghanistan. Women can no longer go to school, people do not have the basic freedoms most of the world enjoys, and economic opportunity is limited to a privileged few in Taliban leadership. The botched withdrawal from Afghanistan stands as a reminder of the importance of strong American leadership in the world.”###"

OBN supports Lankford’s SOIL Act. “The Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics is extremely grateful to Senator Lankford for his continued support of our agency’s efforts to target and dismantle drug trafficking organizations operating inside Oklahoma’s medical marijuana program. This legislation includes critical elements essential for identifying domestic and international criminals who are fraudulently obtaining Oklahoma licenses to appear legitimate on the surface while trafficking their marijuana to black markets throughout the United States. My agency is committed to working closely with Oklahoma’s Congressional Delegation, as well as our federal law enforcement partners to combat these drug trafficking organizations that are attempting to gain a foothold in our state,” OBN Director Donnie Anderson.BackgroundThe SOIL Act deters criminal investment in US agriculture by:Lankford introduced an amendment to Democrats’ “Inflation Reduction Act” that would prevent foreign nationals from buying US farmland. Lankford filed and spoke about an amendment during a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing that would give Homeland Security Investigations with the Department of Homeland Security Title 21 authority to investigate drug crimes. ###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-scott-empower-parents-to-address-kids-learning-setbacks-from-covid-19-school-closures,"OKLAHOMA CITY, OK – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) joined Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) to introduce the Raising Expectations with Child Opportunity Vouchers for Educational Recovery (RECOVER) Act to empower parents to solve the learning loss crisis facing today’s students. Joining Lankford and Scott in introducing the legislation were Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Rick Scott (R-FL), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Jim Risch (R-ID), and Thom Tillis (R-NC). Representative Burgess Owens (R-UT) introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives.“Kids in the lowest performing schools and in the lowest income communities were the most affected by the COVID-19 school shutdowns; they need education options and they need them now,” said Lankford. “Parents should have the authority and the opportunity to choose the best education options for their kids, regardless of their zip code. Our bill takes unspent COVID-19-related education funds and allows parents to find the right education opportunities to fit their kids’ needs. These kids can’t just wait, and they don’t have a second chance at education.”“States and school districts have only spent a fraction of the education funds they received through the Democrats’ American Rescue Plan—leaving kids helpless as they struggle to recover from academic setbacks,” said Scott. “It’s clear that big-government bailouts won’t solve our education crisis. That’s why the RECOVER Act allows those funds to flow to a much better steward: parents. I urge all of my colleagues to join me on this bill that would empower parents to help their kids thrive once again.”""As pandemic learning loss continues to crush the academic progress of millions of students across the country, only 7 percent of the so-called solution—$122 billion in American Rescue Plan funding—has been spent,” said Owens. “Not only is our nation falling behind as a leader in education, but our one-size-fits-all system is leaving our most vulnerable kids behind and pushing parents out of the driver's seat. I am proud to introduce the RECOVER Act with Senator Scott to bring parents off the sidelines of their kid's education by allowing states to reallocate billions in unspent dollars so that low-income students can receive the targeted support they need to reach their God-given potential.""Lankford’s bill would allow states and school districts to use unspent funds from Democrats’ American Rescue Plan Act to issue Child Opportunity Scholarships directly to parents. These scholarships, targeted for low-income families, could be put toward educational opportunities, including:Lankford remains a strong school-choice and parental rights advocate that puts parents at the helm of their kids’ education. Recently, he urged the Department of Education to reconsider proposed rules redefining the Charter School Program, stripping parents of their ability to choose the best school for their child. He stood firmly for parental rights and school choice when he called for the Senate to immediately pass his resolution to support parents having the freedom to choose the best educational environment for their kids and remain in control of whether or not they want their children exposed to “woke” ideologies at school, including Critical Race Theory and others. Democrats blocked the Senate from unanimously standing up for American parents. Lankford introduced the resolution to recognize the need to stand up for parents’ choices in their children’s education during National School Choice Week earlier this year. Lankford introduced a resolution supporting parents’ rights after the Biden Administration politicized and weaponized the Justice Department by threatening to use federal law enforcement resources to intimidate and silence parents who speak out to protect their children from harmful curricula like Critical Race Theory being pushed by Biden and the far left. Lankford joined his colleagues to send a letter demanding answers from US Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona on reports that he played a key role in orchestrating a letter from the National School Boards Association (NSBA) that called concerned parents “domestic terrorists.”###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-cotton-colleagues-move-to-stop-contraband-cellphone-use-in-prisons,"OKLAHOMA CITY, OK– Senator James Lankford (R-OK) joined Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR)  to introduce the Cellphone Jamming Reform Act, legislation to prevent contraband cellphone use in federal and state prison facilities by allowing state and federal prisons to use cell phone jamming systems. The bill gives state and federal prisons the authority to implement a jamming system to protect inmates, guards, and the public at large. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC), John Boozman (R-AR), Mike Braun (R-IN), John Kennedy (R-LA), and Bill Hagerty (R-TN) joined Lankford and Cotton in introducing the bill. Representative David Kustoff (R-TN) introduced companion legislation in the House Of Representatives.“Cell phones are being slipped into jails and prisons, but federal policy prevents local law enforcement from jamming the cell signal. That needs to stop,” said Lankford. “After years of work and conversations with law enforcement, the Federal Communications Commission, the Department of Justice, and Oklahoma prison leadership, we finally have a bill to allow states to jam illegal cell phones in their prisons to prevent prisoners from contacting their victims or coordinating even more crime while they are incarcerated. This bill simply allows state and federal prisons to use cell phone jammers to ensure they have the tools they need to combat illegal activity in a prison.” ""Prisoners have used contraband cell phones to direct illegal activities outside prison walls, including hits on rivals, sex trafficking, drug operations, and business deals. Cellphone jamming devices can stop this but the Federal Communications Act doesn't allow facilities to use this technology. My bill would fix this problem so that criminals serve their time without posing a threat to the general public,"" said Cotton.""In correctional facilities across our country, inmates are using contraband cell phones to conduct illegal activities, including running drug operations, facilitating sex trafficking, and organizing escapes,” said Kustoff. “These contraband cell phones are a major problem and Congress must take action to protect the public from dangerous criminals who continue their illegal activities behind bars. I am pleased to join Senators Cotton and Graham in reintroducing this important bill that will keep our communities in West Tennessee and the United States safe.""Lankford has been pushing for a change in federal law that will allow states to use jamming technology to prevent the use of contraband cellphones in prisons. He first raised the issue publicly during a floor speech and pointed to specific examples of how contraband cellphones within prisons were used to conduct crime outside of the prison. This legislation is supported by the Correctional Leaders Association, the Council of Prison Locals, the American Correctional Association, the National Sheriff’s Association, and the Major County Sheriffs of America.###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-strongly-opposes-democrats-tax-and-spend-bill,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today opposed Democrats’ so-called “Inflation Reduction Act” of 2022. Lankford, ahead of a series of amendment votes referred to as a vote-a-rama, spoke on the Senate floor to reinforce that the Inflation Reduction Act does not reduce inflation and does not decrease the deficit. The bill passed by a vote of 50-50, with the Vice President breaking the tie.“A bill that increases taxes on American businesses, adds a new gas tax, hurts our oil and gas companies, hires thousands of additional IRS auditors to target all incomes, gives multimillion-dollar tax breaks to benefit Tesla, and raises the costs to heat our homes, will not reduce inflation,” said Lankford. “Americans face record-high inflation because Democrats are obsessed with finding ways to pass the Green New Deal, hand out new subsidies, and raise taxes. They refuse to accept the reality that Americans are not happy with the economy. This bill doesn’t reduce inflation; it doesn’t reduce our nation’s out-of-control deficit; it gives the federal government unilateral control over which drugs will come to market, forcing drug companies to launch at higher prices; and it will hurt our energy future. I am absolutely opposed to the damage this bill will do to our economy and Oklahoma families.”After standing against the previous versions of this terrible bill, Lankford has also pointed out several flaws and budget gimmicks in the Democrats’ “Inflation Reduction Act” including almost three-quarters of a trillion dollars in new spending, taking Medicare savings away from seniors, and giving health care subsidies to families making more than $200,000 a year.Lankford offered an amendment to take $1 million out of the health care slush fund for FY2023 and use it to maintain Title 42 authority at our southern border. The amendment failed by a vote of 50-50. Lankford also offered an amendment to exempt traditional energy cost recovery allowances, including percentage depletion, intangible drilling costs, geological and geophysical expenditures, natural gas gathering lines, and others from the book minimum tax. His amendment failed in a vote of 50-50.###"

Lankford continues to push for measures to ensure traditional energy is not unfairly penalized through the tax code by Democrats’ progressive climate-change agenda, energy costs actually decrease for all Americans, and domestic supply is back up and running, despite Democrats’ demands in this bill to push their Green New Deal agenda. Lankford’s amendment, offered as part of a package of pro-traditional energy amendments, failed in a vote of 50-50.Lankford also offered an amendment to take $1 million out of the health care slush fund for FY2023 and use it to maintain Title 42 authority at our southern border. The amendment failed by a vote of 50-50.Transcript:This is an amendment from Senator Barrasso and I. It's very straightforward. If you're a restaurant, you can deduct your business expenses. That's normal tax code. If you're a hardware store, you can deduct your business expenses. That's normal operation. Since 1913 intangible drilling costs have been the tax deductions for oil and gas. IDCs, intangible drilling costs, since 1913 have been set aside for preparing the space, doing all the labor costs, the services, the normal business operations—for a hundred years until now. Slipped into this bill yesterday into the base text, strips away the tax deductions for oil and gas companies, what has been in place for over a hundred years. If you're a wind farm, you can use renewable energy credits to take your tax rate down to zero because you can deduct your normal business expenses as well. If you're a coal company, you could use 45Q, but if you're oil and gas, your prices are going up. Americans should remember this bill when they fill up in the days ahead and when the people in their communities are trying to get a job with oil and gas.###"

It is nonsensical to say that we have a COVID health emergency everywhere but on our southern border. If there is a public health emergency in this country, then Title 42 authority must remain in place. Title 42 authority is the last line of defense that our border patrol agents have to protect our nation, and my Democratic colleagues said they agreed with that idea back in April.

Instead, Lankford says this massive tax-and-spend spree will lead to increased taxes on virtually every American, a potential 17-percent increase in natural gas prices, increased inflation, decreased US manufacturing, punitive taxes on small businesses, and higher prices for Americans overall. Lankford cited numerous specific examples of provisions in the bill being sold to the American people as reducing inflation that are almost comically not associated with inflation reduction at all and likely will cause the opposite.One of the Democrats’ touted supposed drug-pricing strategies won’t kick in until 2026, two years before Medicare is currently set to go insolvent. The bill would also grow the auditing personnel size of the IRS larger than the Pentagon, the State Department, the FBI, and the Border Patrol, which means more audits for Americans of all tax brackets, Lankford says.Lankford continues to oppose Biden’s obsession with raising taxes on businesses, even during the worst inflation we’ve seen in 40 years, to pay for his radical climate-change agenda from the failed Green New Deal, which Oklahomans have made clear they do not want.Transcript:Hans Christian Anderson in 1837 wrote a story about group think. It’s called ""The Emperor Has No Clothes."" It begins with a leader that really loved his clothes. Some unsavory characters saw that. They set up a weaving loom to make the finest clothes in the land, but were just weaving air. There was nothing to it. The catch was they had sold the story that if you can't see what they're weaving, you must just not be wise. So the Emperor sends a couple of his advisers to check out the weaving to see what it looks like. They see nothing, because there is nothing there. They all declare oh, it's beautiful, it's lovely, because they don't want to be seen as unwise. Then it ends up with the Emperor preparing for a big parade, and that's where I pick up the story from there. Let me read you from Hans Christian Anderson from 1837. When he tries on, quote-unquote,  ‘the new clothes,’ it says, they say to him, ‘These scoundrels, these unsavory characters. How well your majesty's new clothes look. Aren't they becoming? The advisors all chirped in. He heard all sides. That pattern is so perfect. Those colors so suitable. It's a magnificent outfit.’ The Minister of Public Processions announced Your Majesty's canopy is waiting outside. I'm supposed to be ready, the Emperor said, turning to the mirror. It's a remarkable fit, isn't it? As he seemed to regard his costume with the greatest interest. The noblemen, who were to carry his train, reached to the floor as if picking up his mantle, then pretended to hold it and lift it high. They didn't dare admit they had nothing to hold.‘So, off went the Emperor under the splendid canopy. Everyone in the streets and windows said oh, how fine are the Emperor's new clothes? Don't they fit him to perfection? See his long train. Nobody would confess he couldn't see anything, for that would prove he was either unfit for his position or a fool. No costume the Emperor had worn before ever got such a complete success. But he hasn't got anything on, a little child said. Did you ever hear such innocent prattle, said his father? One person whispered to another what the child had said, he hasn't anything on. A child says he hasn't anything on. Then the whole town cried out at last, but he hasn't got anything on. The Emperor shivered for he suspected they were right, but he thought this procession must go on, so he walked more proudly than ever as his noblemen held high the train that wasn't there at all.’When the facts come out, it's hard sometimes to admit you're on display. That the bill actually doesn't do what the title says it's supposed to do. This time the bill is called the Inflation Reduction Act. They say it's designed to be able to lower inflation and to reduce the deficit, except now it's been scored and it doesn't actually reduce inflation, and deficit reduction is as visible as the emperor's new clothes. The score for inflation stated in the public scoring, here's the quote it, ‘the impact on inflation is statistically indistinguishable from zero.’ The CBO scored the bill and said, ‘it would have a negligible effect on inflation.’ Remember, this is the bill titled the Inflation Reduction Act. The score deficit on the deficit end, after many on the other side the aisle said it would have $300 billion in deficit reduction is less than a billion.But wait, there's more to the story on even that $100 billion. More than 200 economists wrote a letter to Senator Schumer detailing how this bill will not reduce inflation, nor reduce the deficit. Taxing more and spending more will only make the problem worse. They closed by saying this statement, ‘the bill deficit reduction is likely to prove illusionary due to implausible spending phase-outs. In summary, we agree with the urgent need to reduce inflation, but the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is a misleading label applied to a bill that would likely achieve the exact opposite effect.’ What they said was, the emperor has no clothes. It doesn't really reduce inflation. At some point, the emperor has to make a decision. Am I going to keep parading through the streets when everyone knows the Inflation Reduction Act doesn't reduce inflation? Or am I going to head back and fix it?Let me start with just the plan that's in this bill. Here's the bill titled the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. So the plan my Democrat colleagues have laid out, let me give you a couple details in the plan to reduce inflation in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Here's one, up to $4 billion allocated to study cow burping and their production of methane. I'm sure that's going to bring down the price of beef right away. That grocery store price, as I've heard even on the floor today, this is going to bring down the prices at the grocery store by having up to $4 billion allocated to study cow burping. It has $2 billion in construction grants to improve walkability in context-sensitive projects. No one seems to know what the word context-sensitive projects even means, or how $2 billion in construction to improve walkability will bring down inflation.There’s $3,000 for environmental justice block grants to facilitate workshops. Workshops to bring down inflation. Aren't you confident that the price of eggs and bread will go down after $3 billion is spent on environmental justice workshops? $17 million for consumer-related education and partnerships to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By the way, that's not reducing, that's partnerships to discuss reducing. There is a brand-new tax credit for Elon Musk in this, though. I'm sure that will bring down inflation. Tesla has used up all of its credits for its electric vehicles. This bill renews it and does a special perk for Tesla to give them unlimited new tax credits. I'm sure Elon Musk is thrilled about his unlimited new tax credit to him. And I’m sure all of our prices will go down based on Elon Musk 's new multibillion-dollar tax credit that he gets.Again, the bill is the Inflation Reduction Act.There's a new fee on methane, which will raise the price of natural gas, which has been estimated to raise the price of our natural gas to the consumer 17 percent. Seventeen percent increase in our natural gas. Now, let me remind you, this is the Inflation Reduction Act that will increase the price of our heating, our cooking, our energy production 17 percent.There's a new tax on imported oil and new fees on domestic oil produced on federal lands. There's new inspection fees and owners' fees on pipelines. I do not understand how new fees, new taxes on oil and gas are supposed to lower the price of natural gas and gasoline, but that's what's declared in the Inflation Reduction Act. If only we had more taxes on oil, gas, and natural gas, then prices will somehow magically go down.As has been mentioned multiple times on the floor, this Inflation Reduction Act hires more than 80,000 new IRS auditors, with no limit on who they can audit. If you thought that there would be a limit to those people making $400,000 or more on being audited, you were wrong. Now, that could have been in this bill, but they chose not to put it in this bill. There are no guardrails for who can be audited by the IRS with billions of dollars being allocated to new IRS agents. Every single American of every income bracket, every small business, every large company, everyone is going to experience new IRS audits in the days ahead.So, remember this night. Remember this night. In the next 10 years, when you get an IRS audit, it was the Democrats in this body that sent the IRS to your house. So keep your records, because IRS audits are about to dramatically go up due to the gift of the Inflation Reduction Act. Maybe this bill should instead be called the CPA Hiring Act, because I assume millions of taxpayers who struggle under our complicated tax code already will now have to hire a CPA to know their chances of being audited are greatly increasing now. And they know the complicated rules of the IRS.Most taxpayers that I talk to submit their tax form every year and hope they got it right, because it's so complicated. But because of this night, and this vote, there will be auditors coming after you to make sure that you got it right. Democrats in the days ahead, when the IRS comes to this body for a hearing, will be asking them, did they pull in additional money based on the audits they gave them? Because they're not telling you this, but they assume the IRS will collect $200 billion more once they give them these new auditors. You can be assured that's going to be a metric that is going to be checked in the days ahead.The IRS will suddenly be like the small-town police force that has a quota of writing tickets on the highway through their small town to help pay for the new city hall meeting. You got to pay for city hall, you need to write more tickets on the highway. It's about to be that with the IRS. They need to audit more, go get more, because we gave you more people. Remember, this is the Inflation Reduction Act. I've yet to figure out how Americans getting more audits reduces inflation, but as advertised this is going to bring down the cost of groceries, this is going to bring down the cost of gas by more people getting audited by the IRS.One of the other interesting plans in this bill to reduce inflation is to force more Americans to join a union. Now, I have to tell you, I have no angst against unions. Unions are a choice. Those individuals should be able to choose to join a union, be part of collective bargaining. That's an American right and privilege. Let me say this, 10.3 percent of the American workforce is union—10.3 percent. The energy portion of this bill, which is billions and billions and billions of dollars. In the energy portion of this bill, unions get billions of dollars, nonunion workers get nothing.So if you work in the energy sector right now, and you're not a union employee, you're about to get cut out. Because the way this bill is written, it gives federal payouts to companies that use union laborers, which will make nonunion energy companies un-competitive and will force them out of business or force them to unionize. This should be called the Mandatory Union Bill of 2022, not the Inflation Reduction Act. Because I’m not sure how forcing more people into a union reduces inflation, but that's a major portion of this bill. I'm confident the union bosses across this country are thrilled to finally see a return on their investment since they gave heavily to democrats in 2022 to get them elected. This is their payoff. They'll no longer be 10.3 percent of workers in unions. This is going to force more companies to have to unionize or they will not be able to survive because of the federal credits that only go to companies that hire union labor. This forced unionization sound like the solution to inflation reduction to you? It does to apparently half this body.It creates a subsidy in health insurance to be announced right before the fall elections this fall. It's not for those that are in poverty. Those that are in poverty all the way up to a full 100 percent in poverty already get health subsidies. This is not at folks at the poverty level, 200 percent, 300 percent, or 400 percent of poverty. This is a family of four making $200,000 that will get this healthcare subsidy. What do the economists think will happen with this new subsidy? They believe employers will drop health insurance and  push employees under the affordable care act policies and will shift more and more people on to the government rolls.Remember, this is the Inflation Reduction Act. As homelessness increases across the nation right now, the bill adds $1 billion into HUD for zero emissions electricity generation in affordable housing, that’s what it’s called. Zero emission electricity generation in affordable housing. It's not about increasing access to housing for those that are homeless, it's solar panels in public housing. I'm confident the people that are living on the street, trying to survive a 9 percent inflation rate, are really hoping they can find someplace with a solar panel. But that's what's in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, is solar panels in public housing, that’s their solution to solving inflation.While many of us have been pushing back hard to block China from buying more land in the United States, this bill actually gives ag subsidies to landowners regardless of who is the owner of the land. They don't have to be a US citizen. They don't have to be American ownership. We're literally opening up that owners of land to be able to get access to it.I've also heard over and over again that there are no new taxes in the Inflation Reduction Act. I've heard that in national media, from my Democrat colleagues saying it over and over again and on this floor. Well, that seems to be true if you're a green energy company, that is true there is no new taxes for you. They'll have huge tax breaks. While there is a push for everyone to have a 15 percent minimum tax, that's not exactly true to those folks in these green energy companies that are major democrat donors. They will not have that same minimum tax standard. The Tax Foundation found this, this is their quote. ‘On average, tax filers in every quintile would experience a drop in after-tax incomes.’ Let me run that past you again. ‘On average, tax filers in every quintile would experience a drop in after-tax incomes if this bill passes.’ That means everyone in the country. Under $400,000 and over $400,000 a year. Everyone has a drop in after-tax income.One of the new taxes that was just added into the bill today, the stock buyback tax. This is to punish companies that are listed on our stock exchanges from buying back stocks to raise the value of stocks. They buy back stocks so that the stock value goes up. They're putting a tax on them to be able to punish them to try to prevent them from doing this. They make it sound like they're hitting the big fat cat corporate CEOs and guys on Wall Street, keeping the value of stock lower. They're going to really stick it to the man, except, 16 million Americans are invested in a 401(k) plan for their retirement. 16 million. The largest owners of stocks in America are retirement plans, insurance companies, and nonprofits. They are the largest owners of stocks. So the people that will be hurt the most in this new plan to drive down the stock market prices are nonprofits, insurance companies, and retirement plans. 58 percent of Americans own some kind of stock.This is a tax directly and deliberately designed to keep the price of individual stocks from going up. Sure, that's going to hurt CEOs that own their own stock, but it's also going to hurt everyday Americans that just own stock on their own, and it's going to hurt all of those retirement plans. But they seem not to care who they hurt in this as long as they can also hurt CEOs. Driving down the stock market will, I guess, reduce inflation, if that's their plan in their Inflation Reduction Act, is to drive stock prices lower for retirees and nonprofits and individual investors.Another new tax that was added today, a 15 percent minimum tax on businesses that are funded by private equity. I have to tell you, this one shocked even me when it got slipped in today. Most companies that are funded by private money are small businesses, research companies, small manufacturing companies. This does a new 15 percent tax on those small businesses. Basically, if you're owned by private money, you're funded by private money separate from the owner itself, you're considered a subsidiary, and so you get this big tax that’s laid on you. Let me give you an example of this. I know directly a company in Oklahoma that's a small manufacturing company. They're funded by private outside money. During COVID my Democratic colleagues had the same vendetta against manufacturing that was funded by private equity.This particular company, like every other company across the country, during COVID could not get access to the Paycheck Protection Program because Democrats said, ‘If you're funded by private outside money then we're not going to get you access to that because you're in evil private equity areas.’ Even though they're vastly small businesses. This particular manufacturing company in Oklahoma produces valves. This valve company had hundreds of employees before COVID. Once COVID happened and business dropped off immediately, because they couldn't get access to the Paycheck Protection Program like every other small business, they laid off hundreds of workers.Those workers weren't rich folks. Those were folks turning a wrench and making a great product that a lot of people wanted. They got laid off simply because of how they were funded. Now my Democrat colleagues want to jump right on top of them at the end of COVID as the company is finally starting to come back, and they’re hiring people back, to slap a brand-new new tax on top of them that no one’s discussed, no one’s evaluated. No hearings have occurred on it to determine how wide and how broad this will be.Literally the owners of this company will wake up tomorrow morning because in the middle of the night a new tax got added on to them right at the tail end of COVID simply because my Democratic colleagues don't like any company, regardless of what they do, regardless of the workers that actually work there, they don't like how they're funded through a private individual that funds them.This bill doesn't lower inflation. I listed off all these things. Could a single American go, ‘Oh that’ll take down inflation, that’ll work?’ None of those things take down inflation.It also doesn't reduce the deficit. Their plan for reducing the deficit—brace yourself for this—their plan for reducing the deficit is not doing programs they were already not going to do. That's their plan. That's the deficit reduction. Let me give you an example of this. Let's say you were going through Walmart shopping, and you're at your shopping cart and you step aside to be able to get something off your shelf. When you step back somebody stuffed in your basket a big bag of Brussel sprouts. Now, you didn’t put them in there. Someone else put them in there. As you go through the aisle, you look down and you see this big bag of Brussel sprouts. Now, I don't know about you. I don't want a bag of frozen Brussel sprout. Maybe some of you love those. Great. But if somebody slipped a bag of frozen Brussel sprouts into my cart I would put it back up. I would put that away and say, ‘I’m not going to buy that. Somebody else put that into my cart.’ Here's what I wouldn't say. I wouldn't say, ‘Somebody put a bag of frozen Brussel sprouts in my cart. I'm going to put them back on the shelf. That's deficit reduction in my account.’ I wouldn’t say that.And here's what I mean by that. During the end of the Trump Administration, they laid the groundwork for seniors to get a rebate at the pharmacy counter for Medicare prescriptions to make sure that every senior got a discount at the pharmacy counter. That was the plan, that’s what the Trump Administration put in place. When the Biden Administration came in they didn't like that plan for seniors to get a discount at the pharmacy counter, so they set that plan aside and said, ‘We're not going to do that.’ And instead they've come up with this new plan, I’ll explain in just a second. But they're saying because they didn't do the plan that Trump was planning to do, because they didn't do that plan, that's $100 billion in savings by not buying what they never intended to buy, ever.Let me just tell you: if you don't buy the Brussel sprouts, you just don't have the Brussel sprouts, but you're not saving money from that. You just didn't get them. That's not real savings. So when they say it's deficit reduction it's because they're not doing what they said they said they're not going to do, and now they’re magically calling it deficit reduction. That’s not real reduction of the deficit. That's a budget gimmick in Washington, DC, a huge budget gimmick. Can I just say the emperor has no clothes. It's not real.In its place, of this rebate rule, in its place, they've created a real method of price controls for some drugs, and it's not price and negotiations. It's price controls. They're spending $3 billion to set up a system for the government to be able to select prices on one of the most used drugs in America. By the way, it starts in 2026, is when this starts. So I've heard some people on the floor say, ‘We're going to have lower prices right away.’ This plan starts in 2026. it wouldn't affect anyone’s pharmaceuticals until 2027. So if you're planning on reduction in prices, it's not coming soon. It's five years away, if there's a price decrease at all.The way it's set up is the president, whoever that may be five years from now, will have a new authority not to negotiate prices in the next ten years. It's not a negotiation. It's setting the price because if you disagree with the next president, whoever the next president is, and what they set on the price, they can raise the taxes on your company 95 percent. So if you disagree with the price that they pick, whoever the next president is, what they pick for the price, then your company gets hit with a 95 percent tax. How does that sound for government sheer power over a company? To crush whoever they choose. That's how this is set up. ‘You don't follow what I say, we will crush your company.’What does that mean for the future? Drug companies will have new incentives to not use existing drugs for new treatments because here's how it typically works. If a cancer drug works for lung cancer, then they start experimenting with others types of cancer to see if it works on those. But in this system the Democrats are setting up, if a drug works for lung cancer, they have a disincentive to try it on other cancers because if the drug gets too used, then it falls into this new negotiation category. So the incentive for the drug companies is not to try new ways of using this drug for fear of getting too big.Can I tell you what this looks like in real life? I have a friend at home whose wife has pancreatic cancer. And they are desperately trying every treatment and trying to get into every clinical trial they can get into—desperately. They are praying, and they are working. And he's being an awesome husband, and she's being a tough warrior, going through nausea and pretty awful treatments. They're trying to get into clinical trials, which are already hard. This bill will make it even harder because existing cancer drugs will have a disincentive to test out new ways to be able to serve their cancer. Thank you very much to my Democratic colleagues who are reducing the number of cancer cures for the future. How does that cure inflation in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022?There's also a special little feature in it in the way the drug piece is set up that it incentivizes more IV drugs and fewer oral drugs because IV drugs get more time. Oral drugs get less time, so the incentive is to set up IV drugs instead for the drug companies. So for all of us who would prefer taking a pill, tough luck. Democrats prefer IV drugs instead of oral drugs. So in the future you are taking an IV instead of a pill, it's because of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.Can I just remind everyone that Medicare has insolvency in six years—2028. This Inflation Reduction Act takes the savings from this new prescription plan from Medicare, takes it out of Medicare, it doesn't stabilize Medicare, which is going insolvent in six years. It takes it out of Medicare and moves it over to the affordable care act subsidies. It literally takes money designed for 76-year-olds on a fixed income and gives them to 26-year-olds and their family making $200,000 a year. That's the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.By the way, did I mention again those subsidies land right before the election this fall? This bill is three-quarters of a trillion dollars that not a single person in this chamber has read—755 pages of it that came out a few hours ago. The media, who also hasn't read this bill, continues to be able to talk about what a great plan it is for inflation reduction. They continue to praise the bill, though they've read the same things. It doesn't reduce inflation, it doesn't reduce the deficit.They joined in the chorus talking about the beauty of the emperor's new clothes. I'm willing to say what a lot of people in this room know in their gut but they're afraid to say: it doesn't reduce inflation. It doesn't reduce the deficit. The emperor has no clothes. Let's reject this bill.###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-colleagues-stand-up-for-law-abiding-gun-owners-against-atfs-unreasonable-application-wait-times,"OKLAHOMA CITY, OK – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) and eight Republican Senators today sent a letter to the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) Steven Dettelbach to share their concerns that ATF has accumulated a significant backlog of Form 4 and Form 1 applications. ATF requires these forms in order to transfer a National Firearms Act (NFA) item, which includes sound suppressors, from a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) to a law-abiding citizen. The current wait time for processing paper applications is one year, and processing for an electronic form takes more than three months, which the Senators say is unacceptable. The Senators also raise concerns that ATF’s proposed stabilizing brace rule will make this backlog even more significant and cause even longer delays.Joining Lankford in sending the letter were Senators Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Mike Braun (R-IN), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Jim Risch (R-ID), Todd Young (R-IN), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Joni Ernst (R-IA), and Ted Cruz (R-TX).The Senators write, “Law-abiding citizens should not have to wait a year to receive approval to own a firearm to which they are lawfully entitled… It is estimated that at least 1.4 million Americans own at least 3 million stabilizing braces. We are deeply concerned that ATF is not equipped to manage the anticipated Form 1 applications that may result from this rule.”Lankford continues to stand up for Oklahomans’ Second Amendment rights. Lankford voted against gun-control advocate Dettelbach to lead ATF after the White House pulled its previous nominee, David Chipman, whom Lankford also opposed. Lankford has called on ATF to provide answers on their recent actions that prevent law-abiding citizens from creating and owning sound suppressors.Lankford joined a letter to ATF expressing concern over their use of secret internal guidance to push new regulations. This secret guidance has been used to justify the seizure of lawfully owned property, which is unacceptable and not in accordance with the Constitution. Lankford introduced a Congressional Review Act (CRA) joint resolution of disapproval to prohibit ATF from implementing a new rule to expand firearm definitions.In April, Lankford introduced the Pistol Brace Protection Act, which would gut an upcoming final rule by the ATF by exempting pistol braces from regulation under the NFA. The bill eliminates subjective standards that exist in federal law that have allowed ATF to reclassify firearms under the NFA, and guarantees that law-abiding gun owners will not have to register, destroy, or surrender their pistol brace.You can read the full text of the letter HERE and below:Dear Director Dettelbach,We write to draw your attention to an issue that requires immediate action.We are concerned that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives (ATF) has accumulated a significant backlog of Form 4 applications. This form must be approved by ATF before a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) can transfer a National Firearms Act (NFA) item to a law-abiding citizen. It is our understanding that the current wait time for approval of a paper Form 4 is one year and 100 days for an e-form. This is an unacceptable amount of time. Law-abiding citizens should not have to wait a year to receive approval to own a firearm to which they are lawfully entitled.We also understand that in anticipation of ATF’s final rule regarding stabilizing braces, law-abiding citizens who currently own a stabilizing brace will need to register it as an NFA item using a Form 1. The current wait time for approval of a paper Form 1 is three months and 60 days for an e-form. It is estimated that at least 1.4 million Americans own at least 3 million stabilizing braces. We are deeply concerned that ATF is not equipped to manage the anticipated Form 1 applications that may result from this rule.After the final rule is issued, individuals who wish to purchase a firearm with a stabilizing brace from an FFL must use a Form 4. Given the popularity of stabilizing braces, we are concerned that this final rule will result in an even larger backlog and even longer wait times.We have long been concerned that this rule places burdensome and unnecessary requirements on law-abiding gun owners. It is unacceptable that individuals who wish to comply with ATF’s new requirements will have to wait several months, if not longer, for approval.We therefore request answers to the following questions:We request answers to these questions as soon as possible and in any event no later than August 19, 2022.Sincerely, ###"

Jackson Women’s Health Organization last week, Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today strongly opposed the so-called “Women’s Health Protection Act,” which he has said would be more accurately described as a bill to promote unlimited abortions on demand until birth, when the bill came once again to the floor for a vote.The bill would undo all existing state protections for unborn life and prevents future federal, state and local limits on abortion. It would force every state to be a late-term abortion state. It also carves out long-standing protections for religious freedom. Lankford raised his intense opposition to the bill on the Senate floor. The bill failed in a vote of 49 to 51.Lankford previously voted against basically this same bill in February when he also addressed the Senate about why he stands for life.Lankford has been a pro-life advocate and pro-parent advocate for his entire career, ensuring that babies, pregnant mothers and parents are supported. Lankford has fought to protect life at every stage, make adoption more affordable, expand the child tax credit to the unborn, provide food assistance and healthcare to needy families, fund maternal and infant health programs, and incentivize giving so that local nonprofits can more easily assist those in need.Lankford pushed back on the Biden Administration’s rule to allow taxpayer-funded abortions. He successfully secured language to save the long-standing Hyde and Weldon Amendments, which prohibit the use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions and abortion-related discrimination against health care workers, including insurers.Ahead of oral argument in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization before the US Supreme Court, Lankford met with Students for Life during a prayer vigil. Lankford gave a moving speech on the Senate floor recognizing the significance of Dobbs in the fight for life. He joined an amicus brief signed by more than 220 Members of Congress supporting the state of Mississippi in Dobbs. Lankford published an op-ed ahead of Dobbs highlighting the pivotal moment the case presents for protecting the right to life in the nation. Lankford released two episodes of a four-part series on his podcast, The Breakdown with James Lankford, highlighting the science behind life in the womb and the stories behind the pro-life movement.TranscriptLast week a draft opinion was leaked out of the Supreme Court, which never happens, literally has not ever happened—until now. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court called it a betrayal of the court. That leak sparked protests all over the nation and in Washington, DC, but not because two centuries of protocol in the Supreme Court was violated. It was because the court dared to say that when the Supreme Court ruled in 1973 on Roe v. Wade, it made a mistake.In the draft opinion that was released, it stated that the opinion of 1973 exceeded the constitutional boundaries. For 200 years the legislatures determined when life began. But in 1973, the Court determined that states cannot protect its youngest citizens of their state and created a new standard called viability, a standard that had no statement in the Constitution and no statement in federal law. They literally created the viability standard on the spot.The draft opinion from February of this year states that that should not have been done in 1973 and that the people in each state, in the legislatures, should determine when life begins, and they should have that decision based in law. Apparently, this body, including the Democratic majority, agrees at least with the basic finding of the Court's draft decision because the Court says these issues should be settled in legislative branches, not in the Court. And so today, a week after that draft opinion is out, Senator Schumer has called up a bill to actually vote on Roe v. Wade, and not just vote on Roe v. Wade; vote on a very simple decision: when does life begin?  The real question that comes up is: when is that child a child? Because in the most simple of questions, for those two little ones, which I know, only a short time before would have been in the womb. So the simple question that this body is dealing with today is pretty straightforward: who gets to decide whether she lives or dies? Who gets to pick that?I think she should live.And for that simple statement that I believe she should have a chance at life, I have been called a totalitarian extremist because I believe her life is valuable. What kind of upside down world do we live in when people who believe children are valuable are the extremists? Are the radicals? Are the totalitarians?The day before Mother's Day the headquarters for Concerned Women for America, a pro-life organization who speaks up for the millions of women who believe children are valuable, was attacked and vandalized. On Mother's Day—Mother's Day—just let that soak in for a minute. On Mother's Day, someone tried to burn down a pregnancy resource center in Wisconsin that provides baby formula, baby clothing, and diapers to new moms and provides ultrasounds to expectant moms. That facility, they attempted to burn down, and then they spray-painted on the wall outside the building, ‘If abortions aren't safe, then you aren't either.’Instead of that being condemned by the media, a journalist from Rewire saw the news story on the attack in Wisconsin and immediately tweeted out, ‘More of this. May these people never know a moment of peace or safety until they rot in the ground.’ Also on Mother’s Day, protesters showed up at Catholic churches around the country to protest the Catholic Church’s stand for this little girl and for life. Protesters also showed up over and over in the last week at the justices' homes to chant on bullhorns and to threaten the justices because they dare to follow the Constitution.A CNN commentator tweeted out, ‘Concrete barriers being put up around the Supreme Court. Now we just need to lock them in there and keep them away from us. Cut off their internet access so they can't send us any more opinions based on pro-rape judicial theory from the 1600s.’I've heard it all week—all week long on this floor, tweeted out by journalists, tweeted out by the activists. The simple statements like this: equity, privacy rights, bodily autonomy, health care decisions, freedom to choose, reproductive rights, basic civil rights. All those are euphemisms for she dies.Why are people so passionate about this? Because it's not just a person in this conversation. She's in this conversation. Her future, her opportunities—that's what this conversation is about. And for that, I’m being called a radical extremist because I believe she's valuable.Last weekend when I was at home I ran into someone just out and about. He wanted to talk to me about this issue about life, he was very passionate about the freedom to be able to take her life just hours before she's born. In that conversation, as we got back-and-forth on it, I asked him very simply, you know, its federal law right now that we protect turtle eggs. Turtles, if you destroy a turtle egg, it is a federal offense with a very big fine. If you destroy an eagle egg, it's a very big offense with a federal fine. Do you find that odd? And I’m just in dialogue with this person. Do you find that odd that in federal law we protect an eagle egg, acknowledging that's an eagle inside that egg and we protect a turtle egg, saying we acknowledge that's a turtle inside that egg but we allow the destruction but we allow the destruction of children. And to my shock they responded, well turtles and eagles are endangered, so they should be protected. And I’m called the extremist because I happen to believe she's precious, and just because there are billions of other humans around, I don't think she's disposable.What are we really talking about? We're talking about the right for people to be able to speak out to their elected officials in every state and for each state legislature to decide on the issue of life. That's what we're talking about. If the draft opinion ends up being the final opinion from the court, it doesn't end abortion in America. It pushes it back out to every state and every legislative branch, including this one, to be able to have a state-by-state and a national dialogue on the simple question, ‘when does life begin?’Some people will say, at conception, as I do—and quite frankly as science also agrees with. That's cell division, that’s unique DNA. all the makeups of her life and of my life and every other person in this room’s life was there at cell division and conception in the earliest days. Every single cell in a woman's body is exactly the same. Has the same DNA in it except for those cells. Those cells are different. They have different DNA in them. Why are they different DNA in those particular cells than every other cell in a mom's body? Because that's a different body that’s there, that’s why. Some people believe that life begins at conception. Some believe at heartbeat. Some people believe at 15 weeks, as the Mississippi law is challenging. Some people believe at viability. Others at birth. Why don't we have that conversation? Why don't we have that dialogue?Because, quite frankly, as I think about life and I look at this baby and I look at this baby, for some reason there's a whole bunch of people that say that baby is alive and that baby is tissue and not alive. Some people would look at this baby and this baby and would say, totally different, completely different. This baby is alive and needs to be protected, and that baby is just tissue. Which is so strange to me because that baby and that baby look a lot alike to me. I can count fingers on both.In fact, as funny as it is, they're both in the same position, which by the way, for my wife and I, we call this the touchdown position, how babies sleep with their hands up over their heads—and lots of babies do that, including mine did. This baby is in the touchdown position and sleeping. Look, this one is, too. What's the difference between these two? I don't see this as alive and tissue. That looks a lot like a baby to me. And for that I’m called the extremist and the radical. This baby sucks their thumb in the womb, responds to their mom's voice, feels pain, has unique fingerprints, has unique DNA, kicks around like crazy. What's the difference between those two? Time. That's it. That's the only difference—just time.So what's been brought to the floor today? What's been brought to the floor today is this bill. This bill, the Woman's Health Protection Act of 2022. Interestingly enough, that's the last time this bill uses the word woman. It doesn't use the word woman any time after the title. It stops after that, I find that interesting. Let me talk you through a couple of things that are in this bill.Section 2 of the bill defines abortion services and details it out but also has a nice little note that's tucked into the definition here. It defines viability. It says the term viability means the point in a pregnancy at which in the good faith and medical judgment of the treating health care provider, based on the particular facts of the case before the health care provider there's a reasonable likelihood of sustained fetal survival outside the uterus with or without artificial support. Interestingly enough, it just basically says, the doctor that's there, that's providing the abortion, can determine when the child is viable or not viable. We all get the joke on this. We know what this really means. This bill is not about viability. This bill is about whatever age at whatever time anyone wants to perform an abortion at any moment.In my state, we're a state that has medical marijuana laws. They say it's not recreational marijuana. It's medical marijuana. You have to have a medical prescription from a doctor to be able to get it. So you know how you get it? The medical marijuana place actually has a doctor that you can just call that will write a scrip to you, that will write it for no matter what. You can say my left toe hurts every other Thursday, and they would say great, that's a medical condition, and you get the scrip for it. So we get the joke.If the person who’s actually selling the product is the one who’s actually prescribing it that means you can do it at any point and this bill itself protects that individual saying they can define viability and they're protected in their definition of it. So this bill is not about protecting children prior to viability. This bill is about aborting at every single stage of pregnancy, all the way up to the end. No matter how late that abortion is.The bill doesn't just stop there. Not only is there no limit to restriction or restriction on abortion, and it gives a statutory right to abortion, even though 71% of Americans believe there should be some limits to abortion, this bill says, no, there can't be. And then it reaches into every state and abolishes any restrictions that may be on abortion at all, in any state. For instance, if a state says there has to be more information given to the woman, like an ultrasound, or just give information about this child, it abolishes that. So a state cannot inform the mom before the abortion. That's prohibited.It also abolishes any other restriction on telemedicine. It abolishes any requirement any state has on safety or healthy. It used to be, I heard the term from the pro-abortion crowd, safe, legal, and rare. This strips away the safe term on it, and just says every restriction that's out there on safety has to be stripped away. No state can put a restriction out there on this. It takes away any right of any state to actually restrict abortions being carried out on minors without parental consent. It strips away any kind of waiting period laws. And it also strips away religious exemptions.What does that mean? If a doctor or physician says I don't want to carry out an abortion, I believe that’s really a child right there, not just a lump of tissue, that doctor says for their conscience's sake. For this bill, I’m sorry your conscience doesn't matter anymore. This strips away all conscience protections. In fact, what's interesting is the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was passed in 1993 and it's never ever been exempted until this bill. This bill literally reaches into the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and says your religious conscience doesn't matter. It's an abortion, get over it. That's what this bill says.This is not some simple codifying Roe bill. This is telling the nation I’m sorry, you may think that little girl is a little girl and is valuable. We think she's disposable. No. Pro-life members here like myself have fought to make adoption more affordable, expand the child tax credit for the unborn, continue to provide assistance, food, health care to needy families, maternal health. We should all be working to support women in very difficult days—but she matters in this conversation. We can't lose track of that. Mother Teresa once made the comment ‘if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another?’ You may say well that's Mother Teresa's opinion that that child is a child. I would also tell you it’s Joe Biden’s as well.Joe Biden also made the statement just last week, ‘The Dobbs decision is about the ability to abort a child.’ To abort a child was President Biden’s statement. I agree. The conversation right now on the floor is what's her future. What happens next? It will decide a lot. I can assure you I’m going to speak out the rights for every single child, and we'll declare again, every child is valuable. If people call me a radical for believing children are valuable, so be it. But I think it tells us a lot about our culture that I’m the radical one because I believe she has a hope and a future.###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-cruz-colleagues-defend-service-members-from-vaccine-punishment,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) joined Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) and 12 of their colleagues to introduce the Allowing Military Exemptions, Recognizing Individual Concerns About New Shots (AMERICANS) Act of 2022. The bill counters the Biden Administration’s efforts to coerce and punish service members who decline the COVID-19 vaccine and introduces accountability measures in response to DOD efforts to undermine transparency.“Our service members who have chosen not to receive the COVID-19 vaccination face full discharge from the military which means they can no longer serve the country they love because of Biden’s vaccine mandate,” said Lankford. “For some service members, serving our nation in the military is all they’ve ever wanted to do. They deserve nothing less than an honorable discharge from service with our full gratitude and the benefits they earned since the rules changed for them after they joined the military. Biden’s unnecessary mandate is pushing out women and men who have faithfully served our nation and our nation has invested millions of dollars to train and equip.”“It is absolutely unacceptable that the Biden administration is trying to coerce our men and women in uniform to violate their conscience and religious beliefs, let alone on an issue as polarizing as the COVID-19 vaccine. The AMERICANS Act will ensure that these and similar efforts to politicize our military on this issue are blocked,” said Cruz.The bill would require the Secretary of Defense to make every effort to retain unvaccinated service members, strengthen language to ensure service members receive discharge classifications commensurate with their record of service, require the Department of Defense to report the number and type of COVID-19 vaccine religious exemptions that have been denied, and create an exemption from COVID-19 vaccine requirements for service members with natural immunity. The act would also protect service academy students and Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) members in the same way.The bill is cosponsored by Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Rand Paul (R-KY), John Hoeven (R-ND), Jim Risch (R-ID), Rick Scott (R-FL), Mike Braun (R-IN), and Steve Daines (R-MT).Lankford has directly engaged with the service branches and Department of Defense to stand up for service members who do not want to be forced to choose between being discharged from service and the COVID vaccine. He introduced the COVID-19 Vaccine Dishonorable Discharge Prevention Act to prohibit the Department of Defense from giving service members a dishonorable discharge for choosing not to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, which was ultimately solidified in the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act Lankford supported and was signed into law. Lankford previously sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin demanding to know why, despite 19,979 known requests for religious accommodations from the COVID-19 vaccine, the Department had granted nearly zero religious accommodations among the service branches. The letter requested a response by February 1. When he did not receive a timely response, Lankford requested that the Acting Department of Defense (DOD) Inspector General Sean O’Donnell conduct an audit of DOD’s COVID-19 vaccine exemption process, and the IG responded 10 days later that an audit would be conducted.Lankford was joined by Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), and their colleagues to send a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin asking him to provide information on the number and nature of military discharges for not receiving a COVID vaccine.###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-daines-colleagues-stand-up-for-sportsmen-and-urge-biden-admin-against-banning-lead-ammo-public-lands,"WASHINGTON, DC  – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today joined Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) to lead a group of their Senate Republican colleagues in urging the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Martha Williams not to cave in to activists’ calls to restrict the use of lead ammo and tackle on public lands.The Senators wrote, “Policies or actions that reduce or limit sportsmen activities necessarily implicate wildlife conservation programs by affecting state agencies’ revenue. Such policies or actions also handcuff wildlife managers by removing a critical conservation tool while needlessly alienating one of our original conservationists, sportsmen.

We understand that calls on the Administration to phase-out the use of lead ammo and tackle or otherwise reduce sportsmen access to our National Wildlife Refuges have resurfaced following the announcement that US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has entered into settlement negotiations with Center for Biological Diversity regarding a lawsuit on a previous decision to expand access on refuges.As you know, hunting and fishing activities play an integral role in the conservation and management of wildlife and aquatic species. The National Wildlife Refuge Improvement Act of 1977 sought to leverage this conservation tool by ensuring hunting, fishing, and trapping would occur on any wildlife refuge where compatible. Passage of this law has led to the expansion of sportsmen opportunities across the country, including the expansion last August and the expansion currently under litigation.Policies or actions that reduce or limit sportsmen activities necessarily implicate wildlife conservation programs by affecting state agencies’ revenue. Such policies or actions also handcuff wildlife managers by removing a critical conservation tool while needlessly alienating one of our original conservationists, sportsmen. Phasing-out lead ammo and tackle on wildlife refuges would disproportionately affect lower-income households and those that depend on hunting and fishing for their subsistence as lead alternatives are often more expensive. The impact of such a policy would be devastating to the sportsmen heritage in our states.We are encouraged that a sportswoman with first-hand knowledge of the intersection between federal policies and state wildlife conservation is leading USFWS in these discussions and encourage you to remain steadfast in defending sportsmen access. We stand ready to partner with you to continue expanding opportunities for sportsmen and sportswomen across the country.Sincerely,###"

Lankford offered video remarks this afternoon as he worked to feed volunteers, clear debris, and meet with local leaders to assess the damage and the needs of the community going forward.TranscriptI’ve been in Seminole most of the day today getting a chance to be able to see not only what’s happening in the command center, what’s happening with local authorities, which has been a lot, whether it be fire, law enforcement, sheriff’s department, Oklahoma emergency management. There’s been a lot of engagement here in the community, a lot of churches that are stepping up to be able to help.First Baptist Church Seminole is providing all the feedings. It’s just hundreds of people that are out of power, out of water here in the area, and then I’ve been out for a while actually helping clear limbs and debris so people can literally get in and out of their house. Today is a day that’s literally just trying to be able to get to the next step of how do we get out of the house, how do we start getting some debris around, patching up roofs, and trying to be able to keep more water from coming in and taking that first step.For the folks that are here in this community. This is not going to be a weekend event. This is going to be months to be able to recover. So as folks can, they need to be able to come in and to be able to help volunteer because it won’t be cleaned up for a while because there will be a lot of need here for quite a while.###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-recognized-for-his-conservative-excellence,"OKLAHOMA CITY, OK –Senator James Lankford (R-OK) released a statement after it was announced that he was awarded the 2021 Award for Conservative Excellence by the American Conservative Union (ACU) Foundation for his voting record in 2021: “Conservative ideas and values help people in all neighborhoods, from all backgrounds, and from all incomes be better citizens, have stronger families, and enjoy greater economic opportunities. I am grateful for ACU’s continued work to promote conservative ideas and encourage conservative leaders as we work to solve the problems our nation faces every day,” said Lankford. “Oklahomans sent me to Washington to awaken our nation to our challenges and put policies in place for their families and businesses that would maintain our values and promote our national prosperity. I am proud to be a conservative Oklahoman who works to protect life, protect our borders, and protect our liberties.”“The good news for Americans is that there are already dozens of conservative leaders in Congress, ready to implement policies that will reverse the disasters of Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi,” said CPAC Chairman Matt Schlapp. “These ratings are the most comprehensive measure of how committed elected officials are to advancing freedom and opportunity, and we look forward to welcoming more conservative lawmakers next year.” Founded in 1964, the American Conservative Union (ACU) is the nation’s oldest and largest conservative organization. Lankford spoke at ACU’s annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) earlier this year. Over 10,000 activists from all over the US attend the conference annually, making it the largest conference in America for conservative grassroots activism. In 2021, Lankford continued to be the leading voice in Congress for the protection of life, joining an amicus brief signed by more than 220 Members of Congress supporting the state of Mississippi in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which presents the Supreme Court with the opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey and return power to the states in the question of abortion.Lankford pushed back on the Biden Administration’s rule to allow taxpayer funded abortions, and successfully secured language to save the Hyde and Weldon Amendments, which prohibit the use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions and abortion-related discrimination against health care workers, including insurers. Lankford introduced the Conscience Protection Act of 2021 to protect health care providers, including health insurance plans from government discrimination if they decline to participate in abortions. Last year, Lankford successfully blocked President Biden’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office from opening a “sure overflow temporary facility” at the Great Plains Correctional Institution in Hinton, Oklahoma that would have been used to process migrants who crossed the border illegally and release them into Western Oklahoma. Lankford exposed $2 billion in wasted taxpayer dollars to pay Department of Defense (DOD) contractors not to build the border wall while record breaking numbers of migrants illegally crossed our border.Lankford openly opposed and introduced legislation to stop every part of Biden’s vaccine mandates and successfully pushed the resolution of disapproval on the vaccine mandate for companies with 100 or more workers. Lankford sent a brief to the US Supreme Court to outline constitutional issues with the mandates and urge them to block it, which the Supreme Court agreed with.   ###For more information about Senator Lankford, visit: www.lankford.senate.gov"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-colleagues-continue-to-push-for-more-options-in-quality-health-care-for-oklahomans,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK), a member of the Senate Finance Committee with jurisdiction over Medicare and Medicaid, reintroduced the Patient Access to Higher Quality Health Care Act to remove the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) ban on the creation and expansion of physician-owned hospitals (POHs). Lankford’s bill would allow POHs to participate in Medicare and Medicaid as well as increase competition among hospitals with lower costs and expanded access to quality care for more Americans. Lankford was joined in introducing the bill by Senators Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-KS), John Boozman (R-AR), John Barrasso (R-WY), Todd Young (R-IN), John Cornyn (R-TX), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), and Rand Paul (R-KY).“One of the hidden features of the Affordable Care Act passed more than a decade ago was a permanent restriction on the growth of physician-owned hospitals. Oklahomans want the freedom to choose the hospital of their choice, including high-quality physician-owned hospitals, for their care,” said Lankford. “We should not restrict patients and punish providers by forbidding participation in Medicare or Medicaid just because President Obama didn’t like physician-owned hospitals. I look forward to the Senate passing my bill to assure physician-owned hospitals are available to Oklahomans and the nation.” “Physician-Led Healthcare for America (PHA) applauds Senator Lankford and the original cosponsors of this bill for their vision in introducing legislation that would expand patient access to the high quality healthcare services of physician-led hospitals. Expansion of physician-led hospitals represents an immediate solution to help counter our country’s pervasive problem of hospital market consolidation by providing patients a choice of treatment options through expanding our public health infrastructure and its capacity. We urge Congress to step forward and enact this important legislation swiftly,” said Frederic Liss, MD, President of PHA.“As the largest provider of cardiovascular care in the state of Oklahoma we appreciate Senator Lankford’s efforts. The Oklahoma Heart Hospital has been in the top 1 percent of hospitals nationwide in patient satisfaction for the last 20 years and is in the top decile in quality metrics.  It seems obvious that hospitals that provide top tier care should be allowed to grow.  Competition is healthy and artificial restrictions to reward lower performing hospitals and allow monopolistic behavior should be discouraged.  Senator Lankford is a champion of improving health care for all Americans,” said John R. Harvey, M.D., CEO of Oklahoma Heart Hospital.POHs represent less than five percent of the nearly 6,000 hospitals nationwide. However, POHs continue to successfully provide individualized and innovative care in the communities they serve. They remain poised to meet a growing demand for health care access. Seventy-five percent of all POHs have earned three or more stars in CMS’ Hospital Stars Program, and 40 percent of them have earned five stars.###"

Lankford also asked for additional information on the Migrant Protection Protocols program, known as the “Remain in Mexico” policy.The panel of witnesses at today’s hearing included: January Contreras, Assistant Secretary for the Administration for Children and Families under the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS); Blas Nuñez-Neto, Acting Assistant Secretary for Border and Immigration Policy for the Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans; Maryann Tierney, Senior Coordinating Official for the Southwest Border Coordination Center; Benjamine ""Carry"" Huffman, Acting Chief Operating Officer for Customs and Border Protection (CBP); and Emily Mendrala, Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs at the Department of State.After the highest year on record for illegal crossings this past year and 221,000 encounters of border crossers last month, Lankford introduced the Public Health and Border Security Act to require all COVID-19 related national states of emergency to be lifted before Title 42 is officially terminated until a workable plan to replace it is put in place. Lankford also introduced a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to dissolve a proposed Biden Administration rule that would illegally upend the process by which the US government grants asylum claims to migrants.ExcerptLankford: I talked to Secretary Mayorkas recently, and we were talking about his six-point plan that he’s put out, which I have some significant questions on. There’s a section of it—in the six-point plan—that says they’re going to work with countries in Central America for them to be able to enforce their borders as well and to also have asylum-seekers there. I asked him the question of: what leverage are you using on those countries to encourage them to actually enforce their borders? His response to me was, ‘State Department actually is in charge of that,’ so let me ask State Department: what leverage are you using to encourage countries in Central America for them to enforce their borders? What are you doing there for them to stop regular migration that’s just passing through country and heading north?Mendrala: We have strong partnerships with countries in Central America, and many of them are enforcing their borders for their own reasons and to protect their own national interests. During COVID-19, the height of the pandemic, many of the countries imposed public health requirements, additional document checks, and additional public health requirements that prevented transit through their borders for public health reasons for example. We are supporting through our foreign assistance training of border personnel for example to train them on more effective, more humane enforcement tactics. But I would say that most of the countries in the region are conducting those enforcement actions out of their own national self-interest.Lankford: …But that’s not additional border enforcement…I’m asking specifically what’s in the plan, what State Department is doing to put leverage on countries to enforce their own borders? You talked about training that you’ve done in the past, things that they did during COVID years ago. We still had 2 million people last year, many of those crossing through those borders. What are we doing now to encourage those countries to enforce their borders?###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-colleagues-urge-reconsideration-of-russias-status-as-a-market-economy,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) joined Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) in a letter urging Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo to reconsider Russia’s status as a market economy within the meaning of the anti-dumping (AD) law of the Tariff Act of 1930. Although the Commerce Department classified Russia as a market economy in 2002, Russia has backslid in recent years towards less and less of a free market economy. Now after its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has taken further steps to centralize control over the Russian economy. Classifying Russia as a non-market economy would likely increase the anti-dumping duties on Russia in future AD cases.“Russia imposes restrictions on eight of the 11 types of capital transactions tracked by the International Monetary Fund, and since Russia’s invasion, the conversion of the ruble has become only more difficult. Recently, the Central Bank of Russia announced it will prevent banks from selling foreign currency to Russians and limit how much foreign currency individuals can withdraw from their accounts. These edicts are explicitly designed to restrict access to foreign currency,” said the Senators. The Senators continued, “Russia’s economy is also marked by government ownership and control over production. According to Russian government sources, the state’s share in the Russian economy may be as high as 70 percent. This growth of economic intervention by the Russian government tracks the rapid expansion of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in Russia. According to the International Monetary Fund, Russia has the third most SOEs per capita in the world.” Along with Lankford and Portman, Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Mike Braun (R-IN), Angus S. King Jr. (I-ME), Todd Young (R-IN), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Jack Reed (D-RI), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Susan Collins (R-ME), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Steve Daines (R-MT), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Roger Wicker (R-MS) also signed onto the letter.You can read the full letter HERE and below:  Dear Secretary Raimondo,We write to urge you to reconsider Russia’s status as a market economy within the meaning of the anti-dumping (AD) law of the Tariff Act of 1930. In light of Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, as well as the facts on the Russian economy, we ask that you reexamine this issue and find that Russia is a non-market economy country.Over the past two decades, Russia has regressed from a fledgling market economy to one without a free market. In its 2002 decision classifying Russia as a market economy, the Department of Commerce noted that economic decentralization was the “hallmark of market economies.” Yet, under the leadership of Vladimir Putin, Russia has become marked by corruption, weak rule of law, worker exploitation, and human rights violations. When the facts of this backsliding are applied to the relevant statutory criteria, there is no doubt that Russia should be classified as a non-market economy country.Of the six statutory criteria for determining whether a country is a non-market economy, we believe it important, and dispositive, to highlight two in particular: currency convertibility and state control over the economy. It is clear that the ruble is not freely convertible into the currency of other countries. Russia imposes restrictions on eight of the eleven types of capital transactions tracked by the International Monetary Fund, and since Russia’s invasion, the conversion of the ruble has become only more difficult. Recently, the Central Bank of Russia announced it will prevent banks from selling foreign currency to Russians and limit how much foreign currency individuals can withdraw from their accounts. These edicts are explicitly designed to restrict access to foreign currency.Russia’s economy is also marked by government ownership and control over production. According to Russian government sources, the state’s share in the Russian economy may be as high as 70 percent. This growth of economic intervention by the Russian government tracks the rapid expansion of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in Russia. According to the International Monetary Fund, Russia has the third most SOEs per capita in the world.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—a repugnant latest step in its year’s long campaign to undermine order and democracy in Eastern Europe—has earned it a unique status as an international scofflaw. Therefore, we would strongly encourage the administration to use this opportunity to hold the Russian Federation and Vladimir Putin accountable for its continued attempt to circumvent international norms, economic or otherwise, to their own benefit. Specifically, we note that pursuant to the antidumping law, the Department of Commerce “may make a determination [of non-market economy status] at any time.”We believe that time is now and that the facts clearly support this reclassification. Thank you for considering our request, and we appreciate your attention to this important matter.Sincerely,"

The MTI would also prohibit the president from lifting the Foreign Terrorist Organization (FT)_ designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the military of the world’s leading State Sponsor of Terrorism (SST). The MTI passed by a vote of 62-33.Lankford is the lead sponsor of the Iran Sanctions Preservation Act, which is supported by former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and would prohibit any president from lifting sanctions on Iran’s energy industry or financial services sector unless the Iranian regime ends its nuclear program, support for terrorism, or use of ballistic missiles.As the White House currently works to reinstate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or the “Iran Nuclear Deal,” Lankford continues to call out the Administration that re-entering the deal only helps Iran become a nuclear power and creates additional national security concerns for Americans at home and abroad. Lankford and 48 Republican Senators came together to tell the Biden Administration that they will not support the revived Iran Deal, which, according to public reports, will weaken sanctions and lessen restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program.Lankford’s amendment was support by the America First Policy Institute, Christians United for Israel, and the Heritage Foundation. Transcript: We're about to go to conference on what we're affectionately just calling the ‘China bill.’ But this bill does not address China's practice of purchasing and stockpiling sanctioned Iranian oil to the black market. The procurement spike by China’s directly correlated with the spike in terrorist activities by Iran and its proxies in the Middle East. Iran is laundering these petroleum products and illicitly transferring the oil at sea to Iranian tankers in foreign-flagged vessels. Three-quarters of this oil is ultimately exported to China which purchased 310 million barrels of oil from Iran last year. All this is happening while Iran is actually negotiating directly with Iran on our behalf in Vienna. This particular Motion to Instruct goes straight at this illicit activity from Iran that's facilitating the terror activities and also addresses the designation that Iran is asking if they're going to negotiate with the Biden Administration on the Iran nuclear deal, Iran is specifically asking that they get a lift of the Foreign Terrorist Organization on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. That is the group that was attacking our troops in Iraq and facilitating their death. We need to address this and take it off the table so that Iran does not get by with this and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps does not. I urge a yes vote on my Motion to Instruct.###"

Lankford posted about his immediate skepticism of the Board and its purpose on social media earlier this week.ExcerptsOn whether Lankford can expect more details on the Board and its purposeLankford: Is there a written mission statement, a strategy document, a principles, a charter, a job description on this Disinformation Governing Board? Are there written documents to explain what it is, what it is not, and what they’re doing?Mayorkas: …There is a charter. You are correct, Senator, that the rollout with respect to this working group was sub-optimal, and we need to provide more information, not only to this Committee and Congress but to the American public…What this working group seeks to do is actually develop guidelines, standards, guard rails, to ensure that the work that has been ongoing for nearly 10 years does not infringe on people’s free speech rights, rights of privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. It was quite disconcerting frankly that the disinformation work that was well under way for many years across different administrations was not guided by guard rails.On why Lankford is suspicious of the BoardLankford: We have a practical question here. We don’t have a definition of what it is. We don’t have boundaries of what it does. The FBI already does this. The State Department already does this. And the person you tap to lead the disinformation campaign has been outspoken on TikTok and Twitter with disinformation, specifically on election issues. So we’re responding to something that’s unknown, and what we do know is disinformation coming from it. Why should we not have suspicions on this?###"

While we do not know the content of the final opinion, it does appear that the Court is prepared to send the question of where life begins back to legislatures around the country, as it was before 1973.  The American people should determine how to protect life, not Justices. In Oklahoma, we will keep speaking out for the value of each life including pregnant and parenting mothers. Those who work for the destruction of children because they are inconvenient are on the wrong side of history. Each child has great potential and we should celebrate every girl and boy.  “I am glad the Court is also launching an investigation into the source of this unprecedented leak. The person responsible should be held accountable for his or her actions that will devastate the trust in the Court for decades to come.”Lankford has been a pro-life advocate and pro-parent advocate for years, ensuring that babies, pregnant mothers and parenting mothers are supported. Lankford pushed back on the Biden Administration’s rule to allow taxpayer-funded abortions.

DHS owes the American people an answer on who orchestrated this overstep and why.”“The Biden administration wants a government agency dedicated to cracking down on what its subjects can say, an idea popular with Orwellian governments everywhere.

(Citi), following Citi’s recent announcement that it would pay for its employees to travel out of state for abortions. As you know, your office furnishes Citi credit cards to the offices of every member of the US Senate, the offices of Leadership and Committees, and Officers of the Senate to pay for flights, office supplies, and other goods using taxpayer funds.On March 15, Citi sent a letter to stakeholders stating that “[i]n response to changes in reproductive health care laws [regarding abortion] in certain states in the US, beginning in 2022 we provide travel benefits to facilitate access to adequate resources.” In other words, Citi is now paying for its employees to travel to obtain abortions out-of-State that are illegal in the employees’ State. Citi’s decision to finance abortion tourism for its employees in brazen circumvention of State law, shows a reckless disregard for the lives of preborn children and disdain for the will of the people of the States in which Citi acts as an employer.Consistent with nearly five decades of federal policy against using taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions, taxpayer dollars used by the US Senate should not be administered through a company that facilitates abortion on demand and promotes a woke, pro-abortion agenda.

Lankford and Lee are joined in the letter by Senators Roger Marshall (R-KS), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mike Braun (R-IN), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Ted Cruz (R-TX), John Hoeven (R-ND), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Rand Paul (R-KY), Jim Risch (R-ID), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), and Roger Wicker (R-MS).Reports show that more than 1,700 service members have been discharged for their Covid vaccination status and many are being denied retirement or other service benefits as a result.The Senators said in their letter, “While we are deeply troubled that the Department of Defense (DOD) is discharging US military personnel as a result of their COVID-19 vaccination status, we are outraged that these brave men and women are potentially being stripped of various benefits, including education benefits afforded to them under the GI Bill. Whatever disagreements public officials of varying ideologies and political parties may have, we can and should agree on the importance of ensuring the promises made to members of our Armed Forces are fulfilled.”Lankford has directly engaged with the service branches and Department of Defense to stand up for service members who do not want to be forced to choose between being discharged from service and the COVID vaccine. He introduced the COVID-19 Vaccine Dishonorable Discharge Prevention Act to prohibit the Department of Defense from giving service members a dishonorable discharge for choosing not to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, which was ultimately solidified in the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act Lankford supported and was signed into law. Lankford previously sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin demanding to know why, despite 19,979 known requests for religious accommodations from the COVID-19 vaccine, the Department had granted nearly zero religious accommodations among the service branches. The letter requested a response by February 1. When he did not receive a timely response, Lankford requested that the Acting Department of Defense (DOD) Inspector General Sean O’Donnell conduct an audit of DOD’s COVID-19 vaccine exemption process, and the IG responded 10 days later that an audit would be conducted.The full text of the letter is available HERE and below:Dear Secretary Austin,As you know from your decades of service in the United States Army, there are few callings more worthy of respect and admiration than that of those who make the decision to join the Armed Forces for the sake of our country and fellow citizens. Individuals who take such an endeavor upon themselves and carry out their duties in good faith deserve a great deal from a grateful nation. While we are deeply troubled that the Department of Defense (DOD) is discharging US military personnel as a result of their COVID-19 vaccination status, we are outraged that these brave men and women are potentially being stripped of various benefits, including education benefits afforded to them under the GI Bill. Whatever disagreements public officials of varying ideologies and political parties may have, we can and should agree on the importance of ensuring the promises made to members of our Armed Forces are fulfilled.News sources indicate that branches of the US military have continued issuing discharges on the basis of COVID-19 vaccination status, with the total number of discharged personnel already exceeding 1,700. In light of this information, we request answers to the following questions:We appreciate your willingness to respond to our questions on this vital issue, and for the sake of those who made the commitment to defend our country, we ask that you provide the requested information by May 12, 2022. Sincerely,###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-johnson-colleagues-push-biden-to-enforce-legal-asylum-process,"OKLAHOMA CITY, OK – Senator James Lankford (R-OK), lead Republican on the Border Management Subcommittee of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, joined Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) and 29 Senators to introduce a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to dissolve a proposed Biden Administration rule that would illegally upend the process by which the US government grants asylum claims to migrants.“The Biden Administration’s policies have led to a completely wide open border and have made every state a border state,” said Lankford. “With the numbers of migrants coming across the border at a 20-year high, the Biden Administration has no intention of protecting our southern border. This is unacceptable. I will continue to demand the Administration secures the border and follows US law.”“The Biden administration is sending a clear message: our borders are open, you will not be kept in custody, and you will not have to see a judge to stay here. In a time where we surpassed 2 million illegal crossings at the southern border last year and are on track for even more this year, the proposed rule will only lead to more illegal migration for an already overwhelmed immigration system. We strongly oppose the Biden Administration’s reckless attempt to unconstitutionally rewrite the asylum laws in America. The changes the administration is proposing cannot come from unelected bureaucrats, but rather from Congress. I thank my colleagues for joining in this effort,” said Johnson.    Lankford sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on his concerns about efforts to re-implement the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program, known as the “Remain in Mexico” policy for asylum seekers. Lankford has repeatedly asked for information and raised significant questions about whether DHS is following the District Court’s order to resume the program in “good faith.” Lankford is leading the charge to push back on the Biden Administration’s plans to revoke temporary, pandemic-related Title 42 authority as early as May 23 and to stop the ongoing chaos at the southern border amid Biden’s hypocrisy about COVID. After the highest year on record for illegal crossings this past year and 221,000 encounters of border crossers last month, Lankford introduced the Public Health and Border Security Act to require all COVID-19 related national states of emergency to be lifted before Title 42 is officially terminated until a workable plan to replace it is put in place.Lankford and Johnson were joined in introducing the resolution by Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), John Boozman (R-AR), Mike Braun (R-IN), Tom Cotton (R-AR), John Cornyn (R-TX), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Steve Daines (R-MT), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Josh Hawley (R-MO), John Hoeven (R-ND), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), John Kennedy (R-LA), Mike Lee (R-UT), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Rand Paul (R-KY), Jim Risch (R-ID), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Rick Scott (R-FL), and Roger Wicker (R-MS). ###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-to-instruct-china-bill-conferees-to-prevent-growing-iran-china-alliance,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today announced that he will offer a Motion to Instruct (MTI) conferees to the so-called “China bill” that would require any deal with Iran to address Chinese purchases of Iranian oil, along with Iran’s nuclear proliferation, ballistic missile development, and support for terrorism. The MTI would also prohibit the President from lifting the Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the military of the world’s leading State Sponsor of Terrorism (SST).“It is past time for Congress to speak clearly that a nuclear deal with the Iranian regime, negotiated by Russia and China on behalf of the Biden Administration, that allows missile proliferation, lifts sanctions on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, and sets a clear timeline toward Iran having a bomb is unacceptable,” said Lankford. “I want the conferees to hear from the Senate that we do not want the United States to make a nuclear deal with Iran that ignores their past behavior and their present intentions. This is a moment for Congress to push the Administration to demonstrate strength through decisive action, not weakness through negotiating with terrorist regimes.”This week, reports continue to roll in on the ongoing and increasing military cooperation between Beijing and Tehran. Additionally, reports indicate that China is increasingly reliant on oil from Iran—constituting nearly two-thirds of Iran’s foreign petroleum sales last month in violation of US sanctions. Iran’s terrorist activity in the region has also doubled since President Biden took office, showcasing the effectiveness of President Trump’s strategy of “maximum pressure” and the failure of President Biden’s strategy of “maximum appeasement.”Lankford is the lead sponsor of the Iran Sanctions Preservation Act, which is supported by former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and would prohibit any president from lifting sanctions on Iran’s energy industry or financial services sector unless the Iranian regime ends its nuclear program, support for terrorism, or use of ballistic missiles.As the White House currently works to reinstate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or the “Iran Nuclear Deal, Lankford continues to call out the Administration that re-entering the deal only helps Iran become a nuclear power and creates additional national security concerns for Americans at home and abroad. Lankford and 48 Republican Senators came together to tell the Biden Administration that they will not support the revived Iran Deal, which, according to public reports, will weaken sanctions and lessen restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program.""As the Biden Administration rushes to get Iran into a new nuclear deal, it is imperative that Iran be held accountable for its range of nefarious activities, to include documented cheating on the 2015 nuclear deal (the JCPOA), being the lead state sponsor of terrorism, and its ballistic weapons program. Our allies in the region, particularly Israel and Gulf monarchies, feel the impact of these activities as targets of Iran’s proxies. President Trump reversed this dangerous policy by imposing a maximum pressure campaign against the Iranian regime, taking out their chief terrorist mastermind Qasem Soleimani and restoring a strategic deterrent against the Iranian government, and the world was more peaceful for it. Sadly, we are in far more dangerous times and decisive leadership is needed to prevent a growing threat,"" said The Honorable John Ratcliffe and Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Keith Kellogg, Co-Chairs, Center for American Security, America First Policy Institute (AFPI), along with The Honorable Fred Fleitz, the Vice Chair of AFPI.""We are grateful to @SenatorLaknford for his strong opposition to a nuclear #Iran. Every Senator who opposes Iran’s malign activities should support Sen. Lanford’s MTI,"" tweeted Christians United for Israel.“The evil regimes in China and Aidan are inextricably linked. Any coherent US foreign policy recognizes this fundamental fact. It is, therefore, necessary and correct for the Senate to advance strict guardrails on the administration’s dealing with Iran as Congress seeks to confront China. This is necessary for both skeptics of this particular approach to dealing with China and for its supporters. I am grateful for the hard work and leadership Sen. Lankford is exercising on this vital issue,"" said Dr. Kevin Roberts, President of the Heritage Foundation. ### "

SBA determined that these local affiliates of Planned Parenthood Federation of America were ineligible for PPP loans under the applicable affiliation rules and size standards, and that the loans they received should be returned,” the Senators wrote. “Despite this determination, the SBA approved 17 new PPP loans to Planned Parenthood affiliates totaling nearly $40 million in 2021. Moreover, under your leadership, the SBA has forgiven at least 34 Planned Parenthood PPP loans to date. This raises serious questions about the SBA' s management of the PPP program which was intended to provide relief to small businesses. In order to better assist Congress in performing its oversight function, please provide the information requested in this letter no later than 5:00PM on May 10, 2022.”Lankford has been the leading voice in Congress for the protection of life. He has championed the preservation of Hyde Amendment protections for taxpayers not to be forced to pay for abortions. Lankford has taken decisive action to investigate previously issued taxpayer-funded loans to abortion-providers like Planned Parenthood and their affiliates and to prevent it from happening again. In 2020, Lankford joined more than two dozen senators to call on the Department of Treasury to investigate Planned Parenthood’s abuse of PPP.Lankford is Chair of the Senate Values Action Team, which advocates for issues including life and conscience protections, as well as a member of the Senate Pro-Life Caucus.

SBA determined that these local affiliates of Planned Parenthood Federation of America were ineligible for PPP loans under the applicable affiliation rules and size standards, and that the loans they received should be returned. SBA cited the control Planned Parenthood Federation of America exercised over its local affiliates in a number of different areas, such as medical standards, affiliate patient transfers, and an accreditation review process administered every three years as evidence of an affiliated organizational structure. Given that Planned Parenthood Federation of America has nearly 16,000 employees nationwide, SBA determined that these affiliates were ineligible for PPP and requested that each of the 38 affiliates return the $80 million in PPP funds they wrongfully received.Despite this determination, the SBA approved 17 new PPP loans to Planned Parenthood affiliates totaling nearly $40 million in 2021.

https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-cruz-colleagues-oppose-biden-atf-expanding-firearm-definitions-and-creating-national-gun-registry,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senators James Lankford (R-OK) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) along with 16 colleagues introduced a Congressional Review Act (CRA) joint resolution of disapproval today to prohibit President Biden’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) from implementing a new rule to expand firearm definitions. Joining Lankford and Cruz are Senators Mike Braun (R-IN), Mike Lee (R-UT), Steve Daines (R-MT), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), John Thune (R-SD), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), John Boozman (R-AR), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Tom Cotton (R-AR), John Barrasso (R-WY), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Jim Risch (R-ID), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), and John Hoeven (R-ND).The Biden Administration wants to institute a final rule redefining a “firearm” under federal law to not only mean a complete product, but also its individual parts, often included in a weapons parts kit. If implemented, this new rule would require gun kits and gun parts to be regulated as if they were fully functional firearms—meaning they wouldn’t be able to be sold without a serial number or without the buyer having to undergo a background check. The new rule would also require those with Federal Firearms Licenses (FFL) to permanently retain and ultimately surrender records to ATF, in effect creating a national firearms registry. The current standard, which the Biden Administration seeks to change, allows for the disposal of records after 20 years.  “Crime is going up in far-left cities because of soft-on-crime policies. Biden’s response is to clamp down on guns put together in a kit. Federal law already prohibits felons from owning or possessing any gun, including so-called ‘ghost guns,’” said Lankford. “This is another attempt by the Biden Administration to strip law-abiding citizens of their Second Amendment rights instead of addressing the failed policies that have led to increased crime across the country. This action by the Biden Administration is not going to solve rising crime rates. Senator Cruz and I are pushing to overturn this rule and introduced a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn it.”“For the past two years, we’ve seen crime rates skyrocket all across the country, aided by Democrats’ soft-on crime policies and left-wing district attorneys operating like progressive activists instead of law enforcement officers,” said Cruz. “Democrats would love nothing more than to shift the blame and stoke anti-gun sentiment, and create a permanent national gun registry in the process. By introducing this resolution, we’re pushing back—we want to stop the Biden administration from issuing the final rule expanding the definition of firearms and instituting a national gun registry, we want to stop the false narrative that links the rise in crime to ‘ghost guns,’ and firearms, and we want to protect law-abiding citizens who are exercising their Second Amendment rights.”Lankford remains a staunch Second Amendment advocate. Earlier this month, Lankford introduced the Pistol Brace Protection Act, which would gut an upcoming final rule by the ATF by exempting pistol braces from regulation under the National Firearms Act (NFA). The bill eliminates subjective standards that exist in federal law that have allowed ATF to reclassify firearms under the NFA, and guarantees that law-abiding gun owners will not have to register, destroy, or surrender their pistol brace.Lankford continues to stand up for Oklahomans’ Second Amendment rights by calling on ATF to provide answers on their recent actions that prevent law-abiding citizens from creating and owning sound suppressors. Lankford recently joined a letter to ATF expressing concern over their use of secret internal guidance to push new regulations. This secret guidance has been used to justify the seizure of lawfully owned property, which is unacceptable and not in accordance with the Constitution. "
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-brings-government-waste-report-to-the-senate-floor,"CLICK HERE to watch Lankford’s floor speech on YouTube.CLICK HERE to watch Lankford’s floor speech on Rumble.WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today brought this week’s release of volume 6 of his government waste report, Federal Fumbles: Ways the government dropped the ball, to those who need to hear about it most: the US Senate. Lankford spoke about specific examples of waste from the report and about his frustration that some in Congress talk about debt and some of the big decisions we face for long-term solvency of several major federal programs, but most are not willing to actually address it.Lankford’s sixth volume contains examples of $10.5 trillion in wasteful federal spending as well as solutions to address it. Lankford’s report points to the almost $2 trillion in so-called “COVID relief,’ which he opposed when it passed in March 2021, that led to our skyrocketing 8.5 percent inflation, countless employment shortages, and supply-chain delays. Lankford called out earmarks, which he opposes, and cited in the report several jaw-dropping examples of “pork” in the most recent bloated spending bill he opposed in March. Lankford’s report highlights waste, fraud, and abuse in programs Oklahomans depend on like Social Security and Medicare as well as waste and mismanagement in the Highway Trust Fund.TranscriptAbout six years ago I came to this floor and presented an idea. How do we get on top of our debt and deficit? Are we going to get on top of our debt and deficit? Interestingly enough, for each of us and our own families, we can all tell a story about a season in our life where we really hit hard times. I've had several where the money was really tight and our family was very attentive to what we were spending. Very. Those moments when we would literally make sure that every time we went to the grocery store, we only spent this much because we knew we had an electric bill coming in, we knew we had our rent coming due. My family’s most definitely been there.My wife and I when we first married, we had a rule that we couldn't ever spend more than $25 without the other person knowing it because our fear was when we were first married that one of us would spend $30 and the other would spend $35 that day, and we would blow up our bank account because we were living that close to the edge and just getting by while I was in school and we were just getting started. A lot of families have been that way.But you can tell how serious a family is about them dealing with their debt by how seriously they take their expenses. There's some individuals that have massive debt that still keep running up their credit card. They still keep buying more and more product. They still use their credit card and go get additional electronics and go get more stuff and thinking, ‘I will max out this card and then max out another one,’ not with essentials, just with fun, not paying attention to the fact that someday that comes due.When I started presenting the idea of Federal Fumbles, my whole concept was simple, where is it the federal government's dropping the ball? That we are not paying attention to the areas we need to be able to pay attention to in our spending. It is a well-known fact that we have trillions in debt. In fact, as a nation, we have now crossed $30 trillion in total debt—30 trillion.But it's interesting the conversation doesn't seem to be serious. We don't seem to be in a dialogue about how we're going to actually try to bring our debt down. We're still spending on other things and still saying not we're limited in what we can do, we seem to be adding more to the mix. It's not necessarily on essential things. It just seems to be on things.The Federal Fumbles book that I released this week and put on our website just details of several different items. One is: where are we on our debt and how did we get here? But I also walk through some of the trust funds on this because I think it's important. Where are we on Medicare trust fund? By the way, we're four years away from insolvency on Medicare—four years. Where are we on Social Security? We're 12 years away from insolvency in Social Security—12. Where are we on the Highway Trust Fund? We're well past insolvency on the Highway Trust Fund and we've been accelerating borrowing to cover more and more, in fact, that was don't even recently.I laid out a set of ideas of how do you actually solve some of these and how to address it, but I also laid out some of my frustrations that said, ‘At some point this body will be serious about dealing with debt and deficit, but apparently we're not yet.’ And so I laid out some areas and just got a chance to be able to talk through some of those in the book. And I encourage folks to be able to look at the book. And quite frankly, everyone’s free to disagree with me on it. But I laid out some of these issues.For instance, we spent $2 billion—billion with a ‘b’—we spent $2 billion this last year not building the border wall. The contracts had already been let out, the steel was already purchased. The steel, in fact, is laying on the ground still today. Everyone was already hired, and there were literally individuals on the ground ready to do installation because the contractor was there because career professionals at the Department of Homeland Security had made recommendations on certain areas of our southern border that desperately needed fencing. And so those career professionals had worked with contractors and had a contract in place to be able to put fencing in those areas. And they were under way until the Biden Administration stepped in on day one and stopped it all. Though the contracts had already been let out.We spent $2 billion not building border fencing—$2 billion. Now, I asked the simple question: what would it have hurt to go ahead and finish those contracts out that career professionals had signed off on and that career secure individuals from the Department of Homeland Security had said was desperately needed in those areas? What would it have hurt to finish those contracts out? But instead we sent messaging that we're not going to build a fence and spend $2 billion not to doing that. What did we do instead? Well, we started doing  robot dogs along the border instead. I wish I was kidding. These robot dogs would instead be hired to help border folks and border patrol and CBP to be able to help identify and carry things. So instead of border fencing, it's robot dogs that are now being contracted to be able to put in there. What else did we actually deal with? Well, of the trillions of dollars of debt, recently we put $2.6 million into China to help pay for some of their health programs.Now, follow the irony of this. We actually borrow a trillion dollars from China to pay our bills so we borrowed money from China to be able to be able to then send money to China help pay their medical expenses. Does anyone else think this is a bad idea, that if we were serious about dealing with debt and deficit, we would start going line by line through all of this and be able to identify, maybe this is not a good idea if we have $30 trillion in debt, maybe we could cut back in some areas. We could cut back on that, or maybe cut back on the grant that was given out to write about Russian screen writers that we actually paid someone to do research on Russian screenwriters to be able to release this project out so that people could study Russian directors and screenwriters.Again, I'm fine if anybody wants to be able to do that, but my concern is, if we’re going to do this, it should probably be a private project that we release out, not have a federal government project when we're dealing with $30 trillion in debt. But what else did we do with our additional money while we’re having just extra spending and time on this? How about lobster pot removal. Yep, we spent half-a-million dollars in a special earmark to do lobster pot removal. Now, initially, this was listed in the bill as derelict lobster pots—derelict lobster pots. That sounds really ominous, doesn’t it? My understanding is it’s just lobster traps that are just out there that someone abandoned at some point. I would tell you, for those of us in Oklahoma, if you told me there was a lobster trap and there may be a lobster in it and you could keep the trap and the lobster if you want to go get it, we would go get it. Instead, we are paying a half million dollars in federal dollars to pick up derelict lobster pots. Now, again I would say to you, in Oklahoma when we have a derelict well in Oklahoma, an oil and gas well, our oil and gas companies all pool money together and put a little bit in to be able to go clean that site up, and year by year we're cleaning up abandoned well sites because our companies actually kick the money in to go clean up their own messes that are out there.I don't understand how the state didn't do this or a city didn't do this, or the industry didn't take it on. Now, I do have some frustration because there was some money set aside for parks as well. I'm a big fan of parks. My kids go to the park. We're glad to be able to go to the park. I went to the park a lot around it, but there was a project at $2.3 million in federal money to be able to renovate a pool—swimming pool in Rhode Island.Now I'm not opposed to swimming pools and I'm not opposed to Rhode Island having swimming pools. I'm just trying to figure out with federal dollars why the federal government is paying to fix a swimming pool in Rhode Island. Shouldn't this be the state of Rhode Island if it's a state park? Shouldn't it be the state or the community or the city to be able to take this on? Cities in my state, if they have problems with their pool. The city pays to be able to fix the pool or the community pays to be able to do that rather than the federal taxpayers pay to do it.With the same issue, actually, with the ski jump. That there was a state park that needed a renovation for a ski jump. And so instead of the state actually paying for their state park. People in my state are paying for our state park and we're paying to fix the ski jump in this state park as well. Why are we paying for both? Why don't the people of Oklahoma pay for our state parks and the people in other states pay for their state parks? Again, I have nothing in opposition to ski jumping other than that. Seems like a particularly terrible thing for me to do. But if somebody wants to be able to do it and they want to pay for that, that's fine. Just why should Oklahoma taxpayers do that?As we were digging through the different pieces that were actually done, I would tell you it was painful the moment when we ran across the monkey opera. We spent federal tax dollars on something called a monkey opera. Now. I'm not sure why we spent federal tax dollars on a monkey opera. I'm not sure what a monkey opera sounds like. But I would tell you, I think I've listened to a monkey opera on people's at hold music before when I've called certain companies that I think the whole music they have was actually monkey opera. But I have to ask the hard question, is this national defense? Is this educating our children? Is this health care? With $30 trillion in debt, at some point, we as a nation have to stop and say, ‘okay, let's do what's essential. And not what's not.’Two weeks ago, a staff member called me and said she was in line at the grocery store. And the woman in front of her with her kids pulled out all the stuff in her basket and put it on the scanner area and said to the lady that was going to be the cashier, ‘Hey, tell me when it gets to $150 because I can't spend any more. That's all I have. And so the cashier kept ringing things up. She held things back that she thought were the nonessentials at the end because she knew, this is all I have. And though I'd like to get more. I can't.It sent me two messages. One is, every family knows how to do this. Why we can't as a federal government look at it and say with $30 trillion, maybe the monkey opera is not one of our essentials. I don't know. But the second thing it reminded me of is: every family is dealing with the real effects of inflation right now. It's very real for them. They're saying to the cashier at the grocery store, ‘tell me when it gets to this dollar amount, because that's all I have’ When we continue to spend more and more and more as the federal government. It drives inflation higher and higher. I am very aware there are a lot of folks in this room that are just trying to help. But we're causing real problems with inflation, with overspending as a nation. That's got to pull back.And we've got to get serious about what we're spending on because this kind of stuff drives the American people crazy when they're saying to the cashier, ‘I can only do $150. Please tell me when it gets there, because everything else I can't do today.’  And we borrowed more money from China so we could do this. We put out the Federal Fumbles book every year for one reason. I want to remind everybody in this body that debt is still a problem. This is still an issue. Wasteful spending, whether it's in the billions or whether it's in the thousands—is wasteful spending. And at the end of the day. We need to understand the American people are counting on us to make hard decisions, and there are lots and lots of hard decisions. But currently as a body, we're not even discussing 30 trillion in debt. So I bring it to us again. We have $30 trillion in debt. Let's start working on this.###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-inhofe-colleagues-urge-army-corps-of-engineers-to-prioritize-funding-for-mkarns-deepening,"WASHINGTON, DC  – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today joined Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK), the entire Oklahoma House delegation, and their colleagues from Kansas and Arkansas to send a letter to the Office of Management and Budget and the US Army Corps of Engineers urging them to prioritize and commit additional funding to the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System (MKARNS).Lankford and Inhofe were joined in sending the letter by Senators Roger Marshall (R-KS), Jerry Moran (R-KS), John Boozman (R-AR), and Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Representatives Kevin Hern (OK-01), Markwayne Mullin (OK-02), Tom Cole (OK-04), Frank Lucas (OK-03), Stephanie Bice (OK-05), Rick Crawford (AR-01), French Hill (AR-02), Steve Womack (AR-03) and Bruce Westerman (AR-04).The lawmakers wrote: “The MKARNS, which opened as an official inland waterway system in 1971, originates at the Tulsa Port of Catoosa and runs 445 miles through Oklahoma and Arkansas to the Mississippi River. Inland waterways barge transportation is the safest, most economical, and fuel-efficient way to move our nation's goods for use domestically and for export.”They continued: “Continuing the deepening of the MKARNS would directly benefit the 56,000 jobs for surrounding farmers, manufacturers, and other producers who contribute over $8 billion in sales and nearly $300 million in state and local tax revenue as a result of the system's efficient operation.”The full text of the letter can be found HERE and below.Dear Director Young, Assistant Secretary Connor, and LTG Spellmon:We urge the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to prioritize and commit additional funding to the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System (MKARNS), including deepening, and operations and maintenance of the MKARNS in the allocation of additional funding provided by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022.The MKARNS, which opened as an official inland waterway system in 1971, originates at the Tulsa Port of Catoosa and runs 445 miles through Oklahoma and Arkansas to the Mississippi River. Inland waterways barge transportation is the safest, most economical, and fuel-efficient way to move our nation's goods for use domestically and for export. On a single gallon of fuel, one barge can move freight more than four times farther than trucks. In a typical year, approximately 12 million tons of commerce traverses the MKARNS, valued at more than $3.5 billion. However, if the MKARNS was deepened from 9-feet to 12-feet, the capacity of each barge could increase by nearly 400 tons and increase the value of business sales by over $250 million.Through enactment of the Water Resources Development Act of 2020, Congress provided the Corps with flexibility to continue carrying out construction of the deepening of the MKARNS. Continuing the deepening of the MKARNS would directly benefit the 56,000 jobs for surrounding farmers, manufacturers, and other producers who contribute over $8 billion in sales and nearly $300 million in state and local tax revenue as a result of the system's efficient operation. We thank you for allocating $92.6 million to begin construction of MKARNS deepening, and urge you to commit additional funding this year to ensure the timely completion of this important project.The future economic viability of the MKARNS is at risk as there is currently more than a $300 million backlog in critical maintenance along the entire 50-year-old system. This includes locks, dams, and other important equipment that is deteriorating to dangerous conditions. The MKARNS is vital to the economies of Oklahoma and Arkansas, as well as Kansas, which sends or receives 49 percent of the tonnage coming through Oklahoma ports. A critical failure on the system could result in it being shut down for months and even a temporary shutdown could put future use of the system at risk, as businesses would no longer see the MKARNS as reliable and would likely find other means to transport their goods. Losing navigation on the entire MKARNS would cost over 6,000 jobs and cause national GDP to decline by $723 million.As the Corps develops the Fiscal Year 2022 Work Plan, we respectfully request your support in providing additional funding for deepening, and operations and maintenance of the MKARNS. We look forward to working with you on improving our nation's vital inland waterways infrastructure.Sincerely,###"

Lankford, report in hand, quoted the Biden Administration’s own admission in their “plan” that “a significant increase in migrant encounters will substantially strain our system even further.”Lankford is leading the charge to push back on the Biden Administration’s plans to revoke temporary, pandemic-related Title 42 authority as early as May 23 and to stop the ongoing chaos at the southern border amid Biden’s hypocrisy about COVID. After the highest year on record for illegal crossings this past year and 221,000 “encounters” of border crossers last month, Lankford introduced the Public Health and Border Security Act to require all COVID-19 related national states of emergency to be lifted before Title 42 is officially terminated until a workable plan to replace it is put in place. Clearly for Lankford, Biden’s “plan” released yesterday is not workable.TranscriptThis is policy insanity. The Biden Administration is getting the immigration policy that they designed. They stripped away all the restrictions for actually people crossing the border. They get this result. Now, with record-high numbers of people illegally crossing the border, now they’re saying, ‘And we’re going to drop Title 42 as well.’ So we get record-high numbers now of illegal crossings, and they’re going to say, ‘We’re going to strip away the last piece that we hadn’t taken away before to increase this number even higher.’May I remind everyone that’s here of the simple fact that 221,000 ‘encounters,’ as they called them, from the last month is a record-high number. What people are not talking about as well are the 66,000 what they call ‘gotaways’ that also happened last month. That is, the border patrol were so active trying to round up and engage this group of 221,000, they could see in the distance and count people crossing the border. There were 66,000 that we had no contact with that we literally watched them come across the border.Who’s crossing the border, and what’s happening at this point?Well it’s people from 157 different countries, just in the last six months, that have crossed the border. None of these individuals have a criminal background check actually carried out on them from their home country. They’re doing a criminal background check if they’ve committed a crime in the United States before, but we have no idea in the country they’re coming from if there’s a criminal background at all. And for the 66,000 gotaways that happened just last month, we have no criminal background check in this country or in their previous country.This is opening up our nation to additional crime. While the American people are literally saying, ‘Let’s deal with the crime problem,’ the Biden Administration is opening up the border more and having even more people cross the border with no check with no evaluation of their previous history at all.This is why I say it is policy insanity what they’re doing.The plan that we were given yesterday, this plan statement that came in from Alejandro Mayorkas, this plan that was supposed to define out for us, is not a plan at all. It’s basically how they’re going to move people into the country faster. It notes things like currently they’re releasing people into the country and giving them eight years before there’s a hearing. They’re going to now just catch and release people the same at a faster pace, moving them into the country, and say, ‘Now you’ve got to check in within a year.’But there is no evaluation. There’s no chase on those individuals if they don’t check in, so whether it’s an eight-year time period, where it is now,  or whether they magically move that to a one-year time period, there’s no change. Fascinatingly enough, in this report, they say they’re lifting Title 42 authority at the border because there’s no COVID at the border, but they can’t detain individuals because there’s COVID in their detention facilities.So there’s no COVID when you’re crossing the border, but if you actually hold people in detention, then there’s mass COVID. So we can’t actually hold people in detention. So they don’t increase bed space at all in this process. This is a major problem.And can I tell you, if you read through the report—and I hope you do—from what they call a supposed plan. This is not a plan. This is just what they plan to be able to carry out to do to increase the numbers even more. It’s not a plan to decrease the numbers. And I can say that not based on my opinion, but based on theirs.Go to the back of their report, of their supposed plan on this. They end with their conclusion statement. May I read this to you? The conclusion statement says, ‘Despite the best efforts of our dedicated DHS workforce and our partners executing this comprehensive plan, a significant increase in migrant encounters will substantially strain our system even further.’So their plan is not to reduce the number of people crossing; they’re plan is: this is about to get worse. And we’re aware that this is about to get worse. This is not a plan to stop illegal immigration. This is a plan to accelerate illegal immigration. And they even admit it. This has got to stop. The American people just want the enforcement of our laws. That is not too much to ask.###"

Lankford participated in a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing entitled, “Mistreatment of Military Families in Privatized Housing.” Lankford specifically asked about needed changes to housing on Tinker and Altus Air Force Bases and why there has yet to be lasting solutions to address the aging facilities.The first panel of witnesses from  today’s hearing included Capt. Samuel Choe, USA, Former Resident in Balfour Beatty Housing from Fort Gordon Army Base; Tech. Sgt. Jack Fe Torres, USAF, Current Resident in Balfour Beatty Housing at Sheppard Air Force Base; Rachel Christian, the Founder and Chief Legislative Officer at Armed Forces Housing Advocates; and Jana Wanner, a Military Spouse who has lived in on-base housing and started a Facebook group focused on military family on-base housing issues.Lankford continues to support and push for updates and quality control for housing on military installations in Oklahoma and around the nation through numerous changes found in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) legislation he’s supported and in remarks on the Senate floor to his colleagues.ExcerptsOn the need for housing updates at Altus Air Force BaseLankford: One of the issues that we face at Altus Air Force Base is that it’s older housing that needs to be redone completely, but now we’re on the bottom of the list because Tyndall is going to end up with all new, and they’re just going to say, ‘That’s going to get all new,’ and Altus and the other three bases that are in that group are just going to continue to get old and old and older, which doesn’t meet what our folks need actually on that particular base…On long-term fixes needed at Altus Air Force Base after corrections were not timely for Tinker Air Force BaseLankford: Tinker Air Force Base, the largest of the sustainment facilities in the country, and then Altus Air Force Base—Altus was put into a group of multiple different entities, which Tyndall was one of those. So with Tyndall being in that mix, obviously Tyndall getting obliterated in a hurricane, all the focus seems to be going there. And there’ll be lots of new construction at Tyndall, but because of that—and they’re in a grouping of four—now they’re not going to get the attention from Balfour at Altus. So Altus is suffering the consequences of a hurricane on the other side, literally, of the country because of the grouping that they’re in…what I hear when I talk to individuals on base or when we talk to leadership on it, they are very pleased with the turnaround that Balfour has had the last couple of years because in 2018, Balfour at Tinker Air Force Base—all the mold, all the issues, nonresponsive. At Altus, we still continue to be able to get band aid fixes for things that should be replaced or actually just constant band aid fixes where they know that’s going to work for a few months and then I’m going to be calling you again.So it’s two big issues that are here. One is trying to be able to balance out how there’s a hurricane in one area so every other base actually gets punished because of that because all their focus is going to be somewhere else or how do you deal with the issue of band aid fixes that actually get repaired so this isn’t a nuisance for those families.Christian: If you don’t provide a band aid fix, and your provide the correct fix the first time, then you’re not incurring the cost of continually going out and trying to band aid fix these problems.On the need for training and certification of inspectors and advocates in military housing inspectionsLankford: When the command leadership was taken out of the equation, they lost an advocate. The plan was there’d be other advocates that are there, but it’s our understanding those advocates are not able to articulate that. Why? Why aren’t they able to articulate the issues and get results?Christian: So, this varies from branch of service, the type of advocate you have in the installation, and across the board, but I will say that none of them that we’ve come into contact with, which is a majority of military installations in the country, have training in housing. So they are not equipped to understand what an inspection should look like…Christian: So what’s the solution to that? Are you suggesting some sort of state certification before they can do that, some sort of federal certification for that?Christian: Absolutely—an industry standard. So they need to follow state laws, so someone who would be providing the same type of inspection at another facility off of the installation, they need to be trained in understanding the state law, the fire codes, anything that you would need, if you were to inspect a home off the installation.###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-applauds-2022-uscirf-report-to-spotlight-worldwide-religious-liberty-concerns,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) offered the following statement in response to the release of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom’s (USCIRF) 2022 Annual Report, which includes the Commission’s recommendations to the State Department for the designation of Countries of Particular Concern and recommendations for its Special Watch List:“Religious liberty abuse is human rights abuse,” said Lankford. “We have constitutional protections for every American so that they can have a faith, live that faith or change their faith. I believe we should work with our partners in the US and abroad to make sure that important value extends to people everywhere. The US Commission on International Religious Freedom’s Annual Report is one way we are able to shine light on religious liberty abuses and hold other nations accountable. Recommending the State Department designate Nigeria and Afghanistan as Countries of Particular Concern is a big step forward to hold their governments accountable for their persecution of people of faith. We must continue to call out persecution where we see it.”The USCIRF Annual Report recommends the designation of Burma, China, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, Syria, and Vietnam as Countries of Particular Concern and Algeria, Cuba, Nicaragua, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Turkey, and Uzbekistan for the Special Watch List.Lankford remains a leader in advancing religious liberty and human rights around the world. Lankford joined Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and their colleagues to introduce legislation to reauthorize the independent US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) through 2024. Lankford introduced legislation to reauthorize the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. Lankford recently received the Hero on the Hill award from Jeff King, President of the International Christian Concern (ICC), for his work to bring to light the persecution of people of faith around the world and his work to advance religious freedom.This summer, Lankford received the inaugural International Religious Freedom (IRF) Champion Award, presented by Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback under the Trump Administration. Lankford introduced a resolution to call for the global repeal of blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws around the world, which passed the Senate unanimously.###"

The report highlights waste and inefficiency in the federal government and offers solutions and recommendations for long-term changes that need to begin immediately.“Federal Fumbles is a to-do list for me and my team, and it’s also a status update for Oklahomans who are concerned about waste, fraud, and abuse of their tax dollars and what is being done to stop it,” said Lankford. “As Oklahomans face 8.5 percent inflation, sky-high gas prices, and grocery bills they’re struggling to pay, they rightly want to know why they see so much waste in government and what is being done to solve it. We have already utilized our findings in Fumbles to get numerous ‘touchdowns’ signed into law or get bad policy reversed. But there is always more to do. This year’s report focuses on some of the biggest drivers of our debt and deficits, including President Biden’s $2 billion waste at the southern border, long-term solvency issues with Social Security and Medicare, and numerous wasteful earmarks and pork in the latest spending bill, which I opposed. We need solutions to the issues we face, so Fumbles also focuses on recommendations for how to actually make the tough decisions, not just talk about them.”CLICK HERE for a summary of the report.Video ExcerptsOn the ballooning national debt and ongoing deficit spendingLankford: We have a $2.8 trillion deficit, which means we’re spending $2.8 trillion more in one single year than we take in. In 2019 before COVID, our national debt was $22.7 trillion. Today our debt stands at over $30 trillion--$30 trillion. That’s the equivalent of $1 of spending per second for one million years—a million years! That’s the question I hear often: where does all this federal money come from? We don’t have a rainy day fund. We just have more borrowing from the future or printing money.On some of the waste uncovered for the sixth volume of FumblesLankford: This year I’ve found things like $2 billion wasted because of the Biden Administration’s decision to not finish building the wall at our southern border, which is already paid for. We literally paid contractors $2 billion last year not to build the border security wall. I’m also highlighting things like the most recent federal spending bill and earmarks. Things like $20 million for repairs at the US Grant Presidential Library, $500,000 for an art walk project in Trenton, New Jersey, and millions of dollars for sidewalk projects and bike trails in Rhode Island and Vermont just to name a few places. We’ll shine light on some of the projects funded through grant programs for things like $90,000-$150,000 on robot dogs at the border, $2.6 million going to Chinese health programs, $120,000 to write about Russians, $15,000 spent on a monkey opera—we all can’t wait for that opera--$500,000 for the Nansen Ski Club in New Hampshire, $3 million for a fisherman co-op in Guam, $30 million for safe smoking kits. How about $569,000 for lobster pot removal. All of that while we’re experiencing the highest gas prices our nation has ever seen.On the looming crises for Social Security and Medicare if we do nothingLankford: If we do nothing, Medicare will be insolvent and unable to pay its full benefits by 2026. Social Security is expected to go insolvent by 2034. These are not some distant years down the road; 2026 is in four years! This is a crisis we can all see coming, and we can work on solutions to address it, if we start it now. One way to help protect these benefits for the people who depend on them most is to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse of these programs.###"

Murrah Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995.“We still feel the pain and loss of that day. Each April 19th, we pause to remember the victims, survivors, their families, the first responders, and everyone impacted by that fateful day in 1995 when 168 lives were lost in the worst act of domestic terrorism our nation had ever known,” said Lankford. “But out of the terrible tragedy, we introduced the nation to the Oklahoma Standard—the remarkable way Oklahomans immediately step in to show love and help our neighbors stand up, clean up, and help begin the healing process. As we remember the fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, and friends who were taken from us that day, we continue to show the nation how to pray and take care of each other in times of overwhelming loss.” ###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-colleagues-urge-omb-to-lower-prescription-drug-costs-for-seniors-,"WASHINGTON, DC –Senators James Lankford (R-OK), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Jon Tester (D-MT) sent a letter urging the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to move forward quickly with review of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (CMS) proposed rule to lower out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for seniors by bringing so-called pharmacy direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) fees under control. The senators are urging OMB to review this rule so that these important reforms can be implemented as quickly as possible. CMS issued the rule following a letter from the senators to either work with Congress to eliminate DIR fees to help lower prescription drug prices for Medicare Part D beneficiaries or take administrative action to address the problem.“Finalizing CMS’ DIR fee reform proposal will help save Medicare Part D beneficiaries more than $20 billion in prescription drug costs, while also providing increased transparency and predictability for pharmacies and the communities they serve. We urge you to move forward with review of this rule so that these important reforms can be implemented as quickly as possible,” wrote the senators.DIR fees, which are often levied on community pharmacies retroactively by middlemen companies known as Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), increase the cost of prescription drugs for older Ohioans at the pharmacy counter and make it harder for local pharmacies in Ohio to serve their communities.CMS’ proposed rule would improve price transparency and competition in the Medicare Part D program, thereby reducing out-of-pocket costs for the nearly 2 million Part D beneficiaries in Ohio. The rule would require Part D plans and their PBMs to apply all discounts they receive at the point of sale so that those paying for drugs at the pharmacy counter can benefit from those discounts. This policy is estimated to reduce prescription drug costs for Part D beneficiaries by $21.3 billion over the next 10 years.In their letter, the Senators also encourage the Biden Administration to take additional steps to ensure the comprehensive reform and transparency requirements necessary to address any remaining anticompetitive tactics employed by supply chain middlemen that could threaten beneficiary access to care in the future.In October, the senators sent a letter urging CMS to either work with Congress to eliminate DIR fees to help lower prescription drug prices for Medicare Part D beneficiaries or take administrative action to address the problem. CMS committed to taking action in its response to the Senators’ letter, and the proposed rule released on January 6, 2021, represents its formal proposal to address this issue. OMB is now reviewing the CMS proposed rule.The full text of the letter is available HERE and below.Dear Director Young:We write in support of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) proposal to help lower the cost of prescription drugs for Part D beneficiaries through certain pharmacy direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) fee reform in Medicare, included in its proposed rule for Contract Year 2023 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program (CY23 proposed rule), which is now at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. Comprehensive DIR fee reform will help to lower costs for the more than 48 million beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Part D, which is why we urge you to prioritize and efficiently review CMS’ CY23 proposed rule, particularly the provisions related to DIR fee reform, so that CMS can finalize and implement DIR reform for the FY23 contract year, helping to both lower costs for Medicare beneficiaries and provide certainty for pharmacies and the communities they serve.According to the CMS, pharmacy DIR fees grew more than 107,400 percent between 2010 and 2020. As these fees have increased in size and scope, they have contributed to the rising cost of prescription drugs costs for patients and the closure of hundreds of pharmacies in communities across the country. Pharmacy DIR fees applied after the point-of-sale artificially increase patients’ out-of-pocket costs for Part D drugs, which is why CMS’ proposed reforms to bring these fees to the point-of-sale are expected to reduce seniors’ out-of-pocket prescription drug costs by $21.3 billion over 10 years. CMS’ proposed policy will also ensure additional transparency and help provide pharmacies with the certainty they need to provide high quality care for underserved and at-risk communities. Finally, the CMS proposal would help prevent retroactive pharmacy DIR fee claw-backs and provide certainty for pharmacies and patients at the point of sale. Allowing CMS’ proposed pharmacy DIR fee reform proposal to move forward will not only lower costs for seniors and individuals with disabilities across the country; it will help sustain beneficiary access to pharmacies and the essential services they provide. We urge you to review the CY23 proposed rule as quickly as possible so that CMS has time to finalize and implement pharmacy DIR fee reform in the Medicare program in advance of contract year 2023 and help put an end to post-sale concessions charged to pharmacies, including those assessed in the Medicare coverage gap.Finalizing the CMS rule to rein in DIR fees and lower costs for consumers is an important first step; however, more can and should be done to deliver comprehensive pharmacy DIR fee reform. Additional efforts to standardize pharmacy performance metrics, ensure reasonable reimbursement, and protect the rights of pharmacies who wish to participate in Medicare Part D are necessary to maintain robust pharmacy networks and protect patient choice.We support CMS’ continued efforts to address these remaining challenges, and we encourage you to work closely with CMS to ensure the final rule includes the comprehensive reform and transparency requirements necessary for CMS to address any remaining anticompetitive tactics employed by supply chain middlemen that could threaten beneficiary access to care in the future.Finalizing CMS’ DIR fee reform proposal will help save Medicare Part D beneficiaries more than $20 billion in prescription drug costs, while also providing increased transparency and predictability for pharmacies and the communities they serve. We urge you to move forward with review of this rule so that these important reforms can be implemented as quickly as possible.Thank you for your attention to this important matter.Sincerely,###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-colleagues-demand-information-on-safeguards-for-preventing-medicaid-fraud-improper-payments,"OKLAHOMA CITY, OK – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) joined Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) and House Committee on Oversight and Reform Ranking Member, Rep. James Comer (R-KY), along with 20 of their colleagues to send a letter to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure seeking information on what safeguards CMS has in place to address improper payments in the Medicaid program. Lankford has worked throughout his time in Congress to root out waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer-funded programs in order to protect the funds for the most vulnerable in our nation who need them.The members wrote in their letter, “According to CMS, Medicaid made $57.36 billion in improper payments in fiscal year 2019. Medicaid’s improper payments accounted for 32.8 percent of all improper payments across the federal government. In FY 2020, improper payments rose to $86.9 billion, meaning more than one out of every five Medicaid payments were improper. A recent report by the Foundation for Government Accountability found almost all of the improper payments were due to eligibility errors, administrative oversights, or outright fraud. Further, the report found the rate of Medicaid improper payments has nearly quadrupled since the implementation of Obamacare in 2014.”   The members went on to say, “These staggering rates of improper payments in Medicaid programs are inexcusable. As CMS data underscores, these improper payments threaten the integrity of the Medicaid program. Moreover, we are concerned the policies implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic—expanded Medicaid eligibility, increased federal funding and suspended state audits—possibly added to the significant levels of improper payments in the program.”Lankford, Johnson, and Comer are joined in the letter by Senators Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Rand Paul (R-KY), Rick Scott (R-FL), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Mike Lee (R-UT), and Mike Braun (R-IN) and Representatives Ralph Norman (R-SC), Jody Hice (R-GA), Glenn Grothman (R-WI), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Nancy Mace (R-SC), Byron Donalds (R-FL), Fred Keller (R-PA), Jake LaTurner (R-KS), Virginia Foxx (R-NC), Scott Franklin (R- FL), Yvette Herrell (R-NM), and Chip Roy (R-TX).Read more about the letter in The Daily Caller.The full text of the letter can be found HERE and below.Dear Administrator Brooks-LaSure:For years, we have raised concerns to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regarding the staggering rate of improper payments in the Medicaid program. Despite our calls to action, the improper payment rate continues to increase. As we previously noted, the improper payments rate is likely an underestimate, and some estimates show that 27 percent, or more than $100 billion annually, could be improper. This alarming amount threatens the viability of a program designed for Americans in need. We write seeking additional information on what safeguards CMS has in place to address improper payments in the Medicaid program.According to CMS, Medicaid made $57.36 billion in improper payments in fiscal year 2019. Medicaid’s improper payments accounted for 32.8 percent of all improper payments across the federal government. In FY 2020, improper payments rose to $86.9 billion, meaning more than one out of every five Medicaid payments were improper. A recent report by the Foundation for Government Accountability found almost all of the improper payments were due to eligibility errors, administrative oversights, or outright fraud. Further, the report found the rate of Medicaid improper payments has nearly quadrupled since the implementation of Obamacare in 2014.The improper payment rate in some states is as high as 44 percent—nearly double the national average. Eligibility errors cause almost all—95 percent—of the improper payment rates in the worst performing states and cause 80 percent of improper payments nationwide. Improper payments doubled over the last decade in some states like Illinois. Meanwhile, according to the data CMS provided, California’s error rate was only 6.3 percent—significantly less than the nationwide average—despite rapid growth in the state’s Medicaid program. This low percentage appears implausible considering a 2018 Health and Human Services Inspector General audit which found more than half of sampled enrollees in California’s Medicaid program were paid to ineligible beneficiaries.These staggering rates of improper payments in Medicaid programs are inexcusable. As CMS data underscores, these improper payments threaten the integrity of the Medicaid program.  Moreover, we are concerned the policies implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic—expanded Medicaid eligibility, increased federal funding and suspended state audits—possibly added to the significant levels of improper payments in the program.To better understand the policies that CMS instituted to increase accountability and reduce improper payments in the Medicaid program, please provide the following information:The Committee on Oversight and Reform is the principal oversight committee of the US House of Representatives and has broad authority to investigate “any matter” at “any time” under House Rule X. Please provide this material as soon as possible but no later than 5:00 p.m. on April 27, 2022. Thank you for your attention to this important inquiry. Sincerely, ###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-cruz-colleagues-move-to-protect-americans-second-amendment-rights,"OKLAHOMA CITY, OK – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today joined Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) to announce they will introduce a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to prohibit President Biden’s Department of Justice from implementing a new rule to expand firearm definitions. Lankford and Cruz will be joined by Senators Mike Braun (R-IN) and Mike Lee (R-UT) to introduce the resolution.“Crime is going up in far-left cities because of soft-on-crime policies. Biden’s response is to clamp down on guns put together in a kit. Federal law already prohibits felons from owning or possessing any gun, including so called ‘ghost guns,’” said Lankford. “This is another attempt by the Biden Administration to strip law-abiding citizens of their Second Amendment rights instead of addressing the failed policies that have led to increased crime across the country. This action by the Biden Administration is not going to solve rising crime rates. Senator Cruz and I are pushing to overturn this rule and will introduce a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn it.”“For the past two years, we’ve seen crime rates skyrocket all across the country, aided by Democrats’ soft-on crime policies and left-wing district attorneys operating like progressive activists instead of law enforcement officers,” said Cruz. “Democrats would love nothing more than to shift the blame and stoke anti-gun sentiment, and create a permanent national gun registry in the process. By introducing this resolution, we’re pushing back—we want to stop the Biden administration from issuing the final rule expanding the definition of firearms and instituting a national gun registry, we want to stop the false narrative that links the rise in crime to ‘ghost guns,’ and firearms, and we want to protect law-abiding citizens who are exercising their Second Amendment rights.”The Biden Administration wants to institute a final rule redefining a “firearm” under federal law to not only mean a complete product, but also its individual parts, often included in a weapons parts kit. If implemented, this new rule would require gun kits and gun parts to be regulated as if they were fully functional firearms—meaning they wouldn’t be able to be sold without a serial number or without the buyer having to undergo a background check. The new rule would also require those with Federal Firearms Licenses (FFL) to retain records permanently, in effect creating a national firearms registry. The current rule, which the Biden Administration seeks to change, allows for the disposal of records after 20 years.  Lankford remains a staunch Second Amendment advocate. This week, Lankford introduced the Pistol Brace Protection Act, which would gut an upcoming final rule by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) by exempting pistol braces from regulation under the National Firearms Act (NFA). The bill eliminates subjective standards that exist in federal law that have allowed ATF to reclassify firearms under the NFA, and guarantees that law-abiding gun owners will not have to register, destroy, or surrender their pistol brace.Lankford continues to stand up for Oklahomans’ Second Amendment rights by calling on ATF to provide answers on their recent actions that prevent law-abiding citizens from creating and owning sound suppressors. Lankford recently joined a letter to ATF expressing concern over their use of secret internal guidance to push new regulations. This secret guidance has been used to justify the seizure of lawfully owned property, which is unacceptable and not in accordance with the Constitution.  ###"

The introduction of the bill follows recommendations of the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service and its final report entitled “Inspired to Serve.” “Currently it takes nearly three months to hire new employees. The best and the brightest typically cannot wait three months to hear back on a job, and I have not heard of a single private company that tells a potential hire that they will get back to them in three months,” said Lankford. “With so many federal employees eligible for retirement, we need to ensure the federal workforce is equipped and prepared to hire and train employees in the days ahead. This is a fix that will not only ease the frustration of federal hiring but will save taxpayer dollars & ensure high quality service to Americans.”  “The state of our federal hiring process can take several months – time that neither the employee nor the employer can afford to lose. This is not the way a well-run government entity should run, and this behavior certainly wouldn’t fly in the private sector”, Braun said. “I’m happy to cosponsor the Inspired to Serve Act, which will help streamline & improve this dysfunctional federal hiring process.” In March, Lankford participated in a hearing for the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Government Operations and Border Management, entitled, “Chief Human Capitol Officers at 20: What is needed to empower CHCOs to Ensure HR practices support agencies’ mission success.”  Background: ###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-lee-colleagues-demand-doj-investigate-deaths-of-washington-dc-preborn-babies," OKLAHOMA CITY, OK – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) joined Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) to send a letter signed by 23 Senators and 46 Representatives to Attorney General Merrick Garland, demanding the Department of Justice investigate the deaths of preborn babies whose remains have been found in Washington, DC. Images have been widely circulated of the remains that suggest some of the babies may have undergone unlawful partial-birth abortions or possibly infanticide at the Washington Surgi-Clinic. Yet, the Metropolitan Police Department of DC has made the assumption that each preborn baby died as the result of a legal abortion.Lankford and Lee were joined in sending the letter by Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), John Boozman (R-AR), Mike Braun (R-IN), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Steve Daines (R-MT), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Jerry Moran (R-KS), James Risch (R-ID), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ben Sasse (R-NE), John Thune (R-SD), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Todd Young (R-IN) and by Representatives Chris Smith (R-NJ), Brian Babin (R-TX), Jack Bergman (R-MI), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Dan Bishop (R-NC), Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Mo Brooks (R-AL), Ken Buck (R-CO), Larry Buschon (R-IN), Tim Burchett (R-TN), Michael Burgess (R-TX), Madison Cawthorn (R-NC), Ben Cline (R-VA), Michael Cloud (R-TX), Andrew Clyde (R-GA), John Curtis (R-UT), Jeff Duncan (R-SC), Ron Estes (R-KS), Randy Feenstra (R-IA), Russ Fulcher (R-ID), Louie Gohmert (R-TX), Bob Good (R-VA), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Glenn Grothman (R-WI), Michael Guest (R-MS), Andy Harris (R-MD), Richard Hudson (R-NC), Bill Huizenga (R-MI), Ronny Jackson (R-TX), John Joyce (R-PA), Doug LaMalfa (R-CA), Barry Loudermilk (R-GA), Lisa McClain (R-MI), David B.

We demand that you conduct a comprehensive investigation on the circumstances surrounding the deaths of each preborn baby.Alongside passage of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, medical, and ethical consensus exists that the practice of performing a partial-birth abortion an abortion in which a physician deliberately and intentionally vaginally trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother and only the head remains inside the womb, for the purpose of performing an overt act (usually the puncturing of the back of a child’s skull and removing the baby’s brains) that the person knows will kill the partially delivered infant, performs this act, and then completes delivery of the dead infant is a gruesome and inhumane procedure that is never medically necessary and should never be performed.Photos that have been publicly shared (and are enclosed in this letter) suggest that some of these babies may have been victims of partial-birth abortion or infanticide. In one picture, a preborn baby girl is believed to be a victim of partial-birth abortion. Dr. Kendra Kolb, a neonatologist, estimates that this baby girl “is somewhere between 28-30 weeks gestational age, with evidence of deep lacerations to the posterior neck which presumably correlates to the method of abortion used to end her life.Official statements made by the Metropolitan Police of DC have made the assumption that each preborn baby died as the result of a legal abortion. However, we question whether such a conclusion can be reasonably reached regarding the cause of death for each preborn baby until an official autopsy is performed. We formally request that you direct the appropriate personnel at the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate whether these preborn babies were aborted in violation of federal law, specifically the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. We also request the Department of Justice ensure the preservation of each of these bodies as evidence for future investigations.John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the United States, correctly noted that “Justice is indiscriminately due to all, without regard to numbers, wealth, or rank.” In that same sentiment, the undersigned recognize that justice is indiscriminately due to the born and preborn, without regard to numbers, wealth, or rank. There is no compensatory reparation that may be provided to those injured by the abhorrent act of partial-birth abortion. As such, justice demands that at the very least, an investigation be conducted to ensure that anyone conducting these illegal, abhorrent acts against the most innocent among us may be prosecuted.We expect that you will provide written confirmation to the undersigned that you and the appropriate personnel of the Department of Justice and the FBI will either fulfill, or not fulfill, these requests by no later than Monday, April 11.Sincerely,###"

Under your leadership, however, the full Committee has only had one border-related hearing, and thus has failed to carry out its responsibility to conduct meaningful oversight of the southern border crisis.”The Senators went on to request, “a much-needed hearing to discuss how the Biden Administration plans to deal with the massive surge of illegal immigration that will result from their policies.”Read more about the letter in Fox News. The full text of the letter can be found HERE and below.Dear Chairman Peters: The Biden Administration recently announced plans to terminate the Title 42 border restrictions by May 23, 2022. In addition, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are in the process of finalizing a regulation that completely upends the asylum process. The implications of both of these decisions will undoubtedly lead to a surge of migrants at our southern border. It is unclear whether the Biden Administration has plans to respond effectively to the expected surge of illegal immigration that will result from these policy decisions this spring and summer. We write to request that you immediately convene a public hearing to examine the Biden Administration’s termination of the Title 42 border restrictions and other border enforcement policies.  Last month, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) apprehended approximately 7,000 illegal immigrants per day at the southern border, which amounts to approximately 217,000 for the entire month. CBP returned approximately 41 percent of those individuals in March under Title 42. With the Biden Administration’s termination of Title 42 border restrictions, Border Patrol officials are reportedly predicting a flow of illegal immigration that will lead to as many as 18,000 apprehensions per day. This surge of illegal immigration is unconscionable, and it is unclear whether or how an already overrun CBP will be able to safely and effectively respond to this expected surge.       The Biden Administration’s policies are directly contributing to the historic levels of illegal immigration. Administration officials must explain to the American people the rationale for their decisions, and what their plans are to deal with the consequences of their actions.Since the beginning of the 117th Congress, members of this Committee have repeatedly raised the need for the Committee to conduct oversight of the crisis at the southern border. Under your leadership, however, the full Committee has only had one border-related hearing, and thus has failed to carry out its responsibility to conduct meaningful oversight of the southern border crisis.Accordingly, we request you call a much-needed hearing to discuss how the Biden Administration plans to deal with the massive surge of illegal immigration that will result from their policies. We further request that the following witnesses testify at this hearing: We appreciate your attention on this important matter. Sincerely, ###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-colleagues-work-to-save-school-choice-after-bureaucrats-threaten-to-gut-it,"OKLAHOMA CITY, OK –Senators James Lankford (R-OK), Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), Tim Scott (R-SC), and 10 colleagues urged the Department of Education to reconsider proposed rules redefining the Charter School Program, stripping parents of their ability to choose the best school for their child.  “Rather than overseeing and enforcing existing safeguards intended to ensure that high-quality schools are able to open or expand, the Department of Education is engaging in an aggressive attempt to dictate Federal, one-size-fits-all rules for charter schools,” wrote the senators. “This proposed rule would add new requirements for applicants that are entirely unrelated to student outcomes.”“After teachers’ unions spent the pandemic keeping public schools closed while many charter schools stayed open, it is particularly appalling that the Department is working aggressively to limit charter school options for families in need,”continued the senators.Lankford, Cassidy and Scott were joined by Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Richard Burr (R-NC), Mike Braun (R-IN), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Todd Young (R-IN), John Cornyn (R-TX), John Boozman (R-AR), and Kevin Cramer (R-ND). Read the full letter HERE and below.Dear Secretary Cardona:We write to express our deep concern regarding the proposed rewrite of the bipartisan federal Charter Schools Program (CSP). Rather than overseeing and enforcing existing safeguards intended to ensure that high-quality schools are able to open or expand, the Department of Education is engaging in an aggressive attempt to dictate Federal, one-size-fits-all rules for charter schools. This unprecedented attempt at micromanaging a 28-year-old bipartisan program only serves to discourage charter schools from applying for these grants, effectively harming access to high quality schools for millions of students around the country.  This proposed rule would add new requirements for applicants that are entirely unrelated to student outcomes. Applicants would have to demonstrate “unmet demand for the charter school”. This means that having tens of thousands of children on charter waiting lists will not be enough. The Department wants evidence of “over-enrollment at existing public schools,” meaning that charter applicants in areas with shrinking enrollments, which includes most big cities, would most likely be rejected. Demand for charter schools is not just about the availability for any seat, but the demand for a high-quality seat, like those that exist at many of the nation’s premier charter schools. This requirement overrides the will of parents to affirmatively choose charter schools for their children and subjugates parents and students to the bureaucratic priorities set by the Department of Education. Since the pandemic, public charters have seen a substantial increase in demand. A logical approach would be to expand this program and build on what is already working for students and families. Instead, the Department of Education is taking direction from special interest groups, who seem more concerned with union membership rather than what is best for America’s students.This rulemaking makes no mention of how any of these new, burdensome hurdles will improve student achievement or help serve America’s neediest students. In fact, “academic achievement” is only mentioned twice in the text of the rule and not in a manner that shows how any requirement will improve such achievement; rather, an application must only describe the current achievement of students in areas from which it hopes to draw enrollment. At a time when students are falling behind in record numbers, we need new and innovative approaches to our education system. This is the precise reason the CSP exists: to offer innovative teaching models and to increase autonomy for teachers and schools. These proposed rules would take away choice from families and give more power to unelected bureaucrats in Washington. After teachers’ unions spent the pandemic keeping public schools closed while many charter schools stayed open, it is particularly appalling that the Department is working aggressively to limit charter school options for families in need. After teachers’ unions spent the pandemic keeping public schools closed while many charter schools stayed open, it is particularly appalling that the Department is working aggressively to limit charter school options for families in need. Public charter schools currently serve more than 3.4 million students across 42 states. The CSP, which has enjoyed bipartisan support since its inception in 1994, works to support these schools by providing federal funding to create promising new public charter schools, replicate successful public charter schools, and disseminate information about effective practices within charter schools. In fiscal year 2022, the CSP was funded at $440 million. Grants have benefited about half of existing charter schools and hundreds of thousands of predominately low-income students of color across the country.  Changes of this magnitude should be thoughtfully considered through the regular legislative process with proper input from relevant community stakeholders and Congress. Instead, the Department seems to be ignoring the will of Congress, through unilateral action. Therefore, we urge you to withdraw the proposed rule and engage with Congress on better ways to serve America’s students.  Thank you for your attention to this important matter.###"

https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-supports-oil-ban-trade-sanctions-on-russia,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK), a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources and Finance Committees, today voted to impose an embargo on Russian energy products and suspend normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus in response to Moscow’s ongoing aggression with the people of Ukraine. Sadly, 10.6 million Ukrainians have been displaced due to Russia’s war crimes. Lankford secured language that ensures the President is not able to reverse the oil embargo unless an agreement is reached for Russia to withdraw all forces and cease hostilities toward Ukraine. A provision was also included to sanction human rights abusers by making Global Magnitsky sanctions permanent.“Russia continues to threaten and kill the free people of Ukraine. We should suspend normal trade relations and ban all energy imports from Russia to the US to isolate Russia’s economy and cut off American money to their war machine,” said Lankford. “By imposing this ban, Russia’s state-owned and oligarch-run enterprises financing Putin’s war will be unable to access the capital needed to kill Ukrainians. The Senate’s votes today were only a first step. We should also ensure any deal the White House brokers with Iran, through Russia, does not provide Russia an opportunity to evade sanctions and continue financing Putin’s war.”In March, Lankford led a group of Senators to request answers from President Biden’s National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the speed, specifics, and supply of lethal aid provided to Ukraine. He introduced a Senate resolution urging the Biden Administration to facilitate the transfer of aircraft, such as MiG-29s, and air defense systems to Ukraine.

Lankford spoke on the Senate floor to outline his concerns with Judge Jackson and why he opposed her nomination.  Lankford met with Judge Jackson last week and announced he would oppose her confirmation. TranscriptMr. President—There's been a lot of conversation in the past several weeks about Judge Jackson and judicial philosophy. Rightfully so. This is a lifetime appointment on the United States Supreme Court. It's a serious position. I don't know a single Senator in this room that doesn't take their responsibility seriously. This is a big issue when you put anyone on the Supreme Court for a life appointment. Everyone's had the opportunity to be table to go through case law, cases that she's handled, that she's responded to, things that she's written, ways that she responded. Actually I had time to sit down with her for about 45 minutes in the office. Just to be able to talk and get back and forth with her a little bit. I want to give you a little context of this. Many Americans watched all the hearings last week, a full week of conversations with her asking all kinds of different questions. I don't serve on the Judiciary Committee. Some on the outside looking in, that's why I had time individually with her to talk to her for 45 minutes to be able to ask her questions and get to know her. By the way, I had folks in Oklahoma ask if I sat down with her and they asked what she's like. To all of them I’ve answered the same way. I said, she's the kind of person you'd want to invite over to dinner and sit and visit with. Extremely pleasant, outgoing, personable, smart, wonderful smile, and interaction. You would want to invite her over for dinner. My decision is not to invite her to dinner to spend time with. My decision is how to handle the lifetime position of the Supreme Court and how they'll handle the law. The difficult part of this conversation has been circled around judicial philosophy. How will you handle cases? We can't ask how you will rule on a specific case because if she answers then she has to recuse herself from that case in the days ahead. And everyone knows that. So we always try to determine how will you treat cases and what lens will you look through. That's a reasonable conversation. Her response has been interesting. Her response was that she had a methodology as a judge and it has three aspects to it. Neutrality, that's a good thing, receiving all the appropriate inputs, that's making sure everyone is heard, and looking at the factual record and the text of the statute. That is actually a good starting point. The question goes to the next set of questions on it about how do you handle the United States Constitution and where does that document fit in? Is it living, is it changing, is it the original text and meaning of it? Or does it have it have a living version that changes. That's a reasonable conversation because there are different Justices on the Supreme Court that handle that differently. The late Justice William Brennan, he wrote, ‘ for the genius of the Constitution rest not in any static meaning it might have had in a world that is dead and gone, but an adaptability of it’s great principals to coupe with current problems and current needs.’ Well, that's not an original context locked into that. Justice Scalia wrote, ‘the Constitution I interrupt and apply is not living, but is dead, or as I prefer to call it, enduring. It means today not what current society or the Courts think it ought to mean but what it meant when it was adopted.’ In other words, those words had meaning at that time. They couldn't predict what the words might mean 100 years from now. They couldn't only deal with how the words meant right now. If it's going to have a different meaning at a different time, well there has to be different law to be able to deal with that at a different time. We never got a clear answer on that. We got things towards her methodology, but that is a critical issue.  There were issues about sentencing that came up and how she chose to do sentencing at a district court level and handled cases. They were all over the news about some of the cases she handled that were very lenient in the sentencing. There were questions about Second Amendment or about due process. There was kind of the moment of the judicial hearings when Senator Blackburn asked, not a trick question, but a real conversational question about how do you handle the law and culture, and that is can you define a woman? I honestly don't think that Senator Blackburn meant for that to be a trick question, but it really is a question in culture at this point. It’s going to determine how will you be able to handle the law and to be able to read the law. Her response was she can't answer the question of how to define a woman because she's not a biologist. Well, I’m not a biologist either, but I can answer that question. And it’s just a conversational issue we have as a nation to be able to determine, let’s be able to deal with things that are self-evident. There are additional things during the hearing, but I didn't want to revisit those issues. I wanted to spend the time talking through things that were not discussed. There were several issues that weren't discussed about how she handles the law. One of those is tribal law. In some areas of the country this is a big deal and in some areas it is not at all. So I understand why it didn't come up in the hearings. In her past history in her cases, she had one case to deal with tribal law. There's a lot of questions to be able to talk about. Oklahoma is very proud of who we are as a state. We have great diversity as a state. We have a unique relationship in Indian Country in our state, and I thought it was important for us to be able to talk about the relationship that our state has with 39 Tribes, and, quite frankly, the history our state has. As we were the state where tribes were relocated to from the southeast. We spent a lot of time talking about that. We talked about issues of religious liberty, First Amendment issues, how you handle those cases, there's differences even in the Court, even on what is the more liberal side of the Court. Sotomayor and Kagan often disagree on issues of religious liberty. They handle it with a different perspective. And it’s not uncommon for a religious liberty case to come up and Sotomayor and Kagan can be on either side. So, quite frankly, I was trying to discern is this person more like Sotomayor or Kagan. Is this person more like Sotomayor or more like Kagan on how she will handle the issues of religious liberty. I wanted to deal with the role of balance of power and checks and balances. It didn't come up a lot in the hearings, but I think that is a foundational issue. Quite frankly, this is the fourth Supreme Court Justice I’ve had the opportunity to sit down with personally and with each of them the issues that I just brought up is what I talked with them about. They don't often come up in the other issues but to me it's foundational. We have three branches of government defined by our Constitution. Those branches are coequal and they check each other. It's important they do check each other. The Legislative Branch doesn't just give it away to the Executive Branch or the courts. Or the Legislative Branch doesn't run over the courts or the Executive Branch. Neither can the Executive Branch or Judicial Branch do for either. If the Judicial Branch sits passive at a moment they should engage, the other two branches are not checked. Or if the Judicial Branch engages in a moment when they should be silent, they've exceeded their authority as well. It's exceptionally important that the three branches both check each other and also know their lane and do their lane well. There are two cases that popped out. They became very significant to me and were part of our conversation as well. There was a case that came up during the Trump Administration when Judge Jackson was at the District Court level. It dealt with this issue of expedited removal. Now, it's my guess that she doesn't like the expedited removal process in immigration, but I didn't ask and I didn't drill down on that. So it was only my guess. But what was interesting was she ruled on a case on expedited removal and forbid the Trump Administration from actually putting in place what they did and did it nationwide. The problem was when that was appealed up to the DC Circuit Court, the DC Circuit Court actually reversed Judge Jackson's preliminary injunction and reminded Judge Jackson at that point that the way the law was written made this statement, ‘that the Secretary had sole and unreviewable discretion.’ She literally reviewed a decision made by a Secretary where specifically in the law it stated a judge cannot review this decision though she overturned it only to go to the Circuit Court and have them overturn her. That tells me a balance of power issue, of knowing what your lane is and determining how that lane is taken on. There's another case that came up. Actually during the Trump Administration as well when Judge Jackson was also in the District Court and she dealt with the issue about what unions could do and what the Executive Branch could do in relationship to unions. It's been a contentious issue quite frankly for decades. It's entirely reasonable to have that kind of dialogue about it. She ruled in the favor of the unions and the DC Circuit again reversed her decision when it came there, but it's not just that they reversed her decision. It's that they reversed her decision and this is the statement from the DC Circuit, ‘We reverse because the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.’ In other words, that's not your responsibility in that lane. Specifically that kind of issue has to be taken up by the Federal Labor Relations Board. In statute it says it can't go to a District Court. It has to go to a different place. Typically other judges look at it and say you can't be in this spot to be able to argue this and send it into the correct place. Instead she ruled on it in favor of the unions and declared it done until the Circuit came back and said that's not your lane. That's actually the Executive Branch's lane. And then one of the most interesting dialogues when we had to be able to talk through things was the issue about deference. Now what does this matter? Well, for about 80 years Congress has been writing the law that gets broader and broader and broader. Quite frankly it's been a problem with both parties. Though we want to see something done, we write a broad law, send it to the Executive Branch and say figure it out. And each Executive Branch is getting more creative on how they figure it out, and we deal with all kinds of regulations and both parties argue with the Executive Branch. And say why do you do that? And the Executive Branch responds back sometimes, well, you gave me the ability to make that decision on my own so I did. This issue of deference and of delegation is a very significant constitutional principle. It's an issue that we've got to resolve here as a body. Quite frankly on both sides of the aisle to be jealous of the responsibility we're given in the Constitution. But it's also an issue I think is very important for the courts to be able to engage in because the courts are able to step in uniquely to the Executive Branch in the way the Legislative Branch cannot. The Legislative Branch can complain about it. The Courts actually can look at it and say you're out of your lane to the Executive Branch. If the Court is passive in this, then whoever the Executive is gets to run. One of the clearest examples of those is something that's called Chevron deference or our deference. We won't go into the all the details on it but it basically says if a piece of legislation, the way that is written, is ambiguous, then the Executive Branch can interpret it in the way that they choose. I have a problem with that interpretation. Because I believe if a law was written poorly, we shouldn't just give it to the Executive Branch and say figure it out. What do you want it to mean? If it doesn't mean something clearly, it doesn't mean anything at all. Now, it's about two issues. One is a constitutional issue. If you go to 1803, Marbury v. Madison, it's a foundational piece for the Supreme Court. It is the piece that has come up over and over again through the last two centuries. The foundational statement that came out of Marbury v. Madison is this simple statement, “It is emphatically the duty of the Judicial Department to say what the law is.’ If the Judicial hands to the Executive and says we can't tell what the law says so we'll give it to you. It is literally the judicial handing to the Executive something that's uniquely the Judicial Branch’s power. This is no simple issue. This goes back to our balance of power. What we have is a situation now over the past several decades where Congress is given its power to the Executive Branch. If the Judicial Branch does the same, giving its power to the Executive Branch, we have a rising Executive Branch and the other two bodies will look at it and say how did that happen because we gave it away is how it happened. And we have a more and more powerful president of either party and a less and less powerful Congress and Judicial Branch. My conversation with Judge Jackson, she repeated over and over to me that the Court is limited, the Court is limited, the Court is limited. I said yes, they are limited but they have responsibility. And the Court's responsibility is to say what the law is. And at the moment as I said to her, if I threw letters on the table, the Executive Branch doesn't have the ability to say I will make them say whatever I want to. If a law was written and the law said orange, penny, Ford, desk, Reagan. All those are English words but quite frankly they don't really make a sentence. The authority shouldn't be given to the Executive Branch to be able to figure out what they can make of that. The responsibility should be in the Judicial Branch to be able to look at that and says that means nothing. Congress, go do your homework. Clean it up. The Executive Branch can't just make it mean what they want it to say and say what the law is. Congress has to say, make it clear, and the Judicial Branch has to say what the law is, and the Executive Branch has to apply it. Now again this is very philosophical. But it's also foundational in our constitutional construct. It's why I find myself in the position of voting no for someone I personally liked when I met. But do not align with on how you handle the Constitution, separation of powers, and the responsibility of the Court to align with original intent of the Constitution. This is not a new dialogue for us in the Senate body. It's conversation we've had for two centuries that is still unresolved for us. But we cannot select individuals that are not committed to the original meaning of the Constitution and can hand to the Executive Branch what the law says. This is one that we need to guard and so for that reason when the vote comes tomorrow on Judge Jackson, I will vote no.###"

Lankford questioned IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to receive an update on hiring processes at the IRS to recruit new agents to serve Americans filing their taxes, answer their questions, and address amended returns, etc. Rettig told Lankford the IRS is benefitting from direct-hiring authority, which Lankford has called for previously, at several facilities, including the Kansas City processing facility, which impacts Oklahoma. Lankford also asked about attrition and how Biden’s vaccine mandate has impacted IRS employees morale and retention.Lankford joined 100 of his colleagues in a letter to the IRS demanding much needed relief as the agency struggles to address customer service needs and processing issues. Lankford sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and IRS Commissioner Rettig to urge the IRS to do everything it can to support taxpayers during the current tax filing season. Lankford also sent a letter to IRS Commissioner Rettig concerning the IRS’s ability to process Americans’ private information in a safe and timely way, and the many troublesome issues facing the agency. Lankford’s letter presses the IRS for answers about the ProPublica data leak, the targeting of religious organizations seeking tax-exempt status, IT security failures, return processing backlogs, and Democrats’ proposed billions in “enforcement” funds and ongoing attempts to force Americans to have their bank accounts tracked by the IRS.ExcerptLankford: You were given direct-hire authority. This has been an issue I’ve talked about in my other committees and in this Committee as well. You’ve been given access for 10,000 of those. But I don’t know yet what positions you’re using those for. I don’t need the exact location of what desk. What’s the type of position that you’re looking for in that direct hiring authority, and how are you  using it?...Do you have individuals that are in the processing center or answering phones? Is that in your direct hire authority, or are those not in your direct hiring authority?Rettig: It is. Where we’re hiring is Kansas City, Austin, and Ogden, and that’s where our three big processing centers are.  With direct hiring authority, Congress rescued us. There’s no question about it. We are able to onboard folks in those facilities within 30 to 45 days. We needed them in December, but without direct hiring authority we’re competing with Wal Mart, we’re competing with Target—which is onboarding at $20 an hour, our folks are at $15. And we’re competing with Amazon. And then, without direct hiring authority, we have to tell these individuals, it may be six to eight months before we can bring you onboard. For these folks, they need that job now.###C"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-sinema-colleagues-introduce-bill-delaying-end-of-title-42-and-ensuring-comprehensive-plan-in-place-to-secure-the-border,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senators James Lankford (R-OK), lead Republican on the Border Management Subcommittee of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Chair of the Border Management Subcommittee of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, John Cornyn (R-TX), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), John Thune (R-SD), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Jon Tester (D-MT), Rob Portman (R-OH), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), and Thom Tillis (R-NC) introduced the Public Health and Border Security Act to require all COVID-19 related national states of emergency to be lifted before Title 42 is officially terminated.“The Biden Administration is declaring the pandemic over on our southern border but still active on our healthcare workers, military, and travelers. Department of Homeland Security intel projections show that potentially a million people will illegally cross the moment Title 42 is lifted. But instead of a workable replacement plan, the only plan the Biden Administration seems to have is moving people faster into the interior of the country,” said Lankford. “They cannot have it both ways. If they think it’s safe enough to lift Title 42 at the border, then it must be safe enough to lift the COVID-19 state of emergency on the whole country. But when we drop Title 42 at the border, DHS must also implement a workable solution to expel migrants.”“Arizona communities bear the brunt of the federal government’s failure at our border, so we’re stepping in and protecting border communities by ensuring the Administration works hand-in-hand with local leaders, law enforcement, and nonprofits to put a comprehensive, workable plan in place before lifting Title 42. I’ll continue pushing for transparency and accountability from the Administration to help secure the border, keep Arizona communities safe, and ensure migrants are treated fairly and humanely,” said Sinema.The Biden Administration announced its plans to terminate the Title 42 order on May 23, a move Lankford and Sinema strongly oppose due to inadequate time for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to provide a plan that will prevent further chaos at the border. Lankford and Sinema’s bill prevents the Administration from ending the Title 42 emergency authority until at least 60 days after ending the COVID-19 national emergency declaration. After the end of the national emergency, the Department of Homeland Security would have thirty days to submit to Congress a plan to address the impacts of the post-Title 42 migrant influx. That plan must be made in coordination with local governments, federal agencies, and non-governmental organizations on the front-lines of the migrant crisis.A bill to end the federal emergency declaration passed the Senate on March 3, 2022, with Lankford’s support, and at that time Lankford advised against revoking Title 42 until DHS puts a workable plan in place to end the chaos at the southern border.Lankford started talking about the impact of Title 42 on the Senate floor in March of 2021. Lankford sent a letter to Senators and warned the media recently to make sure they’re aware of the chaos that is about to begin if the Biden Administration follows through with plans to lift Title 42 authority and said he will bring a resolution of disapproval forward to overturn the Biden Administration’s attempt to lift the Title 42 order, without a workable solution.Last week, Sinema spoke with DHS Secretary Mayorkas to discuss the Administration’s Title 42 contingency plans. She underscored how Arizona communities and migrants could be harmed if a Title 42 end is not accompanied by proper planning, coordination, and resources. Sinema also raised concerns she heard from her recent virtual border roundtable with federal and non-governmental partners in Arizona, and other conversations she has had with Arizona DHS officials. Sinema called for DHS to launch an intergovernmental coordination effort to ensure communication between federal, state, local, and non-governmental partners to strengthen cooperation. Secretary Mayorkas agreed to move forward with that strategy across the country. Last June, Sinema asked Secretary Mayorkas to proactively create a comprehensive plan in advance of an end to Title 42 and requested to be briefed on this plan.###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-wants-answers-for-googles-censorship-of-conservative-speech-,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) sent a letter today to the Chief Executive Officer of Google Sundar Pichai regarding YouTube’s removal of videos from the Conservative Political Action Conference’s (CPAC) channel. YouTube, which is owned by Google, claims the videos contain “misleading information” but did not disclose what information was “misleading” to CPAC. Lankford participated in a panel at CPAC on Big Tech censorship during the February 2022 conference. He separately uploaded clips from his talk at the conference to YouTube, which have not been censored by Google, yet. Lankford stated in the letter, “Ironically, a portion of one of the videos that YouTube removed was the panel discussion I participated in that focused on big-tech censorship and the repeated pattern of targeted attacks on conservative voices. For example, big-tech pushes its liberal ideology in America while submitting to authoritarian regimes and censoring that same ideology in other countries. Further, those same regimes are provided a platform and rarely face the same censorship shown toward conservatives in the United States. Citing protections under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, companies then actively pick and choose what viewpoints are approved speech. YouTube’s actions further validate the points I and others made on the panel, namely the need for Congress to finally address the scope of Section 230.”You can view the text of the letter HERE and below.Dear Mr. Pichai: It has come to my attention that YouTube recently removed videos from the Conservative Political Action Conference’s (CPAC) channel from the organization’s February 2022 conference. YouTube claims the videos contain “misleading information,” but did not provide details on what information it considered “misleading.” In addition to removing the video, YouTube gave CPAC one strike on its account and offered no additional information regarding the censorship or a path forward for maintaining all or a portion of the video on its channel. Ironically, a portion of one of the videos that YouTube removed was the panel discussion I participated in that focused on big-tech censorship and the repeated pattern of targeted attacks on conservative voices. For example, big-tech pushes its liberal ideology in America while submitting to authoritarian regimes and censoring that same ideology in other countries. Further, those same regimes are provided a platform and rarely face the same censorship shown toward conservatives in the United States. Citing protections under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, companies then actively pick and choose what viewpoints are approved speech. YouTube’s actions further validate the points I and others made on the panel, namely the need for Congress to finally address the scope of Section 230.The “Big 5” tech companies – Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon - hold a combined market share of more than $9 trillion and control an even greater share of speech in America. Google and other large tech companies leave organizations like CPAC with little explanation and recourse when they are accused of violating community guidelines merely for expressing their political opinions or in this case, posting a video that contained political beliefs of others. It’s no secret that these violations are often shrouded behind ambiguous user terms and agreements that can be broadly misapplied and have the appearance of viewpoint-based censorship rather than actual violations of policies or guidelines. The actions taken to reprimand CPAC require greater transparency and explanation. As such, I ask that you answer the following questions: Please reply no later than April 22, 2022. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.In God We Trust,###  "
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-everyone-knows-high-gas-prices-are-because-of-bidens-anti-energy-policies,"CLICK HERE to watch Lankford’s remarks and Q&A on YouTube.CLICK HERE to watch Lankford’s remarks and Q&A on Rumble.CLICK HERE to download Lankford’s graphic of Oklahoma gas prices.WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today stood up for traditional US energy production and for Oklahoma families who continue to pay almost a dollar more for gasoline at the pump compared to last year. Lankford led a Senate Republican press conference today and said that Biden’s progressive anti-energy policies are to blame for the high prices at the pump, not just Putin’s war. Lankford offered specific examples of Biden’s anti-energy policies and discussed Biden’s misguided attempt to “solve” high gas prices by releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which Lankford explained would not solve the problem. Lankford also pointed out that although Democrats want to blame “big oil” for price gouging or blame Putin, the real problem is in the mirror.Lankford continues to lead the Senate on how to address the problems Biden has caused, including stalled US energy production, skyrocketing gas prices, and increased home heating costs. Lankford recently introduced the Energy Regulations Certainty Act to prevent President Biden from issuing new US oil and gas regulations and restrictions until after Russian troops have withdrawn from Ukraine. Lankford sent two letters to the President urging him to restore America’s energy dominance and to change course on the failing energy policies that are emboldening Putin. Lankford stood up to FERC for its ongoing push to stifle and even stop US energy production because of Biden’s agenda that is lock-step with climate-change extremists.Lankford continues to call out the Biden Administration for blaming everyone but themselves for high gas prices that were clearly high even before Russia invaded Ukraine due to their own bad policies. Lankford penned a column on Democrats’ attempts to blame energy companies for “price gouging” amid their calls to haul them before the House of Representatives this week.Transcript of Lankford’s opening remarksSo there are obvious issues with gasoline prices across the country. You don’t have to go very far and you run into folks who are frustrated with the price of gasoline. I don’t know a single person that’s not filling up their tank across the country and saying, ‘This is killing my food budget, my housing budget,’ everything they have to be able to deal with. I asked some of my field team, just as they’re out and about this week across Oklahoma, to just snap a price of the gasses that’re going on right now this week in Oklahoma. And you can see in Kingfisher, just for regular unleaded here, Kingfisher, $3.99, and Tulsa, QT’s the winner here, at $3.53. We’d love to see that around Washington, DC, or many areas of the country. If you get into Marshall, Oklahoma, $4.29. If you get to El Reno, Oklahoma, $3.95, in Moore, Oklahoma, $4.00, and in Caney, Oklahoma, $3.99. This is just what’s happened in the last 24 hours around my state.What’s interesting is people look at this and they fill up their tank, and they realize it’s $75 to $125 to be able to fill up their tank with gas. What that really means for them is they can’t travel more, they can’t get out more, they can’t do more because they understand, ‘I just can’t afford to be able to do that.’ That’s the real-life decisions of Americans as they process through all this.Where did this come from? Well, currently the Biden Administration’s saying this is all Putin’s fault. We know that’s just factually not true. The price of gasoline rose from the day that President Biden came into office until the beginning of the war in Ukraine a dollar a gallon—a dollar during that time period. How did that happen? Was that because of oil companies, as over in the House of Representatives, they’re dragging in oil company executives and saying, ‘You’re gouging prices’?Well actually let’s look at the math on this. Day-one of the Biden Administration, they stepped up and canceled the Keystone pipeline and people keep saying, ‘Why does that matter?’ Well, Canada produces heavy crude. The same type of heavy crude that comes out of Russia. So we’re either going to buy that heavy crude from Russia or from Canada, and day-one, President Biden said, ‘I want to buy that type of crude from Russia, not from Canada.’The other factoid on this that’s interesting is the President’s just done a release of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The release he’s doing from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for a short period of time for the next several months is almost exactly what would be coming from the Keystone pipeline every single day from here on out. So while he’s trying to manipulate the prices with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, you can actually increase production and input into our country from an ally like Canada that’d be reliable and predictable that would actually bring prices down.What else did the President of the United States do? Day-one, cancels out the Keystone pipeline. Day-one, he looks at all the Trump Administration policies that do anything with energy and said, ‘Let’s re-evaluate all of those.’ Day-one, he shuts down everything that’s happening on federal lands as far as federal leasing—no federal leases. And he steps out and says, ‘Well there’s 9,000 that’re out there. They’ve got plenty of options on it.’ He knows the math on this. Most of those are checkerboards, where they’ll lease just one section, test it out, but they’re not going to really do production in that area until they have all the leases around it. He knows the game on that. And so, he can say there’s 9,000 leases out there really know as well that nothing’s really going to happen with it.Twenty-four percent of the oil that we get in the United States comes from those federal leases. So when he has now, still, not re-opened the short-term moratorium on federal leasing, he’s cutting off the future of oil into our country. And it continues to accelerate prices. We’ve dealt with nominees that have come across the floor in the Senate that were the selection from the Biden Administration, that their whole focus was: how are they going to take away access to capital for oil and gas companies? And literally, this week, the Biden Administration announces that they want more American companies to do more production, but then this week they release they’re budget after saying to American companies, ‘Why aren’t you producing more oil,’ the Biden Budget has 15 brand-new tax proposals that they’ve got on the production of oil and gas.So at the time that they’re saying to companies, ‘Y’all should produce more oil. You’re the problem,’ they’re not looking in the mirror, seeing 15 new taxes that they’re releasing, trying to cut off access to capital, trying to be able to make us more focused on what’s happening internationally. There are lots of issues that the Biden Administration needs to look at. This is not a result of Putin’s war. This is a result of Biden policies, and everyone knows it. And they can try to change the subject all they want to, but everyone knows, this is a direct result of the Biden policies that are here. That’s our frustration. There is a way to produce more American energy. There is a way to be able to bring prices down. They’re just not willing to do it at this point.###"

Instead of ensuring that the horrific deaths of these children were properly investigated, Metropolitan Police made the assumption that each child died as the result of a legal abortion. It is our understanding that Metropolitan Police made this assumption without conducting any medical evaluations. We also understand from press reports that the DC medical examiner does not plan to perform autopsies on the children. This is completely unacceptable.”The Members continued, “These five children, like all children, have inherent value and deserved better than abortion—they deserved life. But at a minimum, they deserve to have their deaths investigated to ensure that no DC or federal laws were broken. In light of this information, we demand that a thorough investigation is conducted into the death of each child. In order to accomplish such investigation, we request and fully expect the city to conduct autopsies on the children and preserve all collected evidence. Finally, at the conclusion of such examinations, we urge the city to properly and respectfully bury the babies.”Lankford is a leading voice in Congress for the protection of life, serving as chair of the Senate Values Action Team and a member of the Senate Pro-Life Caucus. Lankford continues to stand up for children of all ages and at all stages of development. In 2015, Lankford delivered an impassioned speech on the Senate floor about the Planned Parenthood video and their abortion practices to harvest body parts. Lankford blocked Planned Parenthood from receiving federal tax dollars in the fiscal year 2022 budget. Lankford has called on the Department of Justice to investigate Planned Parenthood, and he called for a complete investigation into the University of Pittsburgh’s abortion procedures and research.He has introduced key pro-life legislation in the Senate, including the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act. Lankford has fought the Biden Administration tooth and nail as they try to “promote” unlimited abortions and most recently introduced two resolutions of disapproval against forcing taxpayers to pay for abortion. He raised his intense and complete opposition to Senator Chuck Schumer’s (D-NY) appalling, tone-deaf vote in February on the so-called “Women’s Health Protection Act,” which Lankford said is more accurately described as a bill to allow unlimited abortions on demand until birth.Groups supporting the Members’ letter include: Live Action, Catholic Vote, Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee, March for Life, Students for Life Action, Susan B. Anthony List, Family Research Council, National Right to Life, Americans United for Life, Center for Renewing America, and Family Policy Alliance.You can view the full text of the letter HERE and below:Dear Mayor Bowser and Chief Contee: As Members of Congress, we have an obligation to conduct oversight over the District of Columbia (DC), to ensure DC upholds laws enacted by Congress, particularly those enacted to protect and uphold the sanctity of human life. Last week, DC Metropolitan Police recovered the remains of five preborn children apparently from the Washington Surgi-Clinic in Washington, DC, a facility operated by the late-term abortionist Dr. Cesare Santangelo. Instead of ensuring that the horrific deaths of these children were properly investigated, Metropolitan Police made the assumption that each child died as the result of a legal abortion. It is our understanding that the Metropolitan Police made this assumption without conducting any medical evaluations. We also understand from press reports that the D.C. medical examiner does not plan to perform autopsies on the children. This is completely unacceptable.While other horrific methods of abortion unfortunately remain legal for the time being, killing a child through a partial-birth abortion is a crime under federal law. Under the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, a partial-birth abortion occurs when a physician partially delivers a living child for the purpose of performing an overt act that intentionally takes the life of the child. The US Supreme Court upheld the federal ban on partial-birth abortions in Gonzales v. Carhart in 2007.Additionally, Congress passed the Born Alive Infants Protection Act to provide equal protections for children who are born alive during an abortion. If the bodies of other babies who were not aborted were recovered in a similar fashion, it would be hard to imagine the Metropolitan Police declining to conduct a thorough investigation into the death of each child. Based on evidence collected at the time of recovery and photos that have been publicly shared, all five of these children appear to have developed well past the point of viability, and likely suffered severely painful abortion procedures, though without an autopsy, it is not known how each child died. For example, one baby girl has significant damage to her head, with deep lacerations at the back of the neck, and may have been victim of an illegal partial birth abortion. Another baby was found in its amniotic sac and could have been born alive.  These five children, like all children, have inherent value and deserved better than abortion – they deserved life. But at a minimum, they deserve to have their deaths investigated to ensure that no DC or federal laws were broken. In light of this information, we demand that a thorough investigation is conducted into the death of each child. In order to accomplish such investigation, we request and fully expect the city to conduct autopsies on the children and preserve all collected evidence. Finally, at the conclusion of such examinations, we urge the city to properly and respectfully bury the babies.Please respond to the following questions by close of business on Wednesday, April 6, 2022.Sincerely,CC: Attorney General Merrick Garland###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-to-hhs-sec-biden-says-covid-is-not-at-the-southern-border-while-requesting-10-billion-in-covid-funding_,"CLICK HERE to watch Lankford’s Q&A on YouTube.CLICK HERE to watch Lankford’s Q&A on Rumble.WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today participated in a Senate Finance Committee hearing to discuss the President’s Fiscal Year 2023 budget request for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Today’s witness was HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. Lankford has had several direct exchanges with Becerra in the past over Becerra’s promotion of abortion, failure to enforce conscience protections for health care providers who do not want to participate in abortions, and a host of other disagreements, including last year’s HHS budget request referring to mothers as “birthing persons.”Lankford continues to serve as a leader in the Senate for life. Lankford also continues to stand up against the Administration’s announcement that it will lift Title 42 authority, a public health order overseen by Becerra, to expel migrants at the southern border because of COVID-19. Lankford is adamant that the Biden Administration needs a workable plan in place before this authority is lifted. Lankford continues to press that the Administration is saying COVID-19 is over at the border since they’re letting illegal border crossers into the US while our military is being forced to resign because they do not want to get a COVID vaccine and Americans are still forced to wear masks due to the ongoing COVID pandemic on planes, rideshares, busses, and trains.ExcerptsOn Lankford’s ongoing push to maintain Title 42 authority, a public health order, to expel migrants at the southern border, until a workable plan is submitted.Lankford: …This has been used as an immigration policy piece. For instance, the Administration came in and changed Title 42 and said, ‘If you’re coming in with a young child, then Title 42 doesn’t apply to you anymore. There is no more pandemic for you. So there are some things that have actually worked it as an immigration policy. I think our biggest issue is at the same time, there’s a request from the Administration saying, ‘We need 10 billion more dollars because of the pandemic.’ There’s also a decision to say, ‘The pandemic’s over. The risk is over at the border.’ And there’s not even a requirement for individuals crossing the border to get a vaccine when they cross. It’s made available to them but not a requirement to be able to do that. I think that’s the biggest issue that we’re seeing from everybody.  On important updates Lankford successfully pushed for at CMS about lowering prescription drug prices to help rural pharmaciesLankford: Your team at CMS and their work on DIR fees is something that I have pushed for a long time on this. I am pleased to be able to see that there is actual work going on with CMS and the DIR fees. That’s a very big issue for rural pharmacies. Continue to be able to do the work. There are a lot of people that are counting on access to rural pharmacies and other pharmacies based on that work. Just don’t allow entities out there to be able to water everything down with what actually needs to be done. Keep going all the way through.###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-celebrates-win-in-demand-for-action-to-address-prescription-drug-costs-for-oklahoma-seniors-pharmacies,"WASHINGTON, DC  – Senator James Lankford (R-OK), a member of the Senate Finance Committee with jurisdiction over the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), celebrated a huge win for Oklahoma seniors and local pharmacies as Medicare officials finalized sweeping changes to Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans for seniors. Part of this now-final rule from CMS mimics plans for lowering out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries for which Lankford has advocated for several years. In January, Lankford celebrated the rule’s proposal.“I can’t overstate how important this is to our local and family-owned pharmacies in Oklahoma. This rule aims to fix the number-one problem I hear about from local Oklahoma pharmacies. After years of me pushing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to take action, CMS is finally addressing the litany of red tape in the drug pricing process,” said Lankford. “This important change will provide our local pharmacies more of the clarity they need to offer drugs at a price their patients can afford since the price-gimmick haggling will be drastically reduced before it gets to them. We are slowly unraveling the process by which prescription drugs have become so expensive in our nation. There is still work to be done, but this is a big win for patients and independent pharmacies.”BackgroundIn October 2021, Lankford sent a letter to CMS calling on them to either work with Congress to eliminate “direct and indirect remuneration” (DIR) fees to help lower prescription drug prices for Medicare Part D beneficiaries or to take administrative action to address the problem. CMS’s final rule will do just that by essentially eliminating DIR fees through requiring all price concessions to be passed through to the consumer, beginning in 2024. These reforms are estimated to save seniors over $21 billion in the next decade. This change is one success of hopefully many to come from that call to action.Lankford has repeatedly called out abusive practices of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), who act as middlemen between pharmacies and insurers, in the negotiation of the final price of a prescription drug. One of these harmful practices is the issuing of retroactive DIR fees, which are clawback fees required sometimes several months after a pharmacy dispenses a drug to a patient. These fees range in size and timing, causing local pharmacies great uncertainty and driving up seniors’ out-of-pocket drug costs. According to CMS, DIR fees have increased more than 107,400 percent between 2010 and 2020. This has contributed to the closing of hundreds of independent community pharmacies.Lankford has worked for years to pursue workable solutions to lower prescription drug costs. Last May, Lankford introduced the Pharmacy DIR Reform To Reduce Senior Drug Costs Act, which would end DIR fees by ensuring that all drug discounts and rebates that go into a drug’s negotiated price are reflected at the pharmacy counter. In 2019, he penned an op-ed in Modern Healthcare to talk about some of those solutions geared toward market-based proposals that can actually pass through Congress. The op-ed focused on PBMs the drug middlemen, in the pricing process and was reinforced in a follow-up piece in Oklahoma’s Journal Record by David L. Holden, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon and past president of the Oklahoma County Medical Society. ###"

We are thankful for their work to get everyone out safely and strongly condemn the antisemitic hate that fueled this heinous act. We want the families and community members affected to know that we stand beside you, we are praying for you, ask the nation to pray for you, and we will continue working to eradicate the scourge of antisemitism.”  ###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-scott-colleagues-demand-answers-on-scheme-to-label-parents-domestic-terrorists,"OKLAHOMA CITY, OK – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) joined Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) and a group of their Republican colleagues to send a letter demanding answers from US Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona on reports that he played a key role in orchestrating a letter from the National School Boards Association (NSBA) that called concerned parents “domestic terrorists.”“The National School Boards Association’s letter to the President of the United States, which he then turned into an FBI investigation which accused parents of potential domestic terrorism, made concerned parents even more concerned about what’s really going on in their schools,” said Lankford. “Oklahoma parents rightly want a voice in their child’s education. They are tired of progressive ‘woke’ culture being forced on their children, without their consent, by teachers, schools, school boards, and the federal government. I demand to know if the US Secretary of Education encouraged calling concerned parents ‘domestic terrorists.’ We need answers about the US Secretary of Education’s involvement in this process because clearly using federal law enforcement to intimidate parents into silence has crossed a line.”Joining Lankford and Scott in sending the letter were Senators Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Richard Burr (R-NC), John Thune (R-SD), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Mike Braun (R-IN), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Rand Paul (R-KY), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Ron Johnson (R-WI), John Boozman (R-AR), John Barrasso (R-WY), Susan Collins (R-ME), Rick Scott (R-FL), John Cornyn (R-TX), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Mike Lee (R-UT), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and John Hoeven (R-ND).“Parents are not ‘domestic terrorists,’ and it is appalling that anyone would suggest that exercising the constitutionally protected freedoms of speech and assembly would be characterized as a threat,” wrote the senators in their letter. “Parents across the country are outraged that their children’s education has been disrupted, delayed, even denied over the past two years.”“While we knew early on that White House staff were complicit in the creation of this letter, it is only recently that information has surfaced implicating you and your office in this shameful episode,” the senators continued. “News reports indicate that the letter from the NSBA to President Biden was actually initiated at your request. Accountability begins at the top, and as US Secretary of Education you must explain your role, or your staff’s role, in the creation of this letter.”BackgroundOn September 29, 2021, the NSBA sent a letter to President Biden accusing parents expressing concern and frustration with lockdowns, shutdowns, school closures, mandates and more of “domestic terrorism.” In response, on October 4, 2021, Attorney General Merrick Garland issued a memo directing the FBI and US Attorneys to act on the contents of the NSBA letter. On October 22, 2021, the NSBA apologized for the letter after receiving significant backlash from state school board associations. This week, new reporting revealed emails indicating the NSBA letter was sent to the Biden Administration at the request of Secretary Cardona.You can view the full letter HERE or below.Dear Secretary Cardona:  Parents are not “domestic terrorists,” and it is appalling that anyone would suggest that exercising the constitutionally protected freedoms of speech and assembly would be characterized as a threat. Parents across the country are outraged that their children’s education has been disrupted, delayed, even denied over the past two years.  Study after study shows how much educational harm has been done to schoolchildren with shutdowns and closures. It is estimated most students lost between 30 and 50 percent of their learning gains because of school closures. Moreover, minority and low-income students and students with disabilities were among the hardest hit as a result of these disruptions, with many losing as much as a full year of educational progress. Students’ mental health suffered as well. According to the CDC, teen suicide attempts among girls increased by 51 percent, likely due in part to students’ inability to access in-person learning.  Yet on September 29, 2021, the National School Boards Association (NSBA) sent a letter to President Biden accusing parents expressing concern and frustration with lockdowns, shutdowns, school closures, mandates and more with “domestic terrorism.” The letter even suggested using the PATRIOT Act against parents who are concerned about months and years of lost educational opportunities due to school closures, shutdowns, and unnecessary restrictions.  On October 4, 2021, Attorney General Garland issued a memo at NSBA’s behest, directing the FBI and US. Attorneys to act on the contents of the NSBA letter. That evoked the prospects of the FBI using the powers of the PATRIOT Act against peacefully protesting parents frantic to get their children back in school so they don’t fall behind and lose a year of education.  On October 22, 2021, the NSBA apologized for the letter, as they should. Many state school board associations have called into question their affiliation with the NSBA, and the NSBA has a lot of work to do to regain the trust of America’s moms and dads without significant reforms.  Unfortunately, the Attorney General has not rescinded his memo, as he should.  While we knew early on that White House staff were complicit in the creation of this letter, it is only recently that information has surfaced implicating you and your office in this shameful episode. News reports indicate that the letter from the NSBA to President Biden was actually initiated at your request.  Accountability begins at the top, and as US Secretary of Education you must explain your role, or your staff’s role, in the creation of this letter.  Please respond to the following questions by 4:00 p.m., Friday, January 14, 2022:Thank you for your attention to this matter.  Sincerely,###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-scott-colleagues-want-to-stop-congress-from-overspending-when-inflation-soars-,"OKLAHOMA CITY, OK – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) joined Senators Tim Scott (R-SC) and John Thune (R-SD), and eight of their colleagues to introduce the Inflation Prevention Act (IPA) to help combat inflationary spending. Due to record government spending over the last two years, many Americans face rapidly rising costs of consumer goods. This bill would bar legislation estimated to increase inflation until the year-over-year inflation rate drops below 4.5 percent. Lankford, Scott, and Thune are joined on the bill by Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Rick Scott (R-FL), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Todd Young (R-IN), Marco Rubio (R-FL), John Hoeven (R-ND), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), and Steve Daines (R-MT).“It’s clear that Democrats’ reckless spending approach to the pandemic has created the inflation crisis Oklahomans now face, especially after inflation hit a devastating 7 percent in December,” said Lankford. “I have warned about the impact of out-of-control spending on our economy for years. Our proposal protects against federal over spending that makes inflation worse, helps make sure future emergency spending only moves forward when absolutely needed, and reins it in when the federal pork barrel buffet starts to roll toward inflation.”“American families cannot continue to endure the burden of skyrocketing costs of everyday goods brought on by reckless spending in Washington,” said Tim Scott. “A sound financial future requires wise financial action now.”“Our country is facing the highest level of inflation in nearly 40 years, and South Dakotans are paying more for food, utilities, and gas,” said Thune. “I’m proud to join Sen. Scott in the fight to stop the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending spree, which would significantly worsen the already damaging inflation crisis.”“From gas to groceries, Iowans and all Americans are paying higher prices because of record inflation stoked by irresponsible government spending. Our bill seeks to prevent Congress from pouring even more gasoline on the fires of inflation by restricting the ability of Congress to approve new spending while inflation remains historically high,” said Grassley.“Families are worried about the skyrocketing inflation our country is experiencing. We know that reckless government spending causes inflation, but President Biden and the Democrats have absolutely no plans to slow down spending or get our debt under control. It’s shameful. Congress needs to get real about the true cost on every American family that this wasteful spending brings and start acting responsibly. That’s why we must pass the Inflation Prevention Act. I look forward to my colleagues supporting this measure to stop reckless spending and getting our country back on the path to prosperity,” said Rick Scott.“President Biden’s policies continue to cause soaring inflation–the highest in forty years–pinching the pocketbooks of hardworking Iowans and making it harder for them to purchase everyday household items from groceries to gasoline. We must reign in the Democrats’ out of control spending, and this effort will take steps to ensure spendthrift lawmakers are held accountable for the impact their action have on everyday Americans,” said Ernst.“Under the Biden inflation crisis, inflation is at a 40-year high and working Americans are struggling to pay for the daily essentials. For months, Democrats have ignored the problem, blaming everything instead of their socialist spending agenda. The Inflation Prevention Act would ensure that the bills we are voting on in Congress do not make this problem worse,” said Young.“Everyday Americans could care less about a lot of the issues we have been discussing lately in the Senate,” said Rubio. “What people are really worried about is the fact that it costs more to feed their families and put gas in their cars. People can’t get basic goods because grocery store shelves are empty. And rather than fixing the problem, the Biden Administration and Democrats in Congress are making things worse. This bill puts a few commonsense guardrails in place to curb reckless spending habits in Congress that threaten to create even more challenges for American families. That’s the kind of action we should be taking right now.”“Inflation is a tax on all Americans and it is now the highest rate it has been in 40 years,” said Hoeven. “The Inflation Prevention Act will prohibit legislation that worsens inflation. Prices are continuing to rise, and our bill will help prevent further harm to American consumers.”This bill is supported by the National Taxpayers Union, Heritage Action, Americans for Tax Reform, FreedomWorks, and the Conservative Political Action Coalition (CPAC).###"

Today’s ruling states what every Oklahoman has known for months—President Biden does not have the authority to reach into every private business to say who should be hired and who should be fired. We are the United States of America. We do still believe in individual freedom, and today, the Supreme Court affirmed that constitutional right for every American.”Lankford, along with 46 of his Republican Senate Colleagues and 136 of Republican members of the House of Representatives filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court  that argues that Congress did not give the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) the authority to impose a vaccine mandate and urges the Supreme Court to stay the mandate. Background:###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-votes-for-us-to-sanction-russias-nord-stream-2-pipeline,"WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today issued a statement after the Senate voted on legislation to impose US sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Nord Stream 2 is a natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany running through the Baltic Sea. Earlier this year, Biden waived sanctions on those involved in the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which threatens the energy security of the US and our European allies. By contrast, President Trump imposed a total of 25 sanctions on the pipeline during his presidency. “Cancelling sanctions on Russia as they aggressively move against their neighbors shows American weakness, hurts US energy dominance, threatens the security of our allies, and gives more power to Putin. I strongly support US sanctions on the Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Biden and his team have tried to appease the Kremlin by not imposing sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, even as the Biden Administration blocked domestic energy in America like the Keystone pipeline. Biden’s foreign and domestic policy makes absolutely no sense to most Oklahomans.”###"
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-warns-senate-democrats-against-destroying-filibuster-for-schumers-progressive-tantrum,"CLICK HERE to watch Lankford’s remarks on YouTube.WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK) spoke on the Senate floor today about Majority Leader Schumer’s (D-NY) scheme to get rid of the legislative filibuster in order to get his “voting rights” bill passed. Earlier today, Lankford joined Senate Republicans in a press conference on his firm stance that the filibuster remain in place.Lankford joined Fox News Sunday Night in America with Trey Gowdy to discuss Democrats’ latest effort to get rid of the filibuster in order to push their stalled legislative agenda, including “voting rights” and “Build Back Broke.” Lankford called out Democrats’ hypocrisy on trying to nuke the filibuster and frequently references the letter that 32 Democrats sent to Senator McConnell (R-KY) in an effort to preserve it including tonight on the Senate floor. Lankford responded to Senator Chuck Schumer’s (D-NY) threat to bend Senate rules to his progressive legislative agenda. Lankford remains opposed to Democrats’ push to federalize elections and take them out of the hands of states.Excerpts… In 1965, our nation took bold step to make sure we protected the rights of every single individual to be able to vote because there was a season in American history where Black Americans were being pushed out. There were poll taxes, Jim Crow laws, things that pushed people away from voting. So in 1965 our nation passed the Voting Rights Act... That stands today. If a single person or group of people are suppressed in their voting, are prohibited from voting, federal courts today have the right to be able to step in on any jurisdiction, any state in America to be able to protect the rights of individuals to be able to vote. I bring that to this body as a reminder because for some reason an enormous portion of this body on the left side of this room are running around the nation and saying, if we don't do something right now, there'll be voter suppression in America and we have to change that. When they all know in 1965 we passed the Voting Rights Act, and that Act still stands today to be able to protect the rights of individuals…… Most of the areas in their bill we look at and go are you kidding me? We disagree on this. Things like same-day voter registration where a person could literally walk in, say, ‘I’ve never registered to vote before,’ tell them their name and then vote on the spot. Honestly, I have a problem with that because there is no way to be able to validate that they didn't vote in Oklahoma City and then go vote in Tulsa and then vote in Muskogee, Oklahoma. There is no way to know. They just voted and there is no way to validate that person is even that person… … We have a disagreement on the issue of felons voting. Each state makes that decision whether they're going to allow felons to vote, but in this piece of legislation, Democrats are bringing, they're saying, ‘No, felons have to be given the right to vote when they get out of prison.’ Now, I understand we may disagree on that, but I want you to stand what they're saying. My Democrat colleagues are saying, ‘I will blow up the rules of the Senate and change 250 years of history in the Senate to get my way, if you don't allow rapists, convicted murderers, and convicted sex offenders to be able to vote.’ They are so determined that sex offenders get the right to vote, they're willing to blow up the rules of the senate to get it. Can we not have a disagreement on whether to force states to mandate that convicted murderers, sex offenders and rapists get to vote again?...… In this piece of legislation, they provide government funding, taxpayer funding for Members of the House of Representatives, just down the hall over there. Here's the way they set it up. If you're running for the House of Representatives and you raise small dollar donations, then taxpayers will fund your campaign on a six to one match. It gets even better because you as a candidate could actually take a salary from that as well and actually be paid by the taxpayer to be able to run for office, if you're running in the House of Representatives. Can we not have a disagreement on that? I don't meet many people in Oklahoma that say they want to fund House Members running in New York state or California or Illinois or even in Oklahoma. They don't want to fund them with their tax dollars……Our state passed House Bill 2663. House Bill 2663 did a couple of things. It added an extra day of early voting for the general elections. Added an extra day of in-person early voting. And it said if you request an absentee ballot, you have to do that 15 days prior to the election. Do you know why we did that? Because the United States Postal Service contacted every state and asked them to do that, because the Postal Service said, ‘We can no longer guarantee we can get something mailed to a person and give them time to get it actually mailed back in time for the election.’ So to make sure people's votes actually count, we did what the United States Postal Service actually recommended to us. We moved our requests for an absentee ballot to 15 days before the election to make sure every vote would count…… So what's happening now with this? Well, there's two big issues here. One is this fight over voting, whether states make decisions on voting or whether Washington, DC, Democrats make decisions on voting for their states, even if it's a Democrat state. And then the next big issue is are the Democrats in this room actually going to destroy the filibuster and silence the rights of the minority in America? Now, if you would have asked me four years ago, I would have said no way. That's not going to happen. Because a group of Democrats and a group of Republicans joined together and said, [they] are committed to not destroying the legislative filibuster. Why? Because it's what makes the House and the Senate different. The House and the Senate are not just ones bigger and one is smaller. The House and Senate operate differently. The Senate has been the place for two-and-a-half centuries where the debate occurs AND the rights of individual Senators to be able to debate the issues, defend their state, and talk about the rights of Americans…… Listen, this is not some trivial exercise. This is 250 years of history my Democratic colleagues are planning to flush down the toilet because they don't get their way, on a bill we rightfully have very strong philosophical differences on. Hey, I don't agree on giving rapists and sex offenders or convicted felons voting rights when they get out of prison. I'm not alone in that. I don't agree in federal tax dollars being used to be able to pay for political campaigns. I'm not alone in that. That's not that crazy. I don't agree that my state should have to go play ‘Mother, may I?’ with some future attorney general because they to add another day of voting. I'm not alone in that. But to say, ‘If you don't do this now, I’ll destroy the Senate,’ is a toxic shift for our republic…… This is not a flippant issue. As I’ve spoken to some of my Democratic colleagues, they seem to believe, ‘We'll just take this vote and no one is going to care.’ In fact, some of my Democratic colleagues are saying, ‘We know we're going to lose. Senator Manchin and Senator Sinema have already made public comments. They're not going to go with this. We're going to take this, make a statement. Our progressive base wants us to do this. It's not going to pass anyway. So we'll just do it.’…… I've spoken to so many of my colleagues and said, ‘Don't do this.’ And they've quietly responded back to me, ‘I don't want to do this.’…… We are the only body that has a protection for the minority voice. I think the only legislative body in the world that's designed like this. It's been part of the secret sauce of America, that the minority in America, however large or small it is, has a voice. My Democratic colleagues are now saying, ‘We no longer want the minority to have a voice in America. If you're in the minority opinion, you don't count. Sit down, shut up, we're in the majority.’ That has never been the American way, not in 250 years…###"
