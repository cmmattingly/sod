https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2022/9/kennedy-to-lower-crime-stop-defunding-and-disrespecting-the-police,"WASHINGTON – Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) today addressed rising crime rates Americans are experiencing in the wake of Pres. Biden’s soft-on-crime policies.Kennedy outlined the four steps needed to reduce crime in Louisiana and American communities:Key excerpts from Kennedy’s statement include:“Long term, we can debate the solutions to crime, but short term, in my judgment, we have to do three things. Number one: We've got to hire more cops.”… “Number two: We're going to have to stop the retirements among our police officers. They're retiring in droves.”… “The third thing we need to do to get control of crime [won't] cost any money, but it may be the most difficult of all three of the things we have to do. We have to improve the morale of our cops, and that starts with our elected officials.”…“But I think that if you talk to most moms and dad in this country, and ask them what are they worried about when they lie down to sleep at night and can’t, I don’t think they’re worried about proper pronoun usage. I don’t think they’re worried about the president’s war against oil production in America. I think they’re more worried about their job and the economy and inflation, and I think they’re worried about crime.”…“And you’re not going to get control of crime until you keep the cops you have, you add more cops and you stand behind your cops when they’re right, which is 99.9 percent of the time. And folks, that doesn’t cost money.“…We have sent a breathtaking amount of money to state and local government. I mean, they’ve got more money now than they’ve ever had in their entire histories, adjusted for inflation. They’ve got the money to do this.”View Kennedy’s complete remarks here."

John Kennedy (R-La.) and Raphael Warnock’s (D-Ga.) legislation, the Patient Advocate Tracker Act, to increase transparency and accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for veterans who report concerns they experience with VA health care services.Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Mich.) introduced the bill in the House of Representatives.“The Patient Advocate Tracker Act will help America’s veterans overcome bureaucracy to get the efficient, effective health care they deserve. I am thankful for Rep. McClain’s leadership in the House and look forward to seeing the president sign this into law,” said Kennedy.The VA uses the patient advocate tracking system (PATS) to track and report complaints from veterans. The Patient Advocate Tracker Act would allow veterans to access PATS in order to file complaints and view the status of those health care concerns, including interim and final actions that the VA has taken to resolve issues facing individual veterans. By granting veterans access to PATS, VA employees could more effectively route veterans’ concerns to the appropriate department within the VA, avoiding unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles.  Text of the Patient Advocate Tracker Act is available here."

China needs to grasp that just one deception will get its companies booted off U.S. exchanges. “The SEC should make no exceptions. It must allow no loopholes. We have to hold China to the same standards as every other company and every other country that lists on American exchanges. “This agreement only highlights the need for Congress to strengthen the integrity of our markets by passing the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act without delay. It’s not time to give China any benefit of the doubt—not when Americans’ savings are at stake. It’s time to make even more certain that Beijing gives U.S. officials the information they need to keep U.S. investors safe from the schemes we’ve seen from China too many times before. The Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act would allow the SEC to kick lying companies off our exchanges even faster.“Here’s our message to China: We’ve got the regulatory hammer, and we will use it without flinching,” said Kennedy. The SOP includes the following agreements, which Chinese authorities have committed to:Background:"

John Kennedy (R-La.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), along with Senate and House Judiciary Committee Chairs Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) released a revised version of the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act (JCPA) to support small, local, independent and conservative news publications by giving them a level playing field in negotiations with Big Tech platforms that often prevent them from making a profit from their work online. The JCPA removes legal obstacles in order to permit small and mid-sized news organizations to negotiate jointly for compensation from digital platforms, including Facebook and Google, that access their content without allowing them to profit from their journalism. The legislation also allows news publishers to demand arbitration if they reach an impasse in negotiations with digital platforms. This bill would cover Louisiana’s major newspapers.“Local papers—especially the independent papers in Louisiana—are the heart and soul of journalism, and they break the news that millions of Americans rely on every day. However, tech giants like Facebook and Google are hammering local publications by keeping them from making a profit on Big Tech platforms—and it’s killing local journalism. This bill supports the little guy by allowing local news providers to better negotiate with tech companies for the earnings they deserve,” said Kennedy.“As the daughter of a newspaperman, I understand firsthand the vital role that a free press plays in strengthening our democracy. But local news is facing an existential crisis in our country, with ad revenues plummeting, newspapers closing, and many rural communities becoming ‘news deserts’ without access to local reporting. To preserve strong, independent journalism, we have to make sure news organizations are able to negotiate on a level playing field with the online platforms that have come to dominate news distribution and digital advertising. Our bipartisan legislation ensures media outlets will be able to engage in good faith negotiations to receive fair compensation from the Big Tech companies that profit from their news content, allowing journalists to continue their critical work of keeping communities informed,” said Klobuchar. The JCPA would:Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Cynthia Lummus (R-Wyo.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), and John Thune (R-S.D.) have joined a bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers as cosponsors of the JCPA.Full text of the JCPA can be found here.   "

https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2022/8/washington-must-focus-on-pacific-islands-to-curb-china-s-ambitions,"This op-ed by Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) first appeared in Defense News on August 19, 2022.If anyone doubts Beijing’s commitment to aggressive Pacific expansionism, its response to Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s recent visit to Taiwan should remove any lingering uncertainty.The Communist government amped up its rhetoric mightily and threatened to hold America “responsible”—perhaps, some believe, with military action. The question for U.S. officials goes beyond the speaker’s travel. How we conduct diplomacy in the Pacific has been a long-term challenge, and we’re out of time to mull strategic solutions without implementing them.One of the clearest and easiest steps that Congress can take is to establish a special envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF). Similar to the European Union, the PIF is an international organization and includes Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Island nations.The United States invests a lot of diplomatic elbow grease into Indo-Pacific players like Japan and Korea, but we’ve overlooked smaller, yet strategically important countries like Fiji and Kiribati. Meanwhile, China has been deepening its roots across the South Pacific. It’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, made an eight-day tour of the region this May after formalizing a security deal with the Solomon Islands.China continues to wrap its economic, diplomatic, and military tentacles around smaller nations, and implications stretch far beyond Taipei. During World War II, Kiribati’s airport allowed American planes to refuel in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Now, reports indicate that Kiribati will make a deal with China to upgrade its runway. No doubt Beijing recognizes the military significance of that airstrip. Apparently, the U.S. didn’t. Kiribati’s ambassador to the U.S. said the country asked Washington for help but was rebuffed.The Solomon Islands and Kiribati may not be eager to yoke themselves to the Chinese Communist regime, but America isn’t positioning itself to give these countries better options. The U.S. doesn’t have a special envoy to the PIF, but China does. On this front, though, we can pivot on a dime to raise America’s diplomatic presence significantly.Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and I are now giving Congress a bipartisan solution that the White House has already indicated it supports. Since there are no ambassadors to the PIF, the U.S. and Pacific Islands Forum Partnership Act would establish a special envoy there. The Senate-confirmed role would elevate diplomacy in the region since it would offer the same access to the Oval Office as an ambassadorship. The position would also have the same accountability to Congress.The U.S. can’t afford to be ignorant of the economic investments and military overtures China is making to our neighbors in the Pacific. Kiribati turned from diplomacy with Taiwan to China in 2019 and cut ties with the PIF this summer. Other Pacific Island nations could follow suit.Developments like this make it easier for China to divide and conquer—especially when small yet strategic states sense apathy or inertia in Washington. A special envoy would help answer the Communist threats across the board by deepening trust and increasing dialogue on the PIF’s economic, cyber security, and military concerns.With members of both parties in Congress and the White House on board with establishing a permanent envoy to our friends in the South Pacific, we could and should cement this win quickly at a time when China’s growing belligerence doesn’t give America a moment to lose."

https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2022/8/kennedy-statement-on-tax-and-spending-bill,"WASHINGTON – Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) today released the following statement upon voting against the Senate’s tax and spending bill, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022: “Senator Manchin and Senator Schumer’s massive tax-and-spending bill has unfortunately, in my judgment, now passed.“Because of inflation, Louisianians are really getting good at barely getting by—and that’s true for most Americans, too. As a result of Senator Manchin’s bill—and I hope I am wrong on this—I predict that Joeflation, as some people call it, will now refer to Joe Manchin, not President Biden.“For example, Senator Manchin’s bill raises taxes on oil and gas. Now, when you tax something, you get less of it which causes prices to rise.“Senator Manchin’s message seems to be: “Since you can’t afford gas, because of my bill, go buy a seventy-five-thousand-dollar electric vehicle. That’s not going to work in Louisiana. That’s not going to work across America. “Number two. According to the non-partisan Joint Tax Committee, which doesn’t take sides—it’s not Republican or Democrat—the burden of Senator Manchin’s bill will fall on everyone, everyone and their taxes. Not just people making more than four-hundred thousand dollars a year; everyone.“So, most Americans—if not all Americans—are going to have even less money to spend as prices continue to rise.“Point three. Senator Manchin’s bill raises taxes on businesses, especially manufacturers. Most people understand this: Corporations don’t pay taxes, people do. And, those taxes, when they’re increased, are passed on in higher prices, lower wages, lower stock prices and lower 401k balances.“It’s a special kind of stupid, in my judgement, to raise taxes during both a recession and inflation—that’s called stagflation, which is what we have right now as a result of President Biden’s policies. “Look, I’m not saying that Senator Manchin intentionally wants to hurt people. I’m not saying that he intentionally wants to have even more people living in a tent behind Whataburger, but that’s going to be the result of this bill. I hope I’m wrong, but I think I’m right. This bill is tier 1 moronic.”Watch Kennedy’s statement here.   "

The RAMP act ensures that buying American-made products is our first choice, not our last,” said Kennedy. The RAMP Act requires that at least 60 percent of the value of the components of products that the federal government purchases be made in the U.S. The current requirement is that only 55 percent of the components’ value come from American-made resources.Under the bill, the requirement will increase to 65 percent by 2024 and 75 percent by 2029. Additionally, the bill establishes price preferences for domestic goods that the federal government designates as critical to U.S. supply chains.Text of the legislation is available here."

This bill would shine a light on where Beijing is peddling its influence on the U.S. campuses that shape the minds and hearts of America’s next generation,” said Kennedy.Under Kennedy’s bill, any educational institution that receives more than $5,000 from a Chinese-affiliated entity in any given year would have to disclose the full name of the donor to the Department of Education. The school would also have to provide instructions on how the Department of Education can gather more information about the donation.Chinese-affiliated entities would include individuals; universities; think tanks; cultural, educational or language programs; Chinese state-owned entities; or companies, think tanks or nonprofits that have members of the Chinese Communist Party sitting on their boards of directors.The bill would also require any institution that interacts with a Chinese organization to disclose all joint activities, including exchanges or research.In addition, institutions would have to publish all contracts and agreements with Chinese entities on their websites so that the public can access that information.Rep. August Pfluger (R-Texas) introduced the companion legislation in the House of Representatives.“The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is infiltrating American universities and using creative avenues to steal intellectual property and U.S. research. This legislation increases transparency by requiring universities who receive funding from CCP-affiliated individuals or organizations to disclose these donations to the U.S. Department of Education and publish them on a publicly-available website.

John Kennedy (R-La.) successfully negotiated into the bill. “The measures we successfully worked to include in WRDA would help finish crucial projects in our state sooner and help restore important habitats in south Louisiana. I hope Congress sends this bill to the president’s desk soon so that the Corps can get to work on more key Louisiana projects,” said Kennedy. Kennedy fought to include in WRDA several measures that would expedite Army Corps of Engineers projects in Louisiana and a provision that would substantially reduce Louisiana’s cost share to perform ecosystem restoration in areas degraded by the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO) navigation channel.The MRGO navigation channel was closed after Hurricane Katrina, but the habitats the channel damaged have not yet been restored. Louisiana normally covers 35 percent of the cost of Corps of Engineers projects while the federal government covers 65 percent.

Carjackings, homicides, attacks on law enforcement are all up. We have a duty to ensure that penalties for federal offenses serve as a deterrent and that any ambiguity from split court decisions is rectified so that perpetrators can be held accountable. This bill includes a number of small fixes that will go a long way in improving justice and preventing future crimes. Unfortunately, we don’t yet have bipartisan support to advance these modest, but meaningful, reforms. American communities are suffering under a scourge of lawlessness, so I hope we get some cooperation soon and I’ll keep reaching across the aisle to get it,” said Grassley.Notable reforms in the bill include:Text of the legislation is available here. Watch Kennedy’s remarks here."

John Kennedy (R-La.) today introduced the U.S. and Pacific Islands Forum Partnership Act to combat Communist China’s aggression in the Pacific. The legislation would establish a special envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF). Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) is an original cosponsor of this legislation.“How America conducts diplomacy in the Pacific has been a long-term challenge, and we’re out of time to talk about strategic solutions without implementing them. China is putting more economic and diplomatic pressure on the Pacific Island states each day, and one of the clearest and easiest steps that Congress can take to counter this communist antagonism is to establish a special envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum,” said Kennedy.The PIF is an international organization of Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Island nations.Beijing recognizes that these nations are strategically located in the Pacific Ocean and has already established a special envoy to the PIF. The U.S., however, has not taken this or an equivalent diplomatic step to strengthen dialogue and cooperation with these important Pacific Island countries.The special envoy role would require Senate confirmation. It would elevate diplomacy in the region and have accountability to Congress. A special envoy would help answer a diversity of threats from the communist regime by deepening trust and increasing dialogue on the Pacific Islands’ economic, cyber security and military concerns.Text of the legislation is available here. "

John Kennedy (R-La.) today explained on the Senate floor how President Joe Biden’s energy policy has made electricity bills unaffordable for many in Louisiana. Kennedy also outlined how Louisianians can find help to lower their electricity bills.Below are key excerpts from his remarks:“Folks in my home state of Louisiana . . . are facing some of the largest energy bills—electricity bills—in the history of ever.”. . .""Here’s a news flash . . . heat is not the main reason that these electricity bills are soaring—it’s not. The main reason that electricity bills are soaring is because of President Biden’s profoundly foolish energy policies, which have depleted America’s natural gas inventories. Because of this, natural gas prices have increased 75 percent from 2020.”. . .“The current energy crisis—and that’s what this is—is a sucking chest wound for Louisianians and for Americans, but, yet, President Biden refuses to budge from his war on affordable energy that got us here.”. . .“He killed the Keystone Pipeline, he’s canceled our country’s mineral leases, he’s stalled our country’s pipelines, and he’s told his banking regulators to dry up capital and loans for energy production. “He’s put the full force and weight of the United States government behind this effort to destroy oil and gas. And, in doing so, he has intentionally forfeited America’s energy independence—and that’s why electricity bills are so high.” . . .“Now, what’s the answer? How do we fix this? Well, the answer—duh—is to have the American people produce their own oil and gas. And we can do it. We’ve done it before.

https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2022/7/senate-committee-passes-kennedy-supported-bill-to-bring-millions-more-in-oil-revenue-to-louisiana,"WASHINGTON – Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) today applauded the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources’ move to eliminate the state revenue sharing cap that the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) establishes. Kennedy has worked closely with committee members and his Senate colleagues to lift the revenue cap that penalizes Gulf states unfairly and has remained especially focused, in recent days, on moving this bill to the Senate floor.The Reinvesting in Shoreline Economies and Ecosystems (RISEE) Act, which Kennedy cosponsored, would reform GOMESA to allow Louisiana and other states to share more resources from offshore oil and gas leases. Kennedy also introduced the Offshore Cap Parity Act to eliminate the GOMESA cap.“The current GOMESA cap unfairly targets oil producing states and denies them revenue that they have earned. Without this money to build infrastructure and storm barriers, Louisianians remain even more vulnerable to natural disasters. Eliminating the GOMESA cap is key to protecting people’s lives and livelihoods, and I’m glad we’ve made a way to move this bill forward. There’s still more to be done, but this is a step in the right direction,” said Kennedy.Background:GOMESA divides federal revenues from the offshore energy production of Gulf states into three portions. The federal government returns 37.5 percent of this revenue to Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alabama. The Land and Water Conservation Fund receives 12.5 percent of offshore revenue and directs most of that money to landlocked states. The final 50 percent of Gulf oil and gas revenue goes to the U.S. Treasury.The GOMESA cap limits the dollar value of Gulf states’ 37.5 percent revenue share to $375 million, meaning the states receive no benefit when the energy sector peaks and revenues surpass the cap. Conversely, the Mineral Leasing Act ensures that states with onshore drilling operations receive 50 percent of their revenues, while there is no cap on how much money that share includes.States with onshore energy production typically aren’t required to spend that money on environmental priorities. Louisiana, however, constitutionally dedicates that revenue from offshore energy production fund its coastal conservation and restoration projects. "

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in introducing the No Emergency Crude Oil to Foreign Adversaries Act. The legislation would prevent future strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) sales from going to China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.“America’s strategic petroleum reserve protects our country during national emergencies. Selling off American oil to countries that hate us undermines the security that the oil reserve is supposed to deliver, and we can’t let it happen again,” said Kennedy.“At a time of skyrocketing inflation and record gas prices, and with SPR drained to its lowest level since 1986, it is reckless and inexplicable that President Biden would allow oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be exported to China. This practice poses a direct threat to American national security, not least of all because the Chinese Communist Party is currently stockpiling oil for strategic use, and the Biden administration is aiding their effort,” said Cruz.The bill comes after Pres. Biden siphoned off more than 260 million barrels of oil from America’s SPR in recent months. Reports indicate that roughly 5 million barrels from these SPR sales were sent abroad, with China’s Communist-owned, state-run oil and gas company refining more than 1 million of those barrels. The No Emergency Crude Oil to Foreign Adversaries Act would:The text of the bill is available here."

Biden’s assault on American fossil fuels is driving up prices in nearly every sector of industry. Below are key excerpts from his remarks:“Deeply, profoundly stupid. That is the only way I know how to describe one of the worst decisions behind an administration that has become famous for bad decisions. I am talking about Pres. Biden’s assault on sustainable, affordable energy.”. . .“What seems to be underappreciated, Mr. President, however, is how Pres. Biden’s agenda is driving up the price, not just of oil, but of all kinds of necessities that American and Louisiana families need every day. It’s not just about oil and gas—it’s about everything. Not only do most goods get to our homes after riding in trucks, and planes, and cars and ships powered by gas or diesel, but a lot of our plastics and other products—if you think about it—they’re also made from petroleum.” . . . “The truth is, that American ingenuity—and I’m referring to fossil fuels—has made the most out of one of the most versatile resources that the world has ever known. But, the Biden White House is determined to punish us for that innovation—just determined to punish us—by making every single part of the American Dream more expensive.”. . . “Now, high oil prices are also waterboarding our farmers which contributes to these high food prices. Did you know that we make industrial fertilizer with fossil fuels? And when natural gas costs more, so does fertilizing a field of wheat or corn or soybeans. Some of our herbicides right now are twice as expensive as they were—if farmers can find them.“Tractors drink diesel, duh. So do some irrigation systems. A gallon of diesel—one gallon—a year ago: Do you know what it was? $3.23. Do you know what it is today? $5.20.“Now, what does that mean for Louisiana rice farmers and other growers? For every extra dime farmers spend on a gallon of diesel—every extra dime—a grower will spend about $4.50 more for an acre of rice, $2.30 more for an acre of cotton, and an extra $1.74 for an acre of corn. Corn growers—I mentioned corn growers—they also depend on nitrogen fertilizer, which we make with methane.“And then corn—I mentioned corn—goes into cereal, goes into sweetened drinks, peanut butter, baby food, ketchup and salad dressing. You know, I don’t mean to be ugly, but this administration’s energy policy is deeply, profoundly stupid.” . . . “For the sake of Americans’ economic futures and for the sake of our national security, Mr. President, we cannot continue to rely on foreign oil imports—we can’t—while pretending to run this country using wind, solar and wishful thinking. Because that’s what the president’s new policy is on energy. It’s wind. It’s solar. It’s wishful thinking.

https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2022/6/how-making-insulin-affordable-can-help-nela-families,"This op-ed by Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) first appeared in The Ouachita Citizen on June 29, 2022.Diabetes is a tough diagnosis, and I wish no one had to live with it. While the world waits for a cure for diabetes, insulin often provides a crucial treatment option that staves off the illness’s worst effects. Insulin also ultimately cuts health care costs for Louisianians. The key is to make sure that Louisianians can afford it.Twelve percent of Louisiana adults already live with diabetes, and an estimated 30,000 Louisianians receive this diagnosis every year. Unfortunately, patients with diabetes face annual health care costs that are twice as high as non- diabetics face, in part because insulin can be expensive.I’m determined to expand our state’s access to insulin. One of my bills, the Seniors Saving on Insulin Act, would make a Trump administration cost- cutting program permanent. The bill would cap the price that Medicare patients pay for a month’s supply of insulin at $35. That means Louisianians with diabetes won’t have to choose between eating and taking a lifesaving medicine.By making insulin more affordable, we can help people take better care of their health today and reduce their risk of complications tomorrow. Too many patients don’t regularly use their prescription insulin because of its price tag even though taking the medicine now lowers medical costs in the long run.In fact, missing doses can create snowballing costs to the tune of more than $100 billion to America’s health care system every year. American taxpayers bear a large part of that burden, which is why we should expand improvements beyond Medicare.Insulin costs put many northeast Louisiana families in a financial bind. Most diabetes sufferers require at least two to three vials of insulin a month, but some versions of insulin can cost between $175-$300 a vial. Insulin prices have been rising for decades. For example, a month’s supply of one brand of insulin cost $21 in 1996, but that price skyrocketed to $275 in 2019. I wrote the Ending Pricey Insulin Act to cap insulin costs at $50 a month for all Louisianians and Americans, including the uninsured.The median household income in Ouachita Parish is $44,059, and a family of four faces annual health care costs of $10,128. Families in Concordia Parish spend more than 30 percent of their income to cover health care costs. With inflation surging to a 40-year high, the Ending Pricey Insulin Act would improve health care for many Louisiana communities.The bill would also help Louisiana’s economy. When diabetes goes untreated, the cost of caring for sufferers takes an even heavier financial toll on our state: Diabetes and prediabetes cost Louisianians roughly $5.7 billion every year in direct medical expenses, taxpayer dollars, and lost productivity.Louisianians don’t just rely on insulin. Many adults and children also depend on epinephrine to treat allergic reactions that could turn deadly. That’s why I’m also working to make sure that Federally Qualified Health Centers—which serve poor, uninsured, and rural Americans—help Louisianians get the medicine they need at prices they can bear. These centers can acquire prescription drugs at a discount, sometimes for as little as a penny.So, I authored the Vital Medication Affordability Act to cement a Trump administration executive order that would ensure these centers pass along their discounts on insulin and epinephrine to Louisianians. This is not just fair for the patients who need these medicines to manage their conditions; it’s an important move that will reduce costs for Louisianian taxpayers.Historic inflation has made gas, food, and other necessities harder for Louisiana families to afford. Congress must help make insulin cheaper and more accessible—both for diabetics and for the taxpayers who take on additional health care costs when the disease goes untreated. My legislation is the right place to start if we want to make our communities healthier across the board."

I regret that, but I believe that’s a fact. And most of my people in Louisiana understand at this juncture that the only place they’re going to find lower food prices, cheaper gas, a cleaner, safer environment and affordable insurance is in the voting booth. Because my people, most of them, and I think most Americans, have concluded that Republicans aren't perfect but the other side is crazy.“Now, about 500,000 people in my state have flood insurance.

John Kennedy (R-La.) joined Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) and more than 80 members of Congress in releasing a joint bicameral statement in support of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995.  The lawmakers call on the Biden administration not to move the Palestinian Affairs Unit (PAU) out of the U.S. Ambassador to Israel’s reporting chain of command and not to rename the PAU the “U.S. Office of Palestinian Affairs” or allow it to serve as an unofficial U.S. consulate to the Palestinians in Jerusalem.The full statement is below:“It is alarming that the Biden Administration has opened what amounts to be a separate U.S. diplomatic office to the Palestinians in Israel’s capital. This decision is wholly inconsistent with the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 that Congress passed into law and has repeatedly reaffirmed with overwhelming bipartisan support over the years. We strongly supported the Trump Administration’s decision to fully and faithfully implement the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 by formally recognizing Jerusalem as the eternal and undivided capital of Israel, by moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and by closing the U.S. Consulate General for the Palestinians in Jerusalem and merging its functions into the U.S. Embassy’s ‘Palestinian Affairs Unit’ within one diplomatic mission under the authority the U.S. Ambassador to Israel. The Biden Administration’s disregard for that law, however, undermines our nation’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and signals support for dividing Jerusalem.“Let there be no misunderstanding: this unprecedented arrangement—to turn the Palestinian Affairs Unit into a ‘U.S. Office of Palestinian Affairs’ that will no longer report to the U.S. Ambassador to Israel but instead report directly to the State Department in Washington, D.C., and to appoint a Special Envoy to the Palestinians—is an effort to open an unofficial and de facto U.S. consulate to the Palestinians in Jerusalem. In fact, the Biden Administration admits this decision is one step closer to opening an official U.S. consulate, a plan it refuses to stop pushing despite the Government of Israel’s adamant opposition and Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Brian McKeon’s admission to Congress in October 2021 that the United States, under international law, would ‘need to get the consent of the host government to open any diplomatic facility.’“The Biden Administration’s decision is wrong and not how America should treat Israel, one of our closest allies in the world. As sponsors of the Upholding the 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Law Act of 2021 to withhold funding for a U.S. consulate to the Palestinians in Israel’s capital, we unequivocally oppose the Biden Administration’s decision and will use every tool at our disposal to stop it in the 117th Congress and afterwards.”"

Can we agree on that?”Powell: “Yes, generally.”Kennedy: “And to put a little finer point on it, our inflation at this time—and this is the case with respect to most cases of inflation—demand is greater than supply, so prices go up?”Powell: “In some parts of the economy, yes.”. . .Kennedy: “What about if we reduce the regulatory burden, let’s say on refineries? Wouldn't that incent refineries to start refining more and help on the supply side?” Powell: “I would say anything that could increase capacity on that front could have a positive impact.”. . .Kennedy: “Yeah, but would that help? I’m not trying to get you to endorse legislation. Mr. Chairman, we’ve got a hell of a mess here, okay? Inflation is hitting my people so hard they’re coughing up bones. . . . It’s the highest in 40 years, our national debt is greater than our national output, crime is up, the border is open, respect for institutions is way down and 70 percent of the American people think we’re headed in the wrong direction."" . . .“President Biden—I don’t blame him, I understand politics—he keeps saying, ‘Well, your 401K has crashed, and gas has gone from two bucks to five bucks a gallon because the economy is so good.’ And the American people know that’s not true. Now, other than relieving regulatory burden . . . what if the United States Congress said, ‘Look, we've got a budget. We’re going to freeze spending. We’re going to stop injecting more money into the economy. We’re going to freeze spending until Powell can get control on the demand side.’ Would that help?”Powell: “You know, I feel like I’m giving you advice on what to do when we’re not getting our own job done. I feel like maybe a better thing to do would be for us to get our own house in order and do the job you've assigned us.”Video of the full exchange is here."
https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2022/6/kennedy-s-unclaimed-savings-bond-act-passes-senate-finance-committee,"WASHINGTON – An amendment modeled on Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.)’s Unclaimed Savings Bond Act today passed the Senate Finance Committee. The amendment would help Americans claim more than $29 billion in unredeemed savings bonds, including $337 million that belong to the people of Louisiana. “The heart of the Unclaimed Savings Bond Act is finally heading to the Senate floor so that we can make sure states have what they need to get billions of dollars to the rightful owners. The Treasury has sat on money that should be in Americans’ pockets for too long—including more than $300 million that belong to Louisianians. Louisianians pay their taxes faithfully, and Washington needs to pay out these savings bonds,” said Kennedy.Background:The Treasury Department is currently holding more than $29 billion in matured, unredeemed U.S. savings bonds, most of which the Treasury deems lost, stolen, destroyed or “unclaimed.” Many of these bonds were issued more than 70 years ago and have matured—meaning they no longer earn interest for bondholders. In cases in which bonds are not physically possessed by their rightful holders, only the Treasury has the names and addresses of the original bond owners. The Treasury also has the serial numbers needed to claim the bond proceeds.  The Treasury has not taken any significant actions to proactively reunite bonds with their rightful owners despite its relaunch of Treasury Hunt, an online search tool that allows bond owners to locate bond information, at Kennedy’s request. Individual states, however, conduct programs that reconnect their citizens with unclaimed property. Kennedy’s legislation would require the Treasury to provide states information about matured and unclaimed bonds so these states can use unclaimed property programs to help find the original owners (or heirs of those original owners) of these bonds. Text of the Unclaimed Savings Bond Act is available here."

The group of senators penned a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin urging that the United States Security Coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority in Jerusalem remain an officer of three-star rank and not be downgraded.“Given continued regional volatility, steadfast high-level U.S. leadership and engagement to support peace and stability in Israel and the West Bank remain in the national security interest of the United States,” Kennedy and his colleagues wrote.The letter comes after it was reported earlier this month that the Pentagon is considering downgrading the position to colonel, which Kennedy and his colleagues warn may undermine U.S. leadership, credibility and communication in a historically volatile region.The full letter with its specific requests is available here."
https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2022/6/icymi-kennedy-louisianians-deserve-better-than-biden-s-gas-hikes,"WASHINGTON – Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) penned this op-ed for The Farmerville Gazette. Below is the full text of the article, which explains how Pres. Biden’s energy policy is financially burdensome for Louisianians:Most Louisianians get up every day, go to work, obey the law, pay their taxes, and try to save a little money for retirement while living in the greatest country in all of human history. But Louisianians are struggling under the Biden administration’s war on American energy.President Biden took office on January 20 of last year, which means that America is now 17 months into “Build Back Better.” From where Louisianians sit, though, nothing has been built, nothing is back, and nothing is better. Inflation and gas prices are still soaring, and wages haven’t caught up. At the start of the president’s term, Louisianians paid about $2 for a gallon of gas. Today, the price is roughly $4.45. That means moms are forking out close to $90 to fill up their minivans. It’s not just gasoline that’s breaking household budgets. A dozen eggs now costs more than $2.50. Ground beef is way above $5 per pound, and chicken is over $4 per pound. The list goes on, and it’s connected to energy prices. Much of our food, clothing, pharmaceuticals, and other basic goods arrive in our stores by air, truck, or tanker — all of which run on fossil fuel. As a result, Biden’s constant attacks on the oil and gas industry aren’t just forcing oil prices higher — they’re stoking inflation across Louisiana’s economy.President Biden has canceled leases on federal lands in the Gulf of Mexico when Louisianians could be drilling there and helping recover America’s energy independence. President Biden has also created new strict regulations on oil and gas producers that could make it nearly impossible to open new pipelines in America.What’s even more curious to me is that, despite the Biden administration’s claims that it is kneecapping America’s oil production for so-called environmental reasons, the White House insists that the U.S. must purchase foreign oil from countries that bring that fuel to our shores in tankers. Those tankers use 2,000 gallons of fuel and emit eight tons of carbon dioxide into the environment every hour. This White House is beyond tone deaf.Now, President Biden has said he has no control over the price of oil or gasoline. But it’s clear that you can’t have regulatory control over the drilling, transport, storage, refining, trading and taxation of oil — as the president does — and claim to have no control over the price of gas. That’s just not true, and people of Louisiana know it.Here’s what most people in our state see: The Biden administration has crashed their 401k’s and increased their bills by $5,200 a year. Louisianians understand that that is a rotten deal built on bad liberal policies.President Biden’s energy agenda depends on “wind, solar and wishful thinking” and is causing much of these prices to skyrocket. Whether they’re at the grocery store or gas pump, the people of Louisiana are struggling under a president whose policies ignore Middle America. Louisianians deserve better. Americans deserve better. So, I’ll keep fighting for better.The op-ed is available here."
https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2022/6/kennedy-asks-fema-to-extend-deadline-for-hurricane-katrina-recovery,"WASHINGTON – Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Rep. Troy Carter (D-La.) have asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to extend the August 2023 deadline for the city of New Orleans to use the $2 billion of FEMA public assistance it received in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The money focuses on repairing roads and pipes damaged by the historic storm.“Hurricane Katrina devastated our state, and Hurricanes Laura, Delta, Zeta and Ida have only slowed recovery and dealt their own blows. South Louisiana’s communities and economy need this $2 billion in FEMA aid to keep rebuilding what Katrina damaged, and I hope the agency gives the state an extension quickly,” said Kennedy.The lawmakers cited the need for an extension.“When Hurricane Katrina ripped through the Gulf Coast in August 2005 with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph, it killed 1,833 people. It took some 43 days after Katrina made landfall for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to pump the last of the floodwaters out of the city. Even a month later, up to 600,000 households were still displaced, and by the fall of 2006, less than half of the residents had returned,” they wrote.“In the more recent years, New Orleans’ rebuilding has been challenged by the COVID pandemic and the unprecedented 2020 hurricane season that included Hurricanes Ida, Zeta, Barry, and Laura. . . . New Orleans’ need for an extension has been expected by FEMA for some time,” the lawmakers explained. The letter is available here."

https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2022/6/kennedy-fsgg-republicans-challenge-sec-s-unconstitutional-move-to-collect-investor-data,"WASHINGTON—Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a member of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government (FSGG), which has jurisdiction over the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), today raised concerns with Chairman Gary Gensler about privacy and national security threats that the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) poses.“The most obvious and necessary step the SEC can take to is to eliminate the collection of all PII under the CAT. Collecting and storing PII serves no regulatory purpose, it’s unconstitutional, and the SEC’s ability to monitor potential risks in the equity market will not be diminished without PII,”explained the senators. The CAT is set to begin collecting the personal and financial information (PII) of every investor that trades on U.S. stock exchanges this July. It will be one of the largest databases of PII ever created.“Collecting the sensitive personal and financial information of individuals without any suspicion of wrongdoing is a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. Forcing broker-dealers to provide this information under threat of significant penalties compounds this unlawful government surveillance,” they continued. In October 2019, the Senate Banking Committee also learned that about 3,000 individuals will have full access to the PII collected by the CAT. The lawmakers note that this raises the possibility that employees of the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or contractors working with the CAT could steal or misappropriate investor PII.Background:In April 2021, Kennedy introduced the Protecting Investors’ Personally Identifiable Information Act to prohibit the SEC from requiring that PII be collected under CAT reporting requirements.FSGG ranking member Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) and Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and John Boozman (R-Ark.) also signed the letter.The full letter is available here."

John Thune (R-S.D.) and more than 20 other senators in introducing the Political Bias In Algorithm Sorting (BIAS) Emails Act. The legislation would prohibit email services like Google from using algorithms that are biased against conservatives while increasing transparency for political campaigns using these Big Tech platforms.“The data show that Google has disregarded their consumers’ interests and targeted private communications to satisfy their own political preferences. This bias hurts Google’s users and erodes free speech on the platform. Our bill would require Big Tech platforms to submit transparency reports to make sure email service providers aren’t forcing their political bias onto unsuspecting users,” said Kennedy. The bill comes after a report from North Carolina State University found that nearly 70 percent of emails from Republican candidates were sent to spam email folders by Google from 2019 to 2020. Google sent fewer than one in 10 emails from Democrat candidates to spam folders during the same time. During that period, Outlook and Yahoo labeled Democrat emails as spam at a marginally higher rate than it did Republican emails.The BIAS Emails Act would:The bill text is available here."
https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2022/6/kennedy-raises-concerns-about-flood-insurance-and-fema-s-cost-hikes,"WASHINGTON – Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) today questioned witnesses in the Senate Banking Hearing about FEMA’s Risk Rating 2.0 plan and why FEMA refuses to let Congress or other stakeholders see the algorithm that FEMA has implemented for flood insurance policyholders.Risk Rating 2.0 enacted the biggest change in history to the way the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) calculates flood insurance premiums. Risk Rating 2.0 significantly raises flood insurance premiums on Louisianians who depend on NFIP to protect their homes from natural disasters.Key comments from Kennedy’s questioning include:Kennedy: “Dr. Van Doren, Mr. Theodorou, have either of your think tanks hired outside expertise to review the algorithm used by FEMA to set these new rates? Have either of you done that? . . . Why not?  . . . How do you know they’re accurate? You don’t know they’re accurate because FEMA won’t show them to you. If I refer to Milliman, I'm talking about a company—last year, had about $1.2 billion revenues, 4000 employees. They’re risk management experts. They represent large institutions, mostly insurance companies. Milliman designed this algorithm, did it not?”Theodorou: “It's my understanding of that Milliman did. I have reviewed . . .”Kennedy: “ . . . Who owns the algorithm? Does Milliman own it? Or does FEMA own it? You're both experts? Do you know?”Theodorou: “I would say it's, it's the NFIP.”Kennedy: “Do you know that for a fact?”Theodorou: “I do not know that for a fact.”Kennedy: “And you don’t know that for a fact because FEMA won't share this algorithm with anybody. They tell you, ‘If we show it to you, we’ve got to kill you.’ They won't even show it to Congress. But, yet, we're supposed to place blind trust in the federal government. What could possibly go wrong?. . .Kennedy: “ . . . they won't show anybody their algorithm. And, if you trust government, Mr. Theodorou, particularly on this program, you failed history class. Now, this is not right. I want to see this program fixed.” . . .Kennedy: “Why does FEMA, Mr. Quinn, repeatedly keep hiring these lawyers and engineers who act like thieves? How much did U.S. Forensic make last year off of FEMA?”Quinn: “I don't know, but I know they do very, very well, as does the Nielsen law firm. And they, they get paid quite well for perpetrating or supporting fraud, Sir.”Kennedy: “And they get paid for not paying claims, not for paying them, right?”Quinn: “That is correct.”Kennedy: “Why does FEMA keep doing this?”Quinn: “We have asked that question over and over. FEMA has told us that they do not have the ability to remove these fraudsters from the program. . . . I can't imagine the amount of wreckage that these organizations are doing in communities. I have personally lived through it. I've seen it in the bayous of Louisiana. I've seen it all over America.”Dr. Peter Van Doren is a Senior Fellow at The Cato Institute.Jerry Theodorou is the Director of the Finance, Insurance and Trade Policy Program at the R Street Institute.Douglas Quinn is the Executive Director of the American Policyholder Association.Background:Watch Kennedy’s exchange here."
https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2022/6/kennedy-and-banking-republicans-challenge-sec-climate-disclosure-rule,"WASHINGTON – Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) joined Ranking Member Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and their Republican colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee in requesting information regarding the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) proposed climate disclosure rule.The rule would require publicly-traded companies to gather and report global warming data, though almost none of that information is material to a business’s finances.“This sweeping, close to 500-page proposed rule is unnecessary and inappropriate, exceeds the SEC’s mission and expertise, will harm consumers, workers, and the entire U.S. economy at a time when energy prices are skyrocketing, and hijacks the democratic process in determining U.S. climate policy,” wrote the senators.“It is neither necessary nor appropriate for the SEC to promulgate securities regulations to address global warming. . . . In other words, to the extent climate change will have a material impact in any of these areas, companies are already legally required to disclose this information,” they explained.The lawmakers noted that climate activists without a fiduciary duty to a company and its shareholders want this information to support their efforts to force their policy preferences on publicly-traded companies and the nation at large after failing to enact these policy changes through the legislative process. Resulting political pressure campaigns would then harm companies and their shareholders.“Furthermore, the SEC’s sweeping proposed climate disclosure rule will impose enormous costs on the entire U.S. economy if it goes into effect. Coupled with Biden administration policies that have been hostile to traditional energy, the SEC’s proposed rule will discourage capital investment in oil, natural gas, and other energy industries at a time when inflation is at a 40-year high and energy prices are skyrocketing. It will also force significant job losses within one sector of the economy when it is not the proper role of the SEC to be directing capital allocation,” the senators continued.The full letter with its specific requests for information is available here.   "
https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2022/6/kennedy-supports-bipartisan-legislation-to-keep-rural-hospitals-open,"WASHINGTON – Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) has cosponsored the bipartisan Rural Hospital Support Act introduced by Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Bob Casey (D-Penn.). The legislation would prevent rural hospitals from closing by extending and modernizing critical federal programs to keep them financially stable.The bill would permanently extend the Medicare-dependent Hospital and Low-Volume Hospital designations that are set to expire on October 1 of this year. Additionally, it would update the year that hospitals can base their operating costs from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2016. Louisiana has as many as 48 small, rural hospitals that could benefit from this legislation.“Rural Louisiana depends on our rural hospitals. The Rural Hospital Support Act would help provide reliable care and peace of mind to rural Louisianians and control costs for taxpayers,” said Kennedy.“These programs bring a lot of value for rural residents and taxpayers. Small, rural hospitals offer good-quality health care at a cost that compares well with urban hospitals’ cost. Congress should extend the programs that help keep the doors open for rural Medicare beneficiaries,” said Grassley.“Every American deserves reliable access to health care. Rural hospitals can be the difference between life and death in many parts of the U.S. Often, a rural hospital means not only safe, dependable access to health care and emergency health needs, but economic safety and stability for an entire community. This legislation takes an important step to maintain that lifeline, especially for older adults and lower income Americans. I will continue to work to bring federal funding to rural communities and make sure older Americans have the health care support they need no matter where they live,” said Casey.The Rural Hospital Support Act is supported by the Louisiana Hospital Association, Beauregard Memorial Hospital (DeRidder, LA), LaSalle General Hospital (Jena, LA), Natchitoches Regional Medical Center (Natchitoches, LA), Abbeville General Hospital (Abbeville, LA), Franklin Medical Center (Winnsboro, LA), the Alliance for Rural Hospital Access, American Hospital Association and the National Rural Health AssociationText of the legislation is available here.   "
https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2022/6/kennedy-introduces-legislation-to-ensure-felons-can-t-avoid-paying-restitution-to-victims,"WASHINGTON – Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) today introduced the Inmate Financial Accountability Task Force Act to ensure that crime victims receive the restitution offenders owe them. “Convicted felons shouldn’t be able to hoard their money for cigarettes, snacks and games while dodging what they owe to their victims and their own children. I’m thankful to work with Congressman Gooden to make sure that crime victims get the restitution they’re entitled to—and that it comes from the pockets of the people who wronged them,” said Kennedy. “Criminals in federal prison should not be shielded from their debts and obligations. Victims of their crimes deserve payment, and the mothers and fathers of their children deserve on-time child support payments. This bill would inject more accountability into the criminal justice system and is long overdue,” said Rep. Lance Gooden (R-Texas), who introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives.Because victims of crime rarely see any of the financial compensation they are owed, the Inmate Financial Accountability Task Force Act wouldcreate a task force to examine the Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) collection of victim restitution, child support for inmates’ children and fines.While there have been several high-profile cases, including the Boston Bomber and Larry Nassar, of inmates who have spent thousands of dollars on themselves while paying the bare minimum in restitution to victims, the problem with collecting restitution remains widespread. Analysis from the Government Accountability Office found that the Justice Department collected just four percent of restitution owed from 2014 through 2016—only $1.5 billion of the $34 billion ordered.Currently, the restitution process is outdated and fragmented. It involves several state and federal agencies, the judicial system and law enforcement organizations. In addition, it is challenging for law enforcement to monitor, deter and report illicit financial activity within BOP accounts in real-time.The task force would issue a report to Congress with suggestions to prevent illicit financial activity and suggest best practices for federal agencies to improve the collection of money owed to victims and child support due to inmates’ children.Text of the bill is available here."

John Kennedy (R-La.) joined Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Ranking Member Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and other Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee in urging Attorney General Merrick Garland to prosecute criminal protests outside the home of judges.“We continue to be baffled over the lack of prosecutions under Title 18, Section 1507 of the U.S. Code. We understand it is the policy of the Justice Department not to discuss any pending or potential investigations, but this is an urgent matter of national importance,” wrote the senators. Last week, a man attempted to assassinate Justice Brett Kavanaugh after learning where the justice lived by watching videos of the protests in front of his house. Reports indicate that those seeking to intimidate the justices at their homes plan to expand their campaign of harassment to their children’s schools.“While judges serve a public office, the principle of judicial independence means that their deliberations should be free from influence outside the courtroom. . . . This means especially that their deliberations should be free from harassment and intimidation, nowhere more than in their homes where their families reside,” they continued. “The responsibility of a judge—or justice—is to follow and apply the law according to his or her judgment. It is not to do so according to the judgment of their community, or the desires of their political party, or the will of the mob. It is only their judgment that counts. This is why they are given life tenure, so that external considerations—such as politics or public opinion—will not influence their constitutional duties.“Given these important distinctions it is only fitting that Congress prohibited the parading and picketing of judges’ houses in order to influence their decisions. It is a measure that preserves judicial independence,” the lawmakers explained.Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) also signed the letter.The letter is available here."

John Kennedy (R-La.) led Louisiana’s congressional delegation in urging the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to address staffing shortages and roles at Federal Correctional Complex (FCC) Oakdale in Allen Parish.FCC Oakdale houses approximately 2,000 federal inmates and faces unsustainably low staffing levels that is nearing crisis. There are approximately 116 staff vacancies, including 65 vacancies for correctional services staff, at the facility. These vacancies force FCC Oakdale to rely on mandatory overtime in order to meet the basic safety needs of its mission.“The use of mandatory overtime and augmentation as a solution to chronic staffing shortages is a dangerous practice. These practices lead to exhaustion, fatigue, and apprehension among FCC Oakdale employees. Sadly, these solutions are increasingly becoming the norm at FCC Oakdale and elsewhere,” wrote the lawmakers.“As concerned members of the Louisiana Delegation, we write to inquire about actions the Bureau of Prisons plans to take in order to maintain adequate staffing levels at the FCC Oakdale facility. We ask that you consider using existing authorities, such as the ability to provide retention bonuses, that will keep staff onboard and allow FCC Oakdale to attract additional personnel needed to perform critical staffing functions,” they explained.The delegation’s request would not require any additional funding, as the BOP already has funds that could be used to support safety by providing retention bonuses to Oakdale staff.Sen.

In voicing their concerns regarding the SEC’s regulatory overreach, the senators called for the rule to be rescinded due to the burden it would place on farmers, agricultural producers and ranchers.“While farmers and ranchers have never been subject to SEC oversight, the proposed rule’s Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirement would place a major reporting burden on the many agricultural producers that provide raw products to the value-chain. This substantial reporting requirement would significantly burden small, family-owned farms with a new, complex and unreasonable compliance requirement, resulting in costly additional compliance expenses, reduced access to new business opportunities, and potential consolidation in the agriculture industry,” they wrote. “Should the SEC move forward with this rule, it would be granted unprecedented jurisdiction over America’s farms and ranches, creating an impractical regulatory burden for thousands of businesses outside of the scope of the SEC’s purview, including our nation’s farmers and ranchers,” they continued.The letter is available here. "

Schools in Louisiana and across the country could use money from the program to harden their facilities against safety threats.“We need to keep our kids and teachers safe, and we know what works. The federal government already has $150 billion that local communities can use to protect students with security officers, school perimeters, mental health resources and more. The Safe Schools Act would use those resources to make our schools safer now,” said Kennedy.“While we made some progress in previous legislation to make our schools stronger, harder, and safer, certainly there is more that can and must be done immediately to protect kids. What happened in Uvalde was a horrific tragedy. While many have been quick to play politics, one thing we can all agree on is that Congress must act to harden schools. For these reasons, I am introducing this legislation that allows the abundance of unused COVID relief dollars to be allocated to secure schools in Kansas and throughout the nation,” said Marshall.$150 billion of the $189.5 billion provided to schools through this fund remain unspent. Under current law, states can obligate and spend this money through the end of 2024.The Safe Schools Act would allow schools to use this funding to hire and retain armed school resource officers.In addition, schools could use the money to provide:Text of the bill is available here.    "
https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2022/6/kennedy-cotton-introduce-stop-gun-criminals-act-to-reduce-gun-violence,"WASHINGTON – Sens. John Kennedy (R-La.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) today introduced the Stop Gun Criminals Act to reduce gun violence by establishing a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for felons who possess a firearm illegally.“Repeat criminals commit a large amount of the shootings that afflict American communities. They think gun laws are meant to be broken. Compassion and common sense tell us that getting those proven offenders off the streets will save lives and reduce gun violence. The Stop Gun Criminals Act would ensure that violent criminals who break our gun laws can’t continue threatening innocent communities,” said Kennedy.“Violent felons commit the vast majority of gun crimes and should be held accountable for their actions. Instead of releasing criminals onto the streets to commit more crime, our bill will establish mandatory minimum sentences for repeat offenders,” said Cotton.A small number of criminals carry out a disproportionate number of shootings, making communities across the country less safe. Despite this, the current average federal sentence for all firearm crimes, including for repeat offenders who fire a gun in the commission of a crime, is only 4.25 years.The bill would also increase penalties for the most serious criminals who use guns to commit additional crimes. The Stop Gun Criminals Act would increase the mandatory minimum sentence for serious repeat felons—those with at least three prior convictions for crimes that are punishable by at least 10 years—who use a gun in the commission of additional crimes. It would increase the minimum sentence in those cases from five years to seven years. Criminals who brandish a gun during a crime would face a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison, rather than the current seven-year minimum.Criminals who fire a gun while committing a crime would face a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years, rather than the current 10-year minimum.Finally, the bill makes a technical correction to the Armed Career Criminal Act that clarifies the definition of a serious felony as any crime for which the maximum sentence is 10 years or more. Text of the bill is available here. "

John Kennedy (R-La.) released the following statement on the historic rate of inflation and record gas prices affecting Louisiana families under President Joe Biden, including their causes and remedies. Excerpts of his comments include:“Inflation is gutting all of us like a fish.”. . .“I know many of you feel like government has let you down and that government doesn’t care about you or about your future, or you kids’ future, and I feel the same way sometimes.“People are having to dig into their savings. A dozen eggs just jumped from $1.62 to $2.52. A single pound of ground beef was $4.66 a year ago. Now it’s $5.41. Chicken is up more than $4 a pound.  “Food banks in our state are even having to cut back. They’re having trouble stocking their shelves to feed our people. And, look, it’s summer: Electricity costs are up 11%.“Used cars and trucks are up 23%. You can’t afford to put gas in your car or truck even if you can buy one, and we’re seeing just record prices every day.“This inflation, there’s nothing magical about its cause. [The] federal government just printed too much money. I mean, the last bill that President Biden passed—he just put us over the top: It was $2 trillion dollars. $2 trillion dollars! That’s 2,000 billion dollars. “And they said it was a COVID bill, but it wasn’t. It was really an expansion of our already generous welfare program. . . . And a lot of the money was wasted.”. . .“They built a $28.5 million apartment complex in Seattle, Washington for the homeless, with views of the Space Needle in Washington.“In Rhode Island, they spent $53,000 remodeling a city hall and buying ergonomic chairs.“In New York, they used $12 million to expand a minor league baseball stadium.“In Arizona, they spent $7.2 million to increase the prize money at horse racing tracks.“We can get this inflation under control, but we’ve got to do two things: Number one, we’ve got to stop spending money we don’t have, and we’ve got to stop printing it. We’ve got to do what you do every day and live within your budget. “And number two, the president has just got to get his boot off the throat of the oil and gas industry. Oil and gas prices are not going to come down as long as we’re having to buy oil from foreign countries at these inflated prices. Oil and gasoline are not going to come down until we go back to producing our own. It’s just that simple. And we can get there if the Biden administration will stop its war on the oil and gas community.”View Kennedy’s full comments here.   "

For more than 45 years, the Hyde Amendment has ensured that taxpayer dollars are not used to fund abortions, saving the lives of nearly 2.5 million preborn children. As you know, the Hyde Amendment is supported by both a substantial majority of the American public and a bipartisan majority of sitting United States Senators, and was most recently signed into law by President Biden in Public Law 117-103,” the senators wrote.“Nevertheless, President Biden's budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 once again proposes to eliminate the Hyde Amendment and other existing pro-life protections, while also increasing taxpayer funding for the abortion industry at home and abroad, including through massive funding increases for the Title X family planning program,” they continued.“We urge you to start where we finished by making a baseline commitment to maintain the same pro-life protections that were included in Public Law 117-103, and to eschew any taxpayer-funded giveaways that benefit the multi-billion-dollar abortion industry. The American people, born and preborn, deserve nothing less,” concluded the lawmakers.The letter is available here."

Below are key excerpts from the piece explaining why Congress should pass the Homeland and Cyber Threat (HACT) Act to help combat cyberpredators and give cyberattack victims the right to seek monetary compensation.“Foreign cyberattacks hurt everyday Americans, and those victims need a way to get justice from foreign governments that sponsor the criminal attackers. U.S. law already allows victims of international terrorism to sue foreign states that sponsor terrorist attacks, but the law deprives cyberattack victims of a similar recourse—and America’s enemies know it.“ Long before Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, he was making Russia a haven for cybercriminals. Not only does the Kremlin provide safe harbor for these criminals, but Russian intelligence agencies sometimes even employ them. This arrangement allows Russian hackers to launch cyberattacks on Americans while the Russian government maintains plausible deniability.“Last May, foreign hackers with likely ties to Russia struck again. They hit the Colonial Pipeline by cutting the company off from its own data until it paid a $4.4 million ransom to restore access.”. . .“Firms such as the Colonial Pipeline and JBS eventually recovered from these cyberattacks, but small businesses are more vulnerable. Main-street shops don’t have the financial resources or the cybersecurity systems that big companies enjoy. That makes them prime targets for digital terrorists.”. . .“Americans need an effective way to seek justice and compensation from the foreign governments that aid cyberterrorists. That’s why Congress should pass the Homeland and Cyber Threat (HACT) Act.“The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act became law in 1976, long before the days of the Internet, and the HACT Act would bring the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act in line with modern technology. The HACT Act would give American citizens the right to seek monetary compensation for damages suffered and hold foreign officials, employees, and agents accountable for sponsoring cyberterrorism. Companies and individual Americans who have had their private data hacked would have a path to justice from the people responsible for their pain. By imposing a cost on the foreign regimes that launch these attacks, the bill would help deter future cyberterrorism.”. . .“If American citizens are already able to sue foreign governments for contributing to terrorism, why shouldn’t they be able to sue governments that help cyberpredators violate their privacy and steal their data?“The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act needs an update. Americans have already suffered too much at the hands of foreign cybercriminals.”The op-ed is available here."

John Kennedy today gathered with local, state and federal officials on the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal Surge Barrier in New Orleans to recognize the completion of the Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System. Kennedy was instrumental in reducing the federal debt the state of Louisiana owes on the storm barrier by $1.3 billion.“Louisianians are the toughest people I know. After enduring five hurricanes in the past two years, we know well that you can never be too prepared—that’s why this investment is so important. Without the deal we worked out to reduce the interest Louisiana was paying for this crucial project, the taxpayers of my state would have been forced to foot the bill for an extra $1.3 billion. Our people need more hurricane protection and less debt, and today we celebrate both of those successes,” said Kennedy.In 2022, the US Army Corps of Engineers completed the 130-mile Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System and turned it over to the state to operate and maintain.Thanks to a provision that Kennedy negotiated into a federal spending bill, the Corps of Engineers agreed to accept, without interest, Louisiana's cost share loan payment for the storm protection system that encircles the New Orleans area. The state of Louisiana must simply repay the remaining unpaid principal balance by Sept. 30, 2023. This provision eliminates $1.3 billion of debt that Louisiana would have otherwise owed to the Corps. "

John Kennedy (R-La.) today spoke on the Senate floor about the burden Louisiana families and workers are suffering as a result of record-high inflation and gas prices.  Kennedy’s comments included:“Many of my people, Mr. President, are struggling. President Biden took office on January 20 of last year. So, what are we, we’re in day 490 of Build Back Better? From where many of people sit, nothing’s been built, and nothing is back, and nothing is better.“There’s not a more appropriate example of that than the cost of living: inflation. When President Biden took office, the cost of gasoline in my state was $2—$2—a gallon. It's between $4.15 and $4.25 right now. “And it’s not just gasoline, Mr. President. I mean, I don’t need to tell you: A dozen eggs now cost $2.52. Ground beef is $5.41. A pound of chicken is $4.10.“The price of oil, the price of gasoline, affects so much in terms of our economy. I mean, most of our food, our clothes, our plastics, the things we use every day are delivered by air, by van, by tanker—all of which use gasoline. Pharmaceuticals are affected by the price of oil.“I don’t think it’s any secret that the Biden administration is trying to disrupt the production of oil in America. I think that’s just a fact. We see it in the president canceling leases on federal lands in the Gulf of Mexico and ANWR. We see it from the difficult regulatory environment for oil and gas producers.”. . .“Now, President Biden has said he has no control over the price of oil, and, therefore, the price of gasoline.“But, Mr. President, you can't have regulatory control over the drilling, the transporting, the storage, the refining, the trading, and the taxation of oil—as the president does—and say you have no control over the price of the commodity. I mean, that’s just not true.”. . .“Here’s his energy policy: wind, solar, and wishful thinking. It’s just not realistic. And, among other things, it is hurting our country—it’s hurting my people of Louisiana desperately because of the rise in gasoline prices.”. . .“The good people in Louisiana, they just can’t afford it. And my people deserve better.“Now, what’s the answer? Here’s my opinion: We’ve got to stop spending. The Federal Reserve has got to be given a chance to do its job. The United States Congress has a budget that we have set for the United States of America. We need to live within our budget. Except for defense spending, we need to freeze spending. We need to freeze it and give the Federal Reserve a chance to get this inflation under control.”Watch Kennedy’s full remarks here. "

John Kennedy (R-La.) today introduced an extension of his 2019 legislation, Rebuilding Small Businesses After Disasters Act. The new bill extends the law and makes permanent provisions that will help homeowners and small businesses access certain U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loans.The original Recovery Improvements for Small Entities (RISE) After Disaster Act of 2015, which the Rebuilding Small Businesses After Disasters Act of 2019 extended, allows borrowers to obtain a physical disaster loan for up to $25,000 without pledging any collateral for three years. The previous loan limit was $14,000. Kennedy’s 2019 bill became law but is set to expire in Nov. 2022.“Disasters like hurricanes and flooding can leave Louisiana properties in ruin, and my bill would ensure that families have quick access to the funds they need to rebuild,” said Kennedy.Physical disaster loans help businesses, homeowners and others rebuild damaged property in declared disaster areas.A Government Accountability Office (GAO) study showed that Kennedy’s 2019 bill saved the government money. According to the study, the GAO “reviewed more than 20 years of loan data and found that the loans approved before the change in collateral requirements had higher default rates than the loans approved after the change.”Text of the proposed bill is available here."

By equipping law enforcement with special training, we can better support those who are suffering, including our brave veterans,” said Kennedy.“It’s important that our police and all first responders are empowered with the resources they need to address a variety of emergencies, including incidents that involve people with traumatic brain injuries or post-traumatic stress disorder. Our legislation would provide departments with crisis intervention tools that can help de-escalate situations and improve outcomes for everyone involved,” Grassley said.“Improved training for law enforcement officers to handle cases of post-traumatic stress or head trauma will improve public safety, support mental health, and reduce the devastation of severe brain injuries,” said Ossoff.The bipartisan TBI and PTSD Law Enforcement Training Act would improve training for law enforcement by boosting resources for the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Program to develop and implement the trainings. Many military veterans suffer from PTSD related to their service, and the bill would require the attorney general to develop best practices on techniques to interact with people who have traumatic brain injury or PTSD.The bill would also require new trainings be included in the Police Mental Health Collaboration Kit, a no-cost training tool that provides resources for law enforcement agencies to effectively respond to calls for service.Text of the bill is available here.  "

Additionally, DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is responsible for informing Americans about disinformation related to elections and critical infrastructure. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the lead agency in the Foreign Influence Task Force. There is no gap in our nation’s ability to counter disinformation threats that this board fills,” continued the senators. “While DHS has promised the board will ‘protect privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties,’ we do not take solace in words alone. A fine line exists between tackling disinformation and government censorship. Exactly where the Disinformation Governance Board falls on this line remains unclear and the potential for abuse is so egregious that we urge any and all funding for the board be prohibited during the Homeland Security appropriations process,” they concluded.  Sens.

What’s in it for the people of Louisiana?“I make decisions on helping other countries solely through the lens of national security for the American people and the people of Louisiana.

Now, more than ever, we owe law enforcement our gratitude and our support,” said Grassley. The resolution honors the 576 law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty in 2021, as well as the 92 lost to date in 2022. Last year marked the most intentional killings of police since the Sept. 11 attacks.

Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and 19 other senators in urging Robert Califf, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner, to explain the FDA’s failure to mitigate the nationwide baby formula shortage.“For decades, the FDA has been the gold standard for approving and regulating medical products and food. Yet this year, the actions of the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) has raised questions regarding its ability to fulfill its core oversight responsibilities. The safety of, and access to, infant formula should be among CFSAN’s highest priorities, as this food is vital for the growth and development of infants,” the senators wrote.“We are also concerned as to why FDA leadership failed to be proactive in mitigating the shortage crisis parents are now facing. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed many vulnerabilities across all sectors of industry, and our food supply chain was woefully unprepared to handle challenges here and from foreign partners. Infant formula supplies at local grocery stores were relatively stable for the first half of 2021. The out-of-stock percentage started to climb steadily in the later half and continued to worsen throughout this year,” they continued.The senators asked Califf several questions, including whether the FDA and White House have a strategic plan in place to mitigate formula shortages and if the FDA made any recommendations to the White House about what actions the FDA can take to handle the shortage. “The shortage, felt by all families in need, is disproportionately impacting vulnerable populations. . . . The FDA must do everything within its statutory authority to ensure it facilitates access to safe, quality foods,” concluded the senators. Sens.

John Kennedy (R-La.) today addressed the record high Louisiana gas prices that President Biden’s policies have caused. Key excerpts from his remarks are below: “It is a serious problem for lower-middle income and poor Americans. . . . For our less fortunate Americans, it’s a choice between filling up their car or paying their rent or buying their food. “It’s no mystery why we’re having this inflation in gasoline. When your demand remains constant or it increases, and your supply shrinks, you’re going to see price increases every single time. “Why is supply shrinking? Well, I think the main reason—there are other reasons—but I think the main reason has to do with President Biden’s energy policy. We know now, after 14 months, that President Biden’s energy policy is wind, solar and wishful thinking. The American economy is the most powerful economy in all of human history. It can’t run without energy. Eighty percent of our energy comes from fossil fuels.” . . . “Markets are forward looking. The price of gasoline today, and the price of oil and natural gas, also reflects what people who produce the product and who buy the product think about the future, and there’s no question that they look ahead under the Biden administration and see that they expect the Biden administration to continue to do everything it can to bankrupt the oil and gas industry.” . . . “The president says: ‘I’m not against oil and gas.’ All you have to do is look at his proposed new rules for the National Environmental Policy Act, the proposed rules for NEPA. Take a good look at a pipeline because you won’t see another one in America if these rules pass.” View Kennedy’s complete remarks here."

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and other Republican senators in writing to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo urging the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to stop delaying permits for offshore oil and gas companies that are performing exploration work ahead of drilling wells.“While the Biden Administration and Members of Congress fault the domestic oil and gas industry of sitting idle on over 9,000 drilling permits and millions of acres in ‘inactive leases,’ NMFS’s permitting delays represent one example of the Administration’s de facto ban on new drilling—impeding domestic oil and gas investment, exploration, and production,” the senators wrote.“Specifically, we are aware that NMFS has a backlog of applications for ‘Letters of Authorization’ (LOA), which federal oil and gas leasees need in order to perform the specific geological surveying necessary to develop their leases located on the federal U.S. Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). We understand some pending LOA applications have been with the agency for well over 100 days, whereas NMFS has historically approved LOA applications within 2 to 4 weeks,” they continued.The letter notes that the permitting delay is principally due to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) inadvertently double-counting projected exposure estimates for activities on the OCS, it’s reliance on those miscalculations when developing the final rule in question. The letter advises the NMFS to:“It is unacceptable that agency miscalculations have restricted access to safe, secure, and reliable domestic oil and gas production through substantial, unnecessary, and arbitrary permitting delays,” the senators concluded.Text of the letter is available here."

John Kennedy (R-La.) today joined more than 15 other Republican senators in introducing a resolution highlighting rising crime rates in the U.S. and calling on President Biden to combat crime and secure the southern border. “The Biden administration seems to think that when a criminal commits a crime, it’s not really the criminal’s fault. Under President Biden’s watch, crime rates have gone up, drugs are pouring across the border and criminals are murdering cops. The White House must do something to keep American communities safe,” said Kennedy.The resolution points out that the murder rate in America rose by 30 percent from 2019-2020, the largest single-year increase in more than a century. In addition, there was a 59 percent increase in the number of police officers murdered last year. At least 16 American cities set record for the number of murders in 2021.More than 2.5 million illegal immigrants have been caught trying to cross the U.S. southern border since January 2021, and overdose deaths have reached an all-time high as the flow of illegal drugs across the southern border is putting communities at risk across America.Text of the resolution is available here."

John Kennedy (R-La.) today introduced the Mother and Baby Formula Safety Act to give parents Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance for producing safe formula options for their children at home. “While the FDA finishes its investigation, it has to help parents find solutions to formula supply chain bottlenecks in real time. The agency must equip moms and dads to find or make safe alternatives if an emergency leaves formula shelves bare, and my bill would make sure the FDA does that for parents,” said Kennedy.Kennedy introduced the bill as parents of young children are facing a nationwide shortage of commercial formula. The Mother and Baby Formula Safety Act would require the FDA to respond to formula shortages by publishing guidelines for safely making formula at home, resources for parents to locate alternatives to commercial formula and other safety guidance.Text of the bill is available here. "

Small Business Mergers, Acquisitions, Sales and Brokerage Simplification Act, which would help small business owners access the services of small business merger and acquisition (M&A) brokers.M&A brokers assist small business owners who want to sell their businesses or merge with other firms so that their companies can continue expanding and supporting job growth.“This bill would give small businesses more flexibility to create and sustain jobs. The Senate has the chance now to pass this bill quickly so that job creators can continue building stronger businesses that serve their employees and communities,” said Kennedy.The bill would allow small business M&A brokers to organize sales and purchases of ownership as well as the control of private companies without registering as “broker-dealers” with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Removing the requirement to register with the SEC and FINRA would remove a bureaucratic roadblock that M&A brokers face when trying to assist small businesses. Kennedy’s bill would make M&A services more affordable and accessible to small business owners who need help buying or selling companies.Kennedy’s bill now awaits passage in the Senate.Text of the Small Business Mergers, Acquisitions, Sales and Brokerage Simplification Act is available here."

John Kennedy (R-La.) released the following statement upon voting against Sen. Schumer’s attempt to force states to legalize abortion up to the point of a child’s birth. The bill goes far beyond the bounds of Roe v. Wade to prohibit states from protecting life even after viability.“Is the Senate working to lower inflation or secure the southern border this week? No. Sen. Schumer can’t be bothered to care about what Louisianians and Americans need most. Instead, he asked us to vote to nullify state laws and legalize abortion up to the moment of birth.“His bill would also allow aborting a child because of the child’s sex. It would remove religious liberty protections for health care providers who believe life begins before birth. It would block laws that require parental consent or notification before an abortion. It is a very radical bill.“This is why Washington insiders don’t get to tell Louisianians what their values should be.”"

John Kennedy (R-La.) today introduced the Independent and Objective Oversight of Ukrainian Assistance Act to establish a Special Inspector General (IG) for Ukraine. The Special IG would oversee the humanitarian, economic and security assistance funding that the U.S. Congress has provided to the country, and make sure that the funds are appropriately spent.Kennedy is introducing the bill as Congress considers nearly $40 billion in additional supplemental aid to the European nation. The U.S. has already provided $13.6 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine. “The Ukrainian people have defended their country’s sovereignty with bravery and grit. Congress has already supported their fight against Putin’s war of aggression with billions and billions of dollars in aid and military equipment. American taxpayers deserve to know that their money is helping Ukraine beat back Russia effectively, and Congress needs to guarantee that oversight,” said Kennedy.  Kennedy’s bill would equip the Special IG for Ukraine with $20 million from the money that Congress has already provided in Ukraine aid. That $20 million represents less than 0.04% of the more than $50 billion in supplemental aid that has been or may be sent to Ukraine.In order to prevent expanding bureaucracy indefinitely, the bill also includes a termination clause to end the Special IG role once U.S. taxpayer spending for Ukraine drops below $250 million per year. The text of the bill is available here."

John Kennedy (R-La.) today joined a bicameral group of 82 legislators, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rep. Michelle Steel (R-Calif.), in filing an amicus curiae (“friend of the court”) brief to the Supreme Court in the cases Students for Fair Admissions vs. Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina.At both schools, considering race allowed admissions offices to discriminate against Asian-American applicants, despite their superior GPAs and standardized test scores.“Harvard College and the University of North Carolina indisputably use race as an important consideration in deciding whom to admit. Record evidence suggests, in fact, that the challenged admissions policies may strive for racial balancing—an aim that is unconstitutional on its face,” lawmakers wrote.“Race-conscious admissions decisions inflict a heavy toll on Asian-American students. Treating them differently because of their race is a stark departure from equal protection decisions issued early on by this Court, which guarded Asian immigrants from racial prejudice. And the burdens imposed on petitioner illustrate a wider trend. Asian-Americans are increasingly victimized by discriminatory practices,” they explained.Sens.

John Kennedy (R-La.) successfully negotiated into the bill. The 2022 WRDA package now awaits a vote in the full Senate. “With the crucial provisions we negotiated for our state, WRDA would help restore ecosystems in south Louisiana and ensure that important Army Corps of Engineers projects get completed sooner,” said Kennedy.Kennedy fought to include in WRDA several measures that would expedite Army Corps of Engineers projects in Louisiana and a provision that would substantially reduce Louisiana’s cost share to perform ecosystem restoration in areas degraded by the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO) navigation channel.The MRGO navigation channel was closed after Hurricane Katrina, but the state has not yet restored the habitats that the channel damaged. Louisiana normally covers 35 percent of the cost of Corps of Engineers projects while the federal government covers 65 percent. The WRDA provision that Kennedy helped negotiate increases the federal share of restoring the MRGO to 90 percent of the project’s cost.Other Kennedy victories in WRDA include directing the Corps of Engineers to:  "

That’s what brought us together to write and pass the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act in 2020, a law that phases down the production and use of HFCs by 85% over the next 15 years. Transitioning away from HFCs drives more investments in American-made technologies that are better for the environment, cheaper for consumers, and good for the economy. “The AIM Act is expected to create 33,000 new manufacturing jobs and help more than 130,000 Americans keep their current jobs over the next five years in communities across the country including our home states of Louisiana and Delaware.” . . . “This manufacturing boost will also be good for Louisiana, where plants in Geismar, Baton Rouge, and St. Gabriel could create more jobs and save hundreds of existing jobs by transitioning to production of safer coolants.

John Kennedy (R-La.) and Tom Carper (D-Del.) first appeared in the Washington Times on April 27, 2022.Win-win opportunities aren’t easy to find in politics, but sometimes single solutions exist to help tackle several challenges. Cleaning up super-polluting hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) is one of those rare solutions that will boost our economy and help protect our planet.HFCs are the coolants and refrigerants that keep our homes cool and our groceries cold in the fridge. They are found in almost every household in America—but they have a global warming effect thousands of times stronger than carbon dioxide.For years, American companies have been at the forefront of developing HFC alternatives, so by phasing down HFCs we help promote U.S. leadership in the innovation and manufacturing of new climate-safe products. That’s what brought us together to write and pass the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act in 2020, a law that phases down the production and use of HFCs by 85% over the next 15 years. Transitioning away from HFCs drives more investments in American-made technologies that are better for the environment, cheaper for consumers, and good for the economy.The AIM Act is expected to create 33,000 new manufacturing jobs and help more than 130,000 Americans keep their current jobs over the next five years in communities across the country including our home states of Louisiana and Delaware. In addition, using these next generation coolants is expected to save American businesses and consumers billions in energy costs over the next 10 years. That’s why the AIM Act won broad support from hundreds of businesses, industry leaders, and environmental groups.This manufacturing boost will also be good for Louisiana, where plants in Geismar, Baton Rouge, and St. Gabriel could create more jobs and save hundreds of existing jobs by transitioning to production of safer coolants. And Louisiana companies involved in the heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration (HVACR) industry could benefit, as well. The international HVACR market could more than double over the next decade, and Louisiana’s HVACR industry can produce appliances that don’t rely on HFCs—appliances that we could then export to make the most out of this industry’s growth.More than a thousand miles away, in Delaware, thousands of workers are employed by manufacturers of climate-friendly HFC alternatives. Yet, the environmental benefits of the AIM Act will benefit all who live in the First State. As the lowest lying state in the nation, Delaware is already experiencing the economic impacts of rising seas and other climate-related events. Reducing HFCs is a powerful tool to use in tackling climate change. Coupled with international efforts, the AIM Act could help avoid a global temperature increase of 0.5C by the end of the century.But our work isn’t done yet. While the AIM Act has helped position America to reap the domestic fruits of transitioning away from HFCs, it can’t ensure that we’ll keep beating competitors (and super-polluters) like China and India unless America is a full partner in international efforts to phase out these substances.In order to see the full economic and environmental benefits of transitioning away from HFCs, the Senate must now ratify the Kigali Amendment.

Both sides of the aisle can agree that the U.S. should lead the world in exporting the goods that use next-generation coolants.The Senate should ratify this amendment for the same reasons that Congress passed the AIM Act. Formalizing America’s support for the Kigali Amendment would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, boost U.S. exports, strengthen America’s manufacturing industry, and create more jobs for workers here at home.

John Kennedy (R-La.) introduced in the Senate and Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) introduced in the House, was today signed into law by President Joe Biden. The bill allows the city of Eunice to restore its historic Liberty Theatre. “I’m grateful that we could finally get through a bureaucratic roadblock which has been blocking the restoration of the historic Liberty Theatre. The people of Eunice are finally free to start bringing the Liberty Theatre back to life,” said Kennedy. The National Park Service owned a section of the Liberty Theatre that provides a handicap accessible entrance, but this ownership interest in the property has been hindering efforts to restore the theater. The Save the Liberty Theatre Act grants Eunice full ownership of the theater property so that the city can begin restoration efforts. Text of the Save the Liberty Theatre Act is available here."
