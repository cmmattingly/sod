https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-colleagues-call-on-leader-schumer-to-safeguard-national-security-by-voting-on-ndaa/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) led 23 of his Senate colleagues in sending a letter to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) demanding the Senate vote on the FY2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) before the end of September. The U.S. House of Representatives approved its version of the legislation in July, with a broad, bipartisan majority voting in support. The letter, sent late Tuesday, invoked the words of George Washington while calling on Leader Schumer to schedule a vote on the NDAA in time for an open Senate amendment process to take place. Among other priorities, the legislation funds military technology, strengthens capabilities, and delivers a 4.6 percent pay raise to America’s service members.“At the founding of our nation, then-General George Washington penned, “When the civil and military powers cooperate, and afford mutual aid to each other there can be little doubt of things going well. Two centuries later, that still rings true. Yet should this body fail in its top Constitutional responsibility of providing for a common defense, our armed services will be left directionless, lack stable funding, and be devoid of civilian Congressional oversight,” the senators wrote.“Members of the House passed their NDAA on July 14th, by a vote of 329 – 101,” the senators continued. “For the bill to go to conference and make it to President Biden’s desk, our colleagues must have the opportunity to debate the Senate version with an open amendment process. As such, we the undersigned respectfully request that you call the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 to the Senate floor before the conclusion of the September work period.Joining Senator Tuberville in the letter are U.S. Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mike Braun (R-IN), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Mike Lee (R-UT), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Jim Risch (R-ID), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Rick Scott (R-FL), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Todd Young (R-IN), and John Hoeven (R-ND).A copy of the letter can be found below.Leader Schumer,At the founding of our nation, then-General George Washington penned, “When the civil and military powers cooperate, and afford mutual aid to each other there can be little doubt of things going well.” Two centuries later, that still rings true.

https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-slams-democrats-radical-takeover-of-higher-education/,"Newsroom &vert; Press Releases“Left-wing activists have fundamentally shifted higher education to become a vehicle to further their political agenda…”WASHINGTON —U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) today spoke about the disastrous impacts of progressive ideologies on the American higher education system. The Biden administration’s decision to forgive student loans and undermine financial accountability will worsen inflation for hardworking Americans while driving the cost of tuition even higher for students. At the same time, the administration’s proposed changes to Title IX, which would force federally-funded schools to allow biological males to compete in women’s sports, would undo 50 years of progress made to level the playing field for female athletes. American students should be encouraged to take responsibility for their own actions and allowed to compete in free and fair competition, on and off the field.Excerpts from the Senator’s speech can be found below, and his remarks can be viewed here.“Beyond the subjects taught in classrooms and in textbooks, there are a lot of lessons to be learned in college. It’s an important time for the overall development of our young adults.”“And just as colleges and universities are important to the students who attend them, they have also been, historically, an integral part of our society and development for the future. For many years, institutions of higher education were great examples of the beauty of the American experiment. They were places where free speech was not only allowed, but encouraged — and innovation and problem solving were required for success. And they created some of America’s favorite pastimes — college sports — which became a piece of our national identity and have immense benefits for the student athletes involved. American higher education became the envy of the world. Our colleges and universities produced new research, technologies, and medicines — and molded the talented minds to use these new developments to make our country a better place. But this trend is changing. Left-wing activists have fundamentally shifted higher education to become a vehicle to further their political agenda — and now they’re set on [forcing] American taxpayers to pay for the overpriced indoctrination, and taking athletic opportunities away from those who have worked so hard to compete.”“Let’s start with the price tag associated with higher education. The cost of attending college has skyrocketed. But these institutions have done little to ensure their value has increased along with their price, the increase of tuitions, and bloated school administrations continually drive budgets and tuition bills up. President Biden recently decided to throw gasoline on this fire by attempting to use executive authority to — as he calls it — ‘forgive’ student loan debt for millions of Americans.”“His plan will forgive up to $20,000 in student loan debt for Pell Grant recipients who make $125,000 or less a year, and $10,000 in student loan debt for all others under the same salary cap. Think about that: a college-educated person making a six-figure salary would essentially get a $10,000 handout from hardworking Americans, the majority of whom did not go to college themselves and are struggling to provide for their families thanks to soaring inflation driven by Democrats’ reckless spending. Despite the administration’s attempts to convince the country they are focused on fighting inflation, this debt transfer scheme will do the exact opposite.”“I’m also concerned about two additional long-term effects of this decision: One, it does nothing to fix the broken system that led to soaring costs in the first place. In fact, it will make college even more expensive…And two, it allows students and graduates to avoid the consequences of their own actions, further hindering young people from becoming independent, free thinking, responsible adults.” “I started coaching a few years after Title IX started, and I’ve seen from the very beginning what Title IX has done for women across this country, girls, and athletes. And how it has made leaders of young girls and women who never [would have] been afforded the opportunity had Title IX not passed…”“This fiftieth anniversary of Title IX was in June. But, this anniversary comes at an important and challenging time for female athletes. Their ability to train and compete fairly is under attack from activists and this current White House.”“In July, the Department of Education published and proposed a rule to change how Title IX is implemented in order to better align with the administration’s progressive agenda. These proposed changes would require schools to allow… biological males to compete in women’s sports. Last week, I submitted a public comment to Secretary Cardona that clearly and strongly condemns this new proposed rule… The change to Title IX would be a monumental setback for the generations of women who have benefited from the law over the last fifty years.”“To best prepare America’s young people to be the next generation of leaders our country needs, I am fighting back against these policies — like [dismantling] Title IX and haphazardly forgiving student debt — that encourages young adults to break the rules and ignore their responsibilities. Instead of making our colleges more expensive and less fair, Congress should be focused on reforms that get to the root of the cause.”“Our country cannot thrive without allowing young adults to freely and fairly learn, grow, develop, and create — on and off the field. We must protect that fair playing field while encouraging college students to take responsibility for their own actions and financial decisions — something all of us here in Congress should learn to do as well.”Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees."
https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-streamline-grant-applications-for-small-towns-local-governments/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON — For local governments in small towns across the country, the federal grant application process can be overly cumbersome and expensive. To support these rural and smaller communities, U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and eight of his colleagues introduced the Simplifying Grants Act (S. 4799). The legislation would make the federal grant process easier to navigate for local governments.“Congress should look for ways to cut red tape and make the government more efficient for the American people. The Simplifying Grants Act will do just that, giving valuable time and resources back to public servants in smaller towns across the country,” said Senator Tuberville. “In a state like Alabama, where nearly 60 percent of counties would benefit from the changes in this bill, that time will be well spent on projects in those communities. I’m proud to join my colleagues in this effort to make it easier for small towns to access the tools they deserve.”Senator Tuberville joined U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Susan Collins (R-ME), John Cornyn (R-TX), Mike Crapo (R-ID), James Risch (R-ID), Rick Scott (R-FL), and Roger Wicker (R-MS) in sponsoring the legislation.Background:The Simplifying Grants Act aims to make it easier for smaller local governments to apply for funds under federal grants by directing the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and executive agencies to 1) simplify grant applications for local governments located innonurbanized areas (populations of less than 50,000), 2) make checklists available that list each requirement of each step of the grant process for grants for which such local governments are eligible, and 3) fulfill certain reporting requirements.Smaller cities, counties, and local governments often face difficulties in applying for, and receiving, federal grant dollars. In the 1980s, the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR) found evidence showing that “federal aid programs have never consistently transferred income to the poorest jurisdictions or individuals” and that “unlike… other major federal systems, the United States lacks a systematic method for equalizing the fiscal resources of its states.” Since ACIR’s report, the total number of federal grants to state and local governments has grown by more than 135 percent and the total amount of federal grant-in-aid to state and local governments increased by approximately 690 percent, since ACIR’s finding.The unequal distribution of federal dollars can be explained by numerous factors, including the complexity of the application process. Larger local governments have more resources to hire dedicated grant writers and coordinators, so they can submit better applications and be more equipped to effectively utilize federally awarded funds, which gives larger local governments an advantage over less populated counties."
https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-blasts-biden-administrations-disregard-for-protecting-womens-sports/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON — As a part of the public comment period for the U.S. Department of Education’s proposed rule that would negatively affect the future of women’s sports, U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) today submitted a public comment urging the department to abandon its efforts to change how Title IX is implemented.Announced in July, the Biden administration’s proposed rule would, among other things, expand the definition of “sex” to include “gender identity,” forcing institutions that accept federal funds to allow biological males to compete in women’s sports. If implemented, the change would come just months after Senator Tuberville joined millions of Americans in celebrating the 50-year anniversary of the revolutionary Title IX law, which has given generations of women the opportunity to meaningfully participate at the highest levels of competition. “Congress made clear its intention to establish Title IX as a prohibition on discrimination against women at institutions that received Federal financial assistance. By broadening the definition of “sex” based on weakly-associated case law and polarizing social concepts adopted by the progressive left, the intent of the law is destroyed, and women are marginalized yet again,” wrote Senator Tuberville. He continued, “This proposed rule is a monumental setback for the generations of women who have benefited from Title IX’s enactment over the last fifty years. The Department should not move forward with this proposed rule, but instead, work with Congress on legislative action meant to strengthen the protections afforded women in the original statute.”Read Senator Tuberville’s entire comment as submitted to the federal register here. The public comment follows months of work from Senator Tuberville to sound the alarm about the growing threats to female athletes’ level playing field and the future of women’s sports posed by the Biden administration’s policies.BACKGROUND:Senator Tuberville, who began his career as a high school girls’ basketball coach, is leading the efforts in the U.S. Senate to protect women’s sports. The Senator has been vocal about the Biden administration’s proposed rule changes to how Title IX is implemented, particularly how the changes would affect women’s sports.In July, Senator Tuberville joined 20 of his colleagues in strongly criticizing the U.S. Department of Education’s proposed rule and urging the Secretary of Education to extend the public comment period. Earlier this year, he called for the vote of the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, which Democrats blocked from consideration."
https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-colleagues-urge-biden-to-address-supply-chain-shortages-threatening-electric-infrastructure-as-storm-season-approaches/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON —U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) joined 11 of his congressional colleagues calling on President Biden to immediately address the supply chain shortages threatening the Southeast region’s electric infrastructure as storm season approaches. Their letter echoes concerns expressed from local power companies in the region about the supply of transformers and the raw materials used to make them. Members of Alabama’s congressional delegation expressed similar concerns in a letter to FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell earlier this year.“Transformers are a crucial component of electricity delivery at substations and utility poles. This equipment is important not only for keeping up with economic growth, but for restoring power after storms and other extreme weather events. In the past months, costs are skyrocketing, and lead times for some manufacturers are up to two years – while others are not taking orders at all,” the members wrote. The members also urged President Biden to “direct the Department of Energy (DOE) to temporarily suspend its most recent conservation standards for transformers, which require manufacturers to use more steel than previously required,” and to “engage the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to engage with suppliers and utilities to determine whether stockpiles of transformers, particularly those that may have been purchased with federal funds, may exist that can be called upon in emergency situations.”Joining Senator Tuberville in the letter are U.S. Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), and Marco Rubio (R-FL), and U.S. Representatives David Kustoff (R-TN-08), Diana Harshbarger (R-TN-01), John Rose (R-TN-06), Scott DesJarlais (R-TN-04), Tim Burchett (R-TN-02), Morgan Griffith (R-VA-09), and Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN-03).A copy of the letter can be found below.Dear Mr. President:We are writing to encourage you to take further action to address the urgent supply chain shortages threatening our region’s electric infrastructure. Beyond the current invocation of the Defense Production Act for certain energy infrastructure components, more must be done to ensure electric reliability heading into storm season.We have heard from Local Power Companies serving our region that the availability of transformers is particularly dire. Transformers are a crucial component of electricity delivery at substations and utility poles. This equipment is important not only for keeping up with economic growth, but for restoring power after storms and other extreme weather events. In the past months, costs are skyrocketing, and lead times for some manufacturers are up to two years – while others are not taking orders at all.At issue is the availability of raw materials like steel. Your Capstone report on America’s Supply Chains notes that there is only one domestic manufacturer of the steel used to produce transformers, and this company is unable to meet demand. The Department of Energy’s (DOE) February 2022 report which informed that conclusion recommends, among other things, lowering manufacturing costs of large power transformers.At a minimum, we request that you direct DOE to temporarily suspend its most recent conservation standards for transformers, which require manufacturers to use more steel than previously required. According to a letter sent to DOE Secretary Jennifer Granholm by the American Public Power Association and National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, this would allow manufacturers to increase transformer availability by allowing less steel to be used for each device.Further, we request you engage the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to engage with suppliers and utilities to determine whether stockpiles of transformers, particularly those that may have been purchased with federal funds, may exist that can be called upon in emergency situations.Thank you for your attention to this matter.Sincerely,Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees."
https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-colleagues-raise-concern-about-biden-administration-allowing-individuals-who-have-supported-terrorism-to-immigrate-to-the-u-s/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) joined nine of his Senate colleagues in a letter to Department of Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressing serious concern over their departments’ recent determination that allows individuals who provided “insignificant material support” or “limited material support” to terrorist organizations to immigrate to the United States. This determination from June 8 alters current U.S. immigration policy.“We write because the American people deserve an explanation regarding the broad, open-ended nature of this authority for exempting individuals who would otherwise be barred from immigration to the United States for supporting a terrorist organization,” the senators wrote.  “In contrast, the June 8 determination is not limited to certain conflicts, terrorist organizations, geographic regions, or time periods. Instead, it “broadly permits the admission of foreign individuals who provided material support to terrorist organizations that the Biden Administration deems insignificant or limited. This could include, for example, current or former members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and IRGC-linked entities, which are responsible for the deaths of hundreds of U.S. service members in Iraq and Afghanistan. It could include individuals seeking asylum at the southern border,” the senators continued.While the authority has previously been used by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of State, prior determinations have typically been narrowly tailored and limited to specific groups of immigrants, geographic regions, or conflicts, such as the Lebanese Civil War or revolution against Saddam Hussein in Iraq.The Senators requested that Secretaries Mayorkas and Blinken provide a timely explanation and justification for this broad new authority, which substantially changes U.S. immigration policy.Joining Senator Tuberville in the letter are Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Rick Scott (R-FL), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Roger Marshall (R-KS), John Hoeven (R-ND), and Steve Daines (R-MT).A copy of the letter can be found below.Dear Secretary Mayorkas and Secretary Blinken:On June 8, 2022, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of State determined that they will no longer bar individuals who provide “insignificant material support” or “limited material support” to terrorist organizations from admission into the United States (“June 8 Determination”). We write because the American people deserve an explanation regarding the broad, open-ended nature of this authority for exempting individuals who would otherwise be barred from immigration to the United States for supporting a terrorist organization.Under federal law, persons who have engaged or assisted in terrorist activities are generally ineligible to immigrate to the United States. The Secretaries of Homeland Security and State can exempt certain persons from this prohibition, however. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(3)(B)(i). Usually, such an exemption is limited to specific groups or conflicts for obvious reasons.For example, in 2019, this authority was applied to visa or other immigration-related applications for an activity or association relating to the Lebanese Forces militias (“2019 Determination”). The 2019 Determination is narrowly tailored and does not apply outside the context of the Lebanese civil war that occurred between 1975 and 1990. It also clearly states that it does not apply to any alien that engaged in terrorist activity or knowingly provided any level of material support to terrorist activities that targeted noncombatants or U.S. interests.Similarly, in 2012, this exemption authority was applied with respect to aliens in the context of activities or associations relating to the uprisings against Saddam Hussein’s government in Iraq (“2012 Determination”). Like the 2019 Determination, the 2012 Determination is confined to a specific group of aliens from a certain geographic area during a specified period of time.In contrast, your June 8 Determination widely exempts persons who provided “insignificant material support” or “limited material support under circumstances” to a designated terrorist organization. According to a DHS press release, the intent of this determination is to help “vulnerable Afghans.” Yet, the June 8 Determination makes no mention of Afghanistan or Afghan refugees and is not limited to the categories of Afghan individuals described in your press release or persons connected with the war in Afghanistan. Indeed, it is not limited to certain conflicts, terrorist organizations, geographic regions, or time periods at all.In contrast, on the same day that you issued the June 8 Determination, you issued a separate determination that was specifically limited to individuals who were employed as civil servants in Afghanistan during a specific time frame. The geographic, circumstantial, and temporal specificity in this second determination highlights and calls into question the broad, open-ended nature of the June 8 Determination, which is not in any way limited to vulnerable Afghans or persons involved with the conflict in Afghanistan.Instead, the June 8 Determination broadly permits the admission of foreign individuals who provided material support to terrorist organizations that the Biden Administration deems insignificant or limited. This could include, for example, current or former members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and IRGC-linked entities, which are responsible for the deaths of hundreds of U.S. service members in Iraq and Afghanistan. It could include individuals seeking asylum at the southern border. The timing of the June 8 Determination, nearly a year after the Administration’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, also raises questions. If its intent is to ensure that Afghan refugees are able to gain asylum in the United States, there is no explanation regarding why this decision was not made months ago with prudent restrictions limiting its application to Afghan refugees.The June 8 Determination alters U.S. immigration policy and for obvious reasons affects the security of the United States by making individuals who provided material support to terrorist organizations eligible to enter the United States and receive “immigration benefits or other status[es]” at the expense of American taxpayers. This sort of substantial, inadequately explained change to U.S. immigration policy implicating obvious U.S. national security interests merits further explanation and congressional scrutiny.Therefore, we request that you provide answers to the following questions regarding the June 8 Determination:In addition to providing written responses to these questions, we also request a briefing from the appropriate officials to discuss any outstanding questions.Further, we write to confirm that you will comply with the requirements of the CRA in taking this action.Under the CRA, an agency action that falls within the definition of a “rule” must be submitted to Congress for review before it can take effect. 5 U.S.C. § 801(a)(1)(A). “The definition of a rule under the CRA is very broad.” Government Accountability Office B-323772, at 3 (Sept. 4, 2012), available at https://www.gao.gov/assets/b-323772.pdf. In pertinent part, the CRA defines a rule as: “the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency.” 5 U.S.C. § 551(4). This is not limited to directives requiring notice, public comment, or similar Administrative Procedure Act procedures. This appears to be an agency statement of general applicability that prescribes new immigration law altering terrorist-related exclusions, in which case it must be submitted for congressional review. Thank you for your attention to this letter, and given the important national security interests at stake, we respectfully request a reply by September 12, 2022.Sincerely,Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees."

This latest tax and spend spree will further increase inflation and raise taxes on families at a time when they can least afford it. I worked with my Republican colleagues to offer commonsense amendments to this package that would cut taxes, slash regulations, stand up to China, and bolster our national security. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats shot down these proposals and forced through a bill that does nothing to improve or grow our economy. Instead, their bill provides funding for their Green New Deal policies, sends American businesses overseas, and doubles the size of the IRS, giving the agency more manpower to go after small business and the middle class.”BACKGROUND:During the vote-a-rama, Democrats voted against all Republicans’ efforts to provide economic relief to Americans as the country is on the verge of a recession.

https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-veterans-bill-passes-senate-will-streamline-post-9-11-gi-bill-benefits/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesSenator Tuberville continues efforts to help military and veteran familiesWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville’s (R-AL) veterans bill (S. 3606) passed the U.S. Senate last night with unanimous support. The bill, which clarifies the information required on the post-9/11 GI Bill benefit transfer forms, is Senator Tuberville’s second piece of legislation to pass the Senate, after the Supporting Families of the Fallen Act passed in March. “As the son of a veteran and a grateful American, I want to ensure that our veterans and their families are well-taken care of, not the victims of bureaucratic red tape,” said Senator Tuberville. “This bill is another targeted, meaningful change that makes it easier for our veterans and their families to receive the benefits they so rightly deserve. I look forward to seeing this bill pass the House and sent to President Biden’s desk soon.”BACKGROUNDAfter learning of a small, but correctable error that makes it difficult for dependents to receive their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, Senator Tuberville introduced legislation to fix the issue in February 2022. The bill clarifies the information required on U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) forms filled out by a service member when they elect to have their post-9/11 GI Bill benefit transferred to a dependent. Part of current VA and DoD transfer forms requires the service member to fill out a field labeled “end date,” which refers to the date on which the dependent may no longer receive the benefit.There are multiple examples of service members misreading the information requested in the GI Bill benefit transfer forms, resulting in eligible dependents being barred from education benefits due to an easily amendable error. Since this field is the cause of many incorrectly completed transfer forms, Senator Tuberville’s bill would remove the “end date” to prevent further issues. The VA and DoD cannot amend the information on the form without this statutory authority. Specifically, this bill would allow a service member to transfer his or her Post-9/11 GI bill benefits to a spouse or child so long as the service member has done the following:A bipartisan group of nine senators cosponsored the bill, including Senators John Thune (R-SD), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Mike Braun (R-IN), Tim Scott (R-SC), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), John Boozman (R-AR), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT). Once the billpasses the U.S. House of Representatives, where it also has bipartisan support, it will head to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law.The state of Alabama is home to more than 400,000 veterans. Since assuming office, Senator Tuberville has been focused on identifying targeted, meaningful changes that can be made to how the U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) delivers benefits and care to America’s veterans and service members. Along these lines, Senator Tuberville has introduced numerous pieces of legislation, including the Supporting Families of the Fallen Act, HBOT Access Act of 2021,and Restoring Benefits to Defrauded Veterans Act. Additionally, through his work on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, he has supported several bills including the Veterans Health Care Freedom Act,  GHAPS Act, and the Strengthening and Amplifying Vaccination Efforts to Locally Immunize all Veterans and Every Spouse (SAVE LIVES) Act.He has written about his efforts to help veterans and their families in The Birmingham News.Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"
https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-on-fox-business-biden-administration-needs-to-wake-up-about-the-belligerence-of-china/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) today joined host Jackie DeAngelis on Fox Business Network’s Cavuto: Coast to Coast to discuss China’s recent missile tests near Taiwan. The Senator also discussed his recent efforts to push back against Chinese aggression by calling for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate two Chinese owned stock applications, and his bill to prohibit China from purchasing land in the United States. Excerpts from Senator Tuberville’s remarks can be found here or below. ON U.S. PRIORITIES AS CHINA FIRES MISSILES AROUND TAIWAN:“The Democrats and Joe Biden, the Biden administration, need to wake up, Jackie, about the belligerence of China.”“Our military is the strength of this country and we’re looking the other way.”“Chuck Schumer’s got the NDAA—the military budget that we just finished in the Armed Services Committee, which I’m on—is sitting on his desk…”ON THE NEED FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN TO STAND UP TO CHINA:“They didn’t know how President Trump was going to react because he understood leading from in front, not from behind. President Biden is always making a weak decision and it started with Afghanistan, we all know that. What a debacle that was —maybe the worst in my lifetime—of treating our military and our country, in a way that we may not ever get over.”“I’ve been to Taiwan. I went there six, seven months ago with three or four other Senators. Same thing happened to us. We were called dirty rats by the Chinese and they called our offices and told us not to go.”“This is a home game for China. They’re very close to it. We are thousands of miles away from the Indo-Pacific in terms of moving our armaments in that direction…We’re trying to make plans being on the Armed Services Committee, but it is a huge problem with them [China] being right there at Taiwan.”“Joe Biden has to be the guy to let China know—do not cross this line. He said it, once, he tried to back off of it, but we got to keep pushing that narrative that we will stand up for Taiwan.”ON BIPARTISAN NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY:“I learned in my former profession of being a coach for 40 years, organization is a key to winning. We have no organization in terms of everybody being on the same page… we’ll always have, problems in terms of Democrats, Republicans and how we handle the economy and certain things. But when it comes to national defense, everybody has to be on the same page. We have to buy in – the Democrats with the Republicans.  On Armed Services Committee, now, that is the most bipartisan committee that I’ve seen up here. We work well together. We understand the problems, we understand what the military has to have to be successful.”“If we don’t unite as one, over a group that is well funded—China. They’re doing everything they possibly can to outrun us in terms of nuclear weapons, ships, armaments, in space.”ON TUBERVILLE’S EFFORTS TO PUSH BACK AGAINST CHINA:DeAngelis: “And I go back to your previous point, that Schumer isn’t making a move on defense spending at a time like this when they’re trying to push their spending bill through. That obviously is the priority right now… There’s a lot of issues when it comes to China and you are leading a call for an investigation into some of these stock trading apps, these Chinese based apps: Webull and Moomoo. They’ve got ties to the Chinese Communist party. We are constantly talking about, you know, intellectual property we’re talking about infringement with respect to data mining and information. Tell me a little bit about the work that you’re doing.”Tuberville: “Everything that we’re doing here China knows, and it’s a huge national security problem… We’ve got to control what we have within our country. They owned, 10 years ago, 10,000 acres of farmland in this country. I’m talking about foreign adversaries, China being one of them. Today, they own close to 350,000 acres of farmland here in our country and if we don’t stop that, we’re going to have huge problems agriculturally and also being able to control what we do in imports and exports.”DeAngelis: “Yeah, we have been reporting on those purchases and it is just mind-boggling to think that they are allowed to buy farmland here.”Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

To build consensus around a potential solution, the Senators are soliciting input from a broad range of stakeholders, including university athletic directors, administrators, associations, and student-athlete groups prior to releasing NIL-related legislation. The Senators intend to use the feedback to guide discussions on a legislative path forward. “The lack of meaningful leadership and a lack of clarity in this area resulting from Alston means that the U.S. Congress must act to set clear ground rules for student-athletes and institutions alike.

China’s Ministry of Agriculture claims the country had over 1,300 agricultural, forestry, and fisheries enterprises with registered overseas investments of $26 billion, at the end of 2016. While Chinese entities held slightly less than one percent of all foreign-held acres in the U.S. in 2020, the volume of their holdings increased dramatically over the last decade. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that Chinese investors’ holdings of U.S. agricultural land surged from 13,720 acres in 2010 to 352,140 acres in 2020. Chinese investments in U.S. agricultural may provide the CCP with undue leverage over U.S. supply chains and access to sensitive information critical to U.S. national security. Foreign investors currently hold interest in nearly 37.6 million acres of agricultural land in the U.S.—an area larger than the state of Iowa. Alabama retains the 3rd-highest amount of foreign-owned agricultural land in the United States, at approximately 1.8 million acres.As a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, Senator Tuberville has fought to protect America’s agriculture industry from improper foreign investment. He introduced the Foreign Adversary Risk Management (FARM) Act to bolster the U.S. agriculture industry’s role on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the governmental body that oversees the vetting process of foreign investment and acquisition of American companies.Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

The letter comes in response to the agency’s proposed rule requiring all state fisheries data to be converted into a single federal system, ultimately resulting in a less accurate assessment of red snapper limits.“We urge you to rethink this proposed rule and work with us and our state managers to implement common sense solutions that will untangle this regulatory knot while setting a strong precedent for how state and federal management can work together to more effectively and sustainably manage recreational fisheries,” the members wrote. “We must express our frustration when we see NMFS, not only failing to do their part, but preventing us in the Gulf from doing ours.”A copy of the letter can be found here.Other signers include U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-MS), Richard Shelby, (R-AL), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), John Kennedy (R-LA), and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), as well as U.S. Representatives Garret Graves (R-LA-06), Bennie Thompson (D-MS-02), Robert Aderholt (R-AL-04), Mike Rogers (R-AL-03), Vern Buchanan (R-FL-16), Rob Wittman (R-VA-01), Steve Scalise (R-LA-01), Mo Brooks (R-AL-05), Steven Palazzo (R-MS-04), Austin Scott (R-GA-08), Daniel Webster (R-FL-11), Randy Weber (R-TX-14), Brian Babin (R-TX-36), Buddy Carter (R-GA-01), Bruce Westerman (R-AR-04), Trent Kelly (R-MS-01), Neal Dunn (R-FL-02), Clay Higgins (R-LA-03), Mike Johnson (R-LA-04), Matt Gaetz (R-FL-01), Michael Guest (R-MS-03), Greg Steube (R-FL-17), Gary Palmer (R-AL-06), Cliff Bentz (R-OR-02), Jerry Carl (R-AL-01), Barry Moore (R-AL-02), Byron Donalds (R-FL-19), Carlos Gimenez (R-FL-26), Julia Letlow (R-LA-05), Troy Carter (D-LA-02), and Mayra Flores (R-TX-34).BACKGROUND:Throughout red snapper season, the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Management Council estimates quotas and annual catch targets by using state data. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Management and Conservation Act requires that the best available data be used for decision-making and the Modern Fish Act requires NMFS to coordinate with states to get the best available data. However, the Great Red Snapper Count’s (an independent, effective study by Congress providing higher-quality fisheries data) data regarding fishing limits showed the overfishing limit should increase, but the NMFS decreased the limit because the agency is not using the best available data for decision making or coordinating with the states. In order for our regulations to be accurate, states must have management flexibility for the best sustainable fishing opportunities.Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

In a letter to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler, Senator Tuberville and his colleagues Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX), Mike Braun (R-IN), Rick Scott (R-FL), and Roger Marshall (R-KS) highlight concerns over these firms’ data sharing practices and ties to the CCP – both of which could put U.S. investors at risk.“Instead of pursuing partisan rulemakings like the SEC’s recent climate disclosure proposal, which will do nothing to protect investors, we urge you to focus Commission resources on fully implementing the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and ensuring that U.S. investors are not put at risk by using broker-dealers owned by Chinese companies.

It recently came to our attention that both of these firms are owned by Chinese companies and that their parent companies have close ties to Chinese telecom giants Xiaomi and Tencent, which have reportedly aided the Chinese Communist Party in its efforts to surveil and suppress its citizens. According to Webull’s own CEO, “Webull is both a U.S. and Chinese company,” and Webull’s “technology team is based in Hunan, China, while [its] customer-facing and brokerage operations are in New York City.”[i] In fact, Webull is wholly-owned by Chinese holding company Hunan Fumi Information Technology Company (“Fumi Technology”).[ii] Fumi Technology was “incubated by mobile phone behemoth Xiaomi,”[iii] and Xiaomi is reportedly the largest institutional shareholder of Fumi Technology (and thus Webull).[iv] Xiaomi was among the companies temporarily included on the military blacklist by the U.S. Department of Defense in 2021 as a result of its ties to the Chinese government.[v]Moomoo is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chinese technology company Futu Holdings, Ltd.[vi]  Futu Holdings is one of the Chinese issuers whose auditor the PCAOB cannot inspect and which will soon be delisted from U.S. exchanges.[vii] Futu Holdings also has close ties to the Chinese technology company, Tencent. Tencent is the largest institutional shareholder of Futu Holdings, and three of Futu Holdings’s five directors have worked at or currently work at Tencent, including Leaf Hua Li, the founder, chairman, and CEO of Futu Holdings.[viii] According to media reports, Tencent has actively assisted the Chinese Communist Party in its efforts to spy on its people and operate its authoritarian regime.[ix] Webull and Moomoo collect highly sensitive personal information from their U.S. customers, including Social Security numbers, mailing addresses, and financial account data. We find it deeply concerning that the SEC and FINRA allow these companies to operate as registered broker-dealers in the United States and to freely collect and store personally identifiable information for millions of U.S. citizens. Accordingly, we request that the SEC open a formal investigation into the operations of both Webull and Moomoo to identify any activities or business practices that could put their U.S. customers at risk. Instead of pursuing partisan rulemakings like the SEC’s recent climate disclosure proposal, which will do nothing to protect investors, we urge you to focus Commission resources on fully implementing the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and ensuring that U.S. investors are not put at risk by using broker-dealers owned by Chinese companies.

https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-op-ed-on-al-com-biden-administration-is-pushing-women-to-the-sidelines/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) authored the following op-ed on AL.com voicing opposition to the U.S. Department of Education’s proposed rule that expands the definition of  “sex” to include “gender identity.” As a former coach, Senator Tuberville has been vocal about keeping Title IX protections in place to ensure biological males are not allowed to compete in women’s sports.  Biden Administration is Pushing Women to the SidelinesU.S. Senator Tommy TubervilleAL.comJuly 27, 2022LINKI recently gathered with a few of my colleagues to mark the 50th Anniversary of Title IX and celebrate its impact on women’s sports. We took turns sharing our personal stories and experiences with Title IX. I shared my story about coaching high school girls’ basketball just a few years after the enactment of Title IX and witnessing the positive impact it had on the young ladies on my team. Senator Lummis from Wyoming talked about how her daughter had opportunities in sports because of Title IX that the Senator herself didn’t have growing up. Senator Blackburn from Tennessee shared the dreams of young women across her state who practice their entire lives for the opportunity to be part of the legendary Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball team.Since 1972, millions of female athletes have benefitted from the fair and level playing field that Title IX protections provide. Title IX’s 37 words gave women the same access to athletic funding, scholarships, and facilities that were long afforded to their male counterparts. Before its enactment, female athletics received less than 2 percent of college athletic budgets — and athletic scholarships for women were virtually nonexistent. But fifty years later, 43 percent of high school girls participate in competitive sports, and female participation at the college level has risen by more than 600 percent. This participation is displayed on the world stage as well. Just this year, the United States Olympic team included 108 women—the most to represent any nation in the history of the Winter Olympics, continuing a record-breaking streak of female athlete participation for our country that began in 1984.But now, the Biden administration is attempting to rewind the clock to a time before Title IX. The U.S. Department of Education recently published a proposed rule to change how Title IX is implemented, expanding the definition of “sex” to include “gender identity.” This means that any institution receiving federal funds would be forced to allow a biological male identifying as a female to compete in women’s sports.This proposed rule will shatter Title IX’s protections for female athletes. It is a scientific fact that biological males have physiological advantages over females, averaging 40-50 percent greater upper body strength, 20-40 percent greater lower body strength, and 12 pounds more muscle mass than age-matched female counterparts at any given body weight. A recent study confirmed that biological males who undergo transition treatments still retain a competitive edge over women. Even the International Swimming Federation (FINA) realized the insanity of allowing biological males in women’s sports, taking measures earlier this year that would ban most biological males from female swimming competitions.Biological males have won 28 women’s sports titles since 2003—and under the Biden administration’s new proposed rule, this number will only increase. Volleyball courts, swimming pools, and softball fields at high schools and colleges across the country are filled with young women who practice long hours to be able to fairly compete. They deserve the opportunity to compete for first place—not second, third, and fourth.The intent of Title IX was to provide the same playing field to female athletes as their male counterparts—not push them to the sidelines. Anything less than a level playing field is a total betrayal of our female athletes.That is why I called for the U.S. Senate to vote on and pass the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, which would ensure Title IX protections only recognize gender at birth and prohibit federal funding for institutions that allow biological males to compete in women’s athletics. Unfortunately, my Democratic colleagues refused to protect female athletes and blocked the bill from consideration.While the Biden administration is attempting to destroy women’s sports, I will continue to oppose this terrible decision. The public comment period for this rule is now open, and the Biden administration is required to respond to every comment they receive. If you’re concerned about protecting the future of women’s sports, I hope you will join me in voicing your opposition to this disastrous rule so that our daughters, granddaughters, nieces, sisters, and female athletic icons continue to thrive from fair athletic competition.Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-on-space-command-environmental-impact-study/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON —U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) made the following statement after the U.S. Air Force released the results of their draft Environmental Impact Study with a finding of “no significant impact” for basing U.S. Space Command (SPACECOM) at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama:“This is a welcomed result, but it’s not surprising. Redstone Arsenal’s existing federal footprint and Huntsville’s robust defense industry make this area the ideal home for Space Command. I look forward to the conclusion of the comment period and doing what I can to support Space Command as it makes Huntsville its new home.”BACKGROUND: In 2020, the U.S. Air Force conducted an extensive search for the best location for the new home of U.S. Space Command (SPACECOM), reviewing objective criteria like infrastructure, costs, mission capability, and the quality of the local community. Sixty-six different locations in twenty-six states were evaluated, and in the end, Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama ranked number one.At the request of other lawmakers, the U.S. Department of Defense Inspector General (DoD IG) and the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) both conducted investigations into U.S. Air Force’s site selection process for SPACECOM headquarters. Following the release of the IG’s report, which concluded that the U.S. Air Force followed a legal, fair, and logical process, Senator Tuberville praised the findings of the report as “rock solid.” The IG report said, in part, “Overall, we determined that the 2020 Basing Action directed by the SECDEF complied with Federal Law and DoD policy and that the Basing Action process was reasonable.” After his office was briefed on the GAO report, which had similar findings to the IG report, Senator Tuberville issued a video statement in which he said, “it’s time to fully embrace the Air Force’s decision and move forward together. The U.S. Air Force needs and deserves our full support.”In recent months, Senator Tuberville has led the charge in the U.S. Senate to rally his colleagues around the U.S. Air Force’s decision to base SPACECOM headquarters at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama. After both reports were released, Senator Tuberville sent a letter to his colleagues outlining the findings and how politically-motivated delays negatively impact the nation’s readiness.In June 2022, as the Senate Armed Services Committee considered the Senate version of Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (FY23 NDAA), Senator Tuberville successfully thwarted an attempt to delay and potentially reverse the process of locating SPACECOM at Redstone Arsenal. The senator led a bipartisan group of senators to defeat an amendment that would have required another lengthy study of the U.S. Air Force’s basing decision. This follows the remarks of General James H. Dickinson, Commander of U.S. Space Command, who debunked the idea that moving Space Command would delay readiness during a March 8, 2022, Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. In his testimony, General Dickinson assured the committee that Space Command would be fully operational in two to three years, regardless of where it is ultimately located.Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"
https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-colleagues-call-on-ag-garland-to-stop-sending-federal-funds-to-partisan-organizations/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON —U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and U.S. Representative Lance Gooden (R-TX-05) led 33 colleagues in a bicameral letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland stating their opposition to the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) return to the Obama-era practice of directing legal settlements to partisan, non-victim organizations. Senate signatories of the letter include Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mike Lee (R-UT), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Steve Daines (R-MT), Rick Scott (R-FL), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Roger Marshall (R-KS), and Ted Cruz (R-TX).“The Biden administration is attempting to take a page from the Obama playbook to funnel money to its political allies by requiring federal defendants to pay a portion of their settlement funds to outside activist groups. This corrupt practice is a prime example of executive overreach. It is Congress’s job to direct federal funds and federal bureaucrats should not be in the business of picking winners and losers.  Federal settlement funds should go to the victims first and then to the U.S. Treasury. I will continue to push for government accountability and transparency at all levels of the federal government,” said Senator Tuberville.“President Biden knows Republicans are set to regain control of the House next year and is determined to circumvent the Constitutional role of Congress to fund his radical agenda,” said Representative Gooden. “Settlement agreement payments should go to the victims, not fund Democrats’ partisan pet projects.”The letter is written in response to the public comment period for the DOJ’s interim final rule  published on May 10, 2022. The rule seeks to reverse regulations that protected victim compensation, restored confidence in the judicial process, and respected congressional spending power. If published as a final rule, this policy would mark the return of an Obama-era DOJ practice that allowed settling parties in a federal dispute to reduce their punishment by making “donations” to special interest groups of the DOJ’s choosing, cultivating an environment ripe for corruption and abuse.Read the full text of the letter HERE. BACKGROUND: Senator Tuberville previously introduced the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act to ensure when the federal government settles a lawsuit, settlement funds will go only to the victims, injured parties in the dispute, or the U.S. Treasury. The bill would prohibit settling parties in a federal dispute from reducing their punishments by making “donations” to outside organizations. Representative Gooden introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.Watch Senator Tuberville speak about the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act. Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

Inflation’s out of control.”“It’s been growing for the last two years ever since he [Biden] took office.”“Basically, if you compare it to being a football team, it’d be like playing without an offensive line, what we’re doing, by not having fossil fuels. You can’t do it. It’s impossible to have a strong and growing economy without energy.”“Everything [in the Biden administration] is about throwing money at something, ‘that’ll fix it,’ but obviously it makes things worse.”ON THE SUCCESS OF TITLE IX IN WOMEN’S ATHLETICS:“We should be having a huge celebration up here today because it is really one of the few things… that’s worked in the Capitol here in the last 50 years.”“It made it a level playing field for everybody, and it has been a huge success.”“I coached women’s basketball back when I first started in high school coaching, and I saw the emergence of it [Title IX] right off the bat. But now, Joe Biden is getting ready to make proposals that’s going to bring it to its knees.”“Title IX opened up leadership skills and being able to play and learn how to win and lose for women for the last 50 years and look you’ve got senators up here that they will tell you that women’s sports helped become a senator. It helped them to come out of their shell, understand how to work with other people…so it’s been a great success.”Thursday, June 23rd was the 50th anniversary of the enactment of Title IX. Senator Tuberville’s comments came as the Biden administration announced its proposed rule to expand the definition of “sex” to include gender identity, which would require institutions that receive federal funds to allow biological males to compete in women’s sports and undo Title IX’s five decades of success for female athletes.Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-statement-on-supreme-courts-final-opinion-in-dobbs-case/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON —U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) today released the following statement after the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its final opinion in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case:“The Supreme Court decision is a victory for life and for Alabamians, like myself, who believe in the protection of the unborn,” said Senator Tuberville. “As a Christian, I believe life begins at conception, and that’s why I signed a ‘friend of the court’ brief in support of this law. This case reignited a discussion on the important role of the American family in our country and the need to protect life at every stage. I hope we don’t let this passion stop here, and we continue to discuss how we can protect the unborn and help vulnerable mothers.”“After months of a disgraceful public pressure campaign and failed efforts from Democrats to force their extreme and unpopular abortion-on-demand agenda on the American people, I’m glad the Court didn’t bow to outside pressure and maintained their judicial independence.”Senator Tuberville has previously spoken about the Mississippi law at the center of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case and how the Court’s ruling will impact pro-Life policies. Video footage of Senator Tuberville’s remarks can be found here.BACKGROUND:Senator Tuberville continues to champion pro-Life values by taking action to protect the God-given rights of the unborn. A few examples of these actions include supporting the sanctity of life by signing on to a friend of the court brief in support of the Mississippi law; supporting the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, which would prohibit the use of federal funds for abortion or health coverage that includes abortion; and joining his colleagues in cosponsoring the Life at Conception Act, which would declare that unborn children are persons under the 14th Amendment.The U.S. Supreme Court’s majority opinion on the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization upholds the Mississippi state law and overturns Roe v. Wade. Overturning Roe v. Wade returns the power to individual states to make their own laws regarding limitations on abortion. At the center of the Dobbs case was a Mississippi state law that prohibits abortions after fifteen weeks except in a medical emergency and in cases of “severe fetal abnormality.” Under Roe, pre-viability abortion bans like this one were considered unconstitutional. This means that federal law prevented any state from seeking to stop abortions before a baby is viable, unless the mother’s life or health is in danger. However, since Roe was decided in 1973, the definition of viability changed due to medical and scientific advances. We now know that unborn children have arms, legs, and fully developed hearts at fifteen weeks.  On May 2nd, a draft U.S. Supreme Court opinion on the Mississippi abortion case was leaked to the press. Almost immediately, Senate Democrats took the opportunity to attack the Court and individual justices, demonstrating a complete lack of respect for the Court’s judicial independence. Senator Tuberville spoke out about Democrats weaponizing the leak, which runs counter to America’s core values. Soon thereafter, Senate Democrats demanded a vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act, legislation that would allow for late-term and sex-selective abortions, and eliminate longstanding protections for religiously affiliated health care providers; but it failed by a vote of 49 to 51. As tensions continued to mount following the leaked draft opinion, Senator Tuberville joined with his colleagues to pass the Police Parity Act to provide Supreme Court Justices with increased security in response to violent threats and murder attempts.The United States’ current position on abortion does not reflect international mainstream standards. The United States is 1 of 7 nations, including China and North Korea, that allow for abortion on demand beyond the point babies can feel pain. 47 out of 50 European nations limit abortion at 15 weeks or earlier. Additionally, the majority of Americans support pro-life protections. When asked, 71% of Americans support significant limits on abortion and 80% of Americans believe that third trimester abortions should be illegal.Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

As the Supreme Court rightly recognized this week, any attempts to interfere with law-abiding citizens’ Second Amendment rights should be subject to a high level of scrutiny. I carefully considered this bill, and ultimately, I believe it fell short of ensuring protection of our Constitutional second amendment rights. While I appreciate that the bill includes provisions that focus on mental health, I have serious concerns over how states could implement red flag laws without appropriate due process protections, and I am disappointed with the lack of direct funding to safeguard our schools. I would have welcomed the opportunity to thoughtfully address these concerns, but we were given about an hour to review the bill before we were asked to take the first vote, and there was no amendment process to improve the bill once it was on the floor. For these reasons, I could not support this bill.”Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

It’s up to us to preserve this fairness.’WASHINGTON — Today, on the 50th Anniversary of Title IX’s enactment,U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) led a group of his colleagues in recognizing the impact of Title IX on women’s sports. Passed as part of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, Title IX provided female athletes equal access to funding, facilities, and athletic scholarships as their male counterparts. The press conference comes on the heels of an announcement by the Biden administration this morning that the Department of Education is moving forward with a proposed rule to expand the definition of “sex” to include gender identity, which would force institutions to allow biological males to compete in women’s sports and undo Title IX’s five decades of success for female athletes. Senator Tuberville, a former coach, was joined by U.S. Senators Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), and Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS), who is a physician.Excerpts from the Senator’s press conference remarks can be found below, and his full remarks can be found here.“Since 1972, female participation in sports in college and scholarships has risen 600 percent.”“Young girls were given the opportunity to earn [athletic] scholarships through hard work and dedication.”“Sports can transform lives -I’ve seen it many, many times.”“Today, [on] the 50th anniversary of Title IX, we reflect on its impact…But, as we learned just this morning, the Biden administration is threatening to undo Title IX’s progress in women’s sports… Their proposed rule would expand Title IX’s definition of sex—not male and female—but it would include ‘gender identity.’”“Democrats, basically, are forcing politics onto the playing field. Allowing athletes to self-identify into a gender category erodes the gains that women have made over the past 50 years, and it ignores the biological differences between male and female athletes. That’s because biological males who have gone through puberty are stronger, bigger, and faster.”“In the last four years, biological males in women’s sports have won 22 championships.”“How can you give a post-game, locker room speech, of a half-time speech, to a young lady knowing that she’s not competing to win, she’s competing for second?”“This is about fairness. Title IX sent the message to female athletes everywhere: you can compete, and you can win. It’s up to us to preserve this fairness.”“So, in the light of what the Biden Administration just announced, in a few minutes I’ll be calling up the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act on the floor in a live UC. We will see if Democrats will stand with me to protect women’s rights.”Senator Tuberville thencalled up the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act for a vote on the Senate floor. Democrats blocked the bill from consideration. WATCH the Senator’s floor remarks.BACKGROUND:Senator Tuberville spent four decades in education as an educator and coach. He began his career by coaching high school girls’ basketball shortly after the enactment of Title IX. As a former coach who has witnessed the impact of Title IX firsthand, he has taken action in the U.S. Senate to ensure female athletes continue to have the access to the fair and level playing field provided by Title IX.Last year, Senator Tuberville introduced an amendment to the federal budget that would prohibit educational institutions from receiving federal funding if they allow biological males to compete in women’s sports. He also participated in conversations with former female athletes, wrote about the importance of preserving Title IX protections, spoke about the issue numerous times in the U.S. Senate, and warned the Biden administration about the pact of undoing five decades of Title IX success.Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"
https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-champions-alabamas-defense-priorities-as-ndaa-passes-committee/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) released the following statement after the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act  (FY23 NDAA) was reported out of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC). During the committee’s markup process, Senator Tuberville championed Alabama’s defense priorities and offered amendments that focused on strategic risk-taking, resources to counter Chinese aggression, and enhancing lethality.“I started this year’s NDAA process by identifying my top priorities, three of which were Space Command, strengthening U.S. presence in the Indo-Pacific, and enhancing lethality,” said Senator Tuberville.  “To that end, I pushed back against – and defeated – a counterproductive amendment to delay and potentially reverse the process of permanently establishing U.S. Space Command headquarters at Redstone Arsenal. To preserve a free and open Indo-Pacific, I continued my practice of seeing to it that our top commander in the region got his number one request met by the committee.  Above all, the primary mission of our military is to protect and defend our country – we deter aggression by being prepared. I am determined to see us enhance the lethality of our military and focus on building a fighting force – not a woke, green military. This NDAA positions our men and women in uniform to do what they do best: defend America’s values at home and abroad.”The top Republican on the Committee, SASC Ranking Member Jim Inhofe (R-OK) said, “I am grateful to Sen. Tuberville for his contributions to the Senate Armed Services Committee so far this year. He’s kept his eye on the ball: making sure our military has the personnel, posture, equipment, and strategy needed to deter and, if necessary, defeat our adversaries, especially China. He’s also been a fierce advocate for Alabama’s unique and vital contributions to our national defense, and this year’s National Defense Authorization Act is better for it.”BACKGROUND:The National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, outlines our military’s spending and provides guidance on defense policy and funding priorities. For over six decades, members of the Senate Armed Services Committee have worked in a bipartisan manner to produce this annual defense spending blueprint.The FY23 NDAA increases the overall topline spending number by $45 billion over President Biden’s dangerously inadequate defense budget. Staying competitive with the private sector, the NDAA provides for a 4.6% pay raise for our military, and provides additional hiring authorities and incentives in key sectors including cybersecurity, advanced technology, and space personnel. Additionally, FY23 NDAA grows the U.S. Navy, which is especially important in the face of China’s rapid expansion of its navy and ensures the Department of Defense has the hard power and infrastructure to maximize readiness and lethality now and in the future. A summary of the FY23 NDAA priorities can be found here. In his second year on the committee, Senator Tuberville secured significant wins for Alabama’s defense community. Senator Tuberville began the FY23 NDAA cycle in February 2022 by hosting a virtual meeting with Alabama community leaders, advocacy groups, and industry stakeholders to share his priorities and how the process would work. He also led his colleagues from the Alabama delegation in a defense staffer meeting to ensure consistency in priorities. Senator Tuberville’s defense team held more than 100 meetings to consider various programs and policies in preparation for the FY23 NDAA markups. Senator Tuberville’s priorities included in the FY23 NDAA are below.Keeping SPACECOM at Redstone Arsenal in HuntsvilleSenator Tuberville successfully thwarted an attempt to delay and potentially reverse the process of locating U.S. Space Command (SPACECOM) headquarters at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville. Senator Tuberville led a bipartisan group of senators to defeat an amendment that would have required another lengthy study of the Air Force’s basing decision. In 2020, the Air Force conducted a lengthy fact-based review of potential locations for the headquarters that resulted in the January 2021 announcement that Redstone was the preferred location. That decision was the subject of independent investigations by both the Government Accountability Office and the Department of Defense’s Inspector General, both of which found the selection of Redstone to be fair, logical, and fact-based.Preserving Uranium 233 and Promoting Efficient, Clean EnergySenator Tuberville secured a provision that requires the Department of Defense to study uranium 233 (U-233) and the potential of a thorium cycle to fuel military bases as well as space propulsion and power. Senator Tuberville’s bill requires the Secretary of Defense to brief congressional defense committees no later than March 31, 2023, on the uses of U-233 and thorium-based nuclear fuel cycle by the U.S., as well as the progress our adversaries have made in this field. Senator Tuberville has been a leader on this issue, introducing legislation to prevent the destruction of U-233, a critical element used to produce efficient and clean energy.

The proposed rule would require publicly-traded companies to include certain climate-related disclosures in their registration statements and periodic reports, imposing complex and burdensome greenhouse gas reporting requirements on all entities within a company’s value chain, including farmers and ranchers who fall outside of the SEC’s congressionally-provided authority.“The SEC’s congressionally-mandated mission is to protect investors; foster fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation,” the senators wrote. “However, this proposed rule moves well beyond the SEC’s traditional regulatory authority by mandating climate change reporting requirements that will not only regulate publicly traded companies, but will impact every company in the value chain. Should the SEC move forward with this rule, it would be granted unprecedented jurisdiction over America’s farms and ranches, creating an impractical regulatory burden for thousands of businesses outside of the scope of the SEC’s purview, including our nation’s farmers and ranchers,” they continued.The full text of the letter can be found here. Other signers include U.S. Senators John Hoeven (R-ND), Tim Scott (R-SC), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Roger Marshall (R-KS), James Risch (R-ID), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Steve Daines (R-MT), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Richard Burr (R-NC), Ted Cruz (R-TX), John Barrasso (R-WY), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Rick Scott (R-FL), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), John Kennedy (R-LA), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Mike Braun (R-IN), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Joni Ernst (R-IA), James Lankford (R-OK), John Cornyn (R-TX), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Lindsay Graham (R-SC), John Thune (R-SD), Todd Young (R-Ind.), John Boozman (R-AR) and Josh Hawley (R-MO). Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees. ###"
https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-on-biden-administrations-upcoming-title-ix-proposed-rule/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON – Ahead of the 50th anniversary of Title IX, U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) today delivered a speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate recognizing the incredible impact of the law in advancing women’s athletics. Senator Tuberville also reiterated his call for the Biden administration to rethink their proposed rule that, among other things, would require schools to allow biological males to compete in female sports.Excerpts from the Senator’s speech can be found below, and his remarks can be viewed here.“As the 50th anniversary of Title IX approaches at the end of this month, we should be celebrating the female athletes who were given the opportunity to win first place, to learn the life lessons sports teaches each individual, and to overcome obstacles and reach their God-given potential.”“We should be asking ourselves how can we preserve Title IX so female athletes 50 years from now can experience the same euphoric feeling of a hard work and hard-earned victory. But unfortunately, with the Biden administration’s proposal [over] the next few weeks, we will lose Title IX protections for female athletes as we know it.”“Later this month, it is expected that President Biden’s Department of Education will publish a proposed rule to change Title IX to align more with the administration’s progressive agenda. These proposed changes would require schools to allow biological males to compete in women’s sports.”“I plan to continue leading efforts against this misguided policy to ensure no federal action will negatively impact female athletes. Recently, I have spoken with numerous female athletes who were able to compete – and win – because of Title IX. Additionally, I introduced an amendment to prohibit federal funding to schools that allow biological males to compete in women’s sports. I have also repeatedly called for the Senate to pass the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, legislation I helped introduce that would ensure the definition of ‘sex’ in Title IX is based ‘solely on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth’ and prohibit federal funding to institutions that do not uphold that definition.”“Allowing biological males to compete in women’s sports will set women’s rights back 50 years, to a time before Title IX. It will discourage young girls from entering the court, jumping in the pool, or walking onto the field because they will know they have to compete with the deck stacked against. They can only hope to win second place at best.”“There is really no pre-game speech or halftime talk you can give to a women or a girl who feels like they aren’t competing on a fair playing field like 50 years ago.

https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-47-senators-will-vote-to-block-taxpayer-funding-for-abortion/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON —U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) joined 46 other pro-life senators to send a unified message to Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer pledging that they will vote to block any bill that would undermine the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits taxpayer funding for abortion, or any other pro-life protections.“We write to express our unwavering support for the Hyde Amendment and all other longstanding pro-life protections. For more than 45 years, the Hyde Amendment has ensured that taxpayer dollars are not used to fund abortions, saving the lives of nearly 2.5 million preborn children. As you know, the Hyde Amendment is supported by both a substantial majority of the American public and a bipartisan majority of sitting United States Senators, and was most recently signed into law by President Biden in Public Law 117-103,” the Senators wrote.The Senators continue, “On February 5, 2021, we wrote to you that ‘[w]e are committed to vote against the advancement of any legislation that would eliminate or weaken the Hyde Amendment or any other current-law pro-life protections, or otherwise undermine existing Federal pro-life policy.’ We firmly renew this commitment for FY 2023.”The Senators conclude, “We urge you to start where we finished by making a baseline commitment to maintain the same pro-life protections that were included in Public Law 117-103, and to eschew any taxpayer-funded giveaways that benefit the multi-billion-dollar abortion industry.”Read the full letter here.This letter is endorsed by Susan B.

https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-announces-win-for-u-s-national-security-and-federal-retirement-savers/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesAt Tuberville’s urging, FRTIB nominees clarify policy for TSP investment in China-based companies WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), along with U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Tom Cotton (R-AR), today received a response to their April 12th letter to President Biden’s four nominees to the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) clarifying that, if confirmed, the board nominees would not permit Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) funds to be invested in Chinese companies.Senator Tuberville has repeatedly pressed the FRTIB to clarify its position on TSP investment in China, citing national security concerns over the possibility that TSP’s international investment portfolio would include Chinese securities. As a result of this clarification from the FRTIB nominees, Senator Tuberville will release the hold, a procedural maneuver to prevent confirmation without a vote by the full Senate, he placed on all four of President Biden’s nominees to the FRTIB earlier this year.The TSP is a 401(k)-style investment fund managed by the FRTIB. It is over $700 billion dollars in size and is utilized by 6,000,000 members of our nation’s military and federal civilian workforce. In May of 2021, Senator Tuberville introduced legislation to prohibit investment of TSP funds in any entity based in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Senator Tuberville also wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal about the national security risk investment in China-based entities poses for the United States, he spoke about the issue on the floor of the Senate and in an interview on Fox Business.In part, the letter from President Biden’s nominees to lead the FRTIB reads, “We fully support the position of the acting Chair and would be highly skeptical of future recommendations to track this or any index that invests in Chinese companies…we would not permit TSP funds to invest in Chinese companies knowing TSP participant and beneficiary assets could be subject to fraud, financial irregularities or other risks…we agree it is unfitting for Americans to invest in companies from China or elsewhere that undermine U.S. national security.”In response to the clarity provided by President Biden’s nominees to the FRTIB, Senator Tuberville issued the following statement: “This is a big win for our military and federal civilian employees. The Trump administration halted the FRTIB’s plans to invest TSP funds in China, and Senator Rubio, Senator Cotton, and I have fought to ensure the Trump-era ban stays in place. Investing in Chinese companies is a financial risk to Americans that also undermines our national security. I am glad to hear that President Biden’s nominees to the FRTIB agree.”  The full text of the letter President Biden’s nominees to the FRTIB sent Senators Tuberville, Rubio, and Cotton can be foundhere and below. June 2, 2022Dear Senators Rubio, Tuberville, and Cotton:Thank you for your April 2022 letter and your interest in protecting the participants and beneficiaries of the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). We are honored President Biden nominated us to serve as members of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB), where we would serve as fiduciaries of the TSP, and we appreciate the strong bi-partisan support for our nominations from the members of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. We look forward to working with you, your offices, the Committee members and other members of Congress to ensure TSP participants and beneficiaries have the investment opportunities, protections and resources needed to retire with dignity.In your letter, you explained you have serious concerns regarding potential TSP fund exposure to China-based companies. As fellow Americans, we share your concerns about investing in Chinese companies and are writing now to address these concerns. As noted in your letter, some time ago, FRTIB consultants recommended FRTIB consider moving to Morgan Stanley’s MSCI All Country World ex-US Investable Market Index (ACWI ex-US IMI) as the basis for the TSP I Fund. Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle registered objections to this recommendation because the ACWI ex-US IMI invests in China-based companies. FRTIB did not make that change and FRTIB’s acting Chair has stated in a recent letter to Senator Tuberville there are no current plans to do so. We fully support the position of the acting Chair and would be highly skeptical of future recommendations to track this or any index that invests in Chinese companies, consistent with our fiduciary and statutory duties. You also expressed concern with TSP funds investing in any security that is listed on an exchange in a jurisdiction in which the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) cannot conduct audits and investigations. We believe the PCAOB plays an important role in protecting the interests of investors and, if it is within our fiduciary duty, we would not allow TSP funds to invest in equities based in jurisdictions that do not offer the protections of the PCAOB.  As of now, as you know, China is the only country where the PCAOB is unwelcome, so we believe we would not permit TSP funds to invest in Chinese companies knowing TSP participant and beneficiary assets could be subject to fraud, financial irregularities or other risks. Finally, you also asked us to ensure that TSP funds do not invest in any Chinese firms that undermine U.S. national security. We agree it is unfitting for Americans to invest in companies from China or elsewhere that undermine U.S. national security. Congress provided the authority to the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to ban any American from making such investments.  We fully support OFAC’s ability to exercise its authority and we commit that any company banned by OFAC, whether based in China or elsewhere, would not be included in any TSP fund. Thank you, again, for your interest in the TSP and its participants and beneficiaries. We look forward to working with you and your staffs through this confirmation process and, if we are confirmed, as FRTIB members.Sincerely,Dana Bilyeu, Leona M. Bridges, Michael F.

https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-warns-secretary-cardona-against-weakening-title-ix-protections/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesOn 50-year anniversary of game changing law, Biden administration seeks to propose new Title IX regulation to further progressive agendaWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) today sent a letter to U.S. Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona warning about the irreversible damage that would be inflicted upon generations of female athletes should the Department follow through on its December 2021 announcement to propose a new Title IX regulation that would, among other things, require schools to allow biological males to compete in female sports. Senator Tuberville notes the hypocrisy of the Biden administration weakening Title IX protections for female athletes while the nation celebrates the 50-year anniversary of the revolutionary Title IX law.This letter is the latest push in a series of targeted actions from Senator Tuberville. These actions include discussions with female athletes who benefitted from Title IX protections, the introduction of an amendment to prohibit federal funding to schools that allow biological males to compete in women’s sports, and calls for the Senate to pass the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, legislation Senator Tuberville cosponsored which would, among other things, ensure the definition of “sex” in Title IX is based “solely on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth.” “It is my understanding that the Department of Education is currently considering a proposed regulation that would modify Title IX implementation to adhere to the progressive priorities of the Biden administration…Any such weakening of current Title IX protections would amount to a reversal of 50 years of progress for women and girls in sports and an offense to every woman who has ever benefited from the enactment of the law. Title IX has fostered generations of female athletes who would otherwise never have been afforded the same opportunities as their male counterparts,” wrote Senator Tuberville. Senator Tuberville concluded, “The entire country is watching while this Administration destroys opportunities for generations of women and girls at the behest of liberal extremism. This proposed policy reversal will affect how women and girls approach athletics from this point forward.” A copy of the letter can be found here and below.May 31, 2022Secretary Cardona,                 It is my understanding that the Department of Education is currently considering a proposed regulation that would modify Title IX implementation to adhere to the progressive priorities of the Biden administration. The Department has previously indicated that this effort would, among other things, require schools to allow biological males to compete in female sports. Any such weakening of current Title IX protections would amount to a reversal of 50 years of progress for women and girls in sports and an offense to every woman who has ever benefited from the enactment of the law. Title IX has fostered generations of female athletes who would otherwise never have been afforded the same opportunities as their male counterparts; yet this Administration seeks to tear down their achievements in an effort to further its own progressive agenda.  Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 codified that “no person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance…” The phrase “on the basis of sex” established equal treatment and funding for men and women’s sports under law. The law revolutionized athletics and created countless opportunities for female athletes. Since enactment of this critical legislation, girls’ participation in high school sports has grown from less than 300,000 to nearly 3.5 million.  Over the same time period, female participation in collegiate sports has risen by more than 600 percent. These numbers are not merely incidental; they are the direct results of the protections TitleIX has provided to women and girls. As we observe the 50-year anniversary of TitleIX, these statistics should be celebrated, not used as a reason to upend the statute in the name of social experimentation.Press reports indicate that your proposed regulation will allow biological males to compete in divisions that have been previously reserved only for females. This proposition has already received criticism from across the country. Twenty-one attorneys general have voiced opposition to this proposed regulation, as it forces radical changes concerning sexual orientation and gender identity policies on nearly every employer and school across the nation. So far, thirteen states have enacted bills that prohibit transgender athletes from competing in female athletics to guarantee a level playing field. I plan to lead efforts against this misguided policy to ensure no federal action will negatively impact female athletics and erode these long-standing protections for women and girls. The entire country is watching while this Administration destroys opportunities for generations of women and girls at the behest of liberal extremism. This proposed policy reversal will affect how women and girls approach athletics from this point forward. It will affect the decisions families make about what activities their children join. It will undermine the principle of “fairness” in all educational settings moving forward. This effort is bigger than a minority of progressive voices on the left, and I urge you to reconsider these monumental changes.  Sincerely, Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"
https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-honors-alabamas-fallen-soldiers-in-memorial-day-letter-to-dothan-eagle/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) authored the following letter to the Dothan Eagle honoring Alabama’s fallen heroes and their families for Memorial Day. In the letter, Senator Tuberville shares stories of Alabama’s Gold Star families, and encourages readers to remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice for freedom.In Recognition of our MilitaryU.S. Senator Tommy TubervilleDothan EagleMay 30, 2022LINKIn 1966, Private James Joshua Jr. of Gadsden, Alabama, left high school to become a United States Marine at the age of 18. He deployed, but never came home. His life was cut short when his company was attacked with mortars in Vietnam’s Quang Tri Province.You may have never heard of Private Joshua, or know the names of the millions of other men and women who gave their lives for our country, but every May, we observe Memorial Day in honor of our fallen soldiers. The names of some of our heroes may not be widely known, but are forever intertwined in the fabric of America’s story. These were ordinary men and women who had extraordinary courage and patriotism, and ultimately lost their lives defending the freedoms we hold dear as a nation. Many of Alabama’s sons and daughters are counted among these brave souls. The state of Alabama lost 2,500 soldiers during World War I, 5,114 soldiers during World War II, and hundreds of others in wars since. Growing up, we heard the Bible verse that ‘greater love has no man than laying down his life for his friend.’ But many of our service members didn’t give their lives for their “friends” – they gave their lives for millions of Americans they will never know, so that generations can enjoy the freedoms that our country affords. When our office had the opportunity to speak with some of Alabama’s families who have lost family members to war, you could feel the agony they experienced from losing a loved one too soon. Like Teresa from Huntsville, whose father was declared Missing in Action during the Vietnam War when she was only eight years old. She shared stories of the many days and sleepless nights that she and her family spent hoping for his return, and the heartbreak of growing up knowing that he wouldn’t be there to teach her how to ride a bike, meet her high school boyfriends, celebrate her graduation, or walk her down the aisle at her wedding. She is one of six children whose special events were marked by their father’s absence.Then there is Danny from Elba, whose son Jason was killed in Tallifar, Iraq, one night during a patrol when the enemy attacked his Humvee. Jason was a leader with a deep loyalty to his country. His love for country drove him to join the U.S. Army, where he climbed the ranks to become a sergeant. Danny shared that his son answered the call to join our nation’s military because he felt there was a need for brave men and women to willingly step up and defend America at all costs. Now, Danny drives the truck that once belonged to his son to cope with his grief. For fathers like Danny, ordinary possessions become treasures that keep their loved ones close once they’ve passed.For the Alabama families who know firsthand the high price of freedom, we honor your loved ones this Memorial Day. We know that for you, holidays, special occasions, and daily activities will never be the same. As we gather with friends and family this weekend, let us remember why we are able to gather freely. The cost of our freedom has been paid for by generations of brave men and women in our military who endured sleepless battlefields, tumultuous seas, and harsh deserts. Freedom is not free. Our servicemembers faced adversaries head-on to uphold our banner of liberty. Let us never forget the lives lost and the sacrifices made by the men and women who donned our nation’s uniform. Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs and Senate Armed Services Committees. During the month of May, Senator Tuberville is honoring the sacrifices made by current and former service members as part of Military Appreciation Month. A special ‘thank you’ to the families of the fallen who graciously shared their stories with us. ###"
https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-honors-alabamas-fallen-heroes-for-memorial-day/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) recognized five of Alabama’s fallen soldiers and their families in honor of Memorial Day. The stories shared are those of Officer Marsha Ratchford from Prichard, Sergeant Elbert Phillips from Huntsville, Sergeant Jason Jordan from Elba, Private James Joshua Jr. from Gadsden, and Private Thomas Stagg from Birmingham.Excerpts from the Senator’s remarks can be found below, and his complete remarks can be viewed here. “The first stanza of our National Anthem ends: ‘ O say does that star-spangled banner yet  wave o’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave?’ We sing this part as a triumphant declaration, but if you read the lyrics of the Star Spangled Banner, the sentence actually ends with a question mark. Francis Scott Key intended this line to be sung as a question rather than a statement. That’s fitting because while our freedom may [seem] concrete, hate and evil threaten the security of our freedom from one generation to the next.”“Over the years, our national anthem took on a feeling of confidence and assurance, rather than uncertainty. And that’s thanks to the millions of men and women who bravely answered the call to serve. Many soldiers lost their lives to give us the security we all enjoy, and the assurance we are proud of. That is what we keep in our hearts and on our minds as we honor the fallen on this Memorial Day.”“Throughout the course of our nation’s history, our freedom has been protected by those who stood toe to toe with hate and evil, endured sleepless nights on the battlefield, rough days at sea, harsh conditions in the desert, [and] years living in far corners of the globe, so that we as Americans can sleep peacefully in the comfort and security of our home.”“Sadly, some of our nation’s heroes never returned. My state of Alabama lost 2,500 soldiers during World War I, 5,114 soldiers during World War II, and hundreds and hundreds of others in wars since.”“Many of our fallen servicemembers had not yet reached the prime of their life. Some were still in high school when they answered the call to service. That is true for Private First Class James Joshua Jr. of Gadsden, Alabama, who left high school to become a United States Marine at the young age of 18.”“Colonel Leonard shared that his mother’s dying wish was for her little brother to be found and returned to Birmingham to be buried alongside her and their parents. Five years ago, Colonel Leonard saw his mother’s wish fulfilled.”“It is estimated more than 81,600 missing American soldiers are still missing since World War I…And some families are still searching for answers. Like Teresa Schmitt of Huntsville, Alabama, who was only eight years old when her father, U.S. Air Force Technical Sergeant Elbert Phillips’, airplane crashed in the MeKong River during the Vietnam War.”“Rodney’s story is another heartbreaking example of Gold Star children who faced a childhood they didn’t ask for, but were given as a result of the unthinkable sacrifices their loved ones made for freedom. Their courage is no doubt a testament to the brave parents who raised them.”“It is impossible to speak of Gold Star families without mentioning the parents who are robbed of the joy of seeing their children grow up and have families of their own. Danny Jordan, from Elba, Alabama, is one such Gold Star parent. Danny’s son, U.S. Army Sergeant Jason Jordan of the 101st Airborne Division, was killed in the Iraqi village of Tallifar on the night of July 20, 2003, when his Humvee was attacked by rocket-propelled grenades.”“These are the stories of Americans who gave their lives for freedom’s cause—mothers, brothers, sisters, and sons who became heroes to all of us… These heroes lived lives of impact, driven by a desire to serve their country at any cost. We tell their story to keep their memory alive and ensure their sacrifices are never, never forgotten.”“And as long as there are brave men and women like those I’ve mentioned today, we can continue to sing the national anthem, not with a question mark, but with a declaration that we are the ‘land of the free and the home of the brave.’ As Memorial Day approaches, I hope we will take the time to honor America’s fallen, along with the brave families who they left behind, and always remember that our freedoms were won by men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice.”INDIVIDUAL VIDEOS:Officer Marsha Ratchford-PrichardSergeant Elbert Phillips- HuntsvilleSergeant Jason Jordan- ElbaPrivate James Joshua Jr.-GadsdenPrivate Thomas Stagg- BirminghamSenator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs and Senate Armed Services Committees.

https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-colleagues-urge-president-biden-to-stand-up-for-american-companies-facing-aggression-from-mexican-government/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesBirmingham-based Vulcan Materials Company one of U.S. companies targeted by Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), along with Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Richard Shelby (R-AL), Rick Scott (R-FL), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and John Cornyn (R-TX) called on President Biden to take action against aggression from Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador toward U.S. companies with investments and operations in Mexico. The Mexican government recently presented orders for Birmingham-based Vulcan Materials Company to shut down quarrying and extraction operations on one of its three active mining parcels, despite Vulcan Materials Company owning the property and possessing all the necessary permits for lawful operation. In a speech on the floor of the United States Senate, Senator Tuberville discussed how the actions taken against Vulcan Materials Company are contrary to the most basic principles of international law and have the potential to seriously disrupt international supply chains.“A continued shutdown of Vulcan’s operations in Mexico will have a direct and negative impact on the United States, as Vulcan’s Mexico facility is a critical component of the construction aggregates supply chain for the southeast United States,” the senators wrote. “This facility provides construction aggregates for infrastructure projects in coastal markets that do not have the geology necessary to produce quality construction aggregates locally.”A copy of the letter can be found here and below.Dear President Biden, We write urging you to prioritize and address the recent aggression by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and his Administration toward American companies with investments and operations in Mexico. For over two centuries, the United States and Mexico have developed deep cultural, economic, and diplomatic relations that have been instrumental in creating prosperity in North America. A central component of this relationship is the economic integration that encourages American investment in and trade with Mexico—which, in 2021, generated over $661.1 billion in total trade. As the world emerges from the pandemic and reassesses the global rebalancing of supply chains, North America is uniquely positioned to bolster its leadership as a manufacturing powerhouse as companies look to near-shore their supply chains from Asia and the rest of the world. However, recent actions by President López Obrador and officials in his government threaten to undermine the confidence of U.S. businesses in Mexico as a viable, predictable marketplace and destination for investment. For over thirty years, Vulcan Materials Company has operated a limestone quarry on three contiguous parcels of land in Quintana Roo, Mexico. This facility has brought investment and well-paying jobs to the region. However, under the leadership of President López Obrador, the Mexican government has taken numerous arbitrary and punitive actions against Vulcan, illustrating increasingly protectionist and anti-competitive policies that disregard the rule of law. In 2018, Vulcan initiated NAFTA arbitration proceedings against Mexico due to arbitrary and capricious actions that prohibited Vulcan from operating on two of the three parcels it owns in Quintana Roo. In January of this year, President López Obrador began escalating hostilities, directly interfering with Vulcan’s ability to export materials and making numerous public statements advocating for Vulcan to stop quarrying. On May 5, the Mexican Government presented Vulcan with shutdown orders to immediately cease all quarrying and extraction operations on its one active mining parcel, despite Vulcan’s full ownership of this property and its possession of all the necessary permitting needed to operate. A continued shutdown of Vulcan’s operations in Mexico will have a direct and negative impact on the United States, as Vulcan’s Mexico facility is a critical component of the construction aggregates supply chain for the southeast United States. This facility provides construction aggregates for infrastructure projects in coastal markets that do not have the geology necessary to produce quality construction aggregates locally. Further, Vulcan Materials Company is not the only American entity to experience harassment from the Mexican government and raise concerns over President López Obrador’s anti-business rhetoric. There have been a number of stunning cases, particularly in the energy and power sectors, where multiple U.S.-owned facilities have been forced to close. The Natural Resources Defense Council, the Alliance for Trade Enforcement, the United States Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of Manufacturers have all cited numerous instances in which protectionist policies threaten the predictability of Mexico’s business climate. This is further underscored by the Mexican Senate’s recent passage of a bill to nationalize lithium mining and extraction. Under this protectionist measure, Mexican state-run companies will have exclusive rights to mine lithium, which is a critical mineral used in the production of electric car batteries and other next-generation technologies. Both Republican and Democratic Members of Congress have raised concerns to your Administration regarding President López Obrador’s departures from the economic and legal norms that govern U.S.-Mexican relations and his assault against the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USCMA). If these violations are allowed to continue, they will undermine crucial, mutually beneficial economic cooperation between our nations and encourage businesses to seek more predictable and suitable markets elsewhere. Therefore, we respectfully request that you take immediate action with respect to the Government of Mexico to reverse the harmful measures it has already taken and to prevent further damage to the economic relationship between the United States and Mexico. Sincerely,Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

These permits are currently delayed.Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas receive a share of royalties from the leases in the Gulf of Mexico through the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA). GOMESA is unique to the Gulf of Mexico and without ongoing leases the revenue shared with the states would likely diminish.The senators wrote: “While the Biden Administration and Members of Congress fault the domestic oil and gas industry for sitting idle on over 9,000 drilling permits and millions of acres in ‘inactive leases’, NMFS’s permitting delays represent one example of the Administration’s de facto ban on new drilling – impeding domestic oil and gas investment, exploration, and production.”The letter notes that the delays are principally due to “three administration-made and admitted mistakes” caused by mathematic errors in calculating the number of endangered species in the Gulf of Mexico in a 2021 Final Rule governing offshore oil and gas exploration based on those faulty calculations.The senators called on Secretary Raimondo to “expeditiously correct these errors by putting in place … tangible short-term solutions to stop any further permitting delays,” including an interim rule allowing permitting to continue, expeditiously issuing a new Final Rule to correct the miscalculations, and shifting resources to process permits under alternative mechanisms.The senators added: “It is unacceptable that agency miscalculations have restricted access to safe, secure, and reliable domestic oil and gas production through substantial, unnecessary, and arbitrary permitting delays.”The full text of the letter can be found here or below.May 17, 2022Dear Secretary Raimondo:We write to express our concern with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) delay in issuing permits required to bring additional production online from existing federal oil and gas leases, and we urge you to stop the delay by immediately taking the steps outlined below.While the Biden Administration and Members of Congress fault the domestic oil and gas industry for sitting idle on over 9,000 drilling permits and millions of acres in “inactive leases”, NMFS’s permitting delays represent one example of the Administration’s de facto ban on new drilling – impeding domestic oil and gas investment, exploration, and production.Specifically, we are aware that NMFS has a backlog of applications for “Letters of Authorization” (LOA), which federal oil and gas lessees need in order to perform the specific geological surveying necessary to develop their leases located on the federal U.S. Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). We understand some pending LOA applications have been with the agency for well over 100 days, whereas NMFS has historically approved LOA applications within 2 to 4 weeks.This permitting delay is principally due to three administration-made and admitted mistakes: (1) the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) inadvertently double­ counted projected exposure estimates for activities on the OCS1; (2) NMFS relied upon those miscalculations when developing a 2021 Final Rule to administer LOAs pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act 2; and (3) NMFS overestimated the total expected encounters in the Gulf of Mexico of the species that were the subject of the 2021 Final Rule.Despite acknowledging these mistakes, NMFS has elected to push the consequences back onto consumers and the industry by asking applicants to either: (1) wait for LOA applications to be issued at some still-to-be-determined time, if at all; (2) pursue an alternative permitting process that would still require many more months of delays; or (3) simply stop all planned oil and gas development activities that are held up by these applications until NMFS issues new final regulations, which NMFS does not expect to issue until late-2023.Unfortunately, none of these options are acceptable at this time of record high gasoline prices because they would delay oil and gas production from existing leases.Instead, with your leadership NMFS could expeditiously correct these errors by putting in place the following tangible short-term solutions to stop any further permitting delays:•          Issue within 45 days an interim final rule that allows NMFS to approve outstanding and future LOA applications consistent with NMFS’s permitting activities before it issued the 2021 Final Rule. If the Administration is in-fact concerned with rising global energy prices and recent disruptions to our energy security caused, in part, by Russia’s detestable invasion of Ukraine, then NMFS can certainly find sufficient “good cause” in the national interest to issue an interim final rule while the agency pursues the lengthier process of notice and comment rulemaking.•          Use NMFS’ discretion to immediately approve those LOA applications that are most likely to bring production online immediately, such as LOA applications for seismic projects that have contracts in place and intend to support the drilling of development or production wells. This temporary policy should replace NMFS’s current policy of awarding authorizations on a “first come, first served” basis, which ignores the energy crisis.•          Issue a new proposed rule immediately and final rule within a more reasonable timeframe. Because NMFS just issued its current regulation in January 2021, it is unacceptable for any new notice and comment rulemaking to take another 18 or more months to complete while NMFS “analyze[s] the same activities and activity levels of the current rule, extend[s] for the remaining period of effectiveness of the current rule, and utilize[s] the same modeling methodology described in the current rule.”•          Shift additional resources to quickly process Incidental Harassment Authorization (IHA) applications and make available to permittees any other alternative permitting processes within NMFS authority (pursuant to this specific item in NOAA’s FY 2023 Budget Request).To accomplish the above, it is also clear NMFS must prioritize and dedicate more attention, resources, and expertise to this issue than it has been over the past year. It is unacceptable that agency miscalculations have restricted access to safe, secure, and reliable domestic oil and gas production through substantial, unnecessary, and arbitrary permitting delays.We expect and encourage NMFS to exercise all available tools to correct this avoidable mistake. Please respond to this letter not with words, but instead with action pursuant to the requested remedies outlined above and with an eye towards allowing energy producers to expeditiously develop their leases.Respectfully,###"

The resolution was unanimously adopted by the U.S. Senate on Wednesday. Click here for a video of Senator Tuberville discussing the importance of National Police Week.“Our men and women in blue serve as the boundary between a functioning society and a lawless one,” said Senator Tuberville. “We need to support our law enforcement. The safety of our communities is not possible without them.”BACKGROUND:The resolution honors the 576 law enforcement officers who lost their lives from January 2021 to May 2022. Last year marked the most intentional killings of police since the September 11, 2001, attacks. In the face of an ongoing pandemic and rise in violent crime, law enforcement personnel continue to serve their communities, often at great risk to themselves.The resolution designates the week of May 15 through May 21, 2022, as “National Police Week,” and expresses unwavering support for law enforcement officers across the United States in the pursuit of preserving safe and secure communities.Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Angus King (I-ME), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-NV), Susan Collins (R-ME), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Shelly Moore Capito (R-WV), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), James Risch (R-ID), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Gary Peters (R-MI), John Hoeven (R-ND), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Rand Paul (R-KY), Chris Coons (D-DE), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-CT), John Thune (R-SD), Jack Reed (D-RI), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Edward Markey (D-MA), John Barrasso (R-WY), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Rick Scott (R-FL), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Todd Young (R-IN), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Jon Tester (D-MT), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Tom Carper (D-DE), Steve Daines (R-MT), Michael Bennett (D-CO), Richard Burr (R-NC), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Rob Portman (R-OH), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), John Kennedy (R-LA), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Ben Sasse (R-NE), John Cornyn (R-TX), Mike Braun (R-IN), Richard Shelby (R-AL), John Boozman (R-AR), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Mike Rounds (R-SD), James Lankford (R-OK), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Mike Lee (R-UT), Tim Scott (R-SC), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Jon Ossoff (D-GA), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Mark Warner (D-VA), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Dick Durbin (D-IL) joined Tuberville in supporting the resolution.Read the resolution here.Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"
https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/what-they-are-saying-support-grows-for-tubervilles-legislation-to-protect-401k-investment-freedom/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) introduced the Financial Freedom Act to prohibit the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) from issuing a regulation or guidance that limits the type of investments that self-directed 401(k) account investors can choose through a brokerage window.When delivering a speech on the floor of the United States Senate about the Financial Freedom Act, Senator Tuberville said: “The Financial Freedom Act empowers the American retirement saver and preserves the precedent of investment freedom…. The choice of what you invest your retirement savings in should be yours – not the government’s. The government-knows-best approach being pushed by the current administration runs counter to the values that made our country the most prosperous nation in history.”Here’s What They Are Saying:The Financial Freedom Act has received praise from Americans for Tax Reform, Heritage Foundation, Chamber of Digital Commerce, Blockchain Association, and Association for Digital Asset Markets.“The federal government should never be in the business of telling Americans how they should invest their retirement savings. In addition to pursuing exorbitant tax hikes on all Americans as prices are surging, the Biden administration also wants to prevent retirees from investing their 401(k)s into cryptocurrency. I am proud to support Sen. Tuberville’s Financial Freedom Act, which would prevent the Department of Labor from mandating how Americans can maximize their nest eggs,” said Grover Norquist, President, Americans for Tax Reform.“I applaud Senator Tuberville’s efforts to safeguard Americans’ freedom to invest their 401(k)’s without asking bureaucrats for permission. This is especially important in Bitcoin and other alternatives to government money, where special interests have spent years trying to stop American investors from protecting themselves from Washington’s soaring inflation,” said Peter St. Onge, Economic Research Fellow, Heritage Foundation.“Individual investors are empowered to build their financial futures by selecting the investment vehicles that meet their needs. The ‘Financial Freedom Act of 2022’ is an acknowledgement that consumers and future retirees are increasingly savvy regarding their financial planning, and that providing access to more choices to diversify their investment portfolio is crucial for those investors looking to more actively participate in investment planning.  Senator Tuberville’s legislation would ensure that all investors with access to individual, self-directed investment accounts can choose alternative investment vehicles, including appropriate digital assets. We thank Senator Tuberville for his leadership and look forward to working with him and cosponsors in the legislative process,” said Teana Baker-Taylor, Chief Policy Officer, Chamber of Digital Commerce. “We’re proud to support the Financial Freedom Act of 2022, providing consumers greater choice in their retirement savings, including cryptocurrency and digital assets. Crypto allows individuals to take control of their financial future, and we will continue working with policymakers to support legislation that empowers this innovative technology and allows all Americans to benefit from it,” Kristin Smith, Executive Director, Blockchain Association.“It has never been a better time in history than the present to be an investor. The advent of the internet has brought fundamental shifts to the functioning of financial markets. Investors have more information than ever and are able to access products in faster and more transparent manners. At the same time, the world’s brightest minds are creating new products in the digital asset space with utility and financial upside. Placing regulatory hurdles targeted at specific products, such as digital assets, does not benefit consumers and affects Americans’ ability to exercise consumer choice and maintain a diversified portfolio. Senator Tuberville gets this right with his Financial Freedom Act, which fosters 401(k) investments in digital assets. The Senator’s bill has the Association for Digital Asset Markets’ (ADAM) full support,” said Michelle Bond, CEO, Association for Digital Asset Markets.BACKGROUND:The Financial Freedom Act is in response to March 10th regulatory guidance released by the Employee Benefits Security Administration, an agency inside of U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). The guidance attempts to bar 401(k) investors from investing in cryptocurrency and undermines the ability of 401(k) plans to offer brokerage windows, which give retirement plan participants the ability to personally control how their assets are invested. The guidance threatened that employers and investment firms could be subject to a DOL investigation and enforcement actions should they allow individuals using brokerage windows to invest in cryptocurrency. Senator Tuberville’s legislation would empower retirement savers to invest as they see fit and ensure that plan sponsors and financial firms are not punished for allowing investors to exercise financial freedom. Senator Tuberville discussed the issue and announced his legislation in an op-ed to CNBC.

https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-to-sasc-leaders-its-time-we-embrace-the-air-forces-decision/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesAfter multiple investigations confirm the selection of Redstone Arsenal as the best location for SPACECOM HQ,Senator Tuberville lays out the case for fellow Senate Armed Services Committee members. WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) is urging colleagues to support the Air Force’s decision to base U.S. Space Command (SPACECOM) headquarters at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama. After two government investigations concluded the Air Force basing process was thorough, legal, and comprehensive, Senator Tuberville says it’s time to move forward for the sake of national security and military readiness.In a letter to Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), and Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator James Inhofe (R-OK), Senator Tuberville outlines the findings of the reports and how politically-motivated delays negatively impact the nation’s readiness. “After 15 months of delay, Congress just received reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Department of Defense Inspector General (DoD IG). Both reports confirmed that the Air Force basing process was thorough, legal, and comprehensive; both confirmed Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama ranked highest at every stage of the process… For the sake of national security and military readiness, I will strongly oppose further efforts to unnecessarily delay this critical move,” wrote Senator Tuberville.Senator Tuberville concluded, “At this point, the biggest thing standing in the way of SPACECOM is political inertia and sore loser syndrome, each a detriment to U.S. military effectiveness. It’s time we embrace the Air Force’s decision and move forward together.”The full text of the letter can be found here or below.Wednesday, May 18, 2022Chairman Reed and Ranking Member Inhofe:It is time for the Senate to fully support the Air Force’s basing decision for U.S. Space Command (SPACECOM). The 11th Unified Combatant Command was established on August 29, 2019, with the vital mission to secure the high ground of space. After 15 months of delay, Congress just received reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Department of Defense Inspector General (DoD IG). Both reports confirmed that the Air Force basing process was thorough, legal, and comprehensive; both confirmed Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama ranked highest at every stage of the process.To date, I and others from Alabama have largely declined to engage in a public back and forth on this issue because doing so would not have been helpful to national security. Instead, we have sought to allow the facts and the integrity of the process to speak for themselves. Given the recent DoD IG and GAO findings, as well as the grave threats we face from China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, we must move forward. For the sake of national security and military readiness, I will strongly oppose further efforts to unnecessarily delay this critical move.The following is a summary of developments over the last 24 months relating to the Air Force’s decision to base SPACECOM headquarters at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama. As you will see, the process has been robust and objective, the investigations extensive, and the conclusion the same throughout: Redstone Arsenal is the best place for SPACECOM.Air Force Used an Objective Selection ProcessIn 2019, the Air Force identified six suitable locations—including Redstone—for SPACECOM headquarters, which when fully established will house approximately 1,400 military and civilian personnel. That decision was protested, and in response, the Secretary of Defense testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in March 2020 that he would instruct the Air Force to examine the selection process and allow communities to self-nominate to host the permanent headquarters.  Subsequently, the Air Force considered 66 communities from across 26 states.At the time, lawmakers from all corners praised the revised process for its openness and fairness, with remarks such as “The Secretary and the Chief have been excellent partners throughout the process, and are working to ensure that no one can challenge their final decision.”An exhaustive selection methodology followed—one that weighed 21 different factors and involved site visits, interviews, and input up and down the chain of command. This objective evaluation lasted more than eight months.In the end, the Air Force determined that Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville was its preferred location for SPACECOM headquarters. In its January 13, 2021 news release announcing that finding, the Air Force stated that it had “conducted … visits to assess which of six … locations would be best suited to host the U.S. Space Command Headquarters based on factors related to mission, infrastructure capacity, community support, and costs to the Department of Defense. Huntsville compared favorably across more of these factors than any other community…” In fact, Huntsville ranked in the top- or middle-third of the criteria over 85 percent of the time.The Air Force followed a process that concluded that SPACECOM headquarters at Redstone best served the national security interest of the country. Rather than embrace this decision, politicians representing military installations which were not selected raised unsubstantiated claims that the selection was a politically-motivated decision by the previous administration.Biden Administration Defends Prior Administration’s DecisionBiden administration officials pushed back on assertions that the prior administration’s selection of Redstone was politically motivated. For example:·         On February 22, 2021, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said in a statement that “Secretary Austin has communicated to Air Force leaders that he supports their decision-making process about the preferred location of Space Command headquarters.” ·         On June 16, 2021, John Roth, President Biden’s Acting Secretary of the Air Force at the time, said that “[t]he selection of Huntsville as the preferred location by my predecessor was the result of our strategic basing process, and that process is an analytically based process.”Independent Reviews Support Air Force’s Selection Process and ConclusionUnfortunately, at a time when Congress should have been providing robust support to the Air Force’s efforts to grow our critical space capabilities, politicians once fulsome with praise of the process suddenly enlisted GAO and the DoD IG to castigate the Air Force’s selection as “fundamentally flawed,” howling that the selection must be based upon “sound methodology and good, objective data.”  Sound methodology and objective data are exactly what the DoD IG found. On May 11, 2022—almost 16 months after the Air Force made its initial decision—the DoD IG released its highly anticipated report, concluding that:We found that the process Air Force officials used to select Huntsville, Alabama, as the preferred permanent location for the U.S. Space Command headquarters (USSPACECOM HQ) complied with law and policy, and was reasonable in identifying Huntsville as the preferred permanent location…Basing Office personnel developed relevant and objective criteria to assess candidate locations in the Self-Nomination Phase, score candidate locations in the Evaluation Phase, and rank the six candidate locations in the Selection Phase. The 4 evaluation factors and 21 associated criteria, which the SECDEF approved, were a reasonable and objective means of assessing, scoring, and ranking the candidate locations for hosting the USSPACECOM HQ.On May 13, 2022, GAO provided Senate staff with a briefing on its report. GAO confirmed that during the Air Force’s comprehensive process, “Redstone Arsenal was the highest-scoring location in the Evaluation Phase, the highest-ranked location in the Selection Phase, and the location with the most advantages in the final decision matrix. That is why the U.S. Secretary of the Air Force ultimately selected Redstone as the preferred location for SPACECOM HQ.” GAO was critical of eleventh-hour attempts to elevate a much lower-ranked installation into the number two position. That artificial action gave the appearance of bias. Both the DoD IG and GAO reports are now available for you and your staff to review in full.Readiness Impact Some have claimed that a move to Redstone would negatively impact readiness at SPACECOM. This notion is unsupported by facts and has been refuted.In response to a March 8, 2022 question from Senator Sheheen, SPACECOM Commander General James Dickinson testified before our committee that “we are in the process right now of building the infrastructure that we need to do the mission that I have been given . . . and we are moving in that direction. I would say we are a couple [to] three years away from full operational capability…no matter where we are located.” In short, there is no evidence that a transition of the headquarters would have a significant impact on readiness.Time to Move ForwardIn the words of General Dickinson, “I need a decision.” He, in fact, now has a decision that (1) resulted from a fair and objective process, (2) has been affirmed by senior officials in both parties, and (3) has withstood the scrutiny of two extensive government reviews.At this point, the biggest thing standing in the way of SPACECOM is political inertia and sore loser syndrome, each a detriment to U.S. military effectiveness. It’s time we embrace the Air Force’s decision and move forward together.Sincerely, Tommy TubervilleUnited States SenatorSenator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"
https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-marshall-introduce-bill-to-save-clean-safe-nuclear-power/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON— U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS), a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, today introduced the Thorium Energy Security Act to prevent the destruction of Uranium 233 (U-233), a critical element used to produce clean energy.“Thorium and U-233 hold the promise to produce clean, safe power and are vital to our national security. Energy will continue to be at the heart of global conflicts, so the United States must invest in energy technology,” Senator Tuberville said. “China clearly saw the value in our thorium research—they’ve taken up where we left off, and we may soon see thorium-powered Chinese aircraft carriers and thorium reactors on the Belt & Road courtesy of American technology.” “Uranium-233 is too valuable and too useful to just be thrown in the trash, a fact that the Chinese Communist Party understands but our Department of Energy clearly does not. While we are spending millions of dollars to destroy U-233, the CCP is investing in it by preparing to build a new generation of advanced aircraft carriers and nuclear reactors powered by U-233,” said Senator Marshall.“The United States needs to lead on advanced nuclear reactors and not leave the future of innovative clean energy technologies in the hands of China. Preserving this valuable national resource is the first step on that path.” BACKGROUND:In the 1960s, the United States pioneered thorium molten salt breeder reactor technologies at Oak Ridge National Labs. This promising technology, which employed uranium 233 (U-233), produced clean, safe power, but did not produce plutonium like other reactor designs. As our country was focused on growing our nuclear arsenal, the U.S. shelved thorium and U-233 for decades.In 2001, the Department of Energy began the process of destroying our stocks of U-233. Under the Obama administration, the Department of Energy transferred our thorium technology to China in a cooperative agreement with the Chinese Academy of Sciences. As a result, China just tested their first molten salt thorium reactor and is believed the be using the thorium to power their newest aircraft carrier. The Department of Energy’s “next generation” reactors are reliant on Russian highly-enriched, low-assay uranium (HALEU). Recent events show the error of that judgement. Fortunately, America has the technology and U-233 material to produce energy that doesn’t depend on Russian HALEU.  Moreover, molten salt breeder reactors based on the thorium cycle cannot melt down and are capable of consuming nuclear waste, solving the two most pressing problems of nuclear power. Further, U-233 is also the source material for two essential isotopes, actinium-225 and bismuth-213, which are essential in the treatment of multiple types of cancer, including leukemia, prostate, breast, lymphomas, multiple myeloma, and brain cancers. Given its many benefits, the case to preserve the United States supply of U-233 is of national importance. The Thorium Energy Security Act will immediately halt the Department of Energy’s program to destroy uranium 233, saving this vital national asset for future study, medical research, and clean energy.###"
https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-continues-push-to-protect-retirement-savers-financial-freedom/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) pushed back against the U.S. Department of Labor’s (DOL) recent guidance that bans 401(k) investments in cryptocurrency. On the floor of the U.S. Senate, Senator Tuberville spoke about the Financial Freedom Act, his new bill that would prohibit the DOL from issuing guidance limiting the range or type of investments 401(k) savers can select.Excerpts from the Senator’s speech can be found below, and his complete remarks can be viewed here. “By the time the average American worker retires, they will have worked over 16,000 days. Put another way, by the time an individual reaches the average retirement age in the United States, they will have clocked approximately 133,000 hours. Point being, Americans work hard to retire comfortably. And to help them reach their retirement goals, many employers offer retirement savings and investment plans, commonly known as the 401(k). In fact, 91 million Americans currently invest in the 401(k).”“If someone in Lamar County, Alabama is getting up at the crack of dawn – clocking 14 hours at work – knows their retirement goals and personal circumstances very well, who better to decide how to invest the money they are making? Who better to decide but them?  But – as we have seen time and time again – common sense and individual freedoms are the enemy of the Biden administration.”“The administration has their eyes set on Americans’ financial freedom, yet again. This time, the Department of Labor is specifically targeting workers’ ability to invest their 401(k) savings in assets as they see fit. Recent regulatory guidance released by the Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration attempts to bar 401(k) accounts [from investing] in cryptocurrency, singling out this specific investment type. The guidance threatens to investigate plans that allow participants to select investments in cryptocurrency, including plans where retirement savers use brokerage windows to self-select investments in cryptocurrency.”“The Department of Labor has long permitted employers to offer brokerage windows as an option to employees who prefer to personally invest their own money and manage their own money within these windows. The agency’s new guidance ends this tradition of economic empowerment in favor of big-brother government control.”“The Employee Benefits Security Administration goes a step further by seeking to place a massive new regulatory burden on 401(k)s and requiring them to assess the suitability of investments accessed using a brokerage window. This would undermine the ability of retirement savers to invest as they see fit.”“The Biden administration’s Department of Labor’s guidance singles out this cryptocurrency for some reason– but it’s clear retirement savers want to have that option to invest their own money. Fidelity… is the largest 401(k) provider in the country, recently announced that it will make bitcoin available on its platform…Sadly, DOL has already criticized these plans to empower investors.”“Americans should be able to invest their retirement savings as they choose. That’s why I introduced the Financial Freedom Act. My bill would prohibit the Department of Labor from issuing any regulation or guidance limiting the type of investments that self-directed 401(k) account investors can choose through a brokerage window. It would also push back on the Biden administration’s plan to punish asset managers who authorize individual retirement savers to self-direct their investment choices using a brokerage window. The Financial Freedom Act empowers the American retirement saver and preserves the precedent of investment freedom.”“For decades, 401(k) participants in plans with brokerage windows have been able to buy and sell investments of their choice – that freedom to choose is the entire purpose of the brokerage window. The Department of Labor should not be able to limit the range or type of investments [retirement] savers can select. The choice of what you invest your retirement savings in should be yours – not the government’s. The government-knows-best approach being pushed by the current administration runs counter to the values that made our country the most prosperous nation in history. I urge my colleagues to support financial choice and freedom – to uphold our tradition of economic empowerment.”Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

That artificial action gave the appearance of bias. Excerpts from the Senator’s video message can be found below, and his remarks can be viewed here.“The Air Force chose Huntsville, Alabama as the new home of SPACECOM, which will eventually be home to more than 1,400 personnel.”“But that was 16 months ago. Since then, the decision has been tied up in government reviews by the Inspector General at the Department of Defense and the Government Accountability Office at the request of other lawmakers.”“We finally received the results of both reviews this week. I’m glad to report both reviews were positive.”“The Inspector General found that ‘the process Air Force officials used to select Huntsville complied with the law and policy, and it was reasonable in identifying Huntsville as the preferred location’ for headquarters.”“My office was briefed on the GAO report this morning and, overall, we are pleased with its findings.”“So, 16 months later we know that the Air Force selection process was robust and objective, the investigations extensive, and the conclusion the same throughout: Redstone Arsenal is the best place for Space Command.”“My message to my colleagues is simple, ‘it’s time to fully embrace the Air Force’s decision, and move forward together. The Air Force needs and deserves our full support.’”“And my message to the Air Force and the people of SPACECOM is this: ‘We’re excited to welcome you to Alabama – the most military-friendly state in America. With the threat from China, North Korea, Russia, and Iran on the rise, your mission to seize the high ground of space is critically important. Let’s get going.’”BACKGROUND: In 2020, the Air Force conducted an extensive search for the best location for the new home of U.S. Space Command, reviewing objective criteria like infrastructure, costs, mission capability, and the quality of the local community. Sixty-six different locations in twenty-six states were evaluated, and in the end, Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama ranked number one.At the request of other lawmakers, the U.S. Department of Defense Inspector General (DoD IG) and the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) both conducted investigations into U.S. Air Force’s site selection process for U.S. Space Command headquarters. On Tuesday, Senator Tuberville released a statement on the IG’s report, which concluded that the Air Force followed a legal, fair, and logical process. The IG report said, in part, “Overall, we determined that the 2020 Basing Action directed by the SECDEF complied with Federal Law and DoD policy and that the Basing Action process was reasonable…. Our report describes in detail the actions taken by Air Force officials to select Huntsville, Alabama, as the preferred permanent location for the USSPACECOM HQ. We determined that the 2020 Basing Action process was reasonable in identifying Huntsville, Alabama, as the preferred permanent location to host the USSPACECOM HQ.”In a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on March 8th, 2022, General James H. Dickinson, Commander of U.S. Space Command, debunked the idea that moving Space Command would delay readiness. In his testimony, General Dickinson assured the committee that Space Command would be fully operational in two to three years, regardless of where it is ultimately located.Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"
https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-statement-on-democrats-abortion-on-demand-legislation/,"Newsroom &vert; Press Releases WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) today released the following statement after voting against Senate Democrats’ abortion legislation: “Democrats’ knee-jerk effort to make abortions available on demand until the moment of birth is extreme and out of step with what most Americans believe. This is the second time the Senate has voted on this unrestrained policy– and for the second time, it has failed to get majority support. In Alabama, we hold our Christian conservative values in high regard and believe that every life is precious. I voted against this bill today to protect the lives of the unborn.”BACKGROUND:On May 2nd, a draft U.S. Supreme Court opinion on the Mississippi abortion case – Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization – was leaked to the press. The draft majority decision indicated it would uphold the Mississippi law, which limits abortion to fifteen weeks, and therefore, overturn Roe v. Wade. Should the Supreme Court’s final decision mirror the draft opinion, individual states would then have the authority to enact their own restrictions on abortion.In response to the leaked draft opinion, which is not final, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act. The bill would supersede all state and federal laws on abortion allowing for late-term abortions and sex-selective abortions. Additionally, the legislation eliminated long-standing conscience protections to ensure religiously-affiliated health care providers do not face government discrimination for declining to perform certain health care services on religious or moral grounds. Today’s vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act failed by a vote of 49 to 51.The Senate voted on similar legislation earlier this year, and that vote also failed by a vote of 46 to 48. Some Democrats have argued for eliminating the filibuster in order to pass this abortion bill. If the filibuster was eliminated, the bill could pass with 51 votes. However, the Senate failed to get 51 votes twice this year on the same policy, illustrating how unpopular late-term abortion is within their own caucus.The United States’ current position on abortion does not reflect international mainstream standards. The United States is 1 of 7 nations, including China and North Korea, that allow for abortion on demand beyond the point babies can feel pain. 47 out of 50 European nations limit abortion at 15 weeks or earlier. Additionally, the majority of Americans support pro-life protections. When asked, 71% of Americans support significant limits on abortion and 80% of Americans believe that third trimester abortions should be illegal.Senator Tuberville has spoken out about supporting the lives of mothers and highlighted the vital role adoption plays in supporting the life of a child after birth.Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

This is government overreach at its finest. The government has no business standing in the way of retirement savers who want to make their own investment choices. When you’ve earned your paycheck, how you invest your money should be your decision. My legislation makes sure that is the case.” BACKGROUND:The Financial Freedom Act is in response to March 10th regulatory guidance released by the Employee Benefits Security Administration, an agency inside of U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). The guidance attempts to bar 401(k) investors from investing in cryptocurrency and undermines the ability of 401(k) plans to offer brokerage windows, which give retirement plan participants the ability to personally control how their assets are invested. The guidance threatened that employers and investment firms could be subject to a DOL investigation and enforcement actions should they allow individuals using brokerage windows to invest in cryptocurrency. Senator Tuberville’s legislation would empower retirement savers to invest as they see fit and ensure that plan sponsors and financial firms are not punished for allowing investors to exercise financial freedom. Senator Tuberville discussed the issue and announced his legislation in an op-ed to CNBC.

Those who bravely protected our country over the decades—our nation’s veterans – deserve an immense amount of gratitude.  Alabama alone is home to more than 400,000 veterans. One of the things that inspires me the most in my conversations with our veterans is their unwavering declaration that, regardless of any war, injuries, or post-war struggles, they would gladly do it all over again because they believe that America is worth fighting for. My father was a World War II veteran, and growing up, he would emphasize the importance of hard work and exhibit great love for this country. His service, sacrifice, and patriotism stays with me to this day, long after he passed. It’s why I was so honored to be named to the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee. When I came to Washington, D.C., my office and I got to work identifying targeted changes we could make to improve how the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) delivers care and benefits to veterans and service members. We figured that if we focusing on these changes – no matter how small they seemed – we could positively affect the lives of our veterans and their families. We started by listening. We heard from countless veterans who struggle with their mental health. An increasing number of veterans suffer from the effects of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) or Post-Traumatic StressDisorder (PTSD). TBI and PTSD can lead to other severe mental health issues, and sometimes suicide. We lose an average of 18 veterans per day to suicide, and unfortunately, Alabama has one of the highest veteran suicide rates in the country. There are evidence-based treatments for those suffering from brain injuries and PTSD, but these treatments don’t always work for every veteran. If a veteran has exhausted available treatment options, why not let them try another avenue – especially if it’s doesn’t involve more surgery or more drugs? Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy, or HBOT, is an FDA-approved treatment option for 14 different conditions, and I have spoken with  Alabama veterans who have experienced the benefits of this treatment. So, I introduced the Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) Access Act of 2021 to make Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy an option approved by the VA for veterans who have tried no fewer than two evidence-based treatment options and who are deemed at high-risk of suicide or self-harm. We should be doing all we can to increase access to additional treatments for veterans who are struggling. The VA not only delivers care to our veterans, but the agency also oversees veterans’ benefits. The administration of some of those benefits has not been updated in decades. Our office found maximum coverage amounts for veterans’ life insurance had not been increased since 2005. After 17 years, it’s time for that amount to be updated. So I introduced a bill, the Supporting Families of the Fallen Act, to increase the maximum life insurance coverage amounts offered under VA’s Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI) and Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI) from $400,000 to $500,000. Increasing coverage by $100,000 will give our veterans and their families greater financial peace of mind, and ensure their families are provided for should the worst happen.  Our bill has already passed the U.S. Senate and awaits action in the U.S. House of Representatives. I’m proud that my first standalone piece of legislation to pass the Senate was to help veterans. We also learned that some veterans’ dependents had missed out on receiving benefits because of an error made when the form was filled out. Complicated or confusing forms shouldn’t be a barrier to benefits for veterans and their families. That’s why I introduced legislation to streamline Post-9/11 GI bill benefits to eligible dependents and ensure confusing paperwork does not hinder military families from receiving education benefits should tragedy strike.Finally, our office was made aware of cases where veterans had the benefits they so rightfully earned stolen from them by their fiduciaries. The VA allows veterans to appoint someone—often a friend or close family member—to help oversee and manage their benefits if they are unable to do so themselves. Unfortunately, bad actors have found ways to abuse this fiduciary relationship. Under current law, if a defrauded veteran passes away before their fraud case with the VA is resolved, the veteran’s family cannot seek reimbursement for the funds. I don’t think that’s right, so we recently introduced the Restoring Benefits to Defrauded Veterans to fix that loophole. The bill would ensure a veteran’s estate can be reimbursed for any funds lost to fraud should the veteran pass away before reimbursement is completed.Our office is just getting started in our work helping veterans. We’re going to keep listening to veterans’ needs and figuring out small, but meaningful, changes we can make to improve the VA. Because of the sacrifice of our veterans, Americans live freely in the greatest country in the world. Veterans have stood on the frontlines of freedom for us. Now, it is time that we stand up for them.Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs and Senate Armed Services Committees.

Rather than rewriting asylum rules as part of their open borders agenda, the Biden administration needs to redirect their efforts to upholding the integrity of our immigration system and securing our border.”On October 19, 2021, Senator Tuberville joined Senator Johnson (R-WI), 22 Senate Republicans, and 66 House Republicans in submitting a public comment to the Federal Register in opposition of the rule.  The comment noted:“The proposed rule represents a blatant violation of the laws passed by Congress. It ignores the mandatory detention requirements of aliens claiming asylum through mass parole, violates the principles of separation of powers, and inappropriately shifts the roles of USCIS and Executive Office of Immigration Review.”On March 29, 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published the interim final rule that would allow USCIS asylum officers to grant asylum to illegal immigrants at the border. The asylum rule is set to take effect at the end of May.

U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Mike Lee (R-UT) are original cosponsors of the legislation.“The power of American ingenuity produced three life-saving COVID vaccines in record time – that is something to be proud of,” said Senator Tuberville. “Private industry should have a say if their coveted vaccine formulas are exported to other countries and their cutting-edge technology is copied. Additionally, allowing for a TRIPS waiver would increase the likelihood that this sought-after technology would make it into the hands of bad actors like China and Russia, who could use it to advance their malign agendas. Global industry has the means to produce billions of vaccine doses and they should do so on their own terms, but waiving global intellectual property protections simply undermines American innovation.”“President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed proved the life-saving capabilities of the private sector, but for some reason the Democrats are on a mission to stop this innovation in its tracks,” said Senator Blackburn. “I am leading the charge to stop Joe Biden’s plan to waive the intellectual property rights of vaccine manufacturers. Without the power of free market innovation, we will lose any chance we have at successfully managing another global public health crisis.”BACKGROUND:###"
https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-op-ed-in-southeast-sun-alabamas-community-colleges-are-driving-economic-success/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) authored the following op-ed in the Southeast Sun to highlight the contributions Alabama’s community colleges and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are making to workforce development and economic growth in the state. Alabama’s Community Colleges Are Driving Economic SuccessU.S. Senator Tommy TubervilleThe Southeast SunApril 8, 2022LINKBusiness is booming in Alabama as the state’s contributions continue to be recognized on the national and international stage. No matter the size of the business, Alabama’s economic policies and stellar workforce are a welcome environment for those wanting to grow their businesses and invest in their communities. With these increased opportunities come increased demands, as we see occupational openings ranging from truck drivers to plumbers. Job opportunities are abundant, but future workers need to be equipped with the skills necessary to meet these opportunities head-on. Fortunately, Alabama’s Community College System (ACCS) is ensuring Alabama remains a hub for economic growth by reimagining what it means to develop our workforce. Alabama’s 25 community colleges are providing readily accessible pathways where students can channel their interests into their personal and professional success, while also making meaningful contributions to our state’s upward economic trajectory.Last month, the ACCS opened its Innovation Center as part of its commitment to meet the needs of the high-demand industries in our state. The ACCS Innovation Center provides rapid workforce training for these positions, a direct solution to fill the demands in trucking, butchery, recreation, plumbing, and facilities maintenance. Alabama’s community colleges are also contributing to our national defense by providing technical airframe and avionics training opportunities, such as Enterprise State Community College/Alabama Aviation College’s partnership with M1 Support Services L.P. The partnership’s dual-enrollment option allows students to begin training in high school and secure good-paying jobs at Fort Rucker upon graduation. Innovative collaborations like these ensure Alabama’s military installations have the support needed to continue standing on the frontlines of our national security. Rapid workforce training options not only benefit our economy, but they benefit individuals, too. Placing greater emphasis on skill competency and moving away from time-based programs, ACCS empowers students to complete hands-on training at a pace that works for them. Young adults need access to career options that enable them to discover their passions and develop skills that lead to good-paying jobs. For some, that leads them to a four-year university. But a four-year degree is not for everyone. And even outside of attending a four-year institution, vocational programs with time-based degree requirements can wind up deterring students from pursuing certain careers and deprive our workforce of talented employees. Initiatives like the ACCS Innovation Center ensure that the success of those who are ready to find good-paying jobs is not limited by their current capabilities. At a time when businesses are in need of employees, we must find innovative ways to incentivize prospective workers to find employment within their communities and support novel approaches to do so. When discussing institutions that empower young adults to reach their full potential, the important work of Alabama’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities, or HBCUs, cannot be overlooked. HBCUs provide minority students with opportunities to create their own future. HBCUs not only knock down barriers; they also build upon the inherent potential of their students. Among their many contributions, Alabama’s thirteen HBCUs have helped to fill the ongoing need for workers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) professions in our state. The partnerships and training programs offered through our HBCUs ensure we have workers available and trained to fill vital roles within our local communities. For example, Shelton State’s Fire College trains fire fighters and EMTs that work on the frontlines to keep our communities safe.Bishop State Community College partners with Alabama Power to offer a nine-week electric line worker training program to ensure we continue to have power restoration experts in times of need, like after a hurricane or other natural disaster. Calhoun Community College’s aerospace technology program equips our defense and space industries with the uniquely-skilled workforce needed to manufacture hardware for rockets, missiles, planes, helicopters, and other aerospace and military equipment.And, in as little as six months, a student at Lawson State Community College can launch his or her career in an industry like building construction or HVAC.If we are going to continue fueling economic growth in our state, we must keep bridging the divide between job seekers and employers by ensuring we have adequate training and pathways to good-paying jobs. We must expand upon the work of the Alabama Community College System and our HBCUs to increase opportunities for all Alabamians so that our communities can continue to thrive.Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"
https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-colleagues-ask-biden-nominees-to-protect-federal-employees-retirement-funds-from-chinese-firms/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), along with Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Tom Cotton (R-AR), sent a letter to four of President Joe Biden’s nominees to serve on the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) requesting that they commit to withholding the retirement savings of U.S. service members and other federal employees from investment in Chinese firms that undermine U.S. national security. Senator Tuberville has been outspoken on this issue. In May of 2021, Senator Tuberville introduced legislation to prohibit investment of Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) funds in any entity based in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The TSP is the predominant government retirement fund utilized by 6,000,000 military members and federal civilian employees and is governed by the FRTIB. Additionally, Senator Tuberville pressed top administration officials for clarity about the FRTIB’s policy on investing in Chinese and Russian companies, wrote about the national security risk investment in CCP-backed entities poses for the United States, and spoke about the issue on the Senate Floor and during an interview on Fox Business. Senator Tuberville also placed a hold, a procedural maneuver to prevent confirmation without a vote by the full Senate, on all four nominees to the FRTIB until clarity is provided.“We are deeply concerned by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board’s (FRTIB) history of voting to invest federal employees’ retirement savings into China-based companies, including firms involved in the Chinese government’s military, espionage, human rights abuses, and aggressive industrial policy designed to undermine U.S. industry,” the senators wrote. “The FRTIB’s previous actions have demonstrated a willingness to invest American retirement savings into Chinese companies working to undermine U.S. interests and national security, as well as exposing federal employees’ retirement savings to considerable risk. This cannot be allowed in the future.”The full text of the letter can be found is below. Dear Mr. Gerber, Ms. Bilyeu, Ms. Olivares, and Ms. Bridges:We are deeply concerned by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board’s (FRTIB) history of voting to invest federal employees’ retirement savings into China-based companies, including firms involved in the Chinese government’s military, espionage, human rights abuses, and aggressive industrial policy designed to undermine U.S. industry. The FRTIB’s previous actions have demonstrated a willingness to invest American retirement savings into Chinese companies working to undermine U.S. interests and national security, as well as exposing federal employees’ retirement savings to considerable risk. This cannot be allowed in the future.We have repeatedly voiced our concerns with the FRTIB’s 2017 decision to change the Thrift Savings Plan’s (TSP) International Stock Fund, or the “I Fund,” to mirror the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Investable Market Index. In 2020, after considerable congressional pressure, the FRTIB announced that it had “deferred” the I Fund’s transition to a new benchmark index. Today, the fund continues to mirror the MSCI Europe, Australasia and Far East (EAFE) Index. Had the planned transition taken place, China would be receiving the third-most investment of any nation in the fund, potentially exposing billions of dollars in federal employee retirement assets to risks associated with many of the Chinese companies included in the index.We write asking for your commitment to protect federal employees’ savings and the national security of the United States. In particular:·      Do you commit to ensuring that the TSP’s I Fund does not mirror the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Investable Market Index?·      Do you commit to ensuring that no sums in the Thrift Savings Fund are invested in any security that is listed on an exchange in a jurisdiction in which the PCAOB is prevented from conducting a complete inspection or investigation of a registered public accounting firm under section 104 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 because of a position taken by an authority in that jurisdiction, as determined by the PCAOB?·      Do you commit to voting to ensure that no federal employee retirement funds go to any Chinese firms that undermine U.S. national security?We look forward to your prompt reply. Sincerely,Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

And now, over two years after the start of the pandemic, conditions still haven’t gotten much easier for our farmers and producers.  President Biden’s reckless spending policies are tying the hands that feed us. We are seeing the highest inflation rates in over 40 years because out-of-control spending and misplaced priorities are causing operational costs to shoot up while profits stagnate.  Prices for key inputs such as fertilizer, fuel, and machinery have doubled or tripled over the past year with no signs of coming back down. Dollars do not stretch nearly as far anymore at the gas pump which leaves farmers taking on additional costs for their basic needs of filling up their trucks, tractors, and combines. President Biden’s decision to cripple American energy independence and rely more on foreign oil imports has left Alabamians paying the highest gas prices they’ve ever paid. More than two-thirds of all farming equipment is powered by diesel fuel. So when the price of diesel fuel is $2.11 per gallon more than it was one year ago, that directly impacts our farmers’ bottom lines. Farmers shouldn’t have to choose between fuel and fertilizer. They need both to keep their business afloat and keep our shelves stocked. Higher commodity prices are not translating to higher net incomes for farmers due to skyrocketing input costs. Our farmers are struggling to break even while consumers are also paying more at the register. Prices for common items on our grocery list have shot up. Folks are paying almost 28% more for bacon and nearly 30% more for a dozen eggs than they were a year ago.Not only is inflation eroding profit margins,  it is also diminishing chances of long-term sustainability for our small and family farms by discouraging would-be farmers from entering the industry which will cut into the already declining number of farmers and family farms.  Small, rural farms are the heart of our local communities —if you’ve bought a new shirt, wrote on a piece of paper, or purchased fresh produce from your local store or produce stand to take home to your family—you can thank a farmer. Their declining numbers could be devastating to our local economies and our way of life.Although times are tough, Alabama farmers are resilient and continue to lead the way for agricultural success. In our state, one in every 4.6 jobs are tied to agriculture or food production which creates a $5.5 billion-dollar state impact annually. We lead the way in a diverse range of areas, ranking 1st in the nation in loblolly pine grown, 2nd in the nation for peanuts, catfish, and broiler chicken production, 5th in cotton lint production and 7th in cotton seed production, just to name a few. Alabama’s farmers work on nearly nine million farm acres and 43,000 farms to yield a wide range of exports that support our local and national food security.As a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I continue to look for commonsense ways to get the government out of the way and put farmers at the forefront of conversations regarding all aspects of the agriculture industry. When members of the Biden administration have testified before the committee, I have taken every opportunity to press senior officials on the administration’s plan to actively support rural communities and family farms. Also, I have pressed the Chairman of the Agriculture Committee to call the Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack, as a witness to testify in a hearing. He has not come before the Committee since his confirmation hearing last year, and there is much to discuss with him on behalf of Alabama farmers and producers.I call on President Bidento put forth policies that aim to drive down inflation and regain our energy independence. We need to open up more energy production here at home to reduce critical input costs for our farmers. Committing to more domestic production of critical minerals needed for items like fertilizer will ensure that global supply shortages do not disrupt American food security.It is vital that we create a thriving environment to maintain that our food and supply chains will be secure for generations to come. Alabama farmers never take a day off, and we must keep our laws and regulations in check to ensure they can continue to do what they do best – farm the land. Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

As airwaves were flooded with messages of support in solidarity with Ukraine, one major power was very vocal in their support against Ukraine – and that was China.”“And there is no doubt that China is looking at the Western response to the [war] unfolding in Ukraine as it plans to consume its neighbor, Taiwan in the same fashion.”“Since 1949, the Chinese Communist Party has been eyeing Taiwan and patiently waiting. They’ve not attacked because the United States and other free nations have strengthened the tiny island. That is the essence of deterrence. We want Xi Jinping to look out his window each morning and think, ‘Not today.’ Our president’s response to Russia invading Ukraine has not inspired confidence in the Pacific.”“Alarmingly, the White House is indifferent to the warming relations between China and Russia. When asked about a recent call between President Biden and President Xi regarding the war in Ukraine, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said, in part, ‘China has to make a decision for themselves about where they want to stand.’” “To deter Chinese aggression, the United States must have our forces in the Pacific modernized and ready at any time. That’s why it was a major win that last year’s NDAA secured funding for a robust missile defense system for Guam to counter CCP-launched cruise or ballistic missiles. Guam is our first line of defense, home to 160,000 Americans who are forward-deployed to defend the West coast and our country.”“However, as the CCP has continued to grow its military capabilities over the last decade, our own military has been hampered by cuts to defense spending leaving our artillery antiquated and our defense capabilities weakened. President Biden has been no different – offering up disappointing cuts to defense priorities in both of his first two budgets. These cuts most [certainly] caught the attention of our adversaries. This is yet another example of how sorely out of touch with reality the Biden administration is when it comes to defense. We cannot continue to ask our men and women in uniform to do more with less, especially with China watching everything that we do.”“China is watching every move we make with regards to Putin – and they are taking notes. We cannot allow Vladimir Putin’s war to set a dangerous precedent. We must not make the same mistakes with Taiwan that the administration made with Ukraine. And that begins by sending a strong, clear message to our allies and adversaries that America will always be the world’s [foremost] superpower.”Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

Each member of this body has the responsibility to thoroughly vet the candidate, listen to the voices of their constituents back home, and come to a conclusion. That’s what I have done.“First, I want to note how important it was to me that I met with Judge Jackson one-on-one. I viewed it as my opportunity for Judge Jackson to hear directly from the people of Alabama – what they’re concerned about and what they think the proper role of government is. We covered a lot of ground in our meeting last week, including a robust discussion about the protection of second amendment rights and the importance of following the rule of law. But I made it a point to ask her about her stance on crime and her record of sentencing criminals.“From 2013 to 2021, Judge Jackson served as a judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. During her tenure there, Judge Jackson routinely imposed sentences that were shorter than those requested by the prosecutors and shorter than the guidelines. Point being, Judge Jackson let those who were convicted of a crime off easy, so I took the opportunity to ask about this in our meeting.  “Judge Jackson’s answers to my questions were thoughtful but did not relieve my concerns about her sentencing record, particularly her record on sentencing criminals who preyed on young children. Children are our future. We should do all we can to ensure our communities are safe places for them to grow up. That means holding criminals accountable to the full letter of the law. And listening to the calls I am getting from folks back home, Alabamians agree.“So, I will vote ‘no’ on Judge Jackson’s confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court later this week.”A video of Sen.

It’s not smart, and it’s not safe.’WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) authored the following op-ed in Yellowhammer News in response to the Biden administration’s recent announcement to lift Title 42 on May 23, despite record-high numbers of illegal immigrants crossing the southern border. Title 42 is a COVID-era public health order put in place to allow for immediate expulsion of those illegally entering the United States. The Biden administration has not yet offered an alternative solution to implement in place of Title 42.Biden is Giving a Green Light Where There Should be a Stop SignU.S. Senator Tommy TubervilleYellowhammer NewsApril 5, 2022LINKIllegal immigration is at an all-time high. Just last year, nearly 2 million illegal immigrants from more than 160 countries were apprehended at our southern border—nearly 10 times the population of Alabama’s largest city of Huntsville. This is a direct result of the Biden administration rolling back the enforcement of immigration laws, limiting the ability of our law enforcement officers to fulfill their oath to defend our country, slashing funding, and closing ICE detention facilities. We’re already on track to exceed last year’s record, with February becoming the twelfth consecutive month with more than 150,000 illegal immigrant apprehensions. Yet the Biden administration continues to roll out the welcome mat for those who illegally enter our country. During his first few months in office, President Biden tried to brush off the surge in illegal immigrant apprehensions as nothing more than a seasonal trend. However, it has become quite clear that what’s happening at the border cannot be explained away by seasonal trends. The problem is only getting worse, and we cannot afford to keep ignoring it.The crisis at our southern border has gotten so out of hand that any form of would-be border security hangs on Title 42—an emergency public health authority, determined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and invoked during the Trump administration, that prohibits the admission of non-essential travelers at the border to reduce the rate of infection. The Biden administration weakened Title 42 by allowing children to bypass the rule, meaning unaccompanied minors could come into the U.S. without being expelled. But now, pressured by calls from the far-Left, the CDC announced that Title 42 will be completely rolled back on May 23. Worse, the Biden administration has not articulated another border security plan that would replace it.Even with Title 42 in place, our Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and agents are overwhelmed. And now, we’re seeing reports from Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials warning of an anticipated 25,000 illegal immigrants waiting just south of the U.S.-Mexico border for Title 42 to end. DHS officials are also conducting contingency planning, anticipating as many as 18,000 migrant encounters per day should Title 42 be lifted. If we think the situation at the southern border is bad now, just imagine what it will be like if Title 42 were rescinded completely, and no border security plan was put in its place. Disastrous. It’s as if you’re in a sinking ship trying to get the water out with a spoon until you decide to just throw the spoon overboard, too.Open borders have ripple effects throughout the country. It may be true some immigrants come to our border in search of a better life, but when you signal there are no repercussions for breaking our country’s laws, opportunists will take advantage. Biden officials continue to give the green light to anyone wishing to cross our border without properly vetting them. Just this week, border patrol agents arrested two illegal immigrants with criminal records, including kidnapping, murder, and sexual contact charges. Additionally, deadly, illegal drugs, such as fentanyl, are pouring across the southern border and claiming thousands of American lives. Since President Biden’s inauguration, CBP has seized nearly 3,000 pounds of fentanyl –a 41% increase from the year before. We’re seeing seizures of this deadly drug across the country, including in Alabama. In October of last year, Baldwin County Sheriff deputies seized 14 grams of fentanyl, enough to kill more than 7,000 people.I can only conclude that keeping Americans safe is a last priority for the Biden administration. Yes, it appears the same Democratic politicians who continue to ask for trillions in “COVID relief funds” courtesy of the American taxpayer also want to pronounce the pandemic is over at the border. I have visited the border and seen firsthand the impacts of the President Biden’s open borders agenda. When we continue to leave the door wide open to our country, it puts the American people at risk. It’s not smart, and it’s not safe. I urge President Biden and his administration to take charge of this crisis and put forth a plan that will secure our border and keep our country safe. Senator Tommy Tuberville is serving his first term in the United States Senate. In response to the border crisis, he introduced the Empowering Law Enforcement Act to give local law enforcement officials authority to investigate, identify, apprehend, arrest, detain or transfer illegal immigrants, and legislation requiring the DHS to issue a Notice to Appear (NTA) to illegal immigrants.###  "
https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-sasc-republicans-respond-to-president-bidens-inadequate-defense-budget%ef%bf%bc/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and Republican members of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) have made it clear — President Biden’s fiscal year 2023 defense budget is inadequate. Prior to President Biden releasing his budget proposal, Senator Tuberville joined every Republican member of the Senate and House Armed Service in urging the President to increase the defense budget by 5 percent above inflation to meet growing threats to U.S. national security. President Biden’s defense budget provides just 1.5 percent real growth using an inflation estimate Sen. Inhofe described as “almost certainly low.” Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.): “President Biden’s budget ignores reality and shortchanges our men and women in uniform. The president’s budget proposal, accounting for inflation, cuts our defense budget at a time when real growth is needed. We cannot ask our military to choose between maintenance and modernization or investment and deterrence. But that’s exactly what the president’s budget proposal does.”Ranking Member Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.): “President Biden’s defense budget reflects the world he wishes for — but not the world as it is. You simply can’t look at the world around us now and think this budget is adequate to confront all the threats we face, let alone to accelerate our attempts to maintain or restore deterrence and secure U.S. interests for our children and grandchildren. Most problematic is that this budget neglects to sufficiently account for historic inflation. I am particularly concerned about service members losing buying power, just like all American families… Real growth — 5 percent above inflation — is what we need if we are to meet this moment. We must do more to change the military balance of power in the next five years.”Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.): “…Our top military brass from all branches are wisely asking for more. More ships, more planes, more weapons, more satellites, and more training. But President Biden is instead providing them less to complete their mission. This is strategically unsound and could increase the risk of future conflicts and threats to our country. This moment demands decisiveness and strength through a sustained increase in defense spending. We will ensure that America meets that moment, even if the Commander-in-Chief has other priorities.”Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces: “For the second year in a row, the President has proposed a budget that dramatically increases spending on domestic initiatives, while defense spending fails to even keep pace with inflation. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine proves our adversaries are increasingly willing to use force to pursue their hegemonic ambitions. Meanwhile, China’s expanding military capabilities – highlighted by its nuclear breakout – demonstrates threats to our interests are growing at a rapid pace. At a time of unprecedented geopolitical turmoil, the need for real growth in the defense budget is clear.”Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities: “As America’s enemies are on the march and the world has become a much more dangerous place under his watch, President Biden now wants to flatten our defense budget. Biden’s budget moves us in the wrong direction, reflecting his doctrine of appeasement that’s led to a disaster in Afghanistan and an emboldened Putin in Russia. We should be bolstering our military right now to protect America and show our leadership in the world, and his proposal falls well short.”Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support: “As I’ve said many times before, we are in a new era of authoritarian aggression. The President needs to go back to the drawing board and craft a defense budget that leaves no question as to whether American men and women in uniform are well-trained, equipped and ready to respond to a threat wherever it emerges. If he does not, he can expect yet another broadly-bipartisan rebuke from Congress as we remedy the administration’s dangerous funding shortfall.”Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Seapower: “President Biden needs to put a serious budget proposal forward to confront the real threats we face. Russia is just one reason why defense spending needs to be higher. China and other nations are watching the seriousness and resolve of freedom-loving nations.”Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.): “As Russia wages war on Ukraine and threatens the West, North Korea is launching ballistic missiles and Communist China plans an invasion against Taiwan, President Biden is choosing weakness over strength. At a time when the United States should be bolstering our defense spending, Joe Biden’s latest pathetic spending request does not keep up with the inflation crisis he has caused — effectively cutting defense spending and leaving our country in a vulnerable position. Biden’s raging inflation crisis is hurting America in every way possible and with threats around the world growing every day, we cannot afford more weakness.”Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.): “President Biden’s budget will force cuts to key nuclear capabilities, at a time when Russia is threatening nuclear war. Russia, China, North Korea and Iran only understand peace through strength. We must provide our military the resources they need to defend and protect our freedom.”Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.): “President Biden’s defense budget fails to provide America’s military with the resources needed to deter an imperial China no less deal with other challenges, many of them created by this Administration’s incompetence. Now is the time to invest in our defenses so we can prevent war and keep Americans safe.”Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

Tuberville’s effort to lead targeted policy changes at the VAWASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) introduced the Restoring Benefits to Defrauded Veterans Act to reissue benefits to defrauded veterans. Since taking office, Senator Tuberville has introduced multiple pieces of veterans’ affairs-related legislation aimed at making targeted and meaningful changes to how the U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) delivers benefits and care to our nation’s veterans and servicemembers.  These efforts include a bill, which has already passed the U.S. Senate, to increase servicemembers’ and veterans’ life insurance maximum coverage amount and bipartisan legislation to clarify the information required on GI Bill benefit transfer forms so that eligible dependents are not barred from education benefits due to an error. The Restoring Bill Benefits to Defrauded Veterans Act continues Senator Tuberville’s efforts in this space. “We’d like to believe we live in a country where no one would take advantage of our veterans, but sadly it does happen.  What’s worse is if the money that was lost to fraud is never returned. This bill attempts to help right that wrong by ensuring a veteran’s estate can be reimbursed for any funds that were lost to fraud should the veteran pass away before the funds have been reimbursed. It’s my priority to find ways to make the government work better for the American people, and this bill is a small step toward doing just that for our veterans,” said Senator Tuberville.“Our Veterans have sacrificed so much to protect our great nation and the values we hold dear. Unfortunately, thousands of Veterans have been victims of fraud and have dealt with a long, drawn out process to ensure they and their families receive their earned payments,” said Senator Manchin. “Our bipartisan Restoring Benefits to Defrauded Veterans Act would make a simple fix to help these defrauded Veterans and their families receive the support they need and deserve. I thank Senator Tuberville for working with me on this important issue and I encourage my bipartisan colleagues to join our commonsense legislation.”The Restoring Benefits to Defrauded Veterans Act would:Under current law, if a defrauded veteran passes away before their case with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is resolved, the veteran’s family cannot seek reimbursement for the defrauded funds. This legislation would change that statute to allow a deceased beneficiary’s estate to receive reissued funds. Specifically, the bill will:On November 15, 2021, U.S. Representatives David Trone (D-MD) and Tom Emmer (R-MN) introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Zero. They have no desire to do anything about the southern border.”“And we do need workers. But we need help from this administration to stop the flow, of not just – obviously – the migrants coming across, but the drugs. It’s killing our young kids. So, we need some rules and regulations.

Gimmicks and smoke screens are used to hide the true cost of expanding social programs and prioritizing clean energy policies that will continue to strain Americans’ bank accounts and fuel inflation. New taxes will offshore American jobs and investment. At a time when Americans are paying more for almost everything and our economy is struggling, we need a budget that seriously addresses inflation – this does not.

https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-sounds-alarm-on-deadly-fentanyl-crisis/,"Newsroom &vert; Press Releases‘We don’t need a bureaucratic talking point– we need a plan and we need a plan now.’WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) today spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate about the need to immediately secure the southern border and stop the flow of deadly, illegal drugs from coming into the United States.Excerpts from the Senator’s speech can be found below, and his remarks can be viewed here.“This border surge wasn’t by accident. President Biden pledged to enact an open border agenda by halting border wall construction, reversing successful Trump-era immigration policies, and hamstringing our law enforcement officers. It is one promise he has kept.”“Just last year, nearly 2 million illegal immigrants were apprehended at our southern border from more than 160 different countries. And for 2022, it looks like we’re on track to exceed that record as this February was the twelfth consecutive month with over 100,000 illegal immigrant apprehensions. And if President Biden’s administration stops invoking Title 42 and doesn’t secure the border, the crisis is going to get dramatically worse. A lot of attention is paid to who is coming across the border – and rightfully so. But it’s time we all turn our attention to what is also coming across – and it’s called deadly fentanyl.”“I have been to the border and I’ve seen—firsthand—the impact of President Biden’s open borders policies and agenda. At a checkpoint in McAllen, Texas, I saw a truck bed filled with fentanyl… Thankfully, our border patrol officers stopped this particular truck from making it across the border. But for that one being stopped, there’s several more that get across the border.”“Two milligrams of fentanyl is considered a lethal dose. Two milligrams is the weight of a mosquito. Ten pennies weigh one ounce. One ounce of fentanyl can kill nearly 30,000 people. A football weighs one pound. Just one pound of fentanyl can kill over 200,000 people. In October of last year, in South Alabama, Baldwin County Sheriff deputies seized 14 grams of fentanyl – that’s enough to kill upwards of 7,000 people.”“The connection between President Biden’s open borders policies and the rise of fentanyl is clear. And the American people are paying a heavy price. Since President Biden’s inauguration, Customs and Border Protection seized nearly 3,000 pounds of illicit fentanyl. That’s a 41% increase from last year.”“Over the last year, opioids took the lives of 100,000 Americans. To put that into perspective, that is half the size of our capital city in the State of Alabama, would be almost wiped off the map. That is a bone chilling thought. But these numbers are more than a stat. They are sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers – all taken too soon; bright futures darkened by a deadly drug addiction.  I spent 40 years traveling the country, visiting young athletes and their families from every walk of life. I had players who battled addiction- or who had close friends who battled addiction. It is a heart breaking procedure to watch a student athlete worry about stepping in for parents who are suffering from addiction…when they should only be worrying about studying for an upcoming test.”“It’s true that drug addiction has plagued our country for decades. But we’ve seen a sharp rise since the pandemic. Isolation, loss of work, depression – all making the problem worse. And the data confirms this – so it would only make sense to do all we can to help Americans. That would include cutting off the drugs at the primary source – which is the southern border. Yet, the President refuses to take decisive action to stop these deadly substances from flooding into the country. In fact, the answer from the Biden administration is there will be a strategy for dealing with the addiction and fentanyl crisis coming ‘soon.’”“When President Biden’s drug czar, Rahul Gupta, was asked about the administration plans to address the addiction crisis, he responded that the drug control strategy was in its ‘advanced stages of being finalized.’ To that I say, Americans are losing their lives right now. Lives are being lost every day…  We don’t need a bureaucratic talking point– we need a plan and we need a plan now.”“While the folks at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue continue to work on their ‘strategy,’ I propose President Biden take a logical and long overdue first step today: enforce our immigration laws at the border, end the free flow of fentanyl, and stop the loss of innocent lives. For a White House that is so laser-focused on the health of Americans as it relates to the pandemic, the same emphasis is lost on safeguarding the health and lives of the American people against deadly drugs coming into our country illegally. By creating – and then failing to address – the disastrous situation at the southern border, President Biden has fueled another crisis as fentanyl ravages our communities.”“The President has the tools, and the authority, to act quickly and save lives.”Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-gop-armed-services-committee-members-press-biden-to-boost-defense-budget-by-5-above-inflation/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWashington – U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) joined his fellow Republican members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees to urge President Biden to include a 5 percent increase above inflation for the defense spending in his fiscal year 2023 budget request. In the letter, Tuberville and his colleagues on the House and Senate Armed Services Committee, encouraged the President to reject progressives’ push to cut or freeze defense spending, to target investments in programs that will “modernize the force and fill ongoing readiness gaps,” and to ensure that rate of growth outpaces current record levels of inflation. “As you prepare your fiscal year 2023 budget for submission to Congress, we strongly encourage you to reject the approach you took last year when you proposed to cut defense spending below the rate of inflation,” the members wrote. “Over the last year, the threats to our national security have grown exponentially. “This is a crucial period for our national security,” the letter continued. “If we do not make the investments our military needs today, we will not be able to defend our nation or our allies in the future. The security of the free world depends on a credible American military. We must work together to ensure the men and women of our Armed Services have the resources and support they need to successfully carry out their missions now and for decades to come.” The full letter can be read here and below: Dear President Biden, As you prepare your fiscal year 2023 (FY23) budget for submission to Congress, we strongly encourage you to reject the approach you took last year when you proposed to cut defense spending below the rate of inflation. Instead, we urge you to request a 5 percent increase over the inflation-adjusted FY22 enacted level. Since the publication of the 2018 National Defense Strategy, and particularly over the past year, the threats to our national security have grown exponentially. Unprecedented Chinese military modernization has left us behind in key areas in the Western Pacific, and each day the Chinese Communist Party more clearly shows us that its interests are diametrically opposed to ours. Putin’s aggression against Ukraine has already left us and our NATO allies less secure, and his appetite and erratic behavior is likely to grow. There is much more work to do in Eastern Europe to secure the peace.  Your decision to unconditionally withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan allowed terrorist organizations to regain their capability to strike the American homeland. Similarly, little progress has been made to deter the North Koreans, and Iranian aggression has escalated, with the potential for further escalation in the near future.We understand that despite these threats to our national security, many on the left continue to encourage you to cut or freeze spending on our national defense. As you know, during consideration of the FY22 National Defense Authorization Act and the FY22 Consolidated Appropriations Act, overwhelming bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress voted to reject that short-sighted approach. Instead, Congress acted in a bipartisan manner to provide nearly $30 billion more than you requested. We hope that action convinces you that overwhelming political support exists for increasing immediate investment in our national defense. We also urge you to use your FY23 budget request to target investments in programs that will modernize the force and fill ongoing readiness gaps. Specifically, it is imperative that we improve force proficiency on new battlefields such as cyber; continue work at DoD and the National Nuclear Security Administration to modernize our nuclear triad; grow our naval and projection forces; and quickly incorporate the latest innovations and enhancements into warfighting capabilities, including air and sealift, space, missile defense, munitions, and electronic warfare. Finally, in order to protect the buying power of these investments, we need to ensure the budget achieves real growth. Not since 1982 has our nation experienced this level of inflation. It is driving up the cost of fuel, supplies, and labor for the defense industrial base and the Department of Defense. Failing to provide a budget request that exceeds the rate of inflation equates to a cut in real dollars — a cut we can no longer afford. This is a crucial period for our national security. If we do not make the investments our military needs today, we will not be able to defend our nation or our allies in the future.  The security of the free world depends on a credible American military.  We must work together to ensure the men and women of our Armed Services have the resources and support they need to successfully carry out their missions now and for decades to come. Sincerely,Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-the-real-march-madness/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) today spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate about the “real” March madness: biological males competing in the 2022 NCAA Women’s Swimming and Diving Championship and the further erosion of Title IX protections for women’s athletics. The Senator emphasized the need to keep Title IX protections in place to provide female athletes a fair playing field and called for the passage of the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, legislation he cosponsored which would prohibit federal funds from going to athletic programs that do not uphold Title IX protections and ensure the definition of “sex” in Title IX is based “solely on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth.” Senator Tuberville also previously introduced an amendment prohibiting educational institutions from receiving federal funding if they allow biological males to compete in women’s sports.Excerpts from the Senator’s speech can be found below, and his remarks can be viewed here. “…the discussion should not about inclusivity. It should be about fairness.”“I would argue that by allowing biological males to compete in women’s athletics, Democrats have set serious efforts for women’s equality back by decades. And ultimately, this will have the effect of discouraging many young women from participating in sports.”“In a recent article, two parents of a current collegiate athlete said ‘I think the NCAA needs to change its policies, and find a way to include transgender women without trampling all over biological women.’ Well, the NCAA has been silent. They have failed to take decisive action in ensuring a level playing field for women.  And so now Congress must act to do so. This is why I joined Senator Mike Lee, and 16 fellow colleagues, in introducing the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2021.”“It is imperative for Congress to act so that an entire generation of women aren’t discouraged from pursuing their athletic dreams, whether on a field, court, or in a pool.” “Having been a coach for 40 years, I can attest, more so than anyone else in Congress, that there are fundamental physical differences between men and women. But you don’t have to take my word for it. A recent study concludes that, ‘On average, males have 40-50 precent greater upper limb strength, 20-40 precent greater lower limb strength, and an average of 12 pounds more skeletal muscle mass than age-matched females at any given body weight.’ ” “Title IX has provided women and girls the long-denied platform that had always been afforded to men and boys. It ensures female athletes had the same access to funding, facilities, and athletic scholarships. Before Title 9, female athletics received less than two percent of college athletic budgets — and athletic scholarships for women were virtually nonexistent. And since the 1970s, when I first started coaching, female participation at the college level has risen by more than 600 percent.”“This week’s NCAA championship will once again emphasize that this debate is not limited to the halls of Congress – but one that we’re seeing play out across the country. It is an undeniable fact that biological males have a physiological advantage over females. So, let me be clear: the question here is not should we be inclusive and supportive of all athletes – it is how. The first step the Senate can take to address the wrong that the NCAA has allowed to happen is to pass S.251. I ask my colleagues to stand up for America’s female athletes and support these efforts to preserve women’s sports.”Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

Biden, Jr.The White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.Washington, DC 20500Dear President Biden, We write today urging you to protect American investors from unwittingly financing Vladimir Putin’s war crimes against Ukraine through their investments in index funds, ETFs, bonds, and other securities. Many Russian companies remain present in the U.S. financial system, posing a risk to investors and providing capital to the Kremlin’s war machine.The undersigned seek increased sanctions on these Russian companies and institutions – including capital markets sanctions and secondary sanctions on those who seek to help Russia circumvent existing and future U.S. sanctions. While we commend the actions being taken to remove Russian companies from U.S. markets, more must be done to ensure U.S. investors are not supporting Russian companies that currently enjoy access to U.S. capital markets. We ask that you immediately take the following actions:After Russia’s illegal invasion of Crimea in 2014, the U.S. sanctioned eight major Russian companies.  The investment portfolios of more than 100 million American and European retail investors included investments related to these companies. Beyond the sanctions imposed and administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, four of these eight companies also appear on the Commerce Department’s “Entity List,” which prohibits the sale of U.S. equipment and technology to enterprises because of their egregious human rights and national security abuses. These companies include: Gazprom*, Sberbank, Lukoil*, Novatek, Surgutneftegaz*, Rosneft*, VTB Bank, and Transneft.[1]While we were encouraged by the administration’s efforts to sanction Gazprom, Sberbank, and VTB Bank, we strongly urge your administration to take additional action against the five other listed Russian companies already under U.S. sanctions from the 2014 invasion. We ask that full and immediate action be taken against all eight of these Russian companies and their affiliated entities to include freezing all trading of these securities immediately and suspending the purchase or sale of publicly traded Russian securities while Russia’s aggression continues. Aside from these companies, appropriate capital market sanctions on certain key Russian industries and companies should be considered, including any Russian military and cyberspace industrial complex companies and Russian energy companies who may have been complicit in Russia’s aggression toward Ukraine.Aiding and abetting Russia’s breach of Ukraine’s sovereignty and the violations of the international rules-based order must be met with sufficient consequences in a manner that deters future aggression. Secondary sanctions remain a powerful tool that can be implemented immediately to maximize the effectiveness of sanctions already in place on Russia. To pressure Russia to reverse course and end its occupation of Ukraine, all appropriate economic tools must be brought to bear.Sincerely,Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

It’s especially timely given that we all had to change our clocks this past weekend, and we are now experiencing longer, sunnier days. But it would be better news if longer, sunnier days were a new norm and not cause for a temporary, seasonal celebration. Which is why I hope my colleagues in the House of Representatives pass this bill quickly.”“Since I joined Senator Rubio in the effort to pass the Sunshine Protection Act, the phones in my office have absolutely been ringing off the hook in support of permanently adopting Daylight Saving Time.” “Moms and dads who want some more daylight before putting the kids to bed, so dinner time doesn’t feel like bedtime. Elderly people who want more sun in the evenings in order to take a walk, enjoy work in their yards. Farmers who could use the extra daylight to work in the fields – for them, it’s a better business model and adds to the bottom line.”“But it’s not just people in the state of Alabama – Americans across the country want to make Daylight Saving Time permanent. In fact, it is worth noting this bill has bipartisan support – evidence by the fact it passed with no objection here in the Senate mere moments ago. It is no secret how rare that is here in this Chamber.”“It is simply commonsense to update this outdated practice.”“That is why Alabama, along with 17 other state legislatures, have passed legislation or resolutions to flip the switch on this outdated practice and permanently increase our daylight hours. But these changes on the state level cannot take place until a federal law is passed. We’ve taken the first step today in the Senate by passing this bill.

The warning signs were very, very clear. The response from the Biden administration was anything but.““President Biden was slow to hit Putin where it hurts. He refused to penalize the Russian energy sector until roughly a week after the invasion took place.““President Biden has shown weakness on the world stage throughout his 40 plus years in politics. His foreign policy caves to adversaries, undermines our allies, and devalues the sacrifices of our men and women in uniform. In his first year of office, he abandoned 20 years of effort in Afghanistan and emboldened Putin to attack his neighbor. And as I speak, the White House is [reviving] Iran’s hope of developing a nuclear weapon. Originally brokered when Joe Biden was Vice President, the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, more commonly known as the JCPOA or the Iran Deal, was a deeply flawed agreement aimed at preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. In reality, it did the exact opposite. Nuclear security can’t be achieved with wishful thinking, watered down sanctions, or by sending our adversaries planeloads of cash. Years later, we all know the result – the Iran Deal didn’t work.““If working with, and propping up, Russia isn’t bad enough, Iran is poised to receive billions of dollars from frozen assets in this new agreement, including funds from renewed oil exports. Rather than unleashing the power of the American energy industry and allowing Americans to drill, drill, drill on our own soil the Biden administration would rather do business with Venezuela and plead with Saudi Arabia to turn on the spigots.““I have a long list of concerns about how these negotiations are unfolding, but at the top are the limited sanctions the administration appears to be open to in exchange for a short-term pause on the development of Tehran’s nuclear program. Let me be clear, these short-term sanctions are not a solution. They weren’t a few years ago, and they’re not today. The administration must not allow Tehran obtain a nuclear weapon.““The Iran [Nuclear] Deal was a bad deal in 2015 and it would be a worse deal today. The Biden administration should immediately walk away from the negotiating table before these discussions lead to yet another Biden foreign policy disaster.“Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

The board previously approved a plan to invest billions of dollars in Chinese companies until the policy was overturned during the Trump administration. The Trump-era ban on TSP investment in China is no longer in place, raising questions as to if the board has returned to its previous plan to invest in Chinese companies.  A copy of the letter can be found here and below. March 14, 2022The Honorable David A. JonesActing ChairmanFederal Retirement Thrift Investment Board77 K Street, NE, Suite 1000Washington, DC 20002Dear Acting Chairman Jones,I write to inquire about the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board’s (FRTIB) current policy with regards to International Stock Index Investment Fund (I Fund) investment in China and Russia.As you are aware, a 2017 decision by the FRTIB would have linked the Thrift Savings Plan’s (TSP) I Fund to the MSCI ACWI ex USA Investable Market Index. This would have led to the investment of billions of dollars of federal military and civilian employee retirement savings in Chinese companies. Senior officials in President Trump’s administration rightly intervened prior to the implementation of the FRTIB’s decision by calling for the board to halt its plans. At a FRTIB board meeting held on January 26, 2021, shortly after the inauguration of President Biden, the minutes reflect that you “entertained a motion to affirm the [FRTIB’s] current investment policies.” What are the FRTIB’s current I Fund investment policies? Was the intent or result of this motion to link the I Fund with the MSCI ACWI ex USA Investment Market Index benchmark? If so, why were the minutes not transparent? Is the I Fund or any other TSP fund investing in Chinese securities? Does the FRTIB have any plans to invest TSP funds in Chinese securities? Is the I Fund or any other TSP fund investing in Russian securities?  Does the FRTIB have any plans to invest TSP funds in Russian securities? Clarification on these points is needed before the Senate can proceed with a vote on President Biden’s five nominees to the FRTIB. I intend to place holds on all nominees to the FRTIB until clear answers are provided for each question posed in this letter.Sincerely,Tommy TubervilleUnited States SenatorSenator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

And then Putin would have seen this, and said, ‘You know, I might not want to do this.’ We should have put the sanctions on [ahead of an invasion].”“It’s just unfortunate. We waited too long, we waited way too long, to help these people. We’re playing behind the eight ball.” On China Siding with Russia:  “They’re [China] taking notes every day. This has all started with Afghanistan – the debacle we had there. I don’t think Putin would have ever done this [invade Ukraine] if he had not seen a weak President like we’ve got now in terms of military. Xi Jinping is looking at this. He understands.

The letter highlights concerns with operational constraints being placed on companies from COVID and inflation, and emphasizes their importance to military readiness and national security.“The C&T base enables military readiness, ensuring that America’s warfighters have access to the mission-critical textiles, apparel, and equipage to protect our nation…” Tuberville and Sewell wrote.“Without immediate action, many of these companies will be forced to withdraw from all military- related business or close operations outright. Our nation’s manufacturers, manufacturing workforce, and men and women in uniform need swift, targeted action from the administration,” the Members of Congress continued.A copy of the letter can be found here and below. March 8, 2022The Honorable Andrew HunterUnder Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Department of Defense3010 Defense PentagonWashington DC 20301-3010 Dear Mr. Hunter: We write to request your assistance regarding the U.S. Clothing and Textile (C&T) Manufacturing Defense Industrial Base.The C&T base enables military readiness, ensuring that America’s warfighters have access to the mission-critical textiles, apparel, and equipage to protect our nation. The men and women who wear the cloth of the nation do so proudly. We are proud that 100% of these items are manufactured in the United States. On average, the Department of Defense (DOD) procures nearly $2 billion worth of military textiles, helmets, armor, footwear and clothing annually, through the purchase of over 8,000 items. Dozens of U.S. factories, employing tens of thousands of U.S. workers in the textile, apparel, and footwear industries are proud to support our warfighters.For 80 years, Congress has recognized that an effective national defense requires robust domestic capacity for textiles and clothing. The Berry Amendment ensures that these vital industries are called out for different and enhanced procurement procedures relative to other government procurement. Although the Berry Amendment protects the C&T base from offshore competition, it cannot insulate the base from problematic contracting practices, unpredictable DOD demand, and increases in material and labor costs. Each of these factors have made it unsustainable to continue to produce clothing, ballistic protection, and equipage for the U.S. military.Many companies are now operating on Firm Fixed Price contracts that were awarded before the current COVID economic and health crises were realized. Fixed price contracts make it impossible for companies to react to changing business conditions — such as those that have whipsawed domestic industry over the past two years. Costs for labor, health care, freight, energy, and materials have all suddenly and unexpectedly increased by double digits over the past 18 months and show no sign of abatement. Many manufacturers are unable to offer competitive wages, further exacerbating acute labor shortages. These higher costs coupled with a lack of economic price adjustment mechanisms from DOD mean companies are often forced to perform on contracts at a financial loss simply to retain business and keep workers employed in the hopes that a future contract will make up for current losses. Even if they can eke out a slim profit, these companies rarely have enough to reinvest in their business for training or equipment. Unfortunately, many companies with long track records of supporting the warfighter have already left the industrial base. In just the past few years, longtime industry stalwarts such as Campbellsville Knits (Kentucky), Racoe Manufacturing (Tennessee), and DeRossi & Sons (New Jersey) have all closed.The C&T manufacturers who support our military readiness request your immediate help to make sure the Department of Defense has the authority and funding necessary so that Berry-compliant C&T contracts in distress can be adjusted to give U.S. companies and their workers the wherewithal to survive.Without immediate action, many of these companies will be forced to withdraw from all military- related business or close operations outright. Our nation’s manufacturers, manufacturing workforce, and men and women in uniform need swift, targeted action from the administration. Thank you for your attention to this request — we look forward to working with you to resolve this pressing issue.Sincerely,Tommy Tuberville                                                                                         Terri A.

It increases depression and decreases productivity in about half of my psychiatric patients…’ These messages make important points, and I couldn’t agree more.““Daylight Saving Time should be a thing of the past – because it literally is. Introduced as a temporary measure during World War I, Daylight Saving Time was originally called ‘war time,’ and it was a way to help conserve fuel and better utilize resources.““Kids get out of school and the sun is starting to set, families in their kitchens cooking dinner feels more like a bedtime dinner. Weekends have less sunlight hours, limiting the amount of time folks of all ages can spend enjoying the outdoors. Additionally, reduced levels of sunlight are known to disrupt the body’s internal clock which regulates sleep and alertness. It is no wonder that cases of SAD or Seasonal Affective Disorder are much more common in the winter months than they are in the spring. And for our farmers, longer days mean more time to work in the field under sunlight which translates to a more profitable bottom line. From an economic perspective, the time change costs the United States economy an estimated $430 million dollars annually when accounting for lost productivity….““The Sunshine Protection Act makes sense from a health and economic perspective.

If we are going to get our economy back up and running, we need to do it correctly and that begins with utilizing the talent we have here at home first and foremost,” said Senator Tuberville.First introduced in 2007, the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act will require U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to prioritize for the first time the annual allocation of H-1B visas.  The new system would ensure that the best and brightest STEM advanced degree students educated in the United States receive preference for an H-1B visa, and also prioritize other U.S. advanced degree holders, those being paid a high wage, and those with valuable skills.The legislation explicitly prohibits the replacement of American workers by H-1B or L-1 visa holders, and clarifies that the working conditions of similarly employed American workers may not be adversely affected by the hiring of an H-1B worker, including H-1B workers who have been placed by another employer at the American worker’s worksite.Importantly, the legislation will crack down on outsourcing companies that import large numbers of H-1B and L-1 workers for temporary training purposes only to send the workers back to their home countries to do the same job.  Specifically, the bill would prohibit companies with more than 50 employees, of which at least half are H-1B or L-1 holders, from hiring additional H-1B employees.  The bill gives the U.S. Department of Labor enhanced authority to review, investigate, and audit employer compliance with program requirements, as well as to penalize fraudulent or abusive conduct.  It requires the production of extensive statistical data about the H-1B and L-1 programs, including wage data, worker education levels, place of employment, and gender. In addition, the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act  includes several reforms of the L-1 visa program, including establishment of a wage floor for L-1 workers; authority for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to investigate, audit, and enforce compliance with L-1 program requirements; assurance that intra-company transfers occur between legitimate branches of a company and do not involve “shell” facilities; and a change to the definition of “specialized knowledge” to ensure that L-1 visas are reserved only for truly key personnel.A copy of the bill text can be found here.Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

Specific answers to these questions are vital before Congress considers additional COVID-19 funding requests from the White House.“Recent news reports indicate the Administration is poised to request an additional $30 billion from Congress for its response to COVID-19,” the senators wrote. “While we have supported historic, bipartisan measures in the United States Senate to provide unprecedented investments in vaccines, therapeutics, and testing, it is not yet clear why additional funding is needed.”“…Since passage of the American Rescue Plan in February, questions are mounting about where exactly the additional money has gone,” the senators continued. “A recent investigative report from the Washington Post headlined, “‘Immense fraud’ creates immense task for Washington as it tries to tighten scrutiny of $6 trillion in emergency coronavirus spending” details the federal government’s shocking failure to provide the American public with a faithful accounting of how it has spent its money.”“Before we would consider supporting an additional $30 billion for COVID-19 relief, Congress must receive a full accounting of how the government has already spent the first $6 trillion,” the senators concluded.Joining Tuberville in penning the letter include Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), John Boozman (R-AR), Mike Braun (R-IN), Richard Burr (R-NC), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), John Cornyn (R-TX), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Steve Daines (R-MT), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Josh Hawley (R-MS), John Hoeven (R-ND), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Rob Portman (R-OH), Jim Risch (R-ID), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Tim Scott (R-SC), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), John Thune (R-SD), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Todd Young (R-IN).Full text of the letter can be found below.Dear Mr. President:Recent news reports indicate the Administration is poised to request an additional $30 billion from Congress for its response to COVID-19. While we have supported historic, bipartisan measures in the United States Senate to provide unprecedented investments in vaccines, therapeutics, and testing, it is not yet clear why additional funding is needed.Since March 2020, the federal government has borrowed trillions of dollars to combat the virus and provide relief to families and businesses. By March 11, 2021, the day you signed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act into law, Congress had already approved over $3.8 trillion in COVD-19 relief. All told, the nearly $6 trillion in spending on COVID-19 is the single greatest expenditure of public funds on one effort in the history of the nation.However, since passage of the American Rescue Plan in February, questions are mounting about where exactly the additional money has gone.A recent investigative report from the Washington Post headlined, “’Immense fraud’ creates immense task for Washington as it tries to tighten scrutiny of $6 trillion in emergency coronavirus spending” details the federal government’s shocking failure to provide the American public with a faithful accounting of how it has spent its money.“Nearly two years later, however, the stimulus data is voluminous yet vexing — for the public and the government alike. The spending portal does not offer a real-time, detailed view as to the way cities, states, schools, hospitals and others actually have deployed broad swaths of the cash they received. In education, for example, federal records show more than $81 billion set aside for school districts in response to the pandemic. Yet the information is 90 days old in some cases and offers no insight as to what those communities actually did once they obtained the grants.”“By 2021, Biden’s top aides intensified the work to improve the oversight process, particularly after the passage of the American Rescue Plan last March. Yet the efforts failed to satisfy lawmakers, federal watchdogs, health professionals and ethics experts, a dozen of whom said in interviews that they have struggled to answer the most basic questions — including how much money has been spent, and how, in critical areas such as testing.” (emphasis added)Before we would consider supporting an additional $30 billion for COVID-19 relief, Congress must receive a full accounting of how the government has already spent the first $6 trillion.In an effort to better understand your reported request for supplemental appropriations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we respectfully ask the Administration to answer the following questions:We strongly believe Americans should continue to take precautionary measures to protect against the pandemic, and it must be an urgent priority that the trillions of taxpayer dollars already appropriated are being spent effectively.Sincerely,Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"
https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-speaks-on-russias-unjustified-war-and-u-s-response/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) today on the U.S. Senate floor discussed the global impacts of Vladimir Putin’s unjustified war against Ukraine. Senator Tuberville highlighted the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) joint effort to rebuke Putin and stressed the need for America to gain energy independence.  Excerpts from Senator Tuberville’s remarks can be found below, and the full video can be found here. “Putin’s terror is hard to watch, but it’s important we not look away. Amid it all, we’re seeing examples of heroism, hearing stories of strength.““And all the while President Zelensky has stayed. He has not abandoned his country even though he knows Putin’s goal is to topple the Ukrainian government…He planted his feet and squared his shoulders for the fight, rallying his fellow countrymen to do the same. And Ukrainian citizens are following suit, showing true bravery in the face of madness.““It’s clear Mr. Putin underestimated the Ukrainians’ will to fight. While Ukrainians are handing Russia a tough fight, we know there will be hard days ahead.““Mr. Putin’s rationale for invading was the ‘demilitarization and de-Nazification of Ukraine’ – arguing that if Ukraine joined NATO, the West would have an excuse to invade Russia. That is paranoia. That is delusion. That doesn’t sound like a strong leader, it sounds like a weakling. Putin was betting that NATO would fold and countries would turn against one another. But if anything, Putin’s bullying has strengthened NATO.““As it currently stands, this is not a fight for American troops. But if a NATO country is threatened, we need to act. Facts could change, therefore polices have to change. Which is why we need to continue to impose harsh financial sanctions and project strength.““Another step we must take is to regain energy independence. We import nearly 600,000 barrels of oil per day from Russia. The Keystone Pipeline would have provided us 800,000 barrels per day. Last week, ahead of the invasion, President Biden admitted, ‘defending freedom will have costs for us at home as well.‘”“Gas prices began to soar long before Putin waged war in Ukraine, starting with the president’s first day in office when he blocked the Keystone Pipeline and undercut our nation’s energy independence. Russia ramped up aggression against Ukraine at the same time as the administration was cancelling 80 million acres of oil and gas leases. ‘Green’ policies here at home have pushed us to seek energy abroad, and our country is paying the price. President Biden has again admitted that we might need to dip into our oil reserves. But why not dig into them? This is no time to be a purist and think others can bail us out – the United States of America is a energy rich nation but we must have smart polices in place to use it. This is an economic and national security issue. You cannot have a strong economy without low-cost energy – and ridding ourselves of our reliance on Russian energy is a matter of national urgency.““As our country prepares to hear from President Biden tonight on the state of our union, I urge the president to project a strong path forward: to double down on investments in our military and to put forth policies to ensure we regain energy independence. If the state of our union here at home is strong, it will only serve to strengthen our standing abroad.“Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

Families across the nation were watching and waiting for the President to address the issues keeping them up at night. Americans deserve a plan to combat rising prices and secure our borders. They deserve answers about the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Americans who were stranded there. And they deserve a commitment to regain America’s energy independence after it was completely undermined by the president’s embrace of far-Left climate policies.““Tonight, these real-world problems were willingly overlooked by President Biden, who instead focused on ways to pull our country farther Left. For example, he touted an infrastructure package that will spend more on his radical climate agenda than on repairing our roads and bridges. This moment required strong leadership and accountability. President Biden failed to deliver.“###"
https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-hawley-introduce-bill-restoring-american-energy-independence-lowering-reliance-on-foreign-nations/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) joined U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) to introduce the American Energy Independence Act of 2022, which reverses President Biden’s shutdown of the American energy sector and returns American energy to full production. The bill is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Bill Hagerty (R-TN). Companion legislation has been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Representative Ronny Jackson (R-TX-13).“Pushing unsustainable energy policies here at home has led us to become dependent on energy abroad, and our country is paying the price for the administration’s decisions,” said Senator Tuberville. “The United States is an energy rich nation, but we need to have smart policies in place to harness that energy and regain energy independence.”  “To be strong and free as a nation, we must be energy independent. My bill will reverse Joe Biden’s disastrous energy surrender that has allowed Russian energy dominance and instead open up American production full-throttle,” said Senator Hawley. “To stand up to aggressors like Vladimir Putin, we can and we must work to power our nation and the world.“Immediately following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the price of oil rose to over $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014. Gas and energy prices for working Americans are quickly rising to new highs. The Biden Administration has been reluctant to sanction the Russian energy sector, due no doubt to the United States’ dangerous dependence on foreign energy. At the same time, European countries, particularly Germany, are heavily dependent on Russian natural gas. Shortly after coming into office, President Biden cancelled the Keystone XL Pipeline, blocked new oil and gas leases, issued regulations designed to stymie domestic energy investment, and advocated for measures that focus more on Green New Deal priorities than on American security.Text for the American Energy Independence Act of 2022 can be found here. Background The American Energy Independence Act of 2022 will:Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

Over the weekend, Senator Tuberville attended the Munich Security Conference with a bipartisan delegation to discuss tensions in Eastern Europe.“As we’ve seen from Putin’s aggression, strongly-worded statements don’t stop wars. Rather than discuss a diplomatic resolution, Putin chose to invade Ukraine and test world order. His actions must be met with a tough and targeted response.“For 80 years, Americans have sacrificed to bring security and peace to the European continent. The events of the past 24 hours underscore that it is time for Europe to contribute more to its own security. The United States should support Ukraine and provide assistance to Ukraine’s military through weapons and funding for emergency equipment while leveling tough and targeted sanctions to halt Russian escalations and cripple Russia’s economy. The incremental sanctions issued by President Biden today are a weak response – the time to have imposed harsh sanctions was yesterday.“Allies and adversaries across the globe are watching and they must be left with no doubt about our strength and resolve. Strength abroad starts with strength at home through investments in our military readiness and 21st century capabilities. We must be ready for future conflicts and refrain from having American bloodshed in fights without American interests.“I call on my colleagues in the U.S. Senate and our allies to ensure Russia pays a heavy price for Putin’s aggression.“Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

They wouldn’t do it. We can’t get to them [Germany] to firmly say no more Nord Stream if they [Russia] come into Ukraine.

He toys with sovereign nations. And he plays by an entirely different set of rules – his own. And when President, Biden signals that our words are hollow or that we will disregard our allies, our adversaries – like Putin – take notice.”“Putin’s goal is to deter Ukraine from joining NATO. He wants their pro-democracy government to collapse, Ukrainians to abandon their resolve, [and] to take over the country that largely despises him. He wants a buffer between him and the West. And he wants the United States to step aside and let him do this. To be clear, we do not want American bloodshed in Ukraine. But neither do the Ukrainians. Late last year, I traveled to Ukraine with several other Members of Congress to meet with President Zelensky. The Ukrainian President told me: Ukrainians don’t want American boots on the ground. Ukrainians are willing and ready to fight their own fight. All they ask for is support. Not blankets and helmets. But small arms, anti-tank missiles, and other weapons.”“When Russia was amassing troops along the Ukraine border, President Biden was giving a blistering speech about voting rights – saying that everyone who disagrees with him wants to destroy our country. Instead of studying war plans on Afghanistan or addressing the growing threats from Russia and China, our service members were forced to spend hours upon hours on ‘woke’ training – not on readiness… But the missed opportunities don’t stop at the administration. The Senate already missed a chance to hit Putin where it hurts. A few weeks ago, Senate Republicans voted in support of sanctions on Russia’s pipeline through Europe – the Nord Stream 2. Senate Democrats refused to support these sanctions – who are they more afraid of, President Biden or Putin?”“Aggression must be met with resolve. We need to bring the full might of sanctions and squeeze Russia’s economy so tightly it chokes Putin’s wealth – this includes sanctions on Nord Stream 2 and actions like delisting Russian companies in our capital markets…”“We need to get back to what makes our country so great in the first place…That means we make the necessary investments to modernize our military. The highest possible percentage of money we spend at the Department of Defense should go to building a killing machine.”“We have to get our fiscal house in order… Inflation has engulfed our economy. Families face bare grocery shelves and gas that is more in some places than $5 a gallon. Our national debt just crested $30 trillion dollars – amounting to almost $100,000 per citizen… We need to return [to] free market enterprise with less government intervention.”“We have to return to championing that spirit of American resolve and determination – in all facets of life. The strength of our nation depends on it. The future of our nation depends on it. After this dark year marked by uncertainty, Americans are ready to return to the path of American independence. Americans across the country want to reignite the American dream and rekindle American ingenuity.”“This is something all of us – from Members of Congress to our President – should want. Putin thinks that because our President has projected weakness, America is weak. How wrong he is. To Russia and China, I say, betting against the United States and rolling the dice against Ukraine, or Taiwan, is a losing game.”Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"

The lessons learned on the field contribute to athletes’ success off the field. For example, the value of discipline, hard work, how to deal with success and failure, how to be a leader, [and] the importance of putting the interests of the team ahead of the individual. But many of these lessons are only realized when there is a fair and level playing field. And that is why Title IX protections have been so transformational for women and girls’ sports.”“Title IX provided women and girls the long-denied platform that had always been afforded to men and boys. It ensured female athletes had the same access to funding, facilities, and athletic scholarships. Before Title IX, female [athletics] received less than two percent of college athletic budgets — and athletic scholarships for women were virtually nonexistent.”“Today, 43 percent of high school girls participate in competitive sports. And since the 1970s, when I first started coaching, female participation at the college level has risen by [more than] 600 percent.”“Additionally, America’s female athletes are routinely the best-performing on the world stage, in both team and individual sports. In the 2016 Olympics, we saw the largest number of U.S. female Olympians in history. It’s clear – we have made important strides. But recently, the adoption of policies for transgender athletes have negatively impacted the rights, privacy, safety, and achievements of women and girls in sports.”“When then-nominee for Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education, James Kvaal testified before the committee, I pressed him on the administration’s position of the administration’s commitment of upholding Title IX and protecting the rights of women. As expected, he failed to articulate how Title IX would be protected under the Biden administration.”“To appease the demands of the left, sports organizations, from grade school to professional leagues, are focusing on the concept of being ‘inclusive,’ at the expense of being fair.” “The NCAA had the perfect opportunity to stand up for women and girls, and they blew it.”“By punting responsibility, the NCAA leaves the door open for the continued erosion of Title IX protections at the expense of women’s athletics and continues to chip away at great unifier that Americans know and love.  We need to do better for women’s athletics all across the country.”“There is no pre-game speech you can give a woman or a girl who feels like they aren’t competing on a fair playing field – no pep talk can touch Title IX’s thirty-seven words that changed everything for women’s sports over 50 years ago. It afforded women and girls the same athletic opportunities that their male counterparts have always had — and we should continue to fight for all the young girls in the future of this country.”Senator Tommy Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans’ Affairs, and HELP Committees.###"
https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tuberville-introduces-legislation-to-streamline-post-9-11-gi-bill-benefits/,"Newsroom &vert; Press ReleasesLegislation will ensure GI bill benefits can be transferred to eligible dependentsWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) today introduced legislation to require the U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to modify language used on official VA and DoD forms to clarify the information required when a service member elects to have their GI Bill benefit transferred to a dependent. There are multiple examples of service members misreading the information requested in the GI Bill benefit transfer forms, resulting in eligible dependents being barred from education benefits due to an easily amendable error. The VA and DoD cannot amend the information on the form without this statutory authority. “Our service members and their families sacrifice greatly for our freedoms, and it isn’t right that confusing paperwork can get in the way of a dependent receiving education benefits after the tragedy of losing a loved one,” said Senator Tuberville. “This legislation provides a simple fix that can make a big difference to our service members and their families in Alabama and across the nation. It fulfills the wish of those who have honorably served and guarantees this earned benefit is preserved.”“We owe veterans and their families more than we’ll ever actually be able to repay,” said Senator Thune. “I am happy to join Senators Tuberville and Rubio in supporting this common-sense legislation that would cut through red tape and make it easier for veteran families to receive the benefits they so rightly deserve.““TAPS is grateful to Senator Tuberville for introducing legislation to ensure surviving spouses and children who are using transferred entitlement are not disqualified due to a technicality. This much needed legislation will give the Department of Veterans Affairs the authority to remove the end date on transferred entitlement and strengthens benefits for surviving families,” said Bonnie Carroll, President and Founder Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS)Background: A service member may transfer their Post-9/11 GI bill benefits to a spouse or child so long as the service member has done the following:Part of the transfer form requires the service member fill out a field labeled “end date.” This field refers to the date on which the benefit is no longer available to the dependent. Since this field is the cause of many incorrectly completed transfer forms, this bill would remove the “end date” to prevent further issues. The benefit would then naturally expire on the dependent’s 26th birthday, per statute.Senators John Thune (R-SD), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Mike Braun (R-IN), Tim Scott (R-SC), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Raphael Warnock (D-GA) are original cosponsors of this legislation. Representatives Greg Murphy, M.D. (NC-03), Cindy Axne (IA-03) and David Trone (MD-06) introduced the companion bill in the U.S. House of Representatives. This legislation is supported by the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), a national organization focused on providing compassionate care for all those grieving the death of a military loved one.###"
