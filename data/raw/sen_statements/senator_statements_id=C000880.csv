The Second Amendment is a fundamental right of law-abiding American citizens.The letter reads, in part, “This decision, which is already being hailed by radical anti-gun activists, is the first step toward backdoor gun control on law-abiding Americans… Creating a new merchant code for gun transactions is a choice being made by each of your companies. You are choosing the side of gun control advocates over the privacy and Second Amendment rights of millions of law-abiding Americans… Your companies are the facilitators of the vast majority of daily financial transactions in America, and that gives you incredible influence over everyday commerce, and thus every American’s very way of life. If you are intent on abusing that influence you will leave Congress no choice but to intercede on behalf of our constituents and all of the law abiding Americans who will not stand by as large banks and the payment networks that serve them do an end run around their constitutional Second Amendment rights to keep and bear arms…”The Senators concluded their letter by requesting answers from the CEOs related to what factors influenced each company to settle on this new policy, how the recategorization of gun sales backs up claims that the action would reduce gun violence and if customers would be able to continue to use these companies’ services without discrimination, among other issues.Click HERE to read the full letter."

https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/crapo-inflation-impacting-idahos-agriculture-industry-is-out-of-control,"Twin Falls, Idaho--Thursday, U.S. Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) led Idaho agricultural producers in a news conference on the inflationary pressure impacting Idaho’s agriculture industry. “Sustained high inflation impacting Idaho’s agriculture industry is out of control,” Crapo said.  “The party-line budget reconciliation bills Congressional Democrats pursued the past two years only added fuel to the inflation fire with unwarranted increases in federal spending.  Further, the tax increases in the ‘Inflation Reduction Act’ will only make matters worse by increasing burdens on businesses that continue to deal with supply-chain disruptions and the added costs of delivering goods to the marketplace.” Crapo was joined at the conference by Idaho Farm Bureau CEO Zak Miller and Twin Falls County Farm Bureau President Larry Hollifield.  Miller and Hollifield added to the Senator’s concerns regarding sustained high inflation and its impacts on Idaho’s producers. “As a farmer, we are used to good and bad years; that is normal,” Hollifield said.  “However, there is a great concern about inflated farm inputs. We don’t know how long they are going to last.”As the Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over international trade, Crapo continues to put pressure on the Biden Administration to pursue more trade agreements.“Sound trade policies that open more international markets to Idaho-produced agricultural goods are also another critical area we can fight inflation and increase economic opportunities for our Gem State agricultural producers,” Crapo said.

https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/crapo-votes-against-democrats-damaging-tax-and-spend-bill,"Democrats double down on failed strategy that has led to sky-high inflation, economic stagnationWashington, D.C.--U.S. Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, today voted against the Democrats’ mislabeled “Inflation Reduction Act,” a partisan, filibuster-proof budget proposal that does nothing to bring the economy out of stagnation and recession, and instead gives Americans higher taxes, more spending, higher prices and an army of IRS agents.   “At the beginning of this Congress, my Democrat colleagues used this same process to ram through the ‘American Rescue Plan’ along party lines, with promises that $1.9 trillion of debt-financed spending was going to save the country and fix everyone’s concerns,” said Crapo.  “Where are we today?  Inflation at 9.1 percent, which we told them was coming.  Gas prices have doubled.  Economic stagnation.  Semantic arguments about what defines a recession, like the one Democrats are making, miss the point.  Sixty-five percent of Americans already think we are in a recession, and more than eighty percent of the country say our economy is on the wrong track.  We should be working together on policies to bring us out of this economic quagmire, but the bill we voted on today doubles down on a tried-and-failed tax-and-spend strategy.  This bill does nothing to address the significant inflation we are facing, or to ease burdens born today by low- and middle-income Americans.  Rather, it promises higher taxes, more reckless spending, higher prices, a supersized IRS and prolonged stagflation. “Before the pandemic, we were experiencing one of the strongest economies in a lifetime.  Employment was up, wages were up, capital formation came back to the United States, and the inflation rate hovered around 1.5 percent.  We know pro-growth policies work, and I will continue to fight for them.” As Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Crapo spoke on the Senate Floor against the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending spree, outlining concerns with proposals to increase taxes on Americans across all incomes.  You can read those remarks here.  Senate Republicans filed hundreds of amendments to blunt the worst provisions in the legislation.  As the lead Republican of the Senate Finance Committee, Crapo offered several commonsense amendments to the Democrats’ social spending spree, none of which were adopted.  Crapo’s amendments included:  Prohibiting the Use of Additional IRS Funding to Audit Taxpayers with Taxable Income Under $400,000: Democrats’ bill included a massive $80 billion in unaccountable funding for the IRS, more than half of which is dedicated to enforcement.  This amendment would have prevented the use of additional IRS funds from being used for audits of taxpayers with incomes below $400,000 in order to protect low- and middle-income earning American taxpayers from an onslaught of audits from an army of new IRS auditors funded by an unprecedented, nearly $80 billion, infusion of new funds. While Democrats chose to shirk their professed “intent” and misdirect with stale rhetoric about “tax cheats” and “the rich,” none chose to vote for this amendment which independent analysts have shown would protect middle-class American workers and small businesses from increased taxes resulting from an audit tsunami released by the Democrat-supersized IRS. Protecting Taxpayers from IRS Targeting for Political, Religious, or Ideological Beliefs: This amendment would have prevented the use of additional IRS funds for audits of taxpayers with incomes below $400,000, or targeting of taxpayers for political, religious, or ideological beliefs.  Preventing New IRS Systems to Monitor Taxpayers’ Bank Accounts: The Administration has proposed allowing the IRS to monitor the transactions of deposits and withdrawals of Americans who have more than $10,000 worth of transactions in a year—a pernicious bank-reporting dragnet.  While explicit language authorizing the Democrats’ desire to snoop on Americans’ bank transactions was not included in the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, Crapo’s amendment would have prevented the IRS from using funding to construct or operate a system for providing information on and monitoring taxpayer flows of deposits or withdrawals in taxpayers’ private accounts with financial institutions or payment providers in order to protect taxpayer privacy.   Replacing Bureaucratic Drug Price Controls with Solutions that Lower Costs while Ensuring Access to Life-Saving New Treatments and Cures: This amendment would have replaced the system of bureaucratic drug price controls that will lead to higher launch prices, stifle growth, gut domestic manufacturing jobs and aid foreign adversaries, like China, with Crapo’s Lower Costs, More Cures Act, legislation that would lower prescription drug prices and encourage new treatments.  Protecting Taxpayer Data and Preventing Data Leaks: This amendment would have provided for the use of Internal Revenue Service funds to further privacy protections against leaks of private, legally protected taxpayer data outside of the Internal Revenue Service, as we have seen with leaks of private, legally-protected individual taxpayer data to the pro-tax media group ProPublica, and for establishment of universal audit trails to track the utilization and access of personal taxpayer data at the IRS to monitor who within and outside of the IRS is looking at your personal tax information. Redirect $80 billion IRS Slush Fund to Shore Up Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund: Rather than provide an unprecedented $80 billion infusion of taxpayer funds to the IRS, this amendment would have repurposed the use of those taxpayer resources to help shore up the nearly-exhausted Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. ###"

That same model concludes that there is “low confidence that the legislation will have any impact on inflation.” But it does have an impact on all of us and our economy.  The bill does nothing to bring the economy out of stagnation and recession.  Rather, the “Inflation Reduction Act of 2022” gives us higher taxes, more spending, higher prices, and an army of IRS agents.  On tax hikes:  Hundreds of billions of dollars raised through taxes–around $350 to $400 billion.  There’s a new book minimum tax on corporations; a new tax on stock buybacks…  There’s—believe it or not—a new tax on gasoline, on oil and gas and refineries at the very time when our President has shut down production of oil and gas on our interior and offshore, and has stopped the Keystone XL pipeline, basically freezing America’s production and driving us from a state of energy independence to a state of energy dependence, where we have to ask our friends and often our enemies across the globe to increase their gas production to help us deal with our prices at the pump.   Everyone in America knows that corporations don’t bear the burden of the taxes we put on them.  Who does?  Workers, consumers and owners.   My colleagues are quick to say this is just rich people and rich companies who are “tax cheats.”  But the owners of the corporations are primarily people in America who have retired and are leaning on a pension, or who have not yet retired or are trying to save money for retirement by putting their money into 401(k)s or other investment programs.  That’s who bears the burden of these taxes.  On the costs of the bill outweighing purported benefits:  In response to this data that we’ve been able to show about the very tax proposals in this bill the Democrats surprisingly have claimed that this Joint Tax Committee analysis isn’t valid because it didn’t include the effects of their spending that they were putting into the bill.    Well that’s a novel idea—it’s okay to raise taxes and it’s okay to put more tax burden on people making less than $400,000 because we’re going to be sending some subsidies to some of them.  So, we asked the JCT to include those subsidies in its analysis. The analysis that incorporated the Obamacare subsidies shows that burdens of the proposed tax increases in the Democrats’ reckless bill would be so substantial and so widespread throughout all income categories—I repeat, all income categories—that no amount of temporary health care credits, or subsidies for $80,000 luxury SUVs, will overcome the tax increase burdens that would be overwhelmingly felt by lower- and middle-income Americans. On prescription drug price controls:  The largest source of proposed savings in the Democrats’ bill is a system of bureaucratic drug price controls that will lead to higher launch prices, stifle growth, gut domestic manufacturing jobs and aid foreign adversaries, like China.  Senate Republicans have developed a commonsense alternative, based on more than two dozen solutions aimed at providing relief at the pharmacy counter while ensuring long-term access to life-saving new treatments and cures.   These are the kinds of solutions that our prescriptions drug pricing system requires, not an arbitrary and offensive federal price-fixing program.   On plans to supersize the IRS:  This bill proposes $80 billion in mandatory appropriations to the IRS.  Let me give you a little perspective—the annual budget of the IRS is only about $12.6 billion.  Nearly six times the annual budget of the current IRS.  Of this, $45.6 billion is for enforcement purposes.  That’s more than 57 percent, almost 60 percent of this $80 billion is for enforcement purposes.   Some estimate the $46 billion for an army of auditors may allow the IRS to hire as many as 87,000 new agents.  That would make the IRS one of the largest federal agencies--larger than the Pentagon, State Department, FBI, and Border Patrol combined. … Multiple studies show that in order to raise the money they are requiring to be raised under this bill, around $200 billion of more tax revenue from Americans by auditing them, they have nowhere else to look.  …In response to this criticism, they included a sentence that said, “nothing in this bill is ‘intended’--focus on that word, nothing in this bill is “intended”—to increase taxes on those making less than $400,000.” Why did they use the word “intended”?  Because they know that’s not what they want to happen, but it’s what will have to happen, and they are not willing to use a stronger word.  I have asked them, and I will ask them in an amendment on this Floor, to say that “none of this money can be used to audit taxpayers making less than $400,000 a year.” Let’s see how they vote on that amendment.____________________________________________________________ Remarks as prepared for delivery:  I’d like to start by going back to near the beginning of this Congress when we were debating what was called “The American Rescue Plan.”  We were told then by our colleagues on the other side that this was going to “save the country.”  $1.9 trillion of debt-financed spending they said was going to fix everybody’s concerns in the United States.  Where are we today?  9.1 percent consumer price inflation, which we told them was coming.  Gas prices doubling.  Economic stagnation: GDP contracted by 0.9 percent in the second quarter, and we’re now arguing over semantics about what defines a recession.  65 percent of the country already think we are in a recession, and more than 80 percent of the country think our economy is on the wrong track.  The nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model says the “Inflation Reduction Act” will, if anything, raise inflation in the first few years, with a small and insignificant negative effect later in this decade.  That same model concludes that there is “low confidence that the legislation will have any impact on inflation.” But it does have an impact on all of us and our economy.  The bill does nothing to bring the economy out of stagnation and recession.  Rather, the “Inflation Reduction Act of 2022” gives us higher taxes, more spending, higher prices, and an army of IRS agents.  HIGHER TAXES Let’s talk about the taxes first.  Hundreds of billions of dollars raised through taxes—around $350 to $400 billion.  There’s a new book minimum tax on corporations; a new tax on stock buybacks;  There’s—believe this or not—a new tax on gasoline, on oil and gas and refineries at the very time when our President has shut down production of oil and gas on our interior and offshore, and has stopped the Keystone XL pipeline, basically freezing America’s production and driving us from a state of energy independence to a state of energy dependence, where we have to ask our friends and often our enemies across the globe to increase their gas production to help us deal with our prices at the pump.   And this book minimum tax—everyone in America knows that corporations don’t bear the burden of the taxes we put on them.  Who does? Workers, consumers and owners.   A recent National Bureau of Economic Research study estimates 31 percent is borne by consumers via price hikes at a time when we’re dealing with record inflation; 38 percent is borne by workers via lower wages, or less employment; and 31 percent is borne by owners.   My colleagues are quick to say this is just rich people and rich companies who are “tax cheats.”  But the owners of the corporations are primarily people in America who have retired and are leaning on a pension, or who have not yet retired or are trying to save money for retirement by putting their money into 401(k)s or other investment programs.  That’s who bears the burden of these taxes.  We asked the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to tell us who will bear the burden of these tax hikes.  They told us that in 2023, taxes will increase by $16.7 billion on American taxpayers earning less than $200,000.  Another $14.1 billion would come from taxpayers earning between $200,000 and $500,000. By 2031, when the new green energy credits and subsidies provide an even greater benefit to those with higher incomes, those earning below $400,000 are projected to bear as much as two-thirds of the burden of the additional tax revenue collected that year.   That’s what we’re being offered as a solution to the crisis that we are now facing in our economy.  And, as I’ll discuss later, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has recently confirmed that a significant portion of revenue that the IRS supersized funding Democrats claim will be forthcoming comes from audits that will squeeze tens of billions out of taxpayers earning less than $400,000.  So, in response to this data that we’ve been able to show about the very tax proposals in this bill the Democrats surprisingly have claimed that this Joint Tax Committee analysis isn’t valid because it didn’t include the effects of their spending that they were putting into the bill.    Well that’s a novel idea—it’s okay to raise taxes and it’s okay to put more tax burden on people making less than $400,000 because we’re going to be sending some subsidies to some of them.  So, we asked the JCT to include those subsidies in its analysis, which they did.  The analysis that incorporated the Obamacare subsidies shows that burdens of the proposed tax increases in the Democrats’ reckless bill would be so substantial and so widespread throughout all income categories—I repeat, all income categories--that no amount of temporary health care credits, or subsidies for $80,000 luxury SUVs, will overcome the tax increase burdens that would be overwhelmingly felt by lower- and middle-income Americans. Few, if any, Americans will get a net reduction in their tax burden.  And for any that do, it will only be temporary.  The vast majority will still bear the burden of these taxes.  Book Minimum Tax  The book minimum tax does not close loopholes—it raises taxes on U.S. companies by hundreds of billions of dollars.   And, it would not prevent all companies from paying zero tax.  Instead, it would let some of the companies preferred by the Democrats continue to avoid their taxes by using—not loopholes—but legitimate provisions for R&D and other kinds of tax credits that are intended to incentivize the conduct of those companies.  JCT has already estimated that half of the burden of the book minimum tax would fall on manufacturers.   In other words, as 252 trade associations and chambers of commerce from across the country said when they realized that close to half this burden would fall on manufacturers:  “Enacting the proposed Corporate Book Minimum Tax would be the antithesis of sound tax policy and administration.  Its introduction would be neither simple nor administrable and would pose a competitive disadvantage to U.S.-headquartered businesses while increasing the incidence of unrelieved double taxation.  It would also have a detrimental effect on the quality of financial reporting.”   The Business Roundtable said:  “[T]he proposed book minimum tax would, among other things, suppress domestic investment when increased investment is needed to spur a strong recovery. This tax hike would also undermine the competitiveness of America’s exporters. Even with a carve-out for accelerated depreciation, there remain many unresolved problems within the design and structure of the minimum tax that make it a poor revenue option.  Stock Buybacks  Let’s go to the next tax they raise: stock buybacks.  Once again, my colleagues on the other side are quick to attack any company that does a stock buyback, saying they’re trying to make owners of their stock who are “rich tax cheaters” even more wealthy.  I’ve already explained that the owners of that stock are the vast majority of Americans who are retired, working toward retirement or who are trying to invest a little bit to get ahead.  Despite Democrats’ claim that they are only closing loopholes, they are doubling down and proposing a new $74 billion tax increase on U.S. companies.   Democrats want to create a third layer of tax on American companies, which will have the harshest impact on seniors and other savers. The WSJ in a recent editorial explained:  “Companies use buybacks to return cash to shareholders for which they don’t have a better use.  Shareholders who sell shares back to the company can invest the proceeds elsewhere. That beats letting the cash sit on corporate books earning interest while CEOs get complacent or decide to buy a business they don’t understand how to run. “Buybacks aren’t tax free: Owners who sell shares back to the company realize a taxable capital gain.  Any boost in the share price contributes to a higher taxable gain for remaining owners when they sell their shares in the future. “Why not pay dividends instead?  Companies and shareholders might prefer buybacks in some instances, such as if the company is disbursing a one-time lump sum or shifting the balance of equity and debt on its books.  For the economy overall, buybacks have the effect of distributing capital specifically to those owners who choose to participate because they believe they have a more productive use for it. Capital flows from companies that don’t need it to companies that do. Democrats are telling companies, if you return value to your retirees or to 401(k) plans or to pension plans, then you will pay a punitive tax. The majority of American households have direct or indirect ownership of corporate stock via pensions, 401(k)s, or other savings vehicles.  Eighty to 100 million Americans have a 401(k).  46.4 million households have an individual retirement account.  Half of Generation-Zers and Millennials are invested in stocks. Seniors are especially dependent on investment income.  An Association of Mature American Citizens report shows that 68 percent of workers between the ages of 55-64 were active participants in a retirement plan to save for their golden years, and that on average 40 percent of seniors’ net worth is held in stocks and mutual funds invested over and above those retirement accounts.  Companies also rely on investments by individuals and institutions like pension funds to finance their operations.  Successful companies use this capital to generate profits, which are then used for expansion, research and development, hiring and benefits, and investment in communities.  Companies may also choose to pay down debt or return excess funds to shareholders Restricting stock buybacks could force companies to sit on cash or waste it on low-potential projects--both of which limit our economic growth and prosperity. As the Tax Foundation points out:  “A large body of evidence supports the idea that companies generally only consider stock buybacks when they have exhausted their investment opportunities and met their other obligations, meaning it is residual cash flow that is used for buybacks.  In fact, stock buybacks can supplement capital investments, as they can help reallocate capital from old, established firms to new and innovative firms.” This unvetted stock buybacks tax is a crippling tax that reduces retirement security for Americans. Tax on American Energy  Let’s go to the next tax they propose, and this one is a little difficult to understand—the Superfund tax and methane fee.  I understand why they call it the Superfund tax—it’s a 16.4 percent increase on oil and gas production in the United States.  According to the Energy Information Agency, regular gasoline prices have risen $1.94 per gallon since President Biden was inaugurated, an increase of more than 80 percent.   Americans are still paying, on average, more than $4.00 for a gallon of gas, and many can still remember the more-than-$5.00/gallon. The price for utility gas service is up by almost 40 percent.  These price increases occurred because President Biden shut down domestic energy production, including through permitting delays and canceling the Keystone XL pipeline.   Now, unbelievably, the President’s Democrat allies in Congress are doubling down with a methane tax and higher royalties on petroleum.   Re-imposing and increasing by nearly 70 percent the Superfund tax on refiners of crude oil, importers of petroleum products, and crude oil exporters, costing almost $12 billion over ten years--which will ultimately be borne by American motorists.  In addition, higher taxes diminish the ability to improve domestic supplies of oil by making capital investments cost prohibitive at a time when the U.S. has already lost one million barrels per day of refining capacity compared to before the pandemic. On the methane fee, the American Gas Association says:  “New fees or taxes on energy companies will raise costs for customers, creating a burden that will fall most heavily on lower-income Americans…. [B]ased on similar proposals introduced earlier this Congress, we estimate that the fee could amount to tens of billions of dollars annually. These major new costs most likely will result in higher bills for natural gas customers, including families, small businesses, and power generators…. Any increase in low-income households’ energy costs could prove devastating.” The bottom line on taxes is that millions of Americans will bear the burden of these tax hikes.   Some of my colleagues have claimed that those tax hikes are worth the supposed benefit.  Let’s look at the benefits:  DRUG PRICE REFORM The largest source of proposed savings in the Democrats’ bill is a system of bureaucratic drug price controls that will lead to higher launch prices, stifle growth, gut domestic manufacturing jobs and aid foreign adversaries, like China.  These proposals will lead to:  Higher launch prices for new medications, triggering financial strain at the pharmacy counter, as confirmed by the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of American job losses, particularly in domestic manufacturing--which is already getting hit by the new book minimum tax--with some estimates projecting as many as 800,000.  A competitive edge for the Chinese Communist Party, which has singled out biomedical innovation as a pillar of its industrial policy strategy, and which could ultimately supplant the U.S. as the global life sciences leader, with profound national security implications.  An unprecedented expansion of the D.C. federal health bureaucracy, financed with a staggering $3 billion in new administrative spending. This bureaucracy would also have unbridled new government price-setting authorities—with permanent prohibitions on judicial and administrative review, and with initial implementation shielded from basic notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements.  Fewer new treatments and cures, with a University of Chicago analysis estimating 135 fewer new drugs approved between now and 2039, resulting from an 18.5 percent reduction in innovative research and development.  Less funding for cancer R&D: Today, nearly 50 percent of the FDA pipeline is comprised of new cancer treatments.  However, according to the same economists at University of Chicago, the drug price controls would reduce funding for cancer R&D by nearly $18.1 billion, or over nine times the amount of funding proposed for President Biden’s Cancer Moonshot.  So much for the President’s “cancer moonshot.”  Dangerous new mechanisms for compelling total compliance with federal government mandates, with potential applications across all sectors of the economy, including: An escalating non-compliance penalty of up to 95 percent of all gross sales—levied every day—for failure to meet any terms of the government price-setting program (“negotiation” in name only), rendering any new federal mandate—however sweeping—an offer you can’t refuse.  Even late paperwork would trigger this crippling, catastrophic penalty, which has a tax-exclusive rate of up to 1,900 percent.   As a messaging gimmick, Democrats have framed their government price-setting program as “negotiation,” but their legislation tells a far different story.  Under their proposed program: The Secretary has absolute, unilateral, uninhibited price-setting authority—with no floor—enabling a price of $1 for even the most innovative new drugs.  Manufacturers have no choice but to comply and to provide indefinite access to their products at the Secretary-dictated price, regardless of how unfair.  They cannot walk away from the “negotiating table” or withdraw selected products from the Medicare market, even if the Secretary sets an economically untenable price, stripping even small businesses of any leverage.  Judicial and administrative review of key decisions—including the price-setting itself—are permanently prohibited.  The bill completely disregards the rest of the prescription drug supply chain, targeting manufacturers while doing nothing to address other key players or to improve oversight and transparency.  Senate Republicans have developed a commonsense alternative, based on more than two dozen solutions aimed at providing relief at the pharmacy counter while ensuring long-term access to life-saving new treatments and cures.   Among other provisions, virtually all of which are based on proposals with bipartisan support, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act (S. 2164) would: Reform the Part D benefit to reduce seniors’ cost-sharing burden and incentivize plans to negotiate the best deals possible for enrollees. Create a hard cap on annual out-of-pocket spending for all seniors under Medicare Part D. Increase Part D plan choices for seniors by enabling sponsors to offer additional plans, with incentives for options that pass a greater share of discounts directly to beneficiaries at the pharmacy counter. Permanently extend a Trump Administration program providing Part D enrollees with access to plan options that cap out-of-pocket monthly insulin costs at $35 or less. Permanently allow high-deductible health plans to offer pre-deductible coverage for preventive services, including insulin.  Establish a Chief Pharmaceutical Negotiator to combat foreign freeloading, ensuring the best trade deals achievable for American consumers and job creators.  Strengthen consumer-oriented oversight through more useful cost comparison tools, price transparency measures, and robust reporting requirements for stakeholders across the drug supply chain, including pharmacy benefit managers.  Facilitate value-based arrangements, where private and public-sector payers can pay based on patient outcomes, driving better results for patients at a lower cost.  Restructure payments for drugs administered in the doctor’s office or hospital outpatient department to encourage physicians to deliver cost-effective treatment options, when clinically appropriate.  These are the kinds of solutions that our prescriptions drug pricing system requires, not an arbitrary and offensive federal price-fixing program.   IRS Funding for an Army of Auditors This bill proposes $80 billion in mandatory appropriations to the IRS.  Let me give you a little perspective – the annual budget of the IRS is only about $12.6 billion.  Nearly six times the annual budget of the current IRS.  Of this, $45.6 billion for enforcement purposes.  That’s more than 57 percent, almost 60 percent of this $80 billion is for enforcement purposes.  $25.3 billion is for operations support.  Only $4.8 billion for business systems and bringing themselves into the 21st century so they can communicate with taxpayers; and $3.2 billion for taxpayer services, or 4 percent.  Some estimate the $46 billion for an army of auditors may allow the IRS to hire as many as 87,000 new agents.  That would make the IRS one of the largest federal agencies--larger than the Pentagon, State Department, FBI, and Border Patrol combined.  According to the Congressional Research Service, the Democrats’ reckless IRS funding increase would raise enforcement funding by nearly 70 percent above what IRS is currently projected to get.   Increased audits for the middle class, small businesses, and those making less than $400,000 are inevitable and unavoidable under this Act. How will the $45.6 billion for enforcement purposes be used?  Interestingly, the White House and even the IRS Commissioner have said “they won’t use all this money for auditing people who make less than $400,000.”  My colleagues just continue to say they won’t do it.   Multiple studies show, however, that in order to raise the money they are requiring to be raised under this bill, around $200 billion of more tax revenue from Americans by auditing them, they have nowhere else to look.   Last year, the IRS announced that it planned to ramp up audits of small businesses by 50 percent this year.   Why did they announce that? Because that’s where they need to look to collect all of this new tax revenue that they want to get.   I asked the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation to estimate where the most underreported income in the “tax gap” lies—where the supposed revenue would come from, that my colleagues on the other side say comes from “big tax cheats.”   JCT looked at IRS data and determined out of all the revenue projected to be raised from underreported income: 40-57 percent could come from taxpayers making $50,000 or less; 65-78 percent from those making less than $100,000; and 78-90 percent from those making less than $200,000.  Only around 4-9 percent could come from those making $500,000 or more. That’s what the data shows.  That’s why the IRS amounted a 50 percent increase in audits for small businesses, and that’s why it is impossible for the Democrats’ claims that they don’t want to have audits of people under $400,000, cannot be honored.  You know, in their bill, in response to this criticism, they included a sentence that said, nothing in this bill is ‘intended’--focus on that word, nothing in this bill is ‘intended’--to increase taxes on those making less than $400,000. Why did they use the word ‘intended’?  Because they know that’s not what they want to happen, but it’s what will have to happen, and they are not willing to use a stronger word.  I have asked them, and I will ask them in an amendment on this floor, to say that “none of this money can be used to audit taxpayers making less than $400,000 a year.” Let’s see how they vote on that amendment.  Why couldn’t they just say that this money ‘shall not’ increase taxes on people earning less than $400,000 per year?  Why couldn’t they say that these funds cannot be utilized to audit taxpayers making less than $400,000 per year?   Because they know they can’t say that and claim the amount of revenue they want to spend, unless they audit those making less than $400,000 per year.  The fact is the “tax gap” isn’t just millionaires, billionaires, oligarchs, or whatever the term-of-the-attack is today. To say that everyone who has misreported their income as “tax cheats” is misdirection.  It calls all of these people who make less than $400,000 who are simply having trouble complying with this complex internal revenue code a “tax cheat,” and that’s unfair.  We examined the IRS’s own data on how successful it is in having the courts sustain its claims that these folks in the $400,000 category and other categories are cheating on their taxes.  Over the past twenty years, the IRS has a less-than 47 percent success rate, and a less-than 45 percent success rate over the last ten years.   In other words, the IRS more often asserts these tax deficiencies exist than the courts agree with.  That is hardly evidence for a multitude of tax cheats, but firm evidence that innocent taxpayers are often subjected to unnecessary and inappropriate scrutiny. And we can be sure they will be with 87,000 new auditors.  Again, making the IRS larger than all of those other agencies that I talked about.  And by the way, folks may remember, just a short time back when the proposal also included language that would let the IRS get into the bank accounts and monitor the transactions of deposits and withdrawals of all Americans who have more than $10,000 worth of transactions in a year.  Which is, essentially, almost all Americans   Admittedly, that language isn’t in this bill, yet, but the broad authority that is given to the Internal Revenue Service with this $80 billion of supersizing will undoubtably result in rules and regulations issued by the IRS to achieve that objective.  They know they couldn’t put it in statute, because it would be rejected, immediately, by the American people.  I encourage the American people to see past this and to reject this legislation.   It’s too many taxes, too much spending, too big of a burden on American people across all income categories.   We don’t want to supersize the Internal Revenue Service.  Going back to that very first statistic I gave you—this bill isn’t even going to have a statistically significant impact on inflation.  If anything, the taxes will drive prices up.   Madame President, I encourage all of my colleagues to reject this reckless bill.  ###"
https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/jct-confirms-tax-costs-exponentially-outweigh-benefits,"New analysis shows outsized tax burden over benefit for vast majority of AmericansWashington, D.C.--The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) has issued an analysis of effects of the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spend bill on taxpayers in each income category.   The new analysis shows that the burden of the bill’s tax increases on lower- and middle-income Americans is so great, any supposed benefits from the temporary premium credits only outweigh the tax hits for a small sliver of the population.  Even for the small number of people who would receive a slight benefit, significantly larger portions of American taxpayers in each income category would still face the burden of a tax increase.   “The Administration has been very careful to say that the ‘individual income tax rate’ would not change for anyone making less than $400,000 per year, yet everyone knows that the corporate tax burden falls on workers and consumers, as well as owners,” said Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), who requested the analysis.  “This analysis shows that burdens of the proposed tax increases in the Democrats’ reckless bill would be so substantial and so widespread throughout all income categories that no amount of temporary health credits, or subsidies for $80,000 luxury SUVs, will overcome the tax increase burdens that would be overwhelmingly felt by lower- and middle-income Americans.” The analysis of the tax title of the “Inflation Reduction Act of 2022” includes the corporate book minimum tax increase and all energy tax provisions that JCT is able to estimate.  It does not include the Superfund tax, the formerly-proposed changes to taxation of carried interest, or a potential excise tax on stock buybacks which would, if included, show potentially even larger burdens on Americans of all income categories.  According to JCT, given the tax hikes and most of the “Green New Deal” tax credits in the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spend bill:  Analysis – No ACA Subsidies Although not part of the tax title in the “Inflation Reduction Act,” Ranking Member Crapo also requested for the JCT to analyze Democrats’ proposed tax title with the three-year extension of the expanded Affordable Care Act premium subsidies.  The results of that analysis show that even when those subsidies are factored in, tax burdens from the Democrats’ bill on low- and middle-income Americans significantly outweigh any tax and ACA-premium benefits.Analysis – ACA Subsidies  Background:  Corporate tax increases get passed on to workers in the form of lower wages and to consumers in the form of higher product prices.  A recent National Bureau of Economic Research study, for example, estimates 31 percent of a tax hike is borne by consumers via higher prices; 38 percent is borne by workers via lower wages; and 31 percent is borne by owners, who include retirees and current workers building their retirement nest eggs. Last week, Ranking Member Crapo also released a distributional analysis from the non-partisan JCT showing that the Democrats’ tax and spend bill would increase the tax burden on Americans earning less than $200,000 by nearly $17 billion in the next year alone, with the average tax rate increasing for nearly all taxpayers and with an even greater share of the burden facing those earning below $400,000 as things move through the full 10-year budget period.   ### "
https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/crapo-reckless-tax-and-spend-dangerous-for-america,"Americans across all income categories would bear tax hike burden; manufacturing sector would be hardest hitWashington, D.C.--U.S. Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, led a news conference with Finance Committee Republicans to highlight the tax hike proposals in the mislabeled “Inflation Reduction Act.”  Analyses from nonpartisan experts have shown the legislation would increase the tax burden on low- and middle-income Americans; slam the manufacturing industry; and do nothing to lower inflation.    “The bottom line—this tax is dangerous for America.”  To watch Crapo’s full remarks, click HERE or the image above. On who bears the burden of a tax hike:  “The Administration has been very careful to say ‘we aren’t raising the tax rates of anyone under $400,000.’  But everyone in America knows that when taxes are charged, people end up carrying the burden of those taxes.  “That burden comes because the incidence of the corporate tax is passed on to workers; to capital, or those who own the stock, people trying to invest in their retirement in a pension plan or 401K; and in price increases in the economy.   “The [Joint Committee on Taxation] found that in 2023, the tax burden would increase by $16.7 billion on Americans earning less than $200,000 per year.  Another $14.1 billion would be borne by taxpayers earning between $200,000 and $500,000 per year.  During the ten-year period, the average tax burden increases for nearly every single income category.  When you get to the point at the end of the ten-year period, half to two-thirds of the burden would fall on those earning less than $400,000.  That is the reality, regardless of the games that are being played in terms of describing who the taxes fall on.”   On which industries will be hit hardest by tax hikes:  “49.7 percent of those taxes will fall on manufacturers, and as you can see from the chart that it goes across various other aspects of our economy…This bill will slam manufacturers.   “The National Association of Manufacturers has indicated that because half of the impact of this will be on that industry, that this would be a reduction of our gross domestic product by $68.45 billion, a reduction of employment by 218 thousand workers and a reduction of employment income of $17 billion.  These numbers show, very graphically, where the burden of this tax falls; contrary to the argument that is this just a tax on tax-cheats.”  On the success of Republican tax reform:  “We worked as hard as we could back in 2017 to get our tax code amended so we could incentivize capital formation in America, so that we could encourage the hundreds of billions, trillions of dollars being held offshore to be brought back to the United States and invested here.  And it happened--companies came back to the United States and invested the capital.  We got the strongest economy we had probably seen in all of our lifetimes.  Employment was up, wages were up and the inflation rate was less than 2 percent--down around 1.5 percent.  That is what was coming out of the effort to get capital formation back into the United States; this bill is going to slam it.”  ###"
https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/crapo-damaging-tax-hikes-would-lead-to-higher-inflation-economic-stagnation,"“If these taxes are passed, we’ll see higher inflation, more economic stagnation, lower wages, less employment, and most importantly, the burden will be paid by people making less than $400,000.”Washington, D.C.--In an interview with Larry Kudlow on Fox Business, U.S. Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) discussed the Democrats’ reckless proposals to raise taxes amid high inflation and economic stagnation under the mislabeled “Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.”  Crapo touted the success of Republicans’ 2017 tax reform bill, cautioning that Democrats’ current proposals would undo much of the progress made from those reforms, and highlighted analyses from nonpartisan experts showing the new tax-and-spend bill would raise taxes on low- and middle-income Americans during a period of declining GDP and high inflation; raise taxes on manufacturers, exacerbating supply-chain disruptions, and costing U.S. jobs and investment; and do little to nothing to lower inflation.   2017 tax reform encouraged investment in domestic manufacturing: “This is exactly what we intended to happen with the 2017 tax act.  Recall that back then, we were facing capital fleeing from the United States and we saw a really weak economy.  When we incentivized capital to come back to the United States, over a trillion dollars in capital that was being held offshores came back, and we started seeing investment growth in many areas--particularly manufacturing--that is so critical to making our economy stronger again. . . . These taxes will slam that very dynamic.”  Nonpartisan experts confirm tax increases will fall on manufacturing and low- to middle-income taxpayers: “We just got two analyses from the Joint Tax Committee, a bipartisan committee, that analyzes these dynamics.  One of them said where this will fall and the other said who will pay the burden of these taxes.  “The first one said, the burden will fall mostly--49 percent--on manufacturing in the United States, and will still hit all other segments of the economy.  The second one said this will fall through to the lower- and middle-income classes primarily.  “Just a couple more statistics: It said in the first year of these new taxes, $17 billion will be paid by people making less than $200,000 a year, and by the end of year ten of these new taxes, one-half to two-thirds of the entire burden of these tax increases will fall on people making less than $400,000.  And of course, that number is critical, because that is what President Biden said he would not do.” The notion that these are tax loopholes is absolutely false: “People across this country understand that [utilizing the tax code] isn’t bad--they realize these aren’t loopholes, and this is exactly what Congress intended with the research and development tax credits, production tax credits and deductions that were authorized by Congress for this very purpose. “It grew the economy, grew wages, increased employment and made our economy much stronger with the kind of capital investment that makes us more competitive against China, Russia and malign activities from other nations across the world trying to steal our markets. “The notion these are tax loopholes is absolutely false.  This is exactly what was intended to happen, it is happening and it is having the impact that it should have.  “If these taxes are passed, what we will see is that not only will the burden be carried, by far, by those earning less than $400,000, but it will result in higher inflation, more stagnation of our economic growth, lower wages, less employment and most importantly, as I said, the burden will be paid by people making less than $400,000.” A direct tax on American energy: “By the way, we’re talking about this book tax--this corporate minimum tax--and you know there is another specific tax in here that is directly on our oil and gas production, at a time when the President has already shut down American production as much as he can.  Gas prices have skyrocketed and they’re talking about piling another tax on the oil and gas industry, it is inexplicable.  Their drive for more spending is causing them to ignore all of these arguments because it is the only way they can get to where they can justify the new spending.” ###"

Warner (D-VA) announced the creation of the Senate Community Development Finance Caucus (CDFC), a bipartisan caucus dedicated to supporting the missions of Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) to scale their activities and fuel more lending in low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities.The 14-member caucus is bipartisan and evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans including Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mike Braun (R-IN), Jon Ossoff (D-GA), Steve Daines (R-MT), Jack Reed (D-RI), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Tina Smith (D-MN), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Rev. Raphael Warnock (D-GA), and Mike Rounds (R-SD).CDFIs play a critical role in providing responsible and affordable credit to underserved communities. During the pandemic, CDFIs demonstrated their ability to deliver billions of dollars to underserved businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), totaling approximately $34 billion.On a bipartisan basis, Sen. Warner worked with Sen. Crapo, former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and other colleagues to introduce the Jobs and Neighborhood Investment Act, which passed as part of the December 2020 COVID relief package. The bill made a historic $12 billion investment in CDFIs and MDIs, which included $3 billion for grant funding and $9 billion for tier-one capital investments in CDFIs and MDIs, which could be leveraged 10 to 1.“CDFIs and MDIs play an essential role in providing access to capital in underserved communities. While Congress took significant steps to support community-based lenders over the last two years on a bipartisan basis, CDFIs continue to need more long-term patient capital, operating capital, and resources to modernize their systems and compete in an era of rapid financial innovation. I am happy to announce the creation of this caucus with Sen. Crapo to improve communication between industry and policymakers and continue working in a bipartisan fashion towards robust investments in CDFIs and MDIs,” said Sen. Warner.“I have consistently heard positive news and success stories about CDFIs in Idaho and across the country, and their responsiveness to the small business community, particularly during these last few challenging years of the pandemic,” said Sen. Crapo. “Sen. Warner and I are proud to launch this caucus to educate members and staff about the important role CDFIs play in their communities, and to create a forum to share ideas and policy proposals that foster strong economic growth in local communities.A summary deck describing the caucus can be found here. More information on the caucus can be found on its webpage here.The Community Development Finance Caucus has the support of a number of organizations and financial institutions.“The National Bankers Association is proud to endorse the bipartisan U.S. Senate Community Development Finance Caucus, which will develop legislative efforts to support MDIs and CDFIs while providing direct lending opportunities. We commend Sen. Mark Warner for his leadership and commitment to ensuring MDIs have the resources to serve our nation's low- and moderate-income communities,” said Nicole Elam, President and CEO, National Bankers Association.“The Community Development Bankers Association is excited about the formation of the Community Development Finance Caucus.  The CDFI sector has emerged as a critical component of the financial services sector because it works to ensure access by underserved markets.  Addressing growing income disparity, promoting racial equity, and building financial wellness are important national priorities and the need for the Caucus is great,” said Jeannine Jacokes, CEO of CDBA.“Opportunity Finance Network (OFN) applauds the leadership of Sens. Mark Warner and Mike Crapo in launching the Community Development Finance Caucus. Providing affordable, mission-drive financing to underinvested communities is the special expertise that community development financial institutions (CDFIs) offer. The CDFI industry looks forward to working with the Community Development Finance Caucus on strengthening public sector understanding and support of CDFIs and the positive community development impact they have in low-wealth communities,” said Jennifer A. Vasiloff, Chief External Affairs Officer, Opportunity Finance Network.“Inclusiv, the largest CDFI network representing near 500 community development credit unions providing responsible and sustainable financial products to over 18 million predominantly low income and minority consumers, expresses its strong support for the formalization of a congressional caucus that will be focusing on community development, financial inclusion and the economic revitalization of minority communities through CDFIs. This body will provide a platform to engage the CDFI industry and inform the development of public policy that’s both impactful and sustainable. We are grateful to Sens. Warner, Crapo, and all caucus members for spearheading this important initiative and call on other senators to lend their support,” said Cathie Mahon, President and CEO of Inclusiv.“The African-American Credit Union Coalition (AACUC), is proud to partner and collaborate with INCLUSIV on ensuring that there is equitable financial futures for all people – especially the marginalized and underserved – usually the Colored Majority.  A Community Development Finance Caucus would provide the appropriate forum for ideas and strategies to be discussed and executed,” said Renée Sattiewhite, President and CEO of the African American Credit Union Coalition.“On behalf of the National Association of Latino Credit Unions and Professionals, we applaud Sens. Warner, Crapo, and all caucus members for leading the organizing of a CDFI Caucus that will give lawmakers a platform to support the critical work of CDFIs play in low income and communities of color as financial first responders and engines of economic revitalization. Our organization is in full support of this initiative and asks members of the Senate to support it as well,” said Maria Martinez, Board Chair, National Association of Latino Credit Unions and Professionals.“The Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) thanks Sens. Warner and Crapo for forming a Community Development Finance Caucus. Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) are the backbone of this sector, providing capital, credit, and financial services in distressed communities and to underserved individuals throughout the country. CDFIs serve borrowers and geographic areas that are not readily served by mainstream financial institutions, providing loans to first-time homebuyers, financing for affordable housing and community facilities, and small business financing. The CDFI sector has grown significantly over the last 20 years, and this growth would not have been possible without bipartisan congressional support. LISC applauds Sens. Warner and Crapo for forming a Community Development Finance Caucus, which will focus on how Congress can continue to meet the needs of CDFIs and their work to serve underserved people and places,” said Matt Josephs, Senior Vice President for Policy, LISC.“We applaud Sens.

https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/myth-vs-fact-tax-title-of-the-inflation-reduction-act-of-2022,"Democrats claim the latest version of their tax-and-spend bill, the mislabeled “Inflation Reduction Act of 2022,” will ensure the wealthiest Americans and corporations pay their “fair share” by closing tax loopholes and boosting IRS funding, all without raising taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 per year.  However, analyses from nonpartisan experts show the legislation would raise taxes on low- and middle-income Americans during a period of declining GDP and high inflation; raise taxes on manufacturers, exacerbating supply-chain disruptions, and costing U.S. jobs and investment; and do little to nothing to lower inflation.  “The more this bill is analyzed by impartial experts, the more we can see Democrats are trying to sell the American people a bill of goods,” said U.S. Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo.  “Non-partisan analysts are confirming this bill raises taxes on the middle class, raises taxes on manufacturers, and produces no meaningful deficit reduction when gimmicks are removed and the full cost is accounted for.”  Access this document here.   IRS FUNDING   MYTH: Increasing IRS funding by $80 billion will provide the agency with the resources it needs to go after wealthy tax cheats and corporations who don’t pay their fair share in taxes, generating more than $124 billion in additional revenue to go toward deficit reduction.  FACT: According to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), the brunt of any new revenue from hiring an army of IRS auditors will overwhelming hit low- and middle-income earners, people already struggling with high gas prices and 9.1 percent inflation.  CBO scores the $80 billion for mandatory IRS funding as spending only, and gives phantom credit for potential enforcement revenue that might be generated in “future baselines.” Background:  IRS funding breakdown—$80 billion in mandatory appropriations to the IRS:  How will the $45.6 billion for enforcement purposes be used to address the noncompliance tax gap?  According to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, misreported trade or business activities (Schedule C items) or other income-producing activities (Schedule E items) make up a very significant portion of the overall noncompliance “tax gap.” IRS data reproduced in the table below show that Schedule C or E tax enforcement assessments predominantly hit taxpayers who have low (or very low) Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), and nothing in the proposal would change that fact. Based upon these data, out of all the revenue projected to be raised from underreported income:   Percentage of Estimated Tax Assessments Relating to the Underreporting of…Reported AGISchedule C IncomeSchedule E IncomeLess than $05%6%$0 - $50,00052%34%$50,000 - $100,00021%25%$100,000 - $200,00012%13%$200,000 - $500,0006%14%$500,000 and over4%9%Total100%100% Referring to all tax gap and misreporting numbers as arising from “tax cheats” is misdirection, as significant amounts arise from hard-working taxpayers simply struggling to comply with an overly complex tax code, which will become even more complex if the latest tax-and-spend bill becomes law.     BOOK MINIMUM TAX  MYTH: The book minimum tax (BMT) does not raise taxes; it closes loopholes by making large companies pay at least a 15 percent minimum tax.  FACT: The BMT is a $313 billion tax increase, with half of the increase falling on manufacturers, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.  Despite proponents’ claims, the book minimum tax does not close tax loopholes.  The BMT is calculated based on financial statement (“book”) income, which is a different set of rules established for an entirely different purpose than taxable income.   Claims that the BMT closes loopholes ignore the fact that the provisions resulting in different book and tax treatment were specifically enacted by Congress for sound policy reasons.  For example, the treatment of capital investments differs for book and tax purposes, in part to encourage companies to invest in capital assets in the United States.  As the left-leaning Tax Policy Center acknowledges, the BMT would discourage investment. According to a study by the National Association of Manufacturers, in 2023 alone the effects would include: Further, the BMT will not prevent large companies from paying zero tax.  The energy tax provisions included in the “Inflation Reduction Act of 2022” would permit companies to receive those tax credits in excess of their tax liability.  In other words, not only will companies in Democrat-favored industries be able to pay zero tax, some will even be able to receive taxpayer-funded subsidies in excess of tax due for engaging in an activity that has been picked for government handouts.   Background:  The book minimum tax is calculated based on book income, or the income reported by companies on their financial statements.  Companies calculate their tax liability based on the tax accounting rules set forth in the Internal Revenue Code.  While book accounting is typically based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), there is no globally uniform financial accounting standard.  Further, U.S. accounting rules are set by the unelected Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), whereas the Internal Revenue Code is enacted by Congress per its authority under the Constitution.  The book minimum tax unwisely injects tax policy—and politics—into the accounting standard setting process. A key difference between book accounting and tax accounting is the treatment of companies’ investments in capital assets, like machinery and equipment.  For book purposes, companies write off the value of their capital assets in line with their decline in economic productivity.  For tax purposes, the cost of most capital assets, including machinery and equipment, can be fully deducted.  The book minimum tax would penalize companies that utilize the tax treatment related to these investments, encouraging manufacturers and others to invest elsewhere. JCT has confirmed that half of the $313 billion BMT increase would fall on manufacturers, targeting the very capital investments Congress intended to encourage amidst an economy in stagflation.  Despite claims, depreciation is not a tax loophole.  This provision is a tax increase—one that falls squarely on domestic manufacturing.   Contrary to closing loopholes, a book minimum tax would actually pick new “winners and losers,” as some provisions receive particularly special treatment under the BMT—namely, companies receiving refundable energy tax credits.  Not only would those companies not be penalized for paying zero tax as a result of receiving energy tax credits, but they would also receive an adjustment to eliminate the subsidy from income under the BMT, further ensuring they pay no additional tax.   Democrats should take a cue from the past.  A previously enacted book minimum tax was allowed to expire in 1989 (after only three years in place) due to the problems outlined above.  In other words, this proposal has been tried before—and it failed.     TAX HIKES ON FAMILIES MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 PER YEAR MYTH: There are no new taxes on families making $400,000 or less and no new taxes on small businesses—Democrats are simply focused on “the rich” by closing evasive tax loopholes and enforcing the tax code. FACT: The JCT estimates the legislation will increase taxes on millions of individuals making less than $400,000 per year.   According to the JCT, the bill would raise a total of $337.8 billion over 10 years from its three revenue-raising provisions: The JCT estimates the following tax effects:  Background:  As outlined above, the book minimum tax is not a loophole closer—it’s a direct tax on America’s manufacturers and actually creates new “winners and losers” in the tax code.   Significantly changing the carried interest deduction increases taxes on private investment, which will increase costs to businesses, eliminate jobs, decrease returns to average Americans who benefit from these investments, and dis-incentivize long-term investment.   Reinstating the superfund tax on America’s producers would result in higher prices for consumers on things like gasoline, threaten thousands of jobs, and undermine domestic critical mineral development.  Taken together, the JCT estimates the latest version of the full tax title will increase taxes on millions of Americans across every income bracket, with more than half of the tax increases on Americans making less than $400,000 per year.  Corporate tax increases get passed on to workers in the form of lower wages and to consumers in the form of higher product prices.  Some estimates say up to 50 percent of a corporate tax increase is borne by workers.  Other estimates say 31 percent is borne by consumers via price hikes; 38 percent is borne by workers via lower wages; and 31 percent is borne by owners.  These owners include individuals with retirement savings, with costs occurring via lower equity valuations, fewer dividends, and reduced opportunities for organic growth through investment.###"

McKalip, for U.S. Trade Representative Chief Agricultural Negotiator. The text of Ranking Member Crapo’s remarks, as prepared, is below. “Thank you, Senator Wyden.  “Welcome, Mr. McKalip, and congratulations on your nomination.  I took the opportunity to listen to your band Box Cartel.  You’re hitting the right notes there.  With your trade policy experience, I hope that—if confirmed—you’ll also the right hit notes on improving opportunities for our farmers and ranchers. “America’s farmers continue to prove their resilience and productivity every day, and will keep doing so.  But’s it not easy.  Americans are painfully aware that gas prices are up 42 percent from a year ago.  What fewer people may know is that the price for diesel rose by an even greater margin—68 percent.  This hits our farmers hard. “Back in March, a fourth generation farmer in Meridian, Idaho explained that the cost of filling up his tractor had doubled in a year to $800.  However, one bright factor for America’s farmers right now is exports with sales of agricultural products overseas reaching $177 billion in 2021.  America’s farmers sell more high quality products to consumers around the world than ever before. “In Idaho, if we kept what our 24,000 farms produced within the state, each Idahoan would have to eat 209 slices of bread, 40 potatoes, 3 pounds of sugar, 2 pounds of cheese, 2 pounds of beef and a cup of beans—every single day.  Fortunately, Idaho’s agricultural products also feed the nation and the world, exporting one of every six rows of Idaho potatoes and 50 percent of Idaho’s wheat.   “Nationally, one in three acres planted in the United States will be exported.  But we can sell even more.  What is holding us back is, again, a misplaced Biden Administration policy: a moratorium on new trade agreements, and limited enforcement of existing agreements.   “The Administration is crystal clear that it prefers to not pursue real trade agreements in favor of something it calls ‘frameworks,’ which lack crucial market access obligations.   “This is confusing, since market access is the main problem our farmers and ranchers face.  A lot of our potential trading partners maintain high agricultural tariffs and regulatory measures that are essentially a guise for protectionism.  We need to tear them down. “For example, India applies an average agricultural tariff of 36 percent.  It also applies a number of non-science based restrictions on U.S. agriculture, such as unreasonable GMO certifications on apples, potatoes, soybeans, wheat and other crops.   “If America wants to sell crops in India, these are exactly the types of issues that must be addressed.  Moreover, the need to find new markets is particularly compelling because we must diversify our customer base. “China is currently our largest agricultural export destination.  But, we need new markets to reduce our dependency and increase our leverage.  Securing these markets will require more than frameworks where government officials can just talk. “It requires binding commitments that ensure our farmers can sell.  Put plainly, our farmers and ranchers deserve our trading partners’ markets to be as open to our commerce as ours is to theirs.  Hopefully, we can start a conversation today on how to apply our nominee’s experience and talents toward that goal.   “With that, I look forward to hearing the nominee’s testimony and his responses to our questions.  I also look forward to the nominee’s next album when that comes out. “Thank you, Mr. Chairman.” ###"

These deficiencies have led to delays in patient care, refilling prescriptions and managing referrals, among other things. In April, the Idaho Congressional Delegation raised concerns to the VA regarding these OIG reports and requested information on steps being taken to ensure these issues do not further impede veteran care during the planned rollout at the Boise VAMC. Though a few of these deficiencies have been addressed, numerous outstanding issues remain.In addition to Delegation staffs’ numerous meetings with Veterans Health Administration stakeholders, staff members from the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs recently visited the Boise VAMC to meet with hospital leadership and providers at the request of the Delegation.“As VA reassesses the Cerner implementation at the Boise VAMC, Members and staff of the Idaho Congressional Delegation remain committed to working with the VA, the Boise VAMC and veterans to ensure our veterans receive the quality care they deserve,” the Delegation continued. “We will continue to closely monitor the situation and stand ready to assist veterans with any issues they may encounter when accessing VA health care.”"

Such policies or actions also handcuff wildlife managers by removing a critical conservation tool while needlessly alienating one of our original conservationists, sportsmen.

We are concerned that the Biden administration is foregoing America’s trade and strategic leadership by failing to pursue such commitments, whether through its Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) or through its decision not to pursue comprehensive free trade agreements, which was reflected in the President’s 2022 Trade Policy Agenda. The lack of ambitious market-opening initiatives not only disadvantages U.S. workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses today, it jeopardizes America’s competitiveness, resilience, and security in the long-term.Unlike traditional trade agreements, the IPEF is not expected to include critical market access commitments. The failure to include such commitments puts American exporters, including agricultural producers, at a competitive disadvantage in the global market. It also signals to the world that the United States is not committed to fully engaging commercially or strategically in the region. Thus, while some aspects of the IPEF may have potential, it is not a credible counterweight to the market-opening agreements that other countries, including China, are actively advancing.America cannot afford to sit on the sidelines in trade. For generations, a large part of our nation’s economic success has been based on the United States advocating for more, not less, open markets. For example, U.S. farm and food product exports grew from $46.1 billion in 1994 to more than $177 billion in 2021, which was largely due to greater market access opportunities for American exporters. These U.S. exports lead to good-paying jobs at home and help spread the reach of American influence abroad. Free trade agreements are also far from relics of the past, as Ambassador Tai recently implied at a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee. In fact, 13 of the 16 enacted U.S. free trade agreements were passed by Congress since the turn of this century. Opening new markets for customers, reducing barriers for business, and enforcing robust trade agreements are cornerstones of our national prosperity.Regrettably, U.S. trade leadership has thus far taken a backseat to other priorities under this administration. But, as you know, global trade does not simply pause until the administration deems it worthy of pursuing. Opening new markets means more high-paying jobs for workers and lower-cost goods for consumers at home. The administration’s failure to engage on Trade Promotion Authority or find other avenues to open markets means our workers and producers will continue to lose ground to competitors. In contrast, China continues to advance its Belt and Road Initiative; it recently concluded the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world’s largest free trade agreement; and it now aspires to join the higher quality Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.We respectfully urge you to include market access and enforceable commitments as part of the IPEF, and any other U.S. trade agreements, and we stand ready to work with you to strengthen American trade leadership.###"

https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/senate-extends-reca-program,"Legislation extending RECA program for two years passes SenateWashington, D.C.--The U.S. Senate unanimously agreed to extend the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) program for two years, allowing individuals more time to apply for the compensation they deserve.  U.S. Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), a longtime Senate lead on RECA expansion efforts, applauded the extension, and reiterated the need for additional efforts to expand the program to include coverage for all of those who lived downwind of above-ground atomic weapons tests in the 1950s and 1960s.  The legislation is now headed to the U.S. House of Representatives for consideration.  Without reauthorization, the RECA program is scheduled to sunset in July. “The Senate’s action to extend the RECA program for two years is critical to providing compensation downwinders rightfully deserve,” said Crapo.  “The House should move quickly on the extension and send the legislation to the President to be signed into law.  Far too many innocent victims have been lost to cancer-related deaths from Cold War era above-ground weapons testing.  More must be done to assist those still with us not currently covered under the program.”“A heartfelt thank you to the Senate for passing this extension,” said Tona Henderson, Executive Director of Idaho Downwinders.  “We still have the task of amending RECA.  Expanding to more areas so all the Downwinders who are not covered now, will have the time to apply.  We need to compensate all the states that were harmed during testing, which is exactly what Sen. Crapo and Sen. Luján’s bill S 2798 will do.  Compensating only a few counties or individual states does nothing to help all the Downwinders throughout the West who have suffered for 70 plus years — many of whom have already lost their lives and many that are still struggling.   We applaud Senator Crapo and Senator Luján for leading the charge.”“Preserving and expanding the RECA program to provide long overdue justice to New Mexico downwinders and uranium workers is one of my top priorities in Congress.  The Senate took a critical step to extend the RECA program ahead of the program’s July sunset date,” said Luján.  “Now, the House must swiftly pass this legislation and send it to President Biden’s desk.  Congress cannot let the RECA program expire and must continue to work to expand and strengthen RECA.”In March 2022, Senators Crapo and Ben Ray Luján (D-New Mexico) led a bipartisan letter urging Congressional Leadership to extend RECA.  The legislation the Senate passed provides a clean, two-year extension of the RECA program. Senator Crapo will continue pushing for passage of his bipartisan legislation, S. 2798, which would extend and expand eligibility under the RECA program.  S. 2798 would expand the coverage area to allow more potential victims, known as “downwinders,” to file for compensation under RECA.  While the original RECA program only covered parts of Utah, Nevada and Arizona, this legislation would expand the geographic downwinder eligibility to include then-residents of Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico and Guam. Crapo chaired a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the RECA program in June 2018.  Tona Henderson, of Emmett, Idaho, and head of the Idaho Downwinders organization, provided testimony in the hearing and paid tribute to those in her community who have passed away due to radiation-related illnesses.  Her birthplace of Gem County, Idaho, received the third-highest amount of fallout in the nation according to a 1997 National Cancer Institute study.  ###"

https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/crapo-statement-at-hearing-on-irs-budget,"Washington, D.C.--U.S. Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, delivered the following remarks at a hearing entitled, “The IRS, the President's Fiscal Year 2023 Budget, and the 2022 Filing Season.” The text of Ranking Member Crapo’s remarks, as prepared, is below. “Thank you, Mr. Chairman--and thank you to Commissioner Rettig for your willingness to testify today and your service. “I appreciate your efforts to make the IRS more customer-focused, and understand that it is hard to change course in large organizations like the IRS.  There is a need to change course, but I do not believe the Administration’s outsized, partisan approach is the solution. “For the third filing season in a row, taxpayers confront vexing customer service challenges as they attempt to fulfill their tax filing obligations.  With tens of millions of 2021 tax returns still to be filed, the most recent data we have on this year’s season is concerning, highlighting longstanding issues the IRS has not adequately addressed. “For example, more than 60 percent of the millions of items of taxpayer correspondence and amended returns have sat in storage for more than three months, an increase of nearly 30 percent over last year.  Average hold times for the lucky few taxpayers who reach the IRS by phone are 28 minutes, an increase of nearly 50 percent over last year. “Scores of taxpayers have seen refunds delayed while their return is suspended for various reasons.  Millions of prior-year tax returns await processing.  The IRS’s management of paper-filed returns is a persistent problem that the National Taxpayer Advocate recently noted goes back decades. “By tax day this year, millions of paper-filed 2020 tax returns will not have been processed, while millions of current-year returns will likewise gather dust.  Steps to prevent or minimize this disruption were not taken by the IRS--and in some cases have still not been taken. “For example, many may not be aware that in order for the IRS to process a paper-filed return, each entry on the return is manually inputted by an IRS employee.  These taxpayer-funded employees would better serve taxpayers by answering phones or responding to correspondence.  “This is not simply a problem of taxpayers choosing to deluge the IRS with paper-filed returns.  In many cases, IRS forms and schedules simply cannot be electronically-filed, including where a taxpayer could e-file and attempts to do so but is rejected by the IRS’s confusing digital signature process. “This is not a funding issue.  Solutions to these challenges have existed for years, but to-date have not been implemented.  The IRS can further transition away from mandating any return or form to be paper filed. “With respect to rejected e-filings--which I understand to be often caused by a taxpayer being unable to locate or recall one of two possible e-filing PINs--the IRS could implement additional means to e-sign a return.  I am aware the IRS with your leadership, Commissioner, is working on this.  So-called ‘2D bar codes’--much like the supermarket barcodes that have been used for decades--could eliminate the IRS’s need to transcribe paper returns at all. “Solutions like these have been held up for years with no clear reason why, leading to results the current National Taxpayer Advocate Erin Collins calls ‘crazy.’  I agree. “Some say that IRS budgets are to blame for all that ails the IRS, but this misdirection distracts from real issues at the IRS.  It also cherry-picks data to paint a misleading portrait.  Many begin their analysis of IRS budgets beginning only with fiscal year 2010, which was a thirty-plus year high-water mark for the IRS’s budget and an outlier.  Viewed in the longer-run, the IRS’s average inflation-adjusted budget is much lower, with recent years aligning with this average.  The efforts to try to claim that Republicans have slashed the IRS budget are simply not accurate. “Budget arguments are also often invoked in attempts to justify massive IRS funding for things that do not address the customer-experience problems plaguing the IRS.  For example, some advocate for increased IRS funding to generate revenue through heavy-handed enforcement. “This year’s Presidential budget request seeks a large enforcement funding boost, and its ‘reserve fund’ placeholder for the reckless Build Back Better legislation would provide a truly massive $80 billion infusion of mandatory funding primarily focused on enforcement.  The reserve fund could also accommodate the Administration’s chilling proposal to monitor Americans’ bank account flows of as little as $600. “I strongly oppose forcing community banks and credit unions to report sensitive and private customer data of law-abiding taxpayers to the IRS in order to raise more money by snooping through customer accounts and will continue to aggressively push back on any attempts add this reporting scheme to legislation.  I remain concerned about huge funding boosts that would increase audits on small businesses and middle-class Americans, rather than prioritize taxpayer services. “Our hearing in February had a positive dialogue spotlighting IRS customer service challenges and solutions and I have a number of questions about ways to address the long-standing IRS problems we can agree on, such as outdated IT, and ways to ensure the next filing season will be much better than the last several. “Given your stated commitment to making these improvements, Commissioner, I look forward to continuing to work with you on this. “Thank you, Mr. Chairman.” ###"

Ambassador Tai.“On your drive here, Ambassador Tai, you passed an inscription engraved on the National Archives: ‘past is prologue.’  An enduring piece of past wisdom is President Reagan’s 1982 address to the nation on international free trade, which was founded on his personal commitment to free market principles, both at home and abroad. “He explained that as Americans, we must, ‘[I]nsist on sound domestic policies at home that bring down inflation…’  Provide opportunity for ‘free world countries [to] go forward and sustain the drive toward more open markets,’ such as the meeting he organized in Geneva that eventually led to the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO).  And—most importantly—negotiate.  Particularly for free trade agreements, like the United States’ first two free trade agreements, with Israel and Canada, that were led by Reagan’s administration.“President Reagan’s policies helped to break inflation and to restore American leadership on trade.  But, it seems President Biden’s trade policy takes the opposite stance.  At a time when inflation has soared to 7.9 percent, President Biden says he will not pursue trade agreements until his domestic agenda is complete.“If ever enacted, this reckless spending agenda would not only make inflation worse, it would undercut U.S. leadership on trade by promoting a China-styled industrial policy. “Proposed electric vehicle provisions, for example, will discriminate against 48 of the 50 models available for sale in the United States.  It is no wonder why 25 foreign ambassadors told Congress these provisions breached our international trade obligations.“I am disappointed that the Administration continues to pursue this agenda, instead of focusing efforts on negotiations for new trade agreements.  This is a shame because the Biden Administration knows better.  Its 2022 Trade Agenda opens on the very point—and, I quote—the ‘Biden Administration recognizes that trade can—and should—be a force for good.’“Absolutely.  My home state of Idaho is proof positive of that proposition.  In 2019, international trade supported over 200,000 Idaho jobs—or almost 20 percent of the state’s employment.  Trade liberalization also saves the average Idaho family of four more than $10,000 per year.“The problem here is that President Biden’s recognition of trade’s overall importance is not matched with an agenda that contains the requisite ambition to succeed.  There is not a single free trade agreement (FTA) under consideration in this agenda.  Free trade agreements open opportunities.  We have seen it over and over.  The past really is prologue.“Idaho’s dairy exports to Korea increased by more than 250 percent since our free trade agreement entered into force in 2012.  But, in lieu of trade agreements, this Administration is proposing dialogues and frameworks, including the new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, or IPEF.  IPEF may be a positive first step to engagement in Asia.  But, it is no substitute for a comprehensive trade agreement. “The Center for Strategic and International Studies will soon release its upcoming analysis on IPEF, based on conversations with over a dozen governments in the Indo-Pacific. “Two points from its analysis are instructive:“First, U.S. engagement is welcome in the Indo-Pacific.  One diplomat stressed, in particular, that his country wants the United States to ‘lay out an affirmative economic strategy that complements its security presence in the region.’“Second, our partners ‘see the IPEF as a proposal with many U.S. asks, few U.S. offers, and a variety of credible regional alternatives to the framework that could provide more tangible benefits.’“If the U.S. is to meet and exceed China’s challenge, then the U.S. must make stronger commitments than China.  Regrettably, if the Administration’s negotiating ambitions are low, its consultations with Congress on the few negotiations actually taking place is even lower.“At last year’s trade agenda hearing, Ambassador Tai stated that she would brief this Committee before and after each negotiating session with respect to a waiver of the WTO TRIPS Agreement.  That hasn’t happened. “USTR recently issued a press release confirming that it had reached a ‘compromise outcome’ on the TRIPS waiver in discussions with South Africa, India, and the European Union.  USTR refuses to share the text of that ‘outcome’ with this Committee.  While members may have different views on the merits of this waiver, every Member here should agree with me that the Administration cannot withhold documents concerning U.S. rights under a congressionally-approved trade agreement.  We need to see the document, and we need to ask questions, because that is what respect for the Constitution requires.“There are serious questions to be asked.  For example, last week, South Africa and India joined with Russia and China to establish the ‘BRICS Vaccine R&D Center’ on vaccine cooperation.  Congress should know whether the text permits South Africa and India to share insights on U.S. intellectual property with Russia and China.“USTR’s transparency with the public is also poor.  The American innovators who developed the vaccines provided plenty of evidence on why a waiver is unnecessary, including that 20 billion doses will be produced this year—more than enough to achieve the World Health Organization’s vaccination target.“The Administration, however, has not shared with the public any evidence as to why a waiver will get shots into arms any faster.  As disappointed as I am about negotiations and congressional consultation, I also have concerns about enforcement. “Americans need to compete on a level playing field, and I appreciate the Administration’s prosecution of two USMCA labor disputes under the Brown-Wyden mechanism.  Yet, much more can be done.  With respect to USMCA, agricultural market challenges remain.  Mexico continues to restrict potatoes and delay approval of biotech crops.  Discriminatory practices targeting our technology companies are also increasing.  Rather than launch cases, the Administration appears to be in retreat. “For example, the trade agenda highlights that USTR reached agreements to terminate our Section 301 investigations against various countries over discriminatory digital services taxes.“Let us be very clear about what this means—those countries are going to continue imposing discriminatory taxes on U.S. firms.  They may give a credit one day, but only if Congress approves the Biden Administration’s international tax deal.  The Biden Administration is blessing foreign governments which discriminate against Americans as long as Congress refuses to go along with its plan to cede taxing rights and revenue to foreign competitors.“Let me close with where I started—past being prologue.  History proves that Americans do not fear competition, but rise to it.  Now is the time to seize on that history and to go further on trade, not shrink from it.“Thank you, Mr. Chairman.”"

https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/gimmicks-wont-solve-skyrocketing-gas-prices,"To lower gas prices and combat inflation, policymakers must address root causesWashington, D.C.-- U.S. Senator for Idaho Mike Crapo, Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, spoke on the Senate Floor about high gas prices and misguided proposals to lower them, like a federal gas tax holiday.  Crapo urged colleagues to support policies that unleash America’s domestic energy potential, reduce reliance on volatile foreign actors like Russia and deliver cost savings to middle-class families across the country.  “The effort to blame [high gas prices] on what has happened in Ukraine overlooks the cause of the phenomenal rise in gas prices for a year before Putin even invaded.  Definitely, the invasion did increase pressures on gas prices, but the problem is this Administration’s policies have dramatically reduced the supply in the United States.  Americans across this country know how supply and demand impacts price. . . .“The solution to rising gas prices is not a tax holiday, which would offer little relief but would threaten infrastructure investments and worsen our national debt situation.  Nor is the solution a tax on American companies who increase their production of oil and gas to try and help us become more energy independent.  Nor is it stimulus checks, which have the potential, as the past ones have, to increase gas prices even further and push inflation even higher.  Nor is it to encourage other hostile regimes to produce more oil. “The only lasting solution to our current problems is to bolster American oil and gas production to replace not only Russian imports but to facilitate exports to support our allies, and end their dependence on Russia. . . .“Republicans believe we can and should be doing more to unleash America’s domestic energy potential, reduce reliance on volatile foreign actors like Russia and deliver cost savings to middle-class families across the country.  Hardworking American families need real relief, not political gimmicks.”Watch Crapo’s full remarks here, or read them below._________________Mister President, reserving the right to object, let me begin by saying that my friends and colleagues across the aisle are right about one thing: gas prices are incredibly high right now in this country. The effort to blame this on what has happened in Ukraine, however, overlooks the cause of the phenomenal rise in gas prices for a year before Putin even invaded.  Definitely, the invasion did increase pressures on gas prices, but the problem is this Administration’s policies have dramatically reduced the supply in the United States.  Americans across this country know how supply and demand impacts price. The gas tax holiday that is now being proposed is not a solution; it is a political gimmick that would not stop skyrocketing gas prices or inflation.  In fact, Larry Summers said in a Wall Street Journal podcast, ‘I think a gas tax idea is saved only by its triviality from being one of the worst public ideas of the decade.  It will have little effect over any reasonable horizon on prices, It will be counterproductive from an environmental point of view, it is the ultimate policy gimmick.’ Rather than accept responsibility for 14 months of reckless spending or the more than 40 percent increase in gas prices that had already occurred before the Russian invasion, Democrats want to blame higher gas prices on the Russian invasion or corporate greed. They also want to ignore the consequences of their relentless attacks on the American oil and gas industry, the Administration’s overly bureaucratic permit and regulatory process for domestic energy production and misguided policy decisions like canceling the Keystone XL pipeline. The solution to rising gas prices is not a tax holiday, which would offer little relief but would threaten infrastructure investments and worsen our national debt situation. Nor is the solution a tax on American companies who increase their production of oil and gas to try and help us become more energy independent. Nor is it stimulus checks, which have the potential, as the past ones have, to increase gas prices even further and push inflation even higher.   Nor is it to encourage other hostile regimes to produce more oil. The only lasting solution to our current problems is to bolster American oil and gas production to replace not only Russian imports but to facilitate exports to support our allies, and end their dependence on Russia. Indeed, I, along with a number of my Republican colleagues, have sponsored proposals to enhance U.S. energy independence and undo many of President Biden’s misguided energy policies. Republicans believe we can and should be doing more to unleash America’s domestic energy potential, reduce reliance on volatile foreign actors like Russia and deliver cost savings to middle-class families across the country.   Hardworking American families need real relief, not political gimmicks. That is why I oppose this gas tax holiday. I urge my Democrat colleagues to abandon the reckless spending and tax policies that already failed, which seem to be contemplated in the President’s newly introduced budget, and support proposals that will actually lower prices for everyday Americans. For those reasons, I object. ###"
https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/crapo-risch-demand-answers-on-changes-to-border-security-policies,"Washington, D.C.--Today, U.S. Senators Mike Crapo and Jim Risch (both R-Idaho) joined Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and 10 of their colleagues in seeking answers from U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on recent changes to how the Department enforces border security and processes migrants at the southern border.“In Fiscal Year (FY) 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 1.7 million encounters with individuals attempting to cross the border illegally, the highest single year total ever recorded,” the Senators wrote .  “Even more troubling is the fact that this year is on pace to far exceed the record-breaking numbers from last year.”“The Biden administration’s decision to terminate the Title 42 public health order that provided border agents the authority to perform expedited removals is the latest example of troubling policy moves,” the Senators continued.  “Last year, Title 42 was used more than 1 million times to quickly expel individuals who crossed the border illegally.  Such a move will undoubtedly leave CBP and law enforcement along the border vulnerable to being overwhelmed in the face of sustained record levels of illegal crossings.”U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina), Jim Inhofe (R-Oklahoma), Mike Braun (R-Indiana), John Boozman (R-Arkansas), Rand Paul (R-Kentucky), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Roy Blunt (R-Missouri), John Hoeven (R-North Dakota), Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) also signed the letter.The full letter can be found HERE and below.Dear Secretary Mayorkas:We write today to express our grave concerns with actions taken by the Biden administration and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the effect they will have on our ability to secure our southern border. These concerns are exacerbated as it becomes more likely every day that this year we will surpass the record-breaking number of encounters at the southern border experienced last year.In Fiscal Year (FY) 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 1.7 million encounters with individuals attempting to cross the border illegally, the highest single year total ever recorded. Even more troubling is the fact that this year is on pace to far exceed the record-breaking numbers from last year. In February, CBP recorded nearly 165,000 encounters, setting a record for that particular month and marking the twelfth month in a row in which encounters exceeded 150,000.Securing the southern border and deterring the sustained, record-breaking flow of illegal and irregular migration should be a top priority for DHS. Unfortunately, the Biden administration has done the opposite by instituting policies that encourage individuals to make the dangerous trek north and entrust their safety to dangerous drug cartels at the risk of being murdered, assaulted or trafficked.In September of last year, you issued new guidance to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for its enforcement and removal operations which dramatically limited the scope of individuals ICE prioritizes for enforcement. With the publication of the ICE Annual Report last month, we learned the results of this policy and, as expected, they are extremely disconcerting as both arrests and removals reached the lowest levels ever recorded. Even more troubling is the fact that arrests and removals of those convicted of a crime were down 48% and 63%, respectively.More recently, your department has moved to dramatically alter America’s system for granting asylum by striping immigration judges of decision-making authority and giving it to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) asylum officers. Such a move raises serious red flags, given that 85% of determinations of credible fear by a USCIS asylum officers are later overturned by an immigration judge.Finally, the Biden administration’s decision to terminate the Title 42 public health order that provided border agents the authority to perform expedited removals is the latest example of troubling policy moves. Last year, Title 42 was used more than 1 million times to quickly expel individuals who crossed the border illegally. Such a move will undoubtedly leave CBP and law enforcement along the border vulnerable to being overwhelmed in the face of sustained record levels of illegal crossings. It has been reported that there are some 25,000 individuals already waiting in Mexico for Title 42 to be lifted and US intelligence estimates an influx of more than 170,000 total.It’s clear that the humanitarian and national security crisis at our southern border will not slow in the coming months and is on pace to be even worse. We understand DHS is actively preparing to respond to the increased illegal and irregular migration, but more details of the plans are needed. We ask that you answer the following questions by April 27, 2022.Addressing the problems facing our broken immigration system in order to provide an effective and efficient legal pathway for those who wish to share in and contribute to the success of our great nation is, as it should be, a priority. However, this cannot be accomplished until we are able to properly secure our borders. Thank you for your attention to this request, and we look forward to your reply.###"

However, that potential will not be realized without full implementation and enforcement of the Agreement as written. Critically, while it would be preferable to resolve USMCA’s implementation issues through negotiation, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (“USTR”) must be prepared to use the strong and innovative enforcement tools that Congress pushed to include in USMCA to ensure that the Agreement lives up to its full potential.  Accordingly, we appreciate that USTR has initiated two cases under the Rapid Response Mechanism to address labor violations in Mexico and successfully litigated Canada’s failure to properly allocate its dairy tariff-rate quotas. Yet we remain concerned that Canada and Mexico continue to ignore many other critical USMCA obligations. To that end, we are highlighting a number of outstanding issues where USTR must ensure that the United States gets what it bargained for, including by taking enforcement actions if necessary. Labor  Moreover, in addition to these significant labor reforms, USMCA contained obligations related to the goal of eliminating all forms of forced or compulsory labor. On October 21, 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a withhold release order to stop importation of certain tomatoes from Mexico produced by forced labor. This finding of forced labor in Mexico is of significant concern.  Agriculture        With respect to Mexico, its failure to adopt measures to recognize certain common cheese names and its new conformity assessment requirements for imported dairy products are of significant concern to U.S. dairy producers seeking access to the Mexican market.  Digital Trade  Services Environment  Energy Telecommunications Pharmaceuticals USMCA earned broad support from bipartisan members of Congress, as well as stakeholders representing an array of interests. The Agreement promised to improve upon our existing trading relationship with Canada and Mexico, including through innovative provisions to swiftly address labor violations, promote agricultural market access through science-based decision-making, advance intellectual property rights protection, and improve the regulation of state-owned enterprises. Unless Canada and Mexico are held to their commitments under USMCA, however, U.S. workers, businesses, and farmers will be denied the full benefits they were promised. Therefore, it is of critical importance that USTR continue to diligently monitor Canada and Mexico’s compliance with the Agreement and ensure that every chapter of the Agreement is fully enforced.

https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/big-win-for-dairy-farmers-after-bipartisan-push-against-unfair-trade-practices,"New Ruling on Major Trade Dispute Comes After Senators Crapo and Smith’s Efforts to Ensure Fair Playing Field for American Dairy ExportsWashington, D.C.--On National Milk Day, U.S. Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, lauded a major victory for U.S. dairy farmers after joining with U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minnesota) to spearhead congressional efforts to hold Canada accountable for violations of a key trade agreement.  “Enforcing our trade agreements to open dairy markets with our trading partners will feed our neighbors and create jobs at home,” said Crapo.  “This is a huge victory in tearing down further barriers for Idaho’s and the nation’s dairies.  This decision will further unlock the promises of the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA) and meet the needs of our 21st Century producers.” “Idaho dairy producers support free trade and welcome competition when the playing field is level,” said Rick Naerebout, CEO of the Idaho Dairymen’s Association.  “The Idaho Dairymen’s Association thanks Senator Crapo for leading the bipartisan effort in Congress to ensure that our trading partners in Canada meet the commitments for U.S. dairy access to their market that were made in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).” “Greater access to global markets is critical to dairy farmers in Idaho and elsewhere across America.  That’s why it’s been so important for the U.S. to defend the full dairy export benefits USMCA has to offer.  Senator Crapo has been a champion in fighting for the export rights of dairy farmers and dairy manufacturers like Darigold through his sustained insistence on ensuring USMCA is fully and faithfully implemented,” said Allan Huttema, Chairman of Northwest Dairy Association.  “The onus is now on Canada to follow through and make the necessary changes to come into compliance with its USMCA dairy obligations.  The U.S. government should ensure that nothing short of full compliance by Canada is accepted.” In July 2021, Allan Huttema, an Idahoan from Parma and Chairman of the Northwest Dairy Association and Darigold Board of Directors, provided testimony before a Senate Finance Committee hearing on USMCA enforcement and implementation. In August 2020, Senators Crapo and Smith led a bipartisan letter with 25 additional colleagues identifying dairy-related provisions not being upheld in the USMCA.  In their letter, the Senators urged the U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Trade Representative to use USMCA’s enforcement measures to ensure full compliance from Canada and Mexico with the trade deal. A USMCA panel recently ruled in favor of the U.S., agreeing that Canada is breaching its commitments.  Specifically, the panel ruled that Canada is reserving most of the in-quota quantity in its dairy tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) for the exclusive use of Canadian processors, a breach of the USMCA Senators Crapo and Smith raised in their letter. This historic win is an important step to eliminating unjustified trade restrictions on American dairy products, and will ensure that the U.S. dairy industry and its workers get the full benefit of the USMCA to market and sell U.S. products to Canadian consumers. ###"

https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/crapo-joins-bipartisan-bill-to-boost-randd-grants,"Washington, D.C.--Today, U.S. Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) joined U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho) to reintroduce bipartisan legislation to improve underserved states’ ability to successfully compete for Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) awards.The FAST Fix Act will reform the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Federal and State Technology (FAST) Partnership Program to encourage federal research and development grants to be awarded to small businesses and universities in states that have historically lacked SBIR and STTR awards.  If enacted, this bill would encourage more awards to commercialize ideas, compete in the global marketplace, and create local jobs.  Additional co-sponsors include U.S. Senators Jacky Rosen (D-Nevada), John Hoeven (R-North Dakota), Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-Nevada), Shelley Moore Capito (R-West Virginia), John Kennedy (R-Louisiana) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska).“The FAST Partnership Program helps next generation research and development small businesses prevail,” said Senator Crapo.  “The FAST Fix Act will bolster competition for FAST grants in rural states like Idaho and encourage more participation in the grant programs to help certain small businesses reach their full potential.”“The FAST Partnership Program is not sufficiently focused to reach the underserved states it’s intended to benefit,” said Senator Risch.  “The FAST Fix Act will make commonsense changes to the program application process to ensure research and development grants reach states like Idaho to galvanize our continued growth and success.”“Nevada small businesses are the engine of our economy and particularly during this period of economic uncertainty, we must do more to help small businesses access SBIR and STTR award opportunities,” said Senator Rosen.  “I’m proud to support this important piece of bipartisan legislation that will open the door for more funding opportunities to Nevada’s hard-to-reach communities to support innovation and job growth.  I will continue working in Congress to strengthen economic development in underserved areas of the Silver State.”“Rural states like North Dakota will benefit from the FAST Fix Act as it aims to give states that have been less likely to receive SBIR and STTR awards a fair shot moving forward,” said Senator Hoeven.  “This will help encourage research and development, make us more competitive in the global marketplace and create local jobs in less-populated states like ours.  It’s important that we continue to expand economic opportunities and help entrepreneurs and small businesses recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.”   “As part of my Innovation State Initiative, I’ve been working to help Nevada’s economy diversify and further develop its cutting-edge industries for the 21st century,” said Senator Cortez Masto.  “The FAST Fix Act will help small businesses, startups, and research institutions all over the Silver State get key federal grants to pioneer creative new technologies and approaches.”“It’s important underserved areas like those in West Virginia are not left behind when it comes to federal grant funding for small businesses and universities,” Senator Capito said.  “Investing in our local communities will bring more jobs, and these grants can serve as a catalyst for economic growth.  The FAST Fix Act would do away with the one-size-fits-all bureaucratic process, and help SBA better fulfill its mission of serving community employers and workers.”“States like Louisiana use FAST grants to help small businesses succeed, but the program’s assistance is not reaching communities that rely on these resources to spark innovation.  The FAST Fix Act would prioritize applicants in historically underserved areas in Louisiana and elsewhere.  I’m proud to partner with Sen. Risch to see this through,” said Senator Kennedy.“The FAST Partnership Program is intended to aid disadvantaged, research and development focused small businesses.  But over the life of the program, Alaska has consistently ranked at the bottom of the list of states getting awards – demonstrating the program is not working for Alaska and other states.  The FAST Fix Act implements small but significant changes to the program to improve funding allocation and give higher priority to applicants in historically underperforming, states such as Alaska,” said Senator Murkowski.  “Reforming this partnership is an important step toward maximizing the innovation of Alaskans.”Background: The FAST Partnership Program provides one-year funding to organizations to develop SBIR/STTR outreach and training programs to help facilitate more awards in their state.  Special consideration is intended for entities in states that have historically lacked awards.  However, under the one-size-fits-all application process, all applicants are equally considered for the FAST program regardless of SBIR/STTR award history.  As a result, the program is not penetrating the very states it’s intended to serve.The FAST Fix Act would increase competition for FAST grants in each state and give priority to applicants located in historically underperforming states to encourage more SBIR/STTR awards are distributed to underserved areas.###"
https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/crapo-bennet-reintroduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-streamline-access-to-resources-for-veterans,"“Network Hubs” Would Centralize Resources for VeteransWashington, D.C.--U.S. Senators Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Michael Bennet (D-Colorado) have reintroduced the Helping Unleash Benefits and Services (HUBS) for Veterans Act, bipartisan legislation to support local “network hubs,” which streamline access to essential resources for veterans, servicemembers and their families.  “Navigating a number of streams of information to gain access to the resources they need can be a daunting and time-consuming task for many servicemembers transitioning from the military to civilian world,” said Crapo.  “Many community-based organizations in Idaho have already stepped up to provide crucial long-term, holistic support and assistance.  Prioritizing network hubs to help provide these servicemembers more wraparound services from one entry point would reduce the burden on veterans to navigate each path individually.” “Colorado has a wide range of resources available for servicemembers, veterans, and their families.  However, these essential services and resources are often spread across agencies and organizations, forcing veterans to navigate a confusing bureaucracy to access the benefits they earned,” said Bennet. “Already, communities in Colorado are recognizing the benefit of centralizing resources into a network hub that can best help individuals find support.  The HUBS for Veterans Act bill would elevate this idea and increase access to resources for more veterans, meeting them where they are.” “The mission of the Idaho Veterans Chamber of Commerce is to bridge the gap through our strong partnerships within the civilian and military community by delivery of wraparound navigation services to connect our military and civilian community to the right resources, the first time, every time,” said Idaho Veterans Chamber of Commerce Founding Executive Director Mindi Anderson.  “This model has proven to work as we have seen in the Joining Forces Treasure Valley group, which has executed this model for the last 10 years as a group of civilian and military partners that come together of their own free will and time to support the needs of the military community.   Senators Crapo and Bennet’s bill would support what we already know in Idaho, and that is, we must create the collaboration space to bring our military and civilian communities together to serve our veterans, military serving, and their family members holistically, and further build unity in the state of Idaho.”  The HUBS for Veterans Act would authorize a five-year pilot program to provide matching grant funds to non-profit organizations that offer access to multiple, wraparound services from one source, or “network hubs.”  The bill directs the Department of Labor (DOL), in consultation with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to prioritize network hubs that provide job recruitment training, educational support services, financial services, entrepreneurship training, behavioral health services and assistance in accessing benefits administered by the VA. The bill would also ensure that servicemembers receive information through the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) about network hubs located in the community in which they will reside once they become a civilian.  TAP is an interagency collaboration between the Department of Defense, DOL and VA that provides information to servicemembers and their families to help them transition from military service to civilian life. Crapo and Bennet first introduced the HUBS for Veterans Act in 2018.  The bill text is available HERE.  ###"
https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/crapo-risch-introduce-state-fiscal-flexibility-act,"Bill would prevent federal government from banning state tax cuts Washington, D.C.--U.S. Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, and U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho) have introduced S. 743, the “State Fiscal Flexibility Act,” a bill to eliminate a provision in the American Rescue Plan that prevents states from using relief funds to cut taxes.  “If a state like Idaho wants to provide tax relief in the interest of economic recovery, and to help people return to earning their livelihoods, the American Rescue Plan says it will be financially punished by the federal government,” said Crapo.  “This infringes on states’ authority to design their own fiscal policies, and invites partisan politics into federal and state relations.” “Last year, Governor Little and the Idaho State Legislature cut red tape and limited government spending to put the state in the strongest possible position to emerge from this pandemic,” said Risch.  “Yet under Democrats’ COVID spending plan, poorly managed states receive a windfall while fiscally responsible states like Idaho are barred from providing tax relief to its citizens. With this legislation, financial competence will be rightly rewarded—not penalized.” “Under the Democrats’ illogical plan, Idaho would potentially subsidize poorly managed states simply because we are using our record budget surplus to pursue historic tax relief for our citizens,” said Governor Brad Little.  “We achieved our record budget surplus after years of responsible, conservative governing and quick action during the pandemic, and our surplus should be returned to Idahoans as I proposed.  Simply put, any federal relief funds directed to states should be allocated fairly. What incentive do states have to do the right thing when they get bailed out for doing the wrong thing?"" The American Rescue Plan includes a $350 billion bailout for states, rewarding those with poor fiscal management and punishing those who operated responsibly during the pandemic.  Funds can be used for virtually anything a state chooses to spend money on, with next to nothing in terms of constraints or restrictions.  However, there are two restrictions: one is that a state may not use recovery funds “for deposit into any pension fund,” and the other is that any state wishing to provide tax relief may do so, but only at a punishable cost.  The latter provision serves no useful purpose, other than to convey the message that tax cuts are not favored by the federal government.  The “State Fiscal Flexibility Act” would eliminate this provision, giving power back to the states to determine what fiscal policies will best serve their citizens. Text of the legislation can be found HERE.  In addition to Senators Crapo and Risch, Finance Committee Members Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), John Cornyn (R-Texas), John Thune, (R-South Dakota), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Tim Scott (R-South Carolina), James Lankford (R-Oklahoma), Steve Daines (R-Montana) and Todd Young (R-Indiana) are original co-sponsors of the measure. ###"
https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/crapo-joins-call-to-stop-sale-of-seattle-archives-facility,"Letter points to concerns over lack of Tribal consultation in “legally flawed” decision to sellWashington, D.C.--U.S. Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) joined Senators Maria Cantwell (D-Washington) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) among the 25 bipartisan congressional members of the Idaho, Washington, Alaska and Oregon delegations in sending a letter to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), requesting it stop the sale of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) facility in Seattle in light of a recent court decision temporarily blocking the sale from moving forward.  Fellow members of the Idaho delegation, Senator Jim Risch and Representatives Russ Fulcher and Mike Simpson also signed the letter. “The items at the Seattle Federal Records Center tell the story of our great state, from the Tribes who originally inhabited this land to Idaho’s eventual statehood,” Crapo said.  “They are vital to the states, Tribes and local universities examining this history.  Moreover, the lack of Tribal consultation on this matter is concerning.  I am hopeful that OMB can reverse its decision and find a better solution.”   “The process leading to the proposed sale of the facility under the Federal Assets and Transfer Act (FASTA) was legally flawed and importantly, OMB failed to consult with Tribal governments and organizations in violation of its own Tribal consultation policies,” the letter reads in part.  “We are not aware of any effort by OMB, the Public Buildings Reform Board (PBRB), NARA or the General Services Administration (GSA) to consult with Tribal representatives at any stage of the process.  It was only after OMB’s decision to approve the PBRB’s list of facilities proposed for sale that Tribes and Tribal organizations were notified of the sale and NARA offered the opportunity discuss its future plans with them.  This is not an acceptable degree of Tribal consultation, and clearly, the sale of this facility greatly impacts Native Americans and Alaska Natives in our states… As a result, OMB must recognize and remedy its failure to enforce Tribal consultation policies in the FASTA process and its own lack of Tribal consultation in its decision to approval to sale of the Seattle NARA facility.” The Pacific Northwest congressional delegations have long advocated for these important records to stay in Seattle.  Following the announcement of the intended sale of the facility, senators and representatives sent a bipartisan, bicameral letter to OMB expressing concern and disapproval of the plans to move these records out of the region.  Members representing the region also came together to secure language in the 2020 appropriations bills that required the agencies charged with the sale of the facility and movement of the records to find ways to keep the records in the Pacific Northwest. Additional members who signed the letter include U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-Washington), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon); and U.S. Representatives Pramila Jayapal (D-Washington), Don Young (R-Alaska), Derek Kilmer (D-Washington), Cliff Bentz (R-Oregon), Earl Blumenauer (D-Oregon), Suzanne Bonamici (D-Oregon), Peter DeFazio (D-Oregon), Suzan DelBene (D-Washington), Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Washington), Rick Larsen (D-Washington), Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Washington), Kurt Schrader (D-Oregon), Kim Schrier, M.D. (D-Washington), Adam Smith (D-Washington) and Marilyn Strickland (D-Washington). Full text of the letter can be accessed HERE. ###"
https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/crapo-massive-covid-relief-bill-misses-the-mark-,"Washington, D.C.--U.S. Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, voted against H.R.1319, the nearly $2 trillion budget reconciliation bill.  This partisan bill, the product of a rushed process and non-pandemic wish-list items, passed in the U.S. Senate by a party-line vote of 50-49. “In 2020, Congress passed five bipartisan bills, totaling nearly $4 trillion, in pandemic relief,” said Crapo.  “No bill earned fewer than 90 votes in the Senate, and the largest of those bills--the CARES Act--had unanimous Senate support.  The fifth bill was signed into law a few short months ago, and over $1 trillion in relief funds have yet to be spent.  Our economy is recovering.  Just yesterday, the jobs report beat expectations.  Vaccine distribution and administration is well underway and accelerating.  This fight is not over, and some further relief is required, but no clear data justifies the scale or scope of this bill.  “Economists across the political spectrum have said this bill is out of proportion compared to what is actually needed.  Congress should have focused on policies to help get more vaccines into peoples’ arms, get kids back in school, reopen businesses’ doors, and finally put this pandemic behind us.  Only a fraction of this bill goes toward vaccines and the health care fight.  Moreover, we should have debated political wish-list wants versus Americans’ needs.  This process bypassed committees, bypassed regular order, and was devoid of true deliberation or debate.  This spending spree grossly misses its mark, and places an undue burden on future generations.”   Senate Republicans filed hundreds of amendments to improve the legislation.  As the lead Republican of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Crapo offered several commonsense provisions to improve the bill: Right-Size State and Local Recovery Funds: This amendment would have reduced funding for state and local governments to an appropriate amount of about $100 billion, from $350 billion.  Overall, state and local governments have fared much better than was initially expected near the beginning of the pandemic, and much of the new funding will go to states with little or no need, including those in a budget surplus.  Reducing the amount is a far more fiscally responsible result for taxpayers.  Targeted Relief: This $1.9 trillion bill sacrifices immediate, targeted COVID relief for struggling workers and main street businesses in favor of longstanding Democrat priorities. This motion would have simply sent the bill to the Finance Committee--where this process should have started under regular order--with instructions to provide targeted and timely tax relief to families and businesses that have been hit hardest by the pandemic.Prevent Medicare Cuts: The Congressional Budget Office estimates this $1.9 trillion bill will trigger a $36 billion cut to Medicare next year.  This amounts to a staggering cut of $180 billion over 5 years--a direct hit to the very people this bill is intended to help.  This motion would have sent the bill back to the Finance Committee with directions to reduce spending by an amount that would help to avoid those $180 billion in Medicare cuts.   Preserving States’ Rights: The relief bill includes a restriction on allowable uses of funds for states and territories to prevent them from using funds to cut taxes, essentially saying that tax cuts are not viewed favorably by the federal government, even if implemented during a pandemic and associated large economic downturn.  Such a restriction also infringes on states’ authority to design its own fiscal policies to suit whatever state governments believe are appropriate.  The amendment would have eliminated this provision.###"

https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/idaho-oregon-senators-leading-bipartisan-push-for-critical-county-payments,"Crapo, Risch, Wyden, Risch, Merkley lead legislation to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools programWashington, D.C.--Idaho and Oregon congressional leaders are pushing to ensure counties do not lose out on essential services due to federal land ownership.  The bipartisan push for reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program is led by U.S. Senators Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon).  The bill would reauthorize the SRS program through September 2022.  The program, which helps fund essential services in rural communities home to federal land, expired in September 2020; the last payment under the current authorization is scheduled for April 2021, less than two months from now. “The SRS program is a critical funding stream for many rural communities in Idaho home to large tracts of federal land,” Crapo said.  “Nearly two-thirds of Idaho is federally-owned, which severely limits the tax base for law enforcement, schools and road construction because federal lands contribute no property taxes.  Our legislation has strong, bipartisan support and passed out of Committee in the last Congress.  It deserves consideration by the full Senate as soon as possible to help these communities have a more predictable source of income.  I remain committed to working to find a more permanent solution.” “With the federal government owning two-thirds of Idaho’s land, a missed or delayed SRS payment isn’t just an inconvenience for our rural counties,” Risch said.  “It can be a death sentence.  We made a commitment to timber communities throughout Idaho and the West, and we have a moral obligation to see it through.  Congress must reauthorize SRS.” “Oregonians living and working in rural counties that have absorbed body blows from COVID and wildfires are counting on these resources now for their schools, roads and other essential services,” Wyden said.  “This two-year extension of Secure Rural Schools is an urgently needed must-do while the work continues on a permanent SRS endowment that gets rural counties once and for all off this roller coaster of uncertainty.” “Our rural communities have been among the hardest hit by the health and economic impacts of the ongoing coronavirus crisis,” Merkley said.  “Those consequences have only been made worse by the fact that many of these towns and counties are losing critical revenue they need to pay their first responders, teachers, and other essential workers at a time when they are needed most.  We must fully fund the SRS program, so these communities can access the lifelines they need to get through this pandemic and thrive on the other side.” In the 116th Congress, Crapo, Risch, Wyden and Merkley led similar legislation to extend SRS for two years, which was voted out of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee unanimously.  It did not receive consideration on the Senate Floor before the end of the Congress.   Co-sponsors of the legislation include Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-West Virginia), Jacky Rosen (D-Nevada), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nevada), Mark Kelly (D-Arizona), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Debbie Stabenow (D-Michigan), Michael Bennet (D-Colorado), Jon Tester (D-Montana), Patty Murray (D-Washington), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Dianne Feinstein (D-California), Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Arizona) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont). Full text of the bill can be found HERE.  Background:The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act was enacted in 2000 to financially assist counties with public, tax-exempt forestlands.  Since then, Crapo, Risch Wyden and Merkley have worked to give SRS a more permanent role in assisting rural counties with large tracts of federal lands.  Critical services at the county level have historically been funded in part with a 25 percent share of timber receipts from federal U.S. Forest Service lands and a 50 percent share of timber receipts from federal Oregon and California Grant Lands managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management.  As those revenues have fallen or fluctuated due to reduced timber harvest and market forces, SRS payments helped bridge the gap to keep rural schools open, provide road maintenance, support search and rescue efforts and other essential county services.  Since enacted in 2000, SRS has provided a total of $7 billion in payments to more than 700 counties and 4,400 school districts in more than 40 states to fund schools and essential services like roads and public safety.  In recent years, however, Congress has allowed SRS funding to lapse and decrease, creating massive uncertainty for counties as they budget for basic county services. ###"

Star—a father, husband, and decorated war veteran who, as a result of his combat-related injuries, was medically retired.  Major Star passed away on February 13, 2021, after a long fight against cancer. “All active duty and retired military personnel deserve to receive the full care and benefits they have earned, not just fragments offset by government red tape,” said Crapo.  “The Major Richard Star Act will ensure medically retired and combat-injured veterans receive both military retired pay and disability compensation earned through their service to our nation.  I join the nation in mourning the recent loss of Major Richard Star, and I remain dedicated to improving veterans benefits, including fixing unfair discrepancies such as this, to honor his legacy.” “When it comes to our nation’s disabled veterans, we’ve got to cut through the bureaucratic red tape that’s prevented them from getting the full benefits they’ve earned,” said Tester.  “The Major Richard Star Act would fix the unfair offset that prevents thousands of veterans living with the wounds of war from accessing both their disability benefits and retired pay.  And it honors the service and sacrifice of Major Richard Star, whose legacy lives on in our continued fight to ensure our men and women in uniform get the assistance they deserve.” “Congress must work to make certain our veterans aren’t being shortchanged by unfair rules that result in one benefit they’ve earned as a servicemember canceling out another benefit they’re entitled to as a veteran,” said Moran.  “This bipartisan legislation would ensure combat-wounded veterans are able to receive their full disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs and retirement pay from the Department of Defense without having their disability pay deducted from their retirement pay.” Currently, approximately 42,000 military retirees with combat-related injuries qualify for retirement pay for their service from the Department of Defense (DOD) and for disability compensation for injuries acquired in combat from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  However, for retired veterans with less than 20 years of service, their disability pay is deducted from their retirement pay. The Major Richard Star Act would repeal this unfair offset, allowing disabled veterans to receive both their retirement pay and their disability compensation. The Major Richard Star Act received strong backing from leading Veterans Service Organizations including the Military Coalition, Military Officer Association of America (MOAA), Wounded Warrior Project (WWP), Disabled American Veterans (DAV), Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA), The American Legion and American Veterans (AMVETS). Text of the Major Richard Star Act can be found HERE. ###"

https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/crapo-pandemic-relief-should-be-bipartisan,"Washington, D.C.--Today, U.S. Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, voted against the adoption of S.Con.Res.5, the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Budget Resolution.  The proposed budget directs the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over major direct spending programs and all revenue and debt limit legislation, to increase the deficit by a staggering $1.3 trillion, without even determining or deliberating what polices would have the biggest impact in growing our economy. “Over the last year, Congress has come together multiple times to pass massive, bipartisan bills totaling trillions of dollars in relief measures to help American families and businesses weather the pandemic,” said Senator Crapo.  “I have been encouraged by this bipartisan approach, and recent economic projections from the Congressional Budget Office, which estimates that already-enacted pandemic-related provisions, built upon the strong fiscal policy foundation we already have in place, will provide a robust economic recovery, with growth of 3.7 percent over the course of 2021.  It is disappointing that the new Senate Majority has decided to move forward with a budget resolution to quickly pass proposals that have failed to garner broad bipartisan support in the past, instead of focusing on policies that will boost vaccine distribution and help get people back to work and our kids safely back to school.  Although this budget instructs the Senate Finance Committee to spend nearly $1.3 trillion, the reality is that the Committee will likely never debate nor vote on amendments.  Rather, we will be asked to simply rubber stamp partisan legislation passed in the House of Representatives.""  Crapo offered several amendments to the Budget Resolution related to tax relief and health care protections, including an amendment to permanently extend the lower tax rates for individuals and small businesses enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the amendment was not agreed to on a party-line vote).  Crapo ultimately voted against the FY2021 Budget Resolution that the Senate passed by a partisan vote of 51 to 50, because it does not pave the way for fiscally responsible, bipartisan budgeting enabling targeted COVID relief and economic growth.  “As we have done in the past, Congress should be working together on targeted COVID relief for families affected by the pandemic, and pro-growth policies that will allow employers to reopen and rehire,” said Crapo.   ###"

Their trust and experience was especially important as we enter a power-sharing agreement with Democrats and prepare for equal representation on committees,” Leader McConnell said.  “I am very grateful for their work.” The Committee on Committees negotiated the process of assigning Republican senators to committees.  For the 117th Congress, committees will have an equal number of Republicans and Democrats on each committee due to the 50-50 Senate composition.  Senator Crapo also announced that he will serve on three committees for the duration of the 117th Congress:“Americans elected an evenly-split Senate, and working together to achieve policy solutions will be critical in continuing to advance meaningful legislation impacting all Americans,” Crapo continued.  “Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit our nation, our economy was the strongest it has ever been.  Unemployment was down, average hourly earnings were up, and small business owners were reporting record-level employee compensation and more job openings than qualified applicants.  In spite of the best efforts made in the U.S. and around the world, the pandemic wreaked havoc on our economy.  The proven fiscal and regulatory policies of the last Congress put us in a better position to continue to rebound from this crisis, and I look forward to continuing to deliver strong, bipartisan results on these committees.” ###"

In 2017, the Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Yellowstone population of the grizzly bear from the endangered species list, citing a significant increase in bear populations and a doubling of their range land. However in September 2018, a federal judge in Montana ruled to put the Yellowstone grizzly bear back on the endangered species list despite the population surpassing recovery targets.

https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/crapo-colleagues-urge-defense-secretary-to-take-final-steps-in-restoring-full-education-benefits-for-guard-and-reserve-members,"Washington, D.C.--U.S. Senator Mike Crapo joined U.S. Senator John Hoeven (R-North Dakota) and 12 additional Senate colleagues in urging Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to take the final steps to enable members of the Guard and Reserve to concurrently use Federal Tuition Assistance and GI Bill® benefits to fund their education, similar to Active Duty servicemembers.  Senator Crapo signed a similar letter to then-Secretary Mark Esper in September 2019. “The brave men and women who serve in our Armed Forces choose to serve for a number of reasons and make countless sacrifices in the defense of our country,” the letter reads in part.  “The benefits provided by Tuition Assistance and the Montgomery GI Bill-Selected Reserve are valuable incentives that help the Reserve Components meet their recruitment, retention, and readiness goals by providing financial means for servicemembers to obtain a college degree with reduced out of pocket expenses."" Additional co-signers of the letter includes Senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont), John Boozman (R-Arkansas), Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), Bob Casey (D-Pennsylvania), Shelley Moore Capito (R-West Virginia), Jon Tester (D-Montana), Bernard Sanders (I-Vermont), Mike Rounds (R-South Dakota) and Steve Daines (R-Montana).  The full text of the letter can be found below: Dear Secretary Austin: Congratulations on your recent confirmation to serve as Secretary of Defense and for your continued service to our nation.  We write to urge you to take the final steps necessary to restore a 2014 Department of Defense (DOD) policy that would enable the concurrent use of federal Tuition Assistance (TA) and Montgomery GI Bill-Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR) benefits for Reserve Component (RC) servicemembers.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. As you may be aware, in July of 2014, DOD officials interpreted DOD Instruction (DODI) 1322.25 so that RC servicemembers receiving DoD-funded tuition assistance would no longer be allowed to concurrently receive MGIB-SR benefits for the same course.  Conversely, their counterparts who qualify for the Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty (MGIB-AD) are, by statute, able to use both benefits concurrently.  We have previously argued that the DOD has the authority to authorize the concurrent use of TA and MGIB-SR benefits based on current guidance in DODI 1322.17 which allows RC servicemembers to use both benefits concurrently as long as they are half-time or more enrolled.  According to Title 10 USC, Section 16131, the MGIB-SR is an education allowance that can be used to pay tuition and fees, as well as the numerous other costs of college attendance including books, supplies, equipment, transportation, and housing. That is why we were pleased to be made aware that in August of 2020, the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) indicated that it would work with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to restore the concurrent use of TA and MGIB-SR benefits for members of the National Guard and the Reserves by clarifying the use of both benefits with the VA.  While this news was positive, we understand that further actions must still be taken by OSD in order to restore concurrent use of these benefits.  In particular, we are told that OSD is required to send a signed policy advisory memo to the VA informing them of the change in policy.  The brave men and women who serve in our Armed Forces choose to serve for a number of reasons and make countless sacrifices in the defense of our country.  The benefits provided by TA and the MGIB-SR are valuable incentives that help the RCs meet their recruitment, retention, and readiness goals by providing financial means for servicemembers to obtain a college degree with reduced out of pocket expenses. There is no question that the last year has especially demonstrated how important our Reserve Component is not just to our states, but to our country.  We urge you to take the final necessary steps to reinstate the concurrent use of TA and MGIB-SR in accordance with DODI 1322.17 so that we can uphold the promises made to our RC servicemembers and ensure the readiness of our all-volunteer force.  Thank you for your prompt consideration of this matter, and for your commitment to our servicemembers and their families. GI Bill® is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

Since then, Crapo, Wyden, Risch and Merkley have worked to give SRS a more permanent role in assisting rural counties with large tracts of federal lands.  Since enacted in 2000, SRS has provided a total of $7 billion in payments to more than 700 counties and 4,400 school districts in more than 40 states to fund schools and essential services like roads and public safety.  The Senators’ Forest Management for Rural Stability Act ends uncertainty for the program and provides rural counties financial security. More information on the legislation can be found here. ###"

Crapo, Sen. Risch, Rep. Simpson and Rep. Fulcher, who continue to work to keep this vital program.“This year’s payments are a welcome relief to rural counties that rely on SRS payments each year, but a permanent solution is needed,” said Senator Crapo.  “Adequate funding for schools, roads and infrastructure repair will only be guaranteed once we can reach agreement on a self-contained funding mechanism outside the yearly votes in Congress, and we are working toward the goal of a permanent endowment.”“The SRS program is critical for Idaho’s rural communities,” said Senator Risch.  “Until the federal government returns to active management of our national forests, these funds will ensure timber counties can provide essential services, like education and road maintenance, until a long-term solution is reached.”“I have long advocated and secured critical funding for SRS and PILT,” said Representative Simpson.  “SRS is critical for timber counties that need the revenue that pay for critical education needs in our rural counties.  I am pleased to see this funding I voted for being distributed to counties at a time that they need it more than ever.”  “The federal government controls 63% of Idaho’s natural resources, preventing these areas from generating revenue and taxes to support our rural schools and infrastructure,” said Representative Fulcher.  “Until this land can be utilized, these payments are vital to the success of our rural communities, and I am pleased to see that they will be delivered.” “The Secure Rural Schools program is one of many ways the Forest Service supports rural communities as a good neighbor,"" said Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen.  ""This support is part of USDA's ongoing commitment to work hand-in-hand with community leaders and to provide vital economic relief to local communities.""A list of payments by county can be found HERE.  For more information about the administration of public funds by the State Treasurer’s Office (STO), visit the STO’s website HERE. ###"
