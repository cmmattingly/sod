https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2022/9/tillis-hassan-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-ensure-that-servicemembers-do-not-lose-out-on-education-benefits,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH), members of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, introduced bipartisan legislation to ensure that servicemembers are protected financially and won’t fail their classes if they need to withdraw from school because they are called up for duty.“When a student reports to active duty, inactive duty training, or state active duty, they and their spouses should not be penalized with failing grades or sacrifice of education benefits,” said Senator Tillis. “I am proud to introduce this legislation to support our servicemembers and their families to ensure they receive the educational benefits they have earned.”“When a service member is suddenly called up for duty, they should not have to fear losing any VA tuition assistance or receiving failing grades because of their service-related withdrawal,” said Senator Hassan. “Our service members make enormous sacrifices to protect our freedom, and we must ensure that they receive the benefits that they have more than earned, including accessing higher education. I am glad to work across the aisle on this bill with Senator Tillis, and I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill.” The Protections for Student Veterans Act would allow student servicemembers and their spouses, who use VA education benefits and are in good standing, to withdraw or take a leave of absence from their education when a service member reports to active duty, inactive duty training, or state active duty. Schools would be barred from assigning failing grades to students who either withdraw or take a leave of absence. This bill will ensure that covered individuals can recoup lost VA education benefits caused by their orders. Students who take a leave of absence would be assigned a grade of incomplete, and, when possible, schools would allow the student to complete their course credits after completing their term of service.Read the bill text here.###"
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2022/9/tillis-announces-25-million-reconnect-grant-for-robeson-and-scotland-counties,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) announced the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development has awarded Robeson County and Scotland County a $25 million grant to improve broadband and comes from the bipartisan infrastructure package which Senator Tillis helped negotiate and pass into law. The grant will be used to help the Atlantic Telephone Membership Corporation deploy a fiber-to-the-home network. This network will connect 13,972 people, 198 businesses, 166 farms and 18 public schools to high-speed internet.   Atlantic Telephone Membership Corporation will make high-speed internet affordable by implementing the FOCUS Broadband's Faster Internet for Robeson and Scotland Today (FIRST) program and offering four internet packages. This project will serve the Lumbee state designated tribal statistical area and the socially vulnerable communities of both Scotland and Robeson counties.“This grant is a big deal for businesses, farmers, and schools in both Robeson and Scotland County and will help connect more than 13,000 people,” said Senator Tillis. “Reliable broadband is crucial to perform the functions of everyday life and I was proud to help negotiate and support the bipartisan infrastructure law to bring this investment to our great state.”###"
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2022/9/tillis-demands-answers-on-sanctuary-city-destinations-for-illegal-immigrants,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) led a letter to Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, also signed by Senators Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Steve Daines (R-MT), Mike Braun (R-IN), and Ted Cruz (R-TX), requesting information on which cities illegal immigrants are listing as their “current address” when they are issued an Notice To Appear (NTA).“Sanctuary city policies are dangerous and threaten public safety,” the senators wrote. “Sanctuary cities and jurisdictions simply release dangerous, criminal aliens instead of complying with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests. These policies prevent law enforcement officials from cooperating with federal immigration officials and allow dangerous, violent criminal aliens to walk free without fear of deportation.”The senators continued, “This issue is as important as ever given the ongoing surge of illegal immigrants arriving at our southern border. Since President Biden took office, CBP has had nearly 3.5 million encounters with illegal immigrants crossing our southern border. Meanwhile, U.S. Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz recently announced that agents caught ten illegal immigrant sex offenders, four gang members, and a murderer in just three days. In those same three days, agents seized one hundred fentanyl pills and seventy-one pounds of methamphetamine.”“We are deeply concerned that sanctuary jurisdictions are serving as a pull factor for illegal immigrants and for criminal aliens. This failure to comply with federal law creates an incentive for illegal immigrants to travel to the United States and avoid accountability by moving to sanctuary jurisdictions,” the senators concluded.Read the full letter here. ### "
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2022/9/tillis-colleagues-call-out-credit-card-ceos-for-infringing-on-americans-second-amendment-rights,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – This week, U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) and 11 of his Senate Republican colleagues sent a letter to the CEOs of Visa, Mastercard, and American Express condemning their removal of gun store transactions from the “general merchandise” merchant category code (MCC) and instead creating a wholly new and separate MCC for gun retailers. The CEOs’ decision came at the recommendation of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which has no legally-binding authority over the affairs of American businesses. The Senators expressed deep concern that these credit card companies’ new policy would infringe upon the Second Amendment Rights of law-abiding American citizens in their letter. “This decision, which is already being hailed by radical anti-gun activists, is the first step towards backdoor gun control on law-abiding Americans… Creating a new merchant code for gun transactions is a choice being made by each of your companies,” the senators wrote. “You are choosing the side of gun control advocates over the privacy and Second Amendment rights of millions of law-abiding Americans… Your companies are the facilitators of the vast majority of daily financial transactions in America, and that gives you incredible influence over everyday commerce, and thus every American’s very way of life. If you are intent on abusing that influence you will leave Congress no choice but to intercede on behalf of our constituents and all of the law abiding Americans who will not stand by as large banks and the payment networks that serve them do an end run around their constitutional Second Amendment rights to keep and bear arms…” The Senators concluded their letter by requesting answers from the CEOs related to what factors influenced each company to settled on this new policy, how the recategorization of gun sales backs up claims that the action would reduce gun violence, and if customers would be able to continue to use these companies’ services without discrimination, among other issues. Read the full letter HERE. Background:Recently, the International Organization for Standardization, which is based in Switzerland, approved a new merchant category code that is exclusive to gun retailers. Although Visa, Mastercard, and American Express are under no legal obligation to conform to ISO policies, all three companies adopted the new merchant category code for gun purchases with their credit cards. Previously, gun purchases with these credit cards would have fallen into the “general merchandise” merchant category code.###"
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2022/9/tillis-seeks-answers-on-unprecedented-drug-price-control-scheme-that-threatens-innovation-future-drug-costs,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Senate Republicans expressed concerns with the establishment of a permanent government drug price-setting program, funded by billions of taxpayer dollars in the partisan Inflation Reduction Act, and raised questions regarding federal health agencies’ plans for program implementation. In a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, the Senators highlight the outsized risks the impending government pricing setting scheme poses for patients, health care providers, small businesses, manufacturers and the American economy as a whole, and urge the officials to weigh impacts on health care access, research and development (R&D), innovation, and domestic manufacturing. The senators wrote, “As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has confirmed, the government price controls codified under the recently enacted reconciliation legislation have the potential to increase launch prices for new medications, as well as to trigger fewer new drug approvals in the coming years.” “Other independent analyses have projected even more catastrophic consequences, from hundreds of thousands of domestic job losses to hundreds of billions in forgone R&D dollars,” the senators continued. “The innovation ecosystem that has made the United States the world’s unquestioned life sciences leader, bolstered by thousands of startups and small businesses, may wither under this partisan legislation, particularly in the absence of careful, deliberative implementation and assertive, consumer-oriented oversight.”Read the full letter here.###"
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2022/9/tillis-colleagues-introduce-reauthorization-of-project-safe-neighborhoods-program-to-reduce-violent-crime,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – This week, U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), John Cornyn (R-TX), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Gary Peters (D-MI), and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) introduced the Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act of 2022 to reauthorize a nationwide law enforcement program focusing on the reduction of violent crime.“We are seeing an increase in crime across our country, and Congress needs to act,” said Senator Tillis. “This legislation provides much-needed support to local law enforcement to combat crime and map overdose patterns in our communities. I am proud to work on this commonsense legislation to create safer neighborhoods for future generations.”Background:Project Safe Neighborhoods is a nationwide partnership between federal, state, and local law enforcement and prosecutors that uses evidence-based and data-driven approaches to reduce violent crime. Under Project Safe Neighborhoods, multiple law enforcement agencies cooperate and focus their enforcement efforts on organized criminal networks and repeat offenders that are driving the crime rates in a particular region. Project Safe Neighborhoods also works to build trust and partnerships between law enforcement and the communities they serve through coordinated outreach, public awareness, innovative tactics, and collaborative interventions. Since its inception in 2001, Project Safe Neighborhoods has been successfully deployed by both Democratic and Republican administrations to reduce violent crime in large cities and smaller communities across the country. The 2018 authorization of the program passed the Senate unanimously. Specifically, the Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act of 2022:The following organizations support Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act of 2022: Fraternal Order of Police, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, Sergeants Benevolent Association, National Association of Police Organizations, Major County Sheriffs of America, National District Attorneys Association, Major Cities Chiefs Association, Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies, and National Narcotic Officers’ Associations’ Coalition. ### "
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2022/9/tillis-colleagues-introduce-law-enforcement-immersive-scenario-based-training-bill,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – This week, U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Representatives Tim Ryan (D-OH-13) and Anthony Gonzalez (R-OH-16) introduced the bipartisan, bicameral LawEnforcement Scenario-Based Training for Safety and De-Escalation Act of 2022. This legislation would require the U.S. Department of Justice, through the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), to create immersive, real-life, scenario-based training curriculum to address key issues raised by law enforcement officers and the communities they serve. The curriculum would focus on improving community-police relations; officer safety and resilience; situational awareness; physical and emotional responses to stress; critical decision-making and problem-solving; de-escalation and use of force; and crisis intervention. The bill would also create a grant program to support public and private entities that train law enforcement officers using similar immersive curriculum. All law enforcement officers—in departments large and small, rural and urban—should have access to the state-of-the-art, scenario-based training that saves lives and rebuilds trust. This bill is an important step toward finding common ground between law enforcement and the communities they serve. “Law enforcement officers risk their lives every single day to keep ourcommunities safe, and they deserve training and resources that help them handle the most difficult situations,” said Senator Tillis. “This bipartisan legislation will help law enforcement receive training to de-escalate a host of crises, including those involving people with mental health or drug dependency issues. Improved training will result in improved safety for both law enforcement officers and the people they regularly interact with.” The NAACP, Fraternal Order of Police, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the National Tactical Officers Association, and the International Union of Police Associations have endorsed the legislation.###"
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2022/9/tillis-co-introduces-the-national-nursing-workforce-center-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – This week, U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and Congresswomen Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) and Young Kim (R-CA) introduced the bipartisan and bicameral National Nursing Workforce Center Act that would establish a 3-year pilot program through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to support state-based nursing workforce centers. The legislation would also broaden HRSA’s authority to establish Health Workforce Research Centers on any program under the Public Health Service Act and give HRSA clear authority to establish a nursing focused research and technical assistance center under the Health Workforce Research Center Program.“Nurses play a crucial role in providing accessible, high-quality care to Americans. Resolving existing nursing workforce challenges, which have been compounded by the pandemic, the increased demand for health care services, and the aging workforce, requires innovative approaches that support and strengthen every aspect of the nursing workforce pipeline,” said Senator Tillis. “I’m proud to co-introduce the bipartisan National Nursing Workforce Center Act that will enhance collaboration and coordination, enabling state and local experts to identify and address unique challenges to increase the resiliency of the nursing workforce.” “As the husband of a nurse, I know just how important nurses are to patients, and how their support and advocacy can make a world of difference at some of the most difficult and joyous moments of people's lives,” said Senator Merkley. “This bill will help establish and support local nursing initiatives and workforce centers across the country—like the one we already have here in Oregon—to apply a local approach to the current nursing workforce crisis. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get this bipartisan bill passed.”“The National Forum of State Nursing Workforce Centers is excited about the introduction of the National Nursing Workforce Center Act. This will provide critical funding to support and solidify the foundation of existing nursing workforce centers while providing funding for states without a center to create one. This act would provide technical assistance to smaller and new nursing workforce centers and build a strong network of experts on state-level nursing workforce issues and solutions.  Nursing workforce centers serve as hubs to advance nursing education, practice, leadership, and workforce development at state and local levels using data-driven approaches.” – Lanelle Weems, President, National Forum of State Nursing Workforce CentersThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated a national shortage of registered nurses, making it critical that policymakers invest in all segments of the nursing workforce: from education and training to retention and leadership development. An important component of this is also having complete, national, standardized data to understand where public policy can help alleviate these shortages. An estimated 500,000 nurses plan to leave the bedside by the end of 2022—creating a shortage of 1.1 million nurses—just as the population of older people, who may require more medical services for complex medical conditions, begins to increase dramatically. The National Nursing Workforce Center Act would help address the shortage by:A one-pager of the bill can be found here. ### "

This legislation will help expedite future infrastructure projects funded by the bipartisan infrastructure bill supported by Senator Tillis.“Permitting reform is crucial as we move towards future infrastructure improvements across our country and North Carolina,” said Senator Tillis. “I was proud to support the bipartisan infrastructure package to improve North Carolina’s roads, highways, and bridges, as well as North Carolina’s water, however a fast and efficient permitting process is key to ensure these projects happen in a timely manner.

DoD contracting processes include mandatory contract review periods and lengthy competitive open-bid windows that have slowed down efforts to rebuild stores of defense articles. This legislation would amend the DoD’s emergency acquisition authorities to allow them to use non-competitive procedures to quickly award a contract in order to replenish defense article stocks sent to an ally or partner after an attack by a foreign adversary of the U.S.While the DoD can use expedited procedures to speed up defense procurement in certain situations, backfilling depleted stockpiles is not one of them. This legislation lays out an exemption to permit the DoD to expedite the acquisitions process and decrease the time it takes to send aid in case of such an attack, subject to the following conditions: ###"

""The partnership between USMS and ICE is critical to ensure that dangerous, criminal aliens are detained and deported. Preventing USMS from communicating with ICE would be a dereliction of federal immigration enforcement, and we strongly discourage you from proceeding with this proposed policy.""The senators continued, ""The Biden Administration’s failed immigration policies continue to fuel a crisis on our southern border. Since President Biden took office, CBP has had 3 million encounters with illegal immigrants at our southern border. Further, there continues to be a growing number of‘gotaways’ entering the country due to the chaos at the border. Recent reports indicate over 500,000 illegal immigrants evaded capture so far in fiscal year 2022 (FY22).

We are writing to request information detailing what the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) is doing to stop drug networks and cartels from overflowing our communities with illicit narcotics.” “Our nation is facing an unprecedented opioid crisis that is devasting our communities and impacting families from all demographics,” the senators continued. “On February 9, 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the United States had over 100,000 fentanyl related deaths in a 12-month period. The overdoses are fueled from multiple fronts including the porous southern border, drug networks using social media to sell illicit narcotics, and China’s supply of the bulk of the precursor chemicals to drug cartels for fentanyl production.”The senators concluded, “Evidence of the smuggling of illicit narcotics by drug trafficking organizations can be seen across the country. In North Carolina, the Guilford County Sheriff’s Office and Rockingham County Sheriff’s Investigators conducted a joint operation which led to the seizure of enough fentanyl to kill around 19,000 people. On July 18, 2022, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) arrested a drug smuggler near Campos, California who was in possession of approximately 250lbs of fentanyl laced pills. The fentanyl laced pills had an estimated street value of $3.6 million dollars and a potency to kill over 56 million people.” Read full letter here.  ###"

The optics are especially disturbing considering that Presidents Biden and Trump are past and potentially future political opponents. The DOJ owes the American people a thorough explanation regarding their decision-making process, including the release of the warrant, the warrant application, and why they decided to execute this search when President Trump’s lawyers were already cooperating with the National Archives.

https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2022/8/tillis-and-hagerty-introduce-legislation-reinstating-services-for-victims-of-crimes-committed-by-illegal-immigrants,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Bill Hagerty (R-TN) introduced the Voice for Victims Act, legislation to restitute the VOICE Office to provide “proactive, timely, adequate, and professional services to victims of crimes committed by removable aliens” and their families. The VOICE Office will also provide quarterly reports to Congress that examine the effects of victimization of US nationals by criminal aliens. The Voice for Victims Act will also expand the functions of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman to include working with the VOICE Office to provide assistance to and accountability for victims of crimes by criminal aliens “Many dangerous illegal immigrants, including cartel members, are making their way further into our country committing heinous crimes,” said Senator Tillis. “Anyone who falls victim to a dangerous illegal immigrant deserves the proper care and attention, including bringing the illegal immigrant to account. I am proud to work with Senator Hagerty to introduce this legislation so we can give a voice to every victim.”“The Biden Administration’s disastrous open-border policies have flung the door wide open for criminals to enter our country illegally and commit crimes against innocent people,” said Senator Hagerty. “We’re seeing a national security crisis of epic proportion with over 160 different nationalities apprehended at our southern border since Joe Biden took office. Adding insult to injury, President Biden terminated the office created by President Trump to help victims of crimes by illegal aliens. This commonsense legislation will reverse President Biden’s regrettable decision and reinstate this critical assistance for victims of these reprehensible acts.” Background In 2017, President Trump established the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (“VOICE”) Office in 2017 under the Department of Homeland Security to assist victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants. This resource served victims of crimes by criminal aliens by acknowledging and supporting victims and families, promoting awareness of available services to victims, and building partnerships with community stakeholders to assist victims. Before President Trump established the VOICE Office, victims of crimes by criminal aliens did not have a dedicated government resource to provide information about their cases and access to assistance. In 2021, President Biden terminated the VOICE Office and replaced it with a watered-down phone line to provide resources to victims of crimes committed by anyone rather than criminal aliens. This sends a clear message to victims of crimes by criminal aliens that their voices do not matter to the Biden Administration. Due to President Biden’s failed immigration policies, Customs and Border Protection has had over 3 million encounters with illegal immigrants since President Biden took office. The chaos created by this crisis has allowed criminal aliens to cross the border undetected, and to conduct human smuggling and drug trafficking operations. For example, in FY22, CBP apprehended over 800 criminal aliens with convictions for domestic violence, over 1,100 for DUI convictions, and nearly 250 for sex crimes. The Biden Administration’s catch and release policies during a surge in illegal immigration is a recipe for crimes by criminal aliens, and it is more important than ever that victims of crimes by criminal aliens are able to access dedicated resources.  ###"

The Strong Communities Act, Invest to Protect Act of 2022, and the Law Enforcement De-Escalation Training Act passed by unanimous consent. All three bills now head to the House for a vote.“Our brave law enforcement officers deserve the best tools, equipment, and training to do their jobs effectively,” said Senator Tillis. “I am proud to support these bipartisan bills to ensure our police officers receive the support they deserve and I applaud the Senate for passing the legislation to assist officers across the country.

https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2022/5/tillis-legislation-authorizing-ukraine-lend-lease-agreement-signed-into-law,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, President Biden signed into law bipartisan legislation co-introduced by U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) that will authorize the President to enter into lend-lease agreements with Ukraine to provide additional categories of military equipment to protect civilians.“As Russia continues its illegal attack on Ukraine, resulting in the death of thousands of civilians, we must do everything we can to support the Ukrainian military and help Ukrainian society fight back,” said Senator Tillis. “Authorization of a Lend-Lease agreement will allow the United States to provide additional equipment and resources to defend innocent civilians and show Putin the United States will not back down from this unprovoked invasion.” Background:As part of his Arms Export Control Act and Foreign Assistance Act authorities, the President can currently lend and lease defense articles to U.S. partners and allies when it is in the United States’ national security interest. However, bureaucratic barriers and other limitations make these authorities impractical for the current crisis facing Ukraine. This enhanced lend-lease authority will be specific to Ukraine to help remove obstacles to lending arms to Ukraine. It will not create a new program but will streamline the President’s current authority to lend the defense articles necessary to defend civilian populations in Ukraine.

https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2022/5/tillis-legislation-to-help-fight-cybercrime-signed-into-law,"WASHINGTON, D.C.  – This week, bipartisan, bicameral legislation introduced by U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC), Co-Chair of the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, Brian Schatz (D-HI), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) to fight cybercrime and help keep Americans safe from online scams was signed into law. The bipartisan, bicameral Better Cybercrime Metrics Act will improve data collection on cybercrimes, giving law enforcement and policy makers more tools to understand the size and scope of cybercrime in the United States.“Cybercrime is a major threat to our national security and has steadily increased in recent years, putting private information and energy dependability at risk,” said Senator Tillis. “The time has come for Congress to act on these growing threats by giving law enforcement and policymakers the tools needed to improve data collection and respond to cyber-attacks. I am proud to have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get this necessary and timely legislation signed into law.”Each year, hundreds of thousands of Americans are targets of cybercrime incidents that cost billions of dollars. Whether done through online scams and fraud, corporate data breaches, or ransomware attacks, the cost of cybercrime has been increasing annually, from $3.5 billion in 2019 to $4.2 billion in 2020, and impacts an estimated 300,000 to 700,000 cybercrime victims each year.Unfortunately, these numbers are likely low, as there are no comprehensive metrics on the scale and impact of cybercrime in the United States, or on law enforcement efforts against them. Only 10 to 12 percent of all estimated cybercrime victims report cybercrime incidents in the United States, while other estimates have put that number much higher.The Better Cybercrime Metrics Act will give law enforcement a clearer picture of online crimes in the United States by requiring the FBI to integrate cybercrime incidents into its current reporting streams to better understand all the types of crime that Americans face. As cybercriminals continue to target vulnerable populations, this data will help lawmakers make an informed case for policy changes to curtail the cybercrime wave, keep Americans safe, and bring these criminals to justice.The Better Cybercrime Metrics Act will:The full text of the bill can be found here. ### "
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2022/5/tillis-moran-lead-colleagues-in-questioning-dhs-secretary-on-misuse-of-taxpayer-dollars,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Jerry Moran (R-KS) led a letter questioning Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas regarding an Office of Inspector General (OIG) report that found U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) wasted taxpayer dollars on hotel rooms for illegal immigrants that were never used.Senators Tillis and Moran were joined by Senators Roger Wicker (R-MS), Rick Scott (R-FL), John Boozman (R-AR), Joni Ernst (R-IA), and Ted Cruz (R-TX). The OIG report found that ICE did not go through the proper process to secure a contract for housing, and with the contract ICE secured, hundreds of beds were left empty totaling more nearly $17 million of wasted spending. During the same six month period in which taxpayer dollars were being wasted, the three closest Family Residential Centers (FRC) had an average capacity of less than 25 percent. One FRC went entirely unoccupied for four of those six months.  “The manner in which DHS executed the contract to house migrant families raises serious questions about the department’s initial response to the crisis and its ability to respond to the continuous and increasing illegal migration,” the senators wrote. “According to the OIG report, ICE did not proactively request proposals to assist in fulfilling its mission to house migrant families.”“Ensuring adequate housing for families as they work their way through the immigration system is a vital part of the mission of ICE,” the senators continued. “However, wasteful spending as outlined by the recent OIG report works to the disadvantage of all involved. All contracts entered into by a federal agency, including DHS, should be done in an appropriate manner that provides the most efficient and cost-effective outcome.”The full letter can be found HERE. ###  "
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2022/5/tillis-introduces-resolution-to-repeal-biden-administration-policy-upending-asylum-process,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) along with 29 Senators and other House Republicans introduced a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to dissolve a proposed Biden Administration rule that would illegally upend the process by which the U.S. government grants asylum claims.“With the crisis at the border causing an ongoing surge in human trafficking and the smuggling of illegal drugs, we cannot suddenly upend the necessary detention process set by Congress,” said Senator Tillis. “We have to have order at our border and upending the asylum process would only encourage more illegal immigration, making our nation less safe. I am proud to work with my colleagues to repeal this reckless and irresponsible decision by the Biden Administration.”                          The rule, “Procedures for Credible Fear Screening and Consideration of Asylum, Withholding of Removal, and CAT Protection Claims by Asylum Officers,” would exacerbate the crisis at the southwest border and encourage fraudulent asylum claims by allowing illegal border crossers who claim asylum to have their asylum application approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officials, not immigration judges, and to not be detained while their application is pending.   On October 19, 2021, Senator Tillis joined 23 Senate Republicans and 66 House Republicans to submit public comment to the Federal Register in opposition to the rule.  The comment noted: “The proposed rule represents a blatant violation of the laws passed by Congress. It ignores the mandatory detention requirements of aliens claiming asylum through mass parole, violates the principles of separation of powers, and inappropriately shifts the roles of USCIS and Executive Office of Immigration Review.” The Congressional Review Act (CRA) can be used by Congress to overturn certain federal agency regulations and actions through a joint resolution of disapproval. If a CRA joint resolution of disapproval is approved by both houses of Congress and signed by the President, or if Congress successfully overrides a presidential veto, the rule at issue is invalidated.The full text of the resolution can be found here.###"

Earlier this year, Senator Tillis sent a letterbefore the launch of the investigation to express concern over the solar tariff petition filed with the Department of Commerce. This investigation could expand harmful, job-killing tariffs on solar imports, raising costs on consumers, and has already caused widespread cancellations and delays in the U.S. solar industry. According to a new report issued by the Solar Energy Industries Association, 70 percent of U.S. companies say at least half of their solar workforce is at risk as a result of this investigation. “Initiation of this investigation is already causing massive disruption in the solar industry, and it will severely harm American solar businesses and workers and increase costs for American families as long as it continues,” wrote the senators. “We strongly urge your administration to swiftly review the case and make an expedited preliminary determination. Such a determination should carefully consider the significant policy ramifications and reject the petitioner’s request for retroactivity.” “Already, as a result of Commerce’s decision to initiate this investigation, industry surveys indicate that 83% of U.S. solar companies report being notified of canceled or delayed panel supply. Without a reliable and cost-effective source of panels, existing and proposed solar projects could come to a halt,” the senators’ continued. “Left unaddressed, cutting off this supply of panels and cells also could cause the loss of more than 100,000 American jobs, including approximately 18,000 manufacturing jobs.”The full text of the letter can be found here.   ###"

This is vital to ensure America’s continued dominance in all areas of innovation, especially emerging technologies, through continued enforcement of strong intellectual property rights.“The Chinese Communist Party poses a serious threat to our national security and intellectual property, and this is not the time to let our guard down,” said Senator Tillis. “We must do everything in our power to counter the Chinese Communist Party’s ultimate goal of overtaking the United States as the world’s top superpower.

The worst inflation in more than 40 years has been fueled by Congressional Democrats and the Biden-Harris administration recklessly spending and wasting trillions over the last 15 months.

These two bills build on efforts led by Senator Tillis to stop the dangerous and reckless decision to rescind the Title 42 Order issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which permits the immediate expulsion of illegal immigrants who attempt to cross the southern border.Specifically, Tillis co-introduced bipartisan legislation that would require all COVID-19 related national states of emergency to be lifted before Title 42 is officially terminated. He also co-sponsored a bill to extend Title 42 authority until February 2025. “The Biden Administration’s failed policies have caused illegal immigration to reach historic and unsustainable levels that have completely overwhelmed the brave men and women tasked with protecting our southern border,” said Senator Tillis. “Title 42 authority has been crucial for Border Patrol as they work to maintain the flow of illegal immigrants, and the decision by President Biden to rescind it will lead to a massive surge of illegal immigrants coming across our southern border. This dire humanitarian crisis cannot continue, and I am proud to co-introduce these bills that would stop this dangerous and reckless decision.”Background:This decision to rescind the Title 42 Order is being made amidst alarming reportsthat the Administration is preparing for a surge of 170,000 illegal immigrantswho will attempt to enter the United States if the Biden Administration rescinds Title 42. Other reports state that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimates up to 60,000 illegal immigrants are already waiting at the border in anticipation of this policy being rescinded.There are additional reports that DHS and the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) are preparing for up to 18,000 illegal immigrants to arrive each day at our southern border. This would mean over 500,000 illegal immigrants arriving per month at our border. One report even suggests that CBP could be planning to limit vetting of migrants in order to expedite processing.This massive surge of illegal immigrants would be on top of a historic influx of illegal immigrants during the Biden Administration. Since President Biden took office, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has encountered over 2.27 million illegal immigrants at the southern border. In February 2022 alone, CBP had 169,973 encounters compared to 101,099 in February 2021 – a 68% increase in encounters with illegal immigrants. And the February 2021 figures were already the highest since Fiscal Year 2006. ###"

https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2022/4/tillis-co-introduces-bipartisan-bill-to-improve-reporting-of-attacks-on-law-enforcement,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, recently co-introduced bipartisan legislation to gather greater information on attacks targeting law enforcement. The Improving Law Enforcement Officer Safety and Wellness Through Data Actbuilds on existing reporting requirements and fills gaps highlighted by law enforcement groups to increase our understanding of the circumstances precipitating and involving ambush-style attacks against law enforcement.   “Attacks on our law enforcement officers are abhorrent and we must get a clear picture on when they occur,” said Senator Tillis. “I’m proud to co-introduce this bipartisan legislation so we can improve reporting and continue supporting the men and women in blue to prevent these disgusting acts.”Police officers feloniously killed in the line of duty spiked 58.7 percent in 2021 over the previous year, marking the deadliest year for law enforcement killings since 1995, with the exception of officers lost during the September 11, 2001, attacks. Nearly 44 percent of police officer killings in 2021 were caused by unprovoked attacks or ambushes on officers. While the government collects basic information on these attacks, such as when the attack occurred and what types of weapons were used, more information is needed to help law enforcement officers prepare for, identify and prevent future anti-police activity. The Improving Law Enforcement Officer Safety and Wellness Through Data Act increases the categories of information that can be voluntarily reported regarding anti-police attacks, including the intention and coordination of perpetrators.

https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2022/3/tillis-co-introduces-bill-to-protect-children-toughen-sentences-for-child-pornography-offenders,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, recently co-introduced legislation that would protect children from sexual exploitation by enhancing the penalties for possessing child pornography and by preventing judges from sentencing offenders below federal guidelines.The epidemic of child pornography in the United States is growing exponentially. Just over a decade ago, the number of images of child sexual abuse material online was less than 1 million. That number grew to 45 million in 2018, and to 85 million in 2021. “There is bipartisan consensus that Congress must act to ensure we impose strong penalties on people in possession of child pornography,” said Senator Tillis. “The PROTECT Act will protect our children and ensure sexual predators receive the appropriate sentence for receiving or possessing child pornography.”By federal statute, judges are required to sentence criminals within ranges set by the federal “Sentencing Guidelines,” subject to some exceptions. In 2003, Congress passed the original PROTECT Act to curtail the exceptions—and enhance the penalties—in child pornography cases. In 2005, the Supreme Court gutted in a controversial 5-4 decision in United States v. Booker. Since then, some federal judges have used their discretion to impose lenient sentences on child porn offenders.The PROTECT Act of 2022 would: View legislative text for the PROTECT Act of 2022 here.###"
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2022/1/tillis-introduces-bipartisan-bill-to-strengthen-community-health-workforce,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - As communities across the nation tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tina Smith (D-MN) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) introduced bipartisan legislation to strengthen the workforce of community health workers and address health disparities among underserved communities. Studies have demonstrated that community health workers can identify and address the specific health needs of their communities, promote healthy behavior and reduce hospitalization. The Building a Sustainable Workforce for Healthy Communities Act would reauthorize a competitive grant program to support state and local governments, tribal organizations and community-based organizations in expanding community health worker programs.“With the current labor shortages facing our communities, we must continue to invest in the future of our health care workforce,” said Senator Tillis. “Our communities need more support, proper resources, and access to necessary health care. I am proud to introduce this commonsense legislation that will do just that, ensuring we are recruiting, training, and retaining qualified frontline health care professionals.”Grant funding would be used to recruit and train community health workers who understand the needs of the community and support outreach to underserved communities and those requiring additional assistance during a public health emergency. These health care workers would promote positive health behaviors and improve access to services supporting physical and mental health, such as childcare, housing, education, nutrition and employment. Read more about the Building a Sustainable Workforce for Healthy Communities Act here. ###"

https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2022/1/tillis-to-support-kathi-vidal-s-nomination-for-director-of-the-u-s-patent-and-trademark-office,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) announced he will support the nomination of Kathi Vidal to be Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property.“It’s a well-known fact that I strongly support the reforms taken by former Director Andrei Iancu to make the Patent Trial and Appeal Board a more fair and equitable forum for patent owners. Before Director Iancu’s reforms, the PTAB was rightly known as a place where big companies could game the system, engage in strategic and efficient infringement, and destroy the patent rights of small businesses and independent inventors. Thanks to Director Iancu’s leadership, the PTAB now protects small businesses and has finally achieved the balance Congress intended when we passed the America Invents Act.“I’ve been clear from the beginning that any nominee for USPTO Director must commit to continuing and building upon these reforms to receive my vote. During Kathi Vidal’s confirmation hearing and in questions for the record, I asked tough questions on her views regarding these reforms and sought a simple yes or no commitment on if she would continue them. After reviewing her answers and talking with her one-on-one, I’m happy to say I’ve received such a commitment. “Our conversations have convinced me that Ms. Vidal will be the exact type of visionary leader we need to succeed Andrei Iancu and will work tirelessly to ensure all inventors get a fair shake before the USPTO. She understands we need to reform our nation’s patent eligibility laws to provide greater clarity, that inventors of all sizes depend on a fair and equitable IP system, and that strong intellectual property rights are the foundation of our economy. She knows that prior to Director Iancu’s reform, PTAB wasn’t the balanced forum Congress intended. She realizes that, absent the continuation of these reforms, bad actors like OpenSky Industries will use the PTAB as a form of strategic litigation to attack competitors. And, most importantly, she’s willing to listen to all stakeholders, big and small, and make decisions based on what is best for everyone and the patent system as a whole. “In addition to being a well-respected patent attorney, she possesses the management experience necessary to ensure the agency continues to provide high-quality services to all—whether assisting first-time patent and trademark applicants, providing policy advice to the Administration, or engaging with intellectual property offices around the world. She understands that we cannot take the United States’ leadership in innovation for granted and that a robust intellectual property system is essential for America’s future. “For all these reasons, that’s why I will proudly be voting to confirm Kathi Vidal as USPTO Director. I look forward to working with my colleagues and Leaders McConnell and Schumer to secure her confirmation.”###"

For example, in October 2020 soldiers of the 1st Special Forces Command soldiers, part of the Command’s 528th Special Operations Sustainment Brigade, were temporarily moved into alternate housing following an air quality test that revealed extensive mold damage in their barracks. Recently, a Fort Bragg soldier contacted our office with photo evidence of mold in his barracks that Bragg’s Department of Public Works (DPW) has stated they will not address.”“Home to the 82nd Airborne and nearly 550,000 active duty servicemembers, Fort Bragg is the largest U.S Army installation by population. As the Army continues to undergo modernization and readiness enhancement efforts to prepare for Strategic Competition with near-peer competitors, Fort Bragg will remain singularly important as the “tip of the spear” for the Department of Defense. Therefore, I urge the Department of the Army to continue the ongoing effort to recapitalize barracks across the Army enterprise and address the conditions of the barracks immediately. Allowing soldiers to live in moldy and unsafe housing is a danger to country,” Senator Tillis continued.Read the full letter here. ###"

Two of the reports raised issues with cost estimates and reporting. The VA Electronic Health Record Transparency Act would hold the VA accountable and increase transparency by requiring the VA Secretary to submit periodic reports to Congress regarding the costs, performance metrics and outcomes for EHRM.“Our veterans have sacrificed so much to protect our country, and it’s time we take care of them by increasing transparency around their electronic health records,” said Senator Tillis. “I will always work to make sure our veterans have the resources and support they need and I am proud to work with my colleagues to hold the VA accountable when it comes to improving health records so every veteran can receive the proper medical care they need and deserve.”  ###"

I will continue to monitor the DOJ as they move to litigate these cases individually and push back against any outcome that will result in millions of dollars being handed out to illegal immigrants.""Earlier this month, Senator Tillis introduced legislation to prevent payments for legal settlements for illegal immigration. Under the Protect American Taxpayer Dollars from Illegal Immigration Act, no federal funds, including money from the Judgment Fund, could be spent to enrich illegal immigrants at the expense of hardworking American taxpayers. This was in response to President Biden’s DOJ discussing giving out payments of $450,000 per person to illegal immigrants who broke our laws, came here illegally, and put their children’s lives at risk.###"

The senators previously requested that Durbin allow virtual or phone participation in that hearing, but the chairman denied this request. “Beginning in the summer of 2020, the country has experienced a sustained and unprecedented 30% increase in murders. This spike has correlated with a move toward depolicing, after the eruption of over 500 riots nationally,” the senators wrote.“In June of 2021, the Biden Administration unveiled its own strategy to reduce violent crime. We were troubled to see how much of the President’s strategy focuses on lawful gun acquisition and lawful gun owners. For example, one of the tenets of the President’s plan is finding ways to sue legal gun manufacturers, an initiative that would do much to interfere with Americans’ access to guns but nothing to target murders or reduce crime. . . . Legally owned firearms play an important role in allowing Americans to protect themselves during a violent crime surge. A 2013 CDC-commissioned study found that as many as millions of people a year defend themselves with a firearm,” they continued.“We therefore request that you hold a full committee hearing in Washington, D.C. on the spike in murders and the challenges that law enforcement is facing. Ineffective bail policies, cumbersome restraints on police officers, and the impact of the ‘progressive prosecutor’ movement are exacerbating this surge. While it would have been helpful to explore the effects of these factors on crime in Chicago, given the many other cities that are impacted by the crime surge, we believe it would be even more useful if we could explore these problems on a national scale with the full committee,”concluded the senators.Read the letter here.  ###"

Faith-based adoption and foster care providers have a history of connecting children with loving homes, and this legislation ensures those providers can continue their child welfare services free of discrimination.”“Far too many children are waiting, right now, either for adoption or foster families,” said Russell Moore, President of the Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission. “Our government must not stand in the way of those seeking to care for them. It is difficult to imagine a more important goal for child welfare policy than the goal of seeing vulnerable children who need a loving home be united with families committed to caring for them. Protecting the rights of faith-based adoption and foster care agencies only ensures that more children will have access to the love and support they so desperately need. This is precisely what the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act would do.”In addition to Senators Tillis and Scott, the bill is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Mike Braun (R-IN), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), John Cornyn (R-TX), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Steve Daines (R-MT), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), John Kennedy (R-LA), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Lee (R-UT), James Risch (R-ID), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Rick Scott (R-FL), and Roger Wicker (R-MS). Companion legislation was introduced in the House by U.S. Representative Mike Kelly (R-PA).

This increase of federal contracts in North Carolina comes as the North Carolina Military Business Center (NCMBC), a business development component of North Carolina’s community colleges, has worked to expand military and federal business opportunities to help grow North Carolina’s economy. “We’ve seen a major increase in federal investments in North Carolina’s military installations and communities over the last several years, and I want to thank the NCMBC for their role in connecting North Carolina businesses with federal agencies,” said Senator Tillis. “The uptick in federal contracts in 2020 created more job opportunities for the people of our state and has been crucial for North Carolina’s economic recovery from COVID-19. I look forward to continue working with my colleagues in Congress and partners in North Carolina to ensure we keep our status as the most military friendly state in the nation.”“Each of these prime contracts – and billions more in subcontracts – grows jobs, expands the economy and tax base and improves quality of life for everyone in North Carolina,” said NCMBC Executive Director Scott Dorney. “Although COVID-19 negatively impacted other sectors of our economy, the federal economy in North Carolina boomed during 2020 - with COVID-19 medical and textile requirements and the Hurricane Florence Recovery program driving federal agency and DoD contracting, respectively.”   Fiscal Year 2020 Figures: ### "

His experience reflects his extensive legal knowledge and unbiased application of the law, and his longstanding reputation of bipartisanship has earned the respect from both Democrats and Republicans. After talking to him and participating in his confirmation hearing, I have no doubt he will serve our country well.”###"
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2021/3/tillis-colleagues-demand-answers-on-cdc-distorting-school-reopening-data,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Tim Scott (R-SC), and Bill Hagerty (R-TN) sent a letter to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky following reports that they “misinterpreted” research on school reopenings. The senators “demand a Tiger Team composed of public health experts to identify and address the source of this failure, align the guidance with science, and get our students back to school.” The Tiger Teams would be composed of experts both inside and outside of the CDC to address the agency’s failure and to provide information, based on consistent science, to safely reopen schools.“It is clear that a team of experts is needed to evaluate the CDC’s guidance and address their clear conflicts with the science,” the senators wrote. “If schools across the country followed the Biden Administration’s unscientific CDC guidance to the letter, more than 90 percent of them would be forced to close. These recommendations are in flagrant opposition to the science, and yet, they support the unions’ goals.”“On March 9, 2021, four leading scientists released an op-ed titled, ‘The CDC misinterpreted our research on reopening schools. It should loosen the rules now.  The scientists further stated that ‘keeping schools closed or even partially closed, based on what we know now is harming children.’  The op-ed continues that the CDC guidance is a fear-based document that is hamstringing reopening efforts, to the detriment of children. This brave call for a science-based approach that prioritizes children and reopens schools safely joins a chorus of leading scientists who are baffled by the CDC’s unacceptable approach,” the senators concluded.The full text of the letter is below. We write with regard to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) school opening guidance.  Numerous reports have documented how school closures continue to cause grave harm to our nation’s students’ educational outcomes and mental wellbeing.  The overwhelming body of evidence indicates that it is safe for schools to offer in-person learning, and experts agree that the best thing we can do for students is to get them back in the classroom.  Many of our states have been able to safely provide in-person learning for the majority of this year, and yet, the CDC and the Biden Administration have failed to provide our nation’s schools with a workable set of standards and a consistent science-based message to help them reopen.  To address those concerns, we demand a Tiger Team composed of public health experts to identify and address the source of this failure, align the guidance with science, and get our students back to school. Last week, every Senate Democrat voted against our amendment to incentivize schools to reopen.  Instead, they moved forward with $123 billion in funding that has no ties to any specific reopening timing.  We are now left with an untenable crisis where it seems unlikely the unions will end their opposition to in-person learning, even after they receive billions in additional funding.  The endless moving of goalposts by teachers’ unions make it hard to see a future in which our students will be able to pursue the in-person education they deserve.  On February 12, 2021, the CDC admitted that listening sessions with parents and teachers led to direct changes to their original draft guidance.  By putting forth biased, unscientific guidance, the CDC made a clear decision to side with teachers unions over the well-being of students. It is clear that a team of experts is needed to evaluate the CDC’s guidance and address their clear conflicts with the science.  If schools across the country followed the Biden Administration’s unscientific CDC guidance to the letter, more than 90 percent of them would be forced to close.  These recommendations are in flagrant opposition to the science, and yet, they support the unions’ goals.  While the Biden Administration tries to claim they support school reopening, by putting forth recommendations that keep almost all of our nation’s schools closed, the unions are using them to extract greater concessions.On March 9, 2021, four leading scientists released an op-ed titled, “The CDC misinterpreted our research on reopening schools. It should loosen the rules now.”  The scientists further stated that “keeping schools closed or even partially closed, based on what we know now is harming children.”  The op-ed continues that the CDC guidance is a fear-based document that is hamstringing reopening efforts, to the detriment of children.  This brave call for a science-based approach that prioritizes children and reopens schools safely joins a chorus of leading scientists who are baffled by the CDC’s unacceptable approach.The status quo cannot and must not continue—it is time to safely reopen schools.  Thank you for your attention to this crisis.    ###"
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2021/3/tillis-statement-on-bipartisan-agreement-to-reopen-north-carolina-schools,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) released the following statement on the bipartisan agreement to reopen schools in North Carolina:“I’ve heard countless stories from North Carolina parents about the hardships their families and children have faced as a result of remote learning, especially for students with physical and intellectual disabilities who need in-person schooling and services. I am glad that Governor Cooper, Speaker Moore, and Senator Berger were able to reach a bipartisan compromise to get students back to school safely and quickly. School reopenings in North Carolina and the rest of the nation must be based on what the scientists—not powerful unions—tell us, and I remain committed to pushing commonsense legislation to support our school districts as they put the well-being of students first by safely resuming in-person learning.”### "

https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2021/3/tillis-introduces-bipartisan-bicameral-bill-to-close-the-patent-gap-faced-by-women,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Mazie Hirono (D-HI) and U.S. Representatives Nydia Velázquez (D-NY) and Steve Stivers (R-OH) introduced the Inventor Diversity for Economic Advancement (IDEA) Act of 2021, bipartisan, bicameral legislation to close the gap that women, minorities, and others face when procuring patent rights in the United States. The same coalition introduced the IDEA Act in 2019.“Women and minority inventors have made some of the most significant inventions in this country’s history, yet studies show that only 22 percent of all U.S. patents list a woman as an inventor and that women only make up 13 percent of all inventors,” said Senator Tillis. “We must work to close this gap to ensure all Americans have the opportunity to innovate, and I am proud to reintroduce this bipartisan, bicameral legislation to get a better understanding of the background of individuals who apply for patents with the USPTO.”“Our nation is home to millions of inventors—and we must do more to encourage women and minorities to secure patent rights. To keep leading in technological innovation, we must harness the potential of all Americans. I have long worked to boost opportunities for women and other underrepresented groups in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields. The IDEA Act will give us insight into what policies we can implement to support underrepresented groups in applying for patents, and help policymakers address these inequalities,” Senator Hirono said.“The reintroduction of the IDEA Act is a crucial step toward ensuring that our nation’s inventors have equal access to our innovation ecosystem, regardless of gender, race, or income. Invent Together applauds this important effort to gather the data we need to build a more diverse and inclusive patent system,” Holly Fechner, Executive Director of Invent Together, said.“For too long, researchers have used names and zip codes as proxies for gender, race, and income to study the diversity gaps in patenting,” said Dr. C. Nicole Mason, President and CEO of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. “The IDEA Act will provide us with the information needed to better understand and address the patent disparities among women, people of color, and other underrepresented groups.”“As America’s leading research universities know, the best science requires all the best minds available – and the innovation economy that stems from university-based research grows faster when all inventors have access to markets for their innovations,” said Association of American Universities President Barbara Snyder. “The Association of American Universities strongly supports the IDEA Act, which will provide tools to create more equitable pathways to support university-based inventors of all backgrounds.”“The Biotechnology Innovation Organization believes that diversity is important not just as a matter of simple justice, but as a necessity in this competitive world. We cannot afford to waste talent, and must draw on the creative capacities of our entire population. That is especially true in the biosciences where the US leads the world in innovation,” said Dr. Michelle McMurry-Heath, BIO’s President and CEO. “The IDEA Act is vital to giving us a clear picture of where we are and what needs to be done to move forward. BIO commends Senators Hirono and Tillis, and Representatives Velazquez and Stivers, for this important legislation, and we urge its swift enactment.”“The IDEA Act will significantly advance our knowledge about the barriers facing women technologists and help us better support our future leaders in science and technology.  It is critically important that we have a full understanding of who is inventing and patenting to move forward with the right solutions,” Brenda Darden Wilkerson, President and CEO of AnitaB.org, said.IPO Executive Director Jessica Landacre said “IPO and IPO Education Foundation support the IDEA Act because collecting data is crucial for measuring progress toward greater inclusion of all underrepresented groups in the patent system. We hope Congress will pass the IDEA Act as soon as possible.”Studies show that women and minorities apply for and obtain patents at significantly lower rates than their male, white counterparts. Only 22 percent of U.S. patents list at least one woman as an inventor and that women make up only 13 percent of all inventors. African American and Hispanic college graduates apply for patents at approximately half the rate of their white counterparts.The IDEA Act works to close those gaps by directing the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to collect demographic data—including gender, race, and military or veteran status—from patent applicants on a voluntary basis. It further requires the USPTO to both issue reports on the data collected and make the data available to the public, thereby allowing outside researchers to conduct their own analyses and offer insights into the various patent gaps in our society. The IDEA Act is cosponsored by Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT).Read the full text of the bill HERE. ###"
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2021/3/tillis-sinema-cramer-and-feinstein-reintroduce-bipartisan-paws-for-veterans-therapy-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) reintroduced the bipartisan Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers (PAWS) for Veterans Therapy Act, bipartisan legislation that authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to create a pilot program on dog training therapy and provide service dogs to veterans with mental illnesses regardless of whether or not they have mobility issues.“We must do everything possible to combat veteran suicide, including innovative treatments like service dog therapy that address post-deployment mental health conditions,” said Senator Tillis. “Our veterans deserve every tool in the toolbox when it comes to their mental health, which is why I’m proud that this legislation encourages dog training therapy for veterans.”“Many veterans with mobility impairments have had their lives changed — in some cases, saved — by service dogs,” said Senator Cramer. “Our bill would expand this treatment by launching a pilot program to make veterans with mental health issues such as depression eligible to receive service dogs.”According to a report from the Department of Veteran’s Affairs, the number of veterans with mental health conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use orders increased from 27 percent in 2001 to more than 40 percent in 2014, and an average of 20 veterans per day died by suicide in 2014. The bipartisan PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act aims to reduce veteran suicide connected to mental health conditions by partnering veterans experiencing symptoms of PTSD and other post-deployment issues with service dogs through a Department of Veterans Affairs pilot program. Dog therapy programs have a track record of reducing symptoms associated with PTSD and through this pilot program, veterans are expected to experience an improved quality of life and ability to re-enter society as well as increased chances of survival.

https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2021/3/tillis-opposes-democrats-partisan-1-9-trillion-spending-bill,"Tillis co-introduced a targeted $650 billion plan that would have directed resources to the people and places that need it the mostWASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) voted against the $1.9 trillion spending bill passed by Senate Democrats. Before the vote, Senator Tillis co-introduced an amendment blocked by Senate Democrats that was based on a COVID-19 relief plan that was unveiled last month by Senator Tillis and nine Republican Senators. “When COVID-19 hit our nation last year, Congress confronted the unprecedented crisis we faced and came together on a bipartisan basis to pass five bipartisan COVID relief packages totaling over $4 trillion. We set aside our partisan differences for the good of the country and refused to allow perfection to become the enemy of the good, and the results were extraordinary.“Unfortunately, Democrats have managed to turn the one uniting force in Congress into just another partisan, divisive political issue of the day. Instead of continuing the bipartisan momentum on COVID assistance, Senate Majority Leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi chose a partisan path that resulted in divisive legislation that’s more focused on ramming through far-left initiatives instead of providing targeted relief to help small businesses, re-open schools, and end this pandemic so we can return to life as normal as soon as possible. “This is evident when considering that in this $1.9 trillion spending bill, only 9% of it is used on public health to defeat COVID-19. Democrats are, however, spending triple that amount of money – more than half a trillion – to bail out poorly run states like New York and California, states that had financial issues well before the pandemic hit. One would expect a real COVID relief bill to re-open schools as students across the country have fallen behind because they haven’t had in-person instruction for a year. Instead, 95% of the new school money will be spent from 2022 to 2028, and in total, more than $700 billion of the funding in this bill won’t be spent until 2022 or later. “The reality is we still have more than $1 trillion of unspent funds from the previous COVID relief bills, which is why I co-introduced an amendment with 10 of my Republican colleagues that would have allocated $650 billion in targeted relief spending that would help those who need it most and provided the funds necessary to respond to the pandemic, including expanding testing and deploying vaccines. “Instead, my Democratic colleagues pushed their partisan spending bill through the Senate and put an end to the bipartisan spirit of COVID relief that produced results over the past year. I am disappointed the Congressional Democrats and the Biden Administration chose this path while promising to work on a bipartisan basis over the past year, particularly when they had 10 Republicans willing to work on compromise legislation. I am committed to reaching bipartisan outcomes on behalf of the people of North Carolina, and I hope we can return to finding areas of agreement instead of ramming through extreme policy outcomes.”###"

https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2021/3/tillis-co-sponsors-bipartisan-bicameral-legislation-to-strengthen-the-victims-of-crime-act,"Legislation will support crime victims by fixing how the Crime Victims Fund is fundedWASHINGTON, D.C. – This week, U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, co-sponsored bipartisan, bicameral legislation to strengthen the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) by fixing how the Crime Victims Fund (CVF) is funded. This legislation will redirect monetary penalties from federal deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements into the CVF to increase funding for state victim compensation and assistance programs.“Congress must act now to preserve and strengthen the Crime Victims Fund,” said Senator Tillis. “We owe it to every victim to make sure victim service providers in North Carolina and nationwide have the necessary resources to assist those in need. I am proud to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to introduce this commonsense legislation so we can provide victims with the peace of mind they deserve.”VOCA established the CVF, which provides grant funding for state victim compensation and assistance programs. Grants are awarded to states, local governments, individuals, and other entities by the Justice Department’s Office for Victims of Crime. The CVF does not receive appropriated funding; instead, it receives most money through deposits from criminal fines. As a result, deposits fluctuate annually based on cases that the Justice Department prosecutes. Deposits into the CVF are historically low, and the decrease is due in large part to greater use of deferred prosecutions and non-prosecution agreements. Monetary penalties associated with these prosecutions are currently deposited into the General Treasury, not the CVF.  Due to the rapidly diminishing balance in the CVF, victim services are already being slashed in states across the country, and some programs and services may see close to a 100 percent cut within two years if Congress does not act. Grant awards to states already decreased in both Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 and FY2020, and victims in rural and smaller jurisdictions will be particularly impacted by the cuts. The bipartisan, bicameral VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime Victims Fund Act would strengthen VOCA and preserve the CVF by amending how the CVF is funded. Critical changes in the bill include:The legislation was introduced by Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, along with Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), John Cornyn (R-TX), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK).

Last year, five of the country’s largest banks announced they will not provide loans or credit to support oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge even though Congress explicitly authorized it. In the fall, JP Morgan Chase declared it would refuse financial services to coal producers, and Bank of America began a politically-motivated effort to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from its financing activities by 2050, an effort directly targeting producers of reliable American energy. Discrimination by financial service providers also extends to industries protected by the Second Amendment, with banks like Capital One including “ammunitions, firearms, or firearm parts” in its prohibited payments section, and payment services like Apple Pay and PayPal denying their services for transactions involving firearms or ammunition.The bill has a wide array of industry support as well, including endorsements from the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA), National Rifle Association (NRA), Kentucky Coal Association, Lignite Energy Council, National Mining Association, Amusement and Music Operators Association, National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, and the Day 1 Alliance.Read the text of the bill HERE.###"

I hope the House chooses to protect freedom of thought on college campuses and joins us in passing the CONFUCIUS Act.” At universities across the U.S., the Chinese government is waging an influence war through its Confucius Institutes. Though ostensibly designed to promote cultural studies on college campuses, Confucius Institutes receive direct funding from the Chinese government.The CONFUCIUS Act reduces the Chinese Communist Party’s influence on U.S. colleges and universities by granting full managerial authority over Confucius Institutes to the universities that host them. Specifically, the CONFUCIUS Act provides that Confucius Institutes must:This bill would prohibit federal government funding to colleges and universities that host Confucius Institutes and are not in compliance with the above provisions.

https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2021/3/tillis-and-smith-lead-bipartisan-push-to-support-health-care-for-veterans-exposed-to-radiation,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Tina Smith (D-MN) reintroduced their bipartisan bill to secure health care benefits for “Atomic Veterans” who were exposed to harmful radiation when they cleaned up nuclear testing sites during the late 1970s.The Mark Takai Atomic Veterans Healthcare Parity Act would allow veterans who participated in the cleanup of Enewetak Atoll on the Marshall Islands to receive the same health care and benefits given to other servicemembers who were involved in active nuclear tests. From 1946 to 1958, the U.S. military conducted more than 40 nuclear tests in the islands, but the thousands of servicemembers who cleaned up the area were never made eligible to receive health benefits under the Radiation Compensation Exposure Act.“The courageous servicemembers who were assigned to cleaning the fallout and debris from nuclear tests in the Marshall Islands without protective gear in the 1970s deserve the highest quality medical care,” said Senator Tillis. “The fact that those servicemembers have had to fight for the same level of care as other radiation-exposed veterans is a systemic failure we must correct. This bipartisan legislation is long overdue and will ensure that those veterans receive access to the medical treatment they are entitled to.”                                                                                            “We have a solemn duty to take care of the men and women who serve in our armed forces—a big part of that means ensuring they can get the health care they need both during and after their service,” said Senator Smith. “Americans who cleaned up the radiation-exposed Marshall Islands—where more than 40 nuclear tests took place in the 20th century—have been fighting for proper care for a long time. We need to stand up for them, and we can do so by delivering on this commonsense, bipartisan fix.”In addition to Senators Tillis and Smith, the bill is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Angus King (I-ME), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Chris Coons (D-DE), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Edward J Markey (D-MA), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI).The bill is named after the late Hawaii Congressman Mark Takai, a veteran of the U.S. Army and Hawaii Army National Guard who passed away in 2016 and was the original sponsor of the bill in the House of Representatives. Companion legislation was introduced in the House by U.S. Representative Grace Meng (D-NY).The servicemembers who participated in the Marshall Islands cleanup between 1977 and 1980 suffer from high rates of cancers due to their exposure to radiation and nuclear waste, but are currently unable to receive the same treatments and service-related disability presumptions that other “radiation-exposed veterans” receive. The Mark Takai Atomic Veterans Healthcare Parity Act would tackle this issue by extending key VA benefits to those who helped clean up the Marshall Islands, which remain partly uninhabitable due to high levels of radiation.You can read a summary of the bill here.###"

https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2021/3/tillis-and-coons-reintroduce-resolution-to-establish-a-senate-human-rights-commission,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Chris Coons (D-DE), co-chairs of the Senate Human Rights Caucus, introduced a resolution to establish a Senate Human Rights Commission, modeled after the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission in the U.S. House of Representatives. If passed, the resolution would create a bipartisan commission to examine human rights violations through regular briefings and events and promote human rights initiatives in the Senate. Joining Senators Tillis and Coons in introducing the resolution were Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Susan Collins (R-ME), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and James Lankford (R-OK).In December 2020, over 50 leading human rights organizations sent a letter to Senate leadership in support of the establishment of a Senate Human Rights Commission.“From the Chinese Communist Party’s brutal imprisonment of Muslim minorities to the Russian government’s crackdown on political dissidents, we are tragically seeing a resurgence of authoritarian regimes denying people basic freedoms,” said Senator Tillis. “Now more than ever, it is vital the United States prioritize human rights and reveal violations occurring across the globe. I’m honored to join my colleagues to establish the Senate Human Rights Commission to keep focused on these pressing issues.”  “I’m proud of the work that Senator Tillis and I achieve through the Senate Human Rights Caucus, and we are eager to do more to defend human rights and stand up for those who are denied their basic freedoms,” said Senator Coons. “A bipartisan Senate Human Rights Commission would provide more resources to advocate for those who suffer from violence, oppression, and wrongful imprisonment, and shine a light on abuses around the world. I’m hopeful we can advance this legislation to uphold our responsibility to fight for the universal protection of human rights.”“Amnesty International USA welcomes this bipartisan resolution to establish the Senate Human Rights Commission, and urges the Senate to swiftly pass the resolution. The U.S. Senate has a major role to play in highlighting and curtailing human rights violations around the world, and ensure universal human rights are central to US foreign policy. From the right to protest in Egypt and Chile, to violations against international religious freedom in Myanmar and China, or the migrant/refugee crisis gripping the America’s and Sub Saharan Africa, there is no shortage of human rights issues that need attention from the U.S. Government, and we believe this commission will help us find some of the answers to these pressing global challenges,” said Joanne Lin, National Advocacy and Government Affairs Director of Amnesty International USA.“The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom is grateful that the United States Senate is prioritizing international human rights through the proposed creation of the Senate Human Rights Commission. The Senate Commission would convene experts on various human rights situations taking place around the world and discuss solutions to very difficult problems, and it would serve as an important reminder that the U.S. is committed to individual universal freedoms as a vital part of its foreign policy and engagement with the world. We look forward to the establishment of the Senate Commission and to seeing its contribution to international religious freedom as it addresses the ongoing persecution of faith communities around the world,” said Gayle Manchin, Chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF).""In Defense of Christians strongly commends Senators Coons and Tillis for their leadership in converting the Senate Human Rights Caucus into a funded commission. The work they have done with the caucus has offered much-needed support to Christians such as Andrew Brunson and Ramy Kamel, who have been persecuted for their faith in the Middle East. We strongly encourage the Senate to support this resolution so this commission can expand this vital work to promote human rights across the globe,” said Toufic Baaklini, President of In Defense of Christians. “The creation of such a commission would provide an important forum for senators to stay abreast of critical human rights issues worldwide, at a time when too many governments have been exploiting the pandemic to restrict the rights and liberties of their citizens, and be a seminal step towards re-enforcing human rights as a cornerstone of American foreign policy,” said Thomas O. Melia, Washington Director of PEN America. “As the state of free expression and other fundamental rights are under assault worldwide, Congress must devote itself to a strong defense of the civil liberties certain governments seek to undermine.""“The need for Congressional leadership to preserve and protect fundamental human rights around the world through U.S. foreign policy has never been more critical. This new commission would complement the work of Congressional committees and strengthen collaboration between government and non-governmental bodies. A Senate Human Rights Commission would increase the volume and effectiveness of bipartisan work focused on human rights abuses across the world,” said Dr. Randel Everett, President of 21Wilberforce.The full text of the resolution is available here. ###"
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2021/3/tillis-to-serve-as-ranking-member-of-the-financial-institutions-and-consumer-protection-subcommittee,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC), a member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, received the appointment as Ranking Member of the Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection Subcommittee. “I look forward to working with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, both in the full committee and the subcommittee assignments announced today,” said Senator Tillis. “I am pleased to serve as Ranking Member on the Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection Subcommittee, which provides necessary and meaningful oversight of the federal financial regulators. I believe it is critically important that Congress continues to adopt well-thought-out and right-sized regulations for the U.S. financial industry, all while ensuring that federal regulators maintain fair and transparent supervision that adheres tightly to their scope of jurisdiction.”“As our nation works to recover from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and government-imposed shutdowns, the Financial Institutions Subcommittee will play an important role in expanding access to credit while guarding against burdensome regulations,” said Ranking Member Pat Toomey. “I am sure Senator Tillis’ record of implementing pro-growth policies and delivering results will prove successful in leading this subcommittee.”The Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection Subcommittee is over the following jurisdictions:Senator Tillis will also continue to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and Committee on the Judiciary as well as Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel and the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property.### "

Iran still needs to be treated like the terrorist regime they are, and Congress should vote before any sanction relief is granted.”Even as the Iranian regime continues to support terrorism, regional militancy, missile proliferation, cyber-attacks, and other forms of aggression—including rocket attacks by Iran-backed militias targeting U.S. forces in Iraq—the Biden Administration last week indicated that it wants to negotiate with Tehran to relieve sanctions on the Iranian regime and reenter the flawed nuclear deal. This legislation builds on the precedent of a 2017 bipartisan law that empowers Congress to vote to support or block Russian sanctions relief and applies identical congressional review procedure to any future Iran sanctions relief. In effect, this legislation would prevent the administration from rolling back sanctions in exchange for advancing negotiations or reentering the deal without first securing strong congressional support. ###"

The members released the following statement after introduction: “The United States must maintain sanctions on the Iranian regime until it abandons its nuclear ambitions and ends its support for violence and terror around the region. Iran took advantage of weak policies during the Obama Administration, and President Biden must not repeat those same mistakes.” Read the full resolution here. ###"
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2021/2/tillis-cosponsors-contract-act-to-support-air-traffic-controllers,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) joined U.S. Senators Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Patty Murray (D-WA), Jerry Moran (R-KS), and 38 of his colleagues in cosponsoring the Continuity for Operators with Necessary Training Required for ATC Contract Towers (CONTRACT) Act of 2021.  These contract towers are an important part of our national air traffic control system—serving communities through a proven public-private partnership that increases safety and improves air traffic control services while lowering the cost to the federal government. U.S. Representatives Julia Brownley (D-CA) and Rodney Davis (R-IL) reintroduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives.“Contract air traffic controllers are crucial to keeping North Carolina's skies safe,” said Senator Tillis. “We should be focused on attracting experienced FAA controllers, not penalizing them financially for continuing to work. This legislation removes the unnecessary penalty and ensures we have the most highly-skilled FAA controllers possible.”Federal contract towers face a unique hurdle to hiring trained and well-qualified retired FAA controllers. Because FAA air traffic controllers are one of several federal employee groups whose retirement is mandated at 56 years of age, retired FAA controllers are penalized for continuing to work as controllers at federal contract towers. These experienced retired FAA employees should have the opportunity to use their skills at a federal contract tower without facing a financial penalty. This legislation would eliminate that penalty.Full bill text can be viewed here.The CONTRACT Act is supported by the U.S. Contract Tower Association (USCTA), the American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE), and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA).Contract towers play a central role in managing the safety and efficiency of our nation's complex airspace, supporting general aviation safety, the efficiency of large commercial airports, disaster relief, and emergency medical operations, law enforcement and agriculture activities and businesses throughout the United States. In addition, many contract tower airports are located near or adjacent to military bases and manage a substantial number of military-related and national security operations, directly supporting the readiness and training of military units.This legislation would remove the disincentive for retired FAA air traffic controllers to work at federal contract towers. Under current law, FAA air traffic controllers must retire by age 56. Because this is earlier than the normal retirement age, controllers are included as a ""special group"" under the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) and contribute an additional 0.5 percent of their annual salary into a special retirement annuity account. In return, they receive a FERS annuity payment during the mandatory retirement period between 56 and the social security minimum age of 62. The retired controller's special annuity payment is incrementally reduced if they earn more than the social security earnings limit of $17,640 (2019 tax year) annually. This annuity offset penalty results in many retired FAA controllers deciding not to work as federal contract tower air traffic controllers.###"
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2021/2/tillis-colleagues-reintroduce-bill-to-protect-health-care-workers-from-discrimination,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) reintroduced the Conscience Protection Act of 2021 to protect health care providers, including health insurance plans, from government discrimination if they decline to participate in abortions. The Conscience Protection Act also provides a private right of action for victims of discrimination. “Health care workers should not be forced to compromise their beliefs because they fear workplace discrimination,” said Senator Tillis. “This legislation provides permanent legal protection for health care workers who decline to participate in or perform abortion services.”Senator Tillis was joined by several of his colleagues to re-introduce the bill, including Senators James Lankford (R-OK), Steve Daines (R-MT), Jim Inhofe, (R-OK), Tim Scott (R-SC), Rob Portman (R-OH), Jim Risch (R-ID), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Deb Fischer (R-NE), John Boozman (R-AR), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Bill Cassidy, (R-LA), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), John Barrasso (R-WY), John Thune (R-SD), John Hoeven (R-ND), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Mike Rounds (R-SD).Currently, if a health care provider, including insurance plans, refuses to provide abortions, the only recourse is to file a complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR). In 2014, California required that health plans must cover abortions, which forced religious employers to offer plans that violate their religious beliefs. In December 2014 under the Obama Administration, HHS opened an investigation, and in spite of then-current laws protecting conscience rights, in June 2016, HHS declared that California could force all its health plans to cover elective abortions, which President Biden’s nominee for HHS Secretary has advocated for and enforced as Attorney General of California.Under the Trump Administration, it took several actions to enforce current law and protect conscience: (1) created the new Conscience and Religious Freedom Division, (2) partnered with the Department of Justice to notice and enforce conscience violations in Vermont and California, resulting in the disallowance of $200 million per quarter from the state due to Attorney General Becerra’s refusal to comply with the law, and (3) issued the final rule “Protecting Statutory Conscience Rights In Health Care” to enforce existing statutory protections, which Lankford supported. Unfortunately, a federal court vacated the conscience rule in November 2019. Litigation on the final rule continues at the Second Circuit in New York v. HHS. Seventy-eight Members of Congress filed an amicus brief led by Senator Lankford in the case.While the rule from the Trump Administration now stands in limbo, passage of the Conscience Protection Act is critical. We cannot wait to see if the Biden Administration will choose to follow the law or whether they will revert to the actions of the Obama Administration and not only ignore the law, but leave victims of discrimination with no recourse. We must ensure the law is followed and that individuals are able to have their case heard in court.The bill is supported by the Christian Medical & Dental Associations, Concerned Women for America, Ethics and Public Policy Center, The Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, Family Research Council, Freedom2Care, Heritage Action, March for Life, National Right to Life, Susan B. Anthony List, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, and First Liberty.###  "

https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2021/2/tillis-leads-effort-to-ensure-protections-and-affordable-coverage-for-americans-with-pre-existing-conditions,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – This week, U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Rob Portman (R-OH), John Cornyn (R-TX), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Richard Burr (R-NC), and Todd Young (R-IN) plan to reintroduce the Protect Act, legislation that protects Americans with pre-existing conditions and ensures that Americans will never be denied health care coverage or be charged more because of a pre-existing condition.The Protect Act amends the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to:Read more about the Protect Act HERE.“Millions of Americans who have a pre-existing condition should never have to worry about being denied coverage of treatment for them or their children,” said Senator Tillis. “There is bipartisan consensus in Congress for codifying these protections into law, but have repeatedly been blocked for political purposes. It’s time to put the American people first, and the Protect Act is an important first step towards protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions and pursuing patient-centered reform that will provide all Americans with the affordable and quality choices that work best for their needs and their budget.” “As I’ve met with Iowans on my 99 County Tour, health care has consistently been a topic that’s top of mind for folks. Iowans want to see lower costs, choice in deciding what’s best for their families, and protections in place for those with preexisting conditions,” said Senator Ernst. “As I’ve long said, we must always ensure protections for Iowans with preexisting conditions — like my nephew with autism, and my brother and my sister who both have Type 1 diabetes — regardless of how policies may change at the federal level. This commonsense and straightforward legislation will do exactly that and Congress should waste no time in passing it.”“Families should not have to worry that a pre-existing condition will stand in the way of getting health coverage,” said Senator Portman. “This is a basic principle for good health care that I will continue to support and fight to ensure that it remains the law of the land.”“Texans shouldn’t have to fear being denied access to affordable health insurance because of a pre-existing condition,” said Sen. Cornyn. “This legislation will give them peace of mind they can choose an insurance plan for their families that offers quality, patient-centered coverage.”“Tens of thousands of Mississippians suffer from pre-existing conditions and worry about the possibility of being penalized because of their health.  The Protect Act would codify protections that shield them from that threat,” Hyde-Smith said.  “I hope this is an area in which a divided Congress can work together to do what’s right for our constituents.” “Protecting Americans with pre-existing health conditions is simply the right thing to do, and that’s what this legislation does,” Senator Capito said. “I will continue working with my colleagues toward commonsense solutions that result in better health care, affordable coverage, and expanded options for all West Virginians, including those battling the disease of addiction.”  “As a physician, I’ve dedicated my career to putting my patients’ health first,” said Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. “The Protect Act would protect Kansan patients by prohibiting insurance companies from raising premiums, banning or denying coverage, and excluding benefits to patients based on a pre-existing condition. I will continue to work with my colleagues to advance patient-centered health care that improves access to quality and affordable care, and puts people back in charge of their health care.” “Americans deserve certainty that their health care coverage will not be denied because of a pre-existing condition,” said Senator Burr. “This legislation gives these individuals and their families peace of mind by ensuring they have affordable and quality choice of health care coverage. I’m pleased to join my colleagues on this important bill that prioritizes patient-centered health care.”“When it comes to healthcare, there is bipartisan agreement that we must protect people with pre-existing conditions,” said Senator Young. “Families should never have to worry about being denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition, and our legislation will ensure they are protected.”  ###"
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2021/2/tillis-reintroduces-bipartisan-legislation-to-support-u-s-research-community-impacted-by-the-pandemic,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Gary Peters (D-MI), and Susan Collins (R-ME) introduced the Research Investment to Spark the Economy (RISE) Act to authorize nearly $25 billion in support to U.S. researchers who have been impacted by the pandemic. Although coronavirus-related research is a current federal government priority, most other research has been delayed due to closures of campuses and laboratories. The people who comprise the research workforce – graduate students, postdocs, principal investigators, and technical support staff – face financial and other hardships from the disruption of their research activities. The RISE Act will provide necessary relief to preserve the current scientific workforce and ensure that the United States is prepared to continue our global scientific leadership once this crisis ends. In September 2020, the RISE Act was marked up and approved by the Senate Commerce Committee. Senators Tillis, Markey, Peters, and Collins will build on the committee approval from last Congress and fight for the inclusion of federal research relief in COVID-19 relief packages.“Over the course of this unprecedented pandemic, our medical researchers, scientists, research institutions, and labs in North Carolina and across the country have worked tirelessly to battle COVID-19 and improve the health of the country,” said Senator Tillis. “I am proud to co-introduce the RISE Act again in the 117th Congress and I will continue to fight for our economic growth, global competitiveness, and ability to deliver innovative medical and scientific solutions. We must support our nation’s research investments and workforce pipeline so that the medical and scientific research community can resume operations and restore progress to pre-pandemic levels.”“We are grateful to Senator Tillis for his leadership on this critical issue,” said UNC System President Peter Hans. “The mission of the UNC System is to discover, create, transmit, and apply knowledge. This legislation makes it possible for us to maintain the momentum we have in creating jobs and fostering innovations that improve the lives of millions.”“As a recipient of approximately $750 million in federal research support, UNC-Chapel Hill is grateful to Senator Tillis and his leadership in advocating for research funding in the next COVID-19 aid bill. The bipartisan RISE Act would authorize critically important supplemental funding for federal science agencies, which support our students and faculty in their research to solve the challenges facing our state, the nation and the world. These funds will ensure our scientific work and research breakthroughs can continue during this unprecedented time,” said UNC-Chapel Hill Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz. “NC State University applauds Senator Tillis and his Congressional colleagues for their bi-partisan leadership in reintroducing the RISE Act, a critical investment to maintain and enhance our nation's leadership in scientific discovery and innovation,” said NC State University Chancellor Randy Woodson. “Federally-funded research at NC State and other research universities has led to countless advances that vastly improve quality of life and drive our nation’s economy. Although our nation’s research institutions have stepped up and done amazing work to address the many challenges caused by COVID-19, the pandemic has broadly challenged our country's overall research capabilities. The RISE Act would ensure that vital federally funded research projects can again be completed, ultimately strengthening and advancing our nation’s research enterprise for the benefit of all Americans.”  “The federal government is a critical partner for university-based research, and North Carolina is shining example of the successful connection between federally-funded academic research and economic growth.  The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many aspects of campus life, including research conducted in our labs and the professional trajectory of our early-career researchers. I am grateful for the bipartisan recognition in Congress of the needs facing our scientific workforce and the importance of providing the federal science agencies the additional funding needed to help mitigate the impacts of COVID to the nation’s research enterprise and universities,” said Duke University President Vincent Price. A copy of the legislation can be found here.Representatives Diana DeGette (D-CO), Fred Upton (R-MI), Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX), Anna A. Eshoo (D-CA) and Anthony Gonzalez (R-OH) also introduced the legislation in the House of Representatives today. That legislation has 77 original co-sponsors, and more than 300 organizations endorsing, including the Association of American Universities (AAU), Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), American Council on Education (ACE) and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU).###   "
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2021/2/tillis-shaheen-reintroduce-bipartisan-bill-to-increase-emergency-funding-for-rural-water-systems,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) reintroduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) to provide rural communities under economic strain during the COVID-19 pandemic with emergency assistance to repair, modernize and renovate failing water infrastructure. The Emergency Assistance for Rural Water Systems Act would provide $1 billion in emergency grants, low- and zero-interest loans and loan forgiveness for struggling small and rural water and wastewater systems across the nation.Small rural water and wastewater systems lost billions of dollars last year, with over 80% of small water systems in New Hampshire reporting decreased revenues since the pandemic, according to the Rural Community Assistance Partnership (RCAP). As the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue, it is estimated 30 percent of systems cannot last more than six months under current financial conditions. The Emergency Support for Rural Water Systems Act would allow rural communities to make necessary improvements and repairs to critical water infrastructure and ensure residents of these rural communities continue to have access to clean drinking water and wastewater treatment services.Companion legislation was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congressman David Rouzer (R-NC-07) and Congressman Filemon Vela (D-TX-34).“Rural water and wastewater systems in North Carolina and across the county are in dire financial situations due to COVID-19,” said Senator Tillis. “I am proud to reintroduce this bipartisan legislation to provide relief so our rural communities continue to receive clean drinking water.”“As we face down this public health crisis, we must ensure our communities have access to clean water, especially in hard to reach rural areas, said Shaheen. “With local governments struggling under the economic weight of COVID, we’ve seen massive budgetary shortfalls that threaten their ability to maintain crucial infrastructure like water systems. I’m proud to reintroduce legislation that increases emergency funding to our rural communities to avoid expensive damage and service disruptions. I’ll keep working to ensure Granite State families have the essential services they need to weather through the pandemic.”  “The Rural Community Assistance Partnership appreciates Senators Shaheen and Tillis for their reintroduction of the bipartisan Emergency Assistance for Rural Water Systems Act, establishing an emergency grant and loan program for small water and wastewater systems during this ongoing pandemic,” said RCAP CEO Nathan Ohle. “When RCAP surveyed small rural and tribal water and wastewater systems we have worked with across the country, we heard very clearly that there was a tremendous amount of assistance needed. We were able to estimate the revenue loss due to the financial impact of COVID-19 across the country for systems serving 10,000 or less in population to be at least $3.6 billion. Not only were rural and tribal water and wastewater systems losing revenue at alarming rates, there was no mechanism for them to make up that revenue loss as federal assistance is focused on new infrastructure projects, not a loss in operating and maintenance costs. This Act can mitigate some of the current and potential damages seen to rural community’s most valuable resource: water. RCAP and our national network stand ready to work with Senators Shaheen and Tillis and their colleagues in Congress to ensure this much needed relief is included in the next relief package.”“The Granite State Rural Water Association of New Hampshire supports the passage of the Emergency Assistance for Rural Water Systems Act,” said Heidi Lauricella, Executive Director of GSRWA. “For the past eleven months, water and wastewater operators have continued working, many times under challenging conditions.  At the same time more customers have struggled to pay their bills, thus raising the concern that very soon there will not be enough revenue to support expenses.  We are thankful that water and wastewater systems have been able to maintain essential services during this public health crises.  Now these same rural utilities need our help to keep going.”### "
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2021/2/tillis-peters-sullivan-hassan-reintroduce-bipartisan-bill-to-protect-firefighters-from-hazardous-pfas-chemicals,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Gary Peters (D-MI), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) reintroduced a bipartisan bill to help protect the health and safety of firefighters, emergency responders, and the communities they serve. The Protecting Firefighters from Adverse Substances (PFAS) Act, which passed in the Senate last Congress, directs federal agencies to develop best practices, training, and educational programs to reduce, limit and prevent exposure to PFAS, also known as ‘forever chemicals’ because they do not naturally break down. The bill would also require guidance to be issued on alternative foams and personal protective equipment that do not contain PFAS. “Firefighters and first responders put their lives on the line to keep communities safe, and they should not have to worry about being exposed to harmful chemicals like PFAS when called to emergencies,” said Senator Tillis. “This legislation will develop guidelines to keep our first responders safe and limit the introduction of these harmful contaminants into the environment.”  Emergency response teams are frequently exposed to harmful per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in firefighting foams and personal protective equipment as they work to keep communities safe. PFAS substances have been linked to a number of health problems, including certain cancers.The Protecting Firefighters from Adverse Substances (PFAS) Act would direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) – in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Fire Administration, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health – to develop educational resources to help protect firefighters, emergency response personnel, and the communities they serve from PFAS exposure. This would include information for federal, state, and local firefighters on training and best practices to prevent and reduce exposure to PFAS from firefighting foams and protective gear, as well as resources that identify alternatives for firefighting tools and equipment that do not contain PFAS. U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Tom Carper (D-DE), and Susan Collins (R-ME) are also original cosponsors of the bill.### "

April 30, 2021.Tax Credit for Tutoring or Private School:Provides refundable tax credits for parents who incur tutoring or private school tuition costs during the COVID–19 pandemic, which may include parents in school districts in which teachers have refused to return to work after the request of the local educational agency.Law and OrderQualified Immunity for Law Enforcement:Prevents legislation that would limit or eliminate qualified immunity for law enforcement officers through existing law enforcement programs and activities.Protect and Serve:Establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund to develop policies by punishing those who assault or attempt to assault law enforcement officers with up to 10 years in prison, and up to life in prison for who those kidnap or attempt to kidnap, or those who kill or attempt to kill a law enforcement officer.Stop Sanctuary Cities:Prevents funding economic development grants to sanctuary city jurisdictions which decline to honor immigration detainers or share information with federal immigration authorities.Public Benefits for Illegal Immigrants: Prevents legislation which would permit illegal immigrants to access any non-emergency

https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2021/2/tillis-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-get-students-back-in-school,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – This week, U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) and seven of his colleagues introduced the Put Students First Act of 2021, legislation which would prohibit federal funding to schools that do not provide an in-person learning option by April 30, 2021.In January, leading health experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that America’s schools should reopen as soon as possible if precautions are taken – namely mask-wearing and social distancing – and that new scientific research provides ""a path forward to maintain or return primarily or fully to in-person instructional delivery."" Additionally, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky reiterated in a press conference today that “vaccination of teachers is not a prerequisite for safe reopening of schools” and that is clear “that there is increasing data to suggest that schools can safely reopen.”“During this unprecedented pandemic, our students and families in North Carolina and across the country have experienced great disruptions to their academic development and well-being, and there is no question that these disruptions will have long-lasting consequences,” said Senator Tillis. “The science is clear: our students, especially those who have special needs or live in underserved communities, will continue to face substantial learning loss and will not be able to receive crucial supportive services. I will continue to follow the guidance from our health experts and it is my highest priority to continue to fight for students and work to reopen our schools and resume in-person learning as soon as possible.”Background:President Biden has committed to reopen schools within his first 100 days as president. Despite this commitment, the Biden Administration claims that an extravagant infusion of $130 billion is necessary for schools to reopen safely, despite reports demonstrating that K-12 schools are not significant drivers of COVID-19 transmission when reasonable measures such as masking and social distancing are practiced.Despite strong evidence indicating that schools can and should reopen safely, a number of teachers’ unions are pushing back with unreasonable timeline requests. Notably, certain unions are demanding conditions be met that would not allow schools to be reopened until 2022, if ever. Experts agree that school closures are incredibly detrimental to students’ wellbeing. A growing body of scientific research is clear: the best thing we can do for students is get them back into the classroom.The Put Students First Act of 2021:o    Schools that do not reopen, and have already received FY21 and/or COVID-19 relief dollars, they would be required to return these funds. This provision would apply to any future infusions of COVID-19 relief dollars being currently debated by Congress. ### "
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2021/2/tillis-colleagues-demand-answers-on-dangerous-biden-dhs-deportation-moratorium,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) and 11 Senate colleagues pushed back on a deportation moratorium proposed by President Biden’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which will prevent the removal of the vast majority of illegal immigrants with final orders of removal—including dangerous criminals—from the United States.The moratorium was proposed in a January 21 memorandum issued by DHS, purportedly to focus resources on border security and conduct immigration and asylum processing at the southern border. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) enforcement and removal officers, whose operations would be severely impacted by the January 21 memorandum, aren’t trained to handle either of those duties normally handled by completely different DHS component agencies. The deportation moratorium has been temporarily enjoined by a federal district court in Texas, but is poised for implementation if that injunction is lifted.“Those seemingly harmless words mask what this memorandum actually does: it turns our nation of laws into a nation of loopholes. It is an insult to the men and women of DHS who have sworn to uphold those laws,” the senators wrote of the proposal. “…The Department’s January 21 memorandum creates, in our view, an unacceptable threat to public safety; constitutes a disregard for the rule of law and the will of Congress; and undercuts the integrity of the immigration enforcement regime.”In a letter to newly-confirmed DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Acting ICE Director Tae Johnson, the senators raise serious rule of law and public safety concerns. The senators also press the officials to provide information about the number of criminal illegal immigrants currently subject to removal, and whether all illegal immigrants currently subject to removal and charged with or convicted of homicide, sex crimes, robbery, kidnapping or domestic violence would still be eligible for removal under the proposed moratorium.In addition to Senator Tillis, the letter is also signed by U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Ben Sasse (R-NE), John Cornyn (R-TX), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mike Lee (R-UT), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Tom Cotton (R-AR) and James Lankford (R-OK).Full text of the letter follows or can be found here.### "

Further, 20 percent of female adolescent dependents of a servicemember are at risk for an eating disorder. Eating disorders have the second highest mortality rates of any mental health illness due to physical risks and elevated risk of suicide, second only to substance use disorders.""The prevalence of eating disorders among servicemembers and their families is unacceptable,""said Senator Tillis. ""Congress must provide our men and women in uniform with the right tools to combat eating disorders, and I'm proud to reintroduce the SERVE Act with Senator Shaheen to improve access and care for those affected.""“Our servicemembers deserve the highest quality health care to help heal both physical and mental wounds,” said Senator Shaheen. “I’m proud to reintroduce legislation that recognizes our servicemembers’ mental health matters just as much as physical health by expanding TRICARE coverage of eating disorder treatments for servicemembers, retirees and their dependents. We owe a great debt to our military for the sacrifices that come with service, and offering them the assistance they need to stay healthy must be our top priority.”“The EDC is thrilled to see the Senate version of the Supporting Eating Disorders Recovery Through Vital Expansion (SERVE) Act introduced today in the United States Senate,” said EDC Board President Chase Bannister, MDIV, MSW, LCSW, CEDS. “This legislation will help military family members access the eating disorders care they need and deserve, and require the Secretary of Defense, DoD, and VA to take steps to improve the identification and treatment of servicemembers affected by eating disorders.”Specifically, the Supporting Eating Disorders Recovery Through Vital Expansion (SERVE) Act would:·       Clarify that under TRICARE, eating disorders treatment shall be provided to beneficiaries without age limitations when medically necessary.·       Require the Secretary of Defense to take steps to identify, treat, and rehabilitate servicemembers affected by eating disorders.·       Direct the Department of Defense to establish clinical practice guidelines on eating disorder treatment.The SERVE Act is also cosponsored by Senators Mazie Hirono (D-HI) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV).###"

Given the outstanding questions about his judgment and policy views, I cannot support his confirmation.”###"
https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2021/2/sens-tillis-and-leahy-and-reps-jeffries-and-mace-reintroduce-bipartisan-bicameral-legislation-supporting-creative-students,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Representatives Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Nancy Mace (R-SC) reintroduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation that directs the Register of Copyrights to waive the copyright registration fee for winners of the Congressional Art Competition and the Congressional App Competition. Currently, the Register of Copyrights, Shira Perlmutter, does not have the authority to waive the registration fee. The Senate passed this legislation unanimously in 2019. Both of these competitions, sponsored and led by the House of Representatives, encourage talented students to engage in the arts and coding. These students are recognized by each district and for the winners of the Congressional Art Competition, their work is displayed in the tunnel between the House office buildings.“Every year, talented students across the country participate in the Congressional Art Competition and the Congressional App Competition, with the winners displaying their work in the United States Capitol,” said Senator Tillis. “I was pleased that the Senate passed this legislation unanimously last Congress, and I have had ongoing conversations about what more Washington needs to do to incentivize copyright registration. Introducing these talented students to the benefits of copyright protection is an excellent place to start.”“Paving the way for and inspiring the next generation of creators is fundamental to both American innovation and the arts,” said Senator Leahy. “This bill will ensure that winners of the Congressional App and Art competitions will have their original works protected regardless of their financial abilities, and I’m proud to support it.”""The commonsense, bipartisan ARTS Act will support student creators, help ignite their passions and allow them to dream big,” Said Congressman Jeffries. “Those creators are our future, and I thank my colleagues for their leadership.""“Every year, Congress urges young people from across the country to pour their heart and soul into the Congressional Art and Congressional App Competitions,” said Congresswoman Mace. “These students come from all walks of life and backgrounds. Leave it to government to charge the kids to protect their work. Give me a break!”###"
