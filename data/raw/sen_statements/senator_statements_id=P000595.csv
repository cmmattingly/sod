https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-statement-on-senate-republicans-blocking-legislation-to-codify-roe-v-wade,"Peters Spoke on Senate Floor Yesterday in Support of the Women’s Health Protection Act; Shared Personal Family Story with AbortionWASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI) today released the following statement after Senate Republicans blocked the U.S. Senate from advancing the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would codify Roe V. Wade at the federal level:“Overturning Roe v. Wade would have immediate, tragic and disastrous consequences for people in Michigan and across the country. Accessing an abortion and making extremely personal health care decisions has been a fundamental right for half a century – and taking it away would put lives at risk. This issue is not abstract or theoretical, and that’s why I shared my family’s abortion story, because families across the country go through these heartbreaking experiences every day.“Despite Senate Republicans blocking us from moving forward on this critical legislation to codify Roe v. Wade, we cannot give up. While Republicans are preparing legislation to make abortion illegal across the country and impose cruel new restrictions, banning exceptions for rape, incest or life of the mother, I remain as resolved as ever — and will continue fighting to protect women’s health care and keeping these decisions between a woman and her doctor.” To watch video of Peters speaking on the steps of the U.S. Capitol after Republicans blocked a bill to codify Roe v. Wade, click here.Peters spoke on the Senate floor last night in support of the Women’s Health Protection Act and shared his family’s abortion story. Peters was the first Senator to share his personal family story with abortion in October 2020 during the confirmation process of Amy Coney Barrett. He again recently told his story in a roundtable with four colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives, as the stakes have never been higher for women’s access to this critical health care. ###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/video-on-senate-floor-peters-urges-passage-of-womens-health-protection-act-and-shares-family-abortion-story,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI) today delivered remarks on the Senate floor in support of the Women’s Health Protection Act and shared his family’s personal abortion story. The Women’s Health Protection Act would protect against dangerous state laws that limit health care professionals’ ability to carry out and provide essential reproductive health care services by codifying Roe V. Wade into law.Peters was the first and only Senator to share his personal family story with abortion – which he shared again recently as the U.S. Supreme Court considers a case that would severely undermine a key right that women and families have relied on for over 50 years. “Right now, we may see a Supreme Court come out with a decision to basically end Roe v. Wade, and in the process, end a fundamental right that women in this country have had available to them for 50 years.” said Senator Peters. “…Let's preserve the right of women to do what they think is best. That's why we have to pass the Women's Health Protection Act – and why I would urge all my colleagues to search their heart and listen to the stories that people will tell them and understand that the right thing to do is to protect reproductive freedoms and rights in America.” To watch video of Senator Peters’ remarks on the Senate floor, click here.The Women’s Health Protection Act would enact a federal law that would make any targeted restrictions against medical providers who carry out this critical work unlawful. Specifically, it would create a statutory right for health care providers to provide abortion care, and a corresponding right for their patients to receive that care, free from medically unnecessary restrictions that single out abortion and impede access.Below are Senator Peters’ full remarks, as delivered:“Madam President, I also rise to speak about the need to pass the Women's Health Protection Act. Certainly the Senator from Maryland outlined a very strong argument as to why this fundamental protection – this fundamental right – needs to be protected.“And we know that right now, we may see a Supreme Court come out with a decision to basically end Roe versus Wade, and in the process end a fundamental right that women in this country have had available to them for 50 years.“You know, we can hear all the arguments, and my colleagues will present an awful lot of arguments tonight and tomorrow as to why we need to pass this Act. But for me, this is personal, a personal experience that I have had.“And it's an experience that unfortunately, many, many families have.“In fact, as I've shared this story, I've been really overwhelmed by people reaching out to me and saying that they too had a very similar story and how me talking about it brought out their willingness to share the experience as well.“And in addition to that, they understand how important it is that we protect Roe versus Wade, and we protect the right for women to make critical decisions for themselves along with their doctor and not have politics interfere with those decisions.“So my story involves my first wife, when she was pregnant with a child that we very much wanted. We were looking forward to have a second child.“And then in the fourth month – towards the end of the fourth month – her water broke. Clearly a very dangerous situation.“She went to go see her physician. Her physician examined her and said, ‘With this water breaking the amniotic fluid has now left the uterus. There's no way the baby can survive in this situation.’ But he examined her – there was a very faint heartbeat. So he says ‘there's a faint heartbeat here but there's no way this this this baby's going survive. What I think will happen is you're going to have a miscarriage. So go home tonight. And you'll have a miscarriage and then come in and see me tomorrow.’“Well, you can imagine the anguish the horrible evening and despair that she was in and I was in. It was a long, long night.“The next morning nothing happened. She went back to the physician – we went back to the physician – examined her again and said, ‘Well, I'm really surprised I don't know why this – you didn't miscarry.’ Because it's clear that there's no way this baby can survive in this situation. The amniotic fluid is gone. The cushion is gone.“But he goes, ‘You know, I don't think I can do anything because there's still a faint heartbeat here. I don't know why they're still a faint heartbeat. So go home again tonight. I think tonight is going to be the night you have a miscarriage.’“We went back again. It didn't happen. Another horrible night. Horrible. The mental anguish is intense. And families who've gone through this know exactly what I'm talking about.“We went the next day. Again, the examiner, he goes, ‘I can't understand this.’ He goes, ‘But you know this is going on, I'm really worried that there's going to be an infection here. There isn't the protection there. But you could go into septic shock and your health is definitely in danger here.’“Again, the baby can't survive. In fact, without the amniotic fluid and the cushion your baby could lose its limbs – and the horrible, horrible, nightmarish kind of thoughts in our mind.“So he says ‘You know, I’m going to go to the hospital. And I'm going to say even though there's a faint heartbeat, this is a medical necessity that we have to do d and c abortion here to protect your health. And potentially your life if we don't take care of this. So I'll go the hospital, go home. And I'll call you let you know when I can bring you in.’“Well, he called it – and I'll never forget the voicemail that was left. He goes, ‘You know, I'm really sorry to say this. I went to the hospital board. I explained the medical necessity here. I understand what you're going through how we have to take care of this because it could clearly be a serious situation if you go into septic shock. And the board said no. As long as there was a faint heartbeat. You can't perform this procedure.’“And then he goes, “There is no reason for this decision from the hospital board. It is not based on sound medicine. It's not based on medical practice, it's not based on what's best for your health. This is based on politics, plain and simple. This is politics.’“And he goes, ‘I'm ashamed that this happened. And I'm embarrassed that I have to call you and tell you I can't do it because the hospital will not grant me privileges to do it.’“So he says, ‘My advice to you is find a doctor now – immediately – that can take care of this procedure.’“Well, you can imagine how scary that is. How frightening that is, and what we're going through, like, ‘Who do we call in that situation?’“Now, we were fortunate in the fact that we had a friend who was a hospital administrator at another hospital. And he got us in to see the gynecologist – OBGYN – at the hospital to examine her. We went in there and he examined her and he said, ‘Oh my gosh, I have to do this procedure now, there is no more time, this is getting incredibly dangerous. We have to do the d and c abortion.’“He said, ‘You're about to go – this infection is starting – it's going to get worse. If I don't do this quickly, you're going to lose your uterus. And if we don't do it quickly, you could very well lose your life with the infection that can occur here.’“So he immediately performed the procedure.“But just think of that. If we didn't have the opportunity to see another doctor who was able to perform it – understood the severity of it – my wife, at the time, my former wife could have easily lost a uterus, have severe significant health impacts and could have lost her life.“And it just kept ringing in my mind what that doctor said: this is about politics. This is not about what's good medicine, medical practice, this is not about caring about someone's health and caring about their life. It was about politics.“And that is why we have to protect Roe versus Wade, we have to protect the right for women to control their bodies – to control their reproductive health. It cannot be a decision made by politicians here in this in this body or other places.“And this is a real situation that families face. As I mentioned the outpouring of folks who have come to me that have had similar situations.“And I think about Michigan right now – Michigan has a law on the books that was written in 1931 that says all abortion is prohibited in our state. It doesn't matter whether or not it's involves the health of the mother, doesn't matter if it's the life of the mother, doesn't matter if a woman is the victim of rape or incest. It's just simply not allowed.“Well I think that's unconscionable. And that's what will happen. It's a real-life situation that could happen if the court decides to go forward and reverse Roe vs. Wade.“Situations like what my former wife went through and families all across America will be not able to have that kind of option. And you think about the no exception for rape or incest that you'll have a 17 year old girl in Michigan who is raped, she will have no options.“I know a majority of people in the United States believe that is unacceptable. I know a majority of people in the United States believe that women have the right to make these most personal – these most intimate – decisions themselves with the advice of their physician and whoever else that they want to consult.“This is not about politics. This is not about the opinions of folks who think that they know better.“Let's preserve the right of women to do what they think is best. That's why we have to pass the Women's Health Protection Act – and why I would urge all my colleagues to search their heart and listen to the stories that people will tell them and understand that the right thing to do is to protect reproductive freedoms and rights in America.”###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/video-peters-introduces-michigander-bridget-brink-at-confirmation-hearing-to-be-next-us-ambassador-to-ukraine,"At Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Peters Highlights Ambassador Brink’s Upbringing in Michigan, Extensive and Accomplished Career in U.S. Foreign ServiceWASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI) today introduced Ambassador Bridget Brink before the Senator Foreign Relations Committee, as part of her confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine. Brink – a Michigan native who has spent her career in the U.S. Foreign Service and is currently U.S. Ambassador to Slovakia – was nominated by President Biden to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine in April.“Ambassador Brink will be charged not just with supporting our Ukrainian partners in the immediate fight against the Russian invasion, but also in the recovery and rebuilding phases after,” said Peters, a former Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “As someone who was working in U.S. Embassies during conflict in the Balkans, and in Tblisi after the Rose Revolution, Ambassador Brink knows what it takes. Her leadership is more vital than ever.”“I am proud to recognize Ambassador Brink for her extraordinary professional achievements and to congratulate her on this opportunity to serve her country,” Peters continued. “Her success will be our country’s success and I can’t think of anybody more equipped for this position, and it’s why I encourage her swift confirmation.”  To watch video of Peters’ introductory remarks, click here.Ambassador Bridget Brink – a Michigan native from East Grand Rapids – is a career member of the U.S. Senior Foreign Service and currently serves as the U.S. Ambassador to the Slovakia. Prior to that, Brink served as Senior Advisor and Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs at the U.S. Department of State, responsible for issues related to Eastern Europe and the Caucasus. She also served as Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassies in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, and Tbilisi, Georgia.Brink began her twenty-five-year career in the Foreign Service in Belgrade, Serbia, and has since been focused on advancing U.S. policy in Europe and Eurasia. She was the Director for the Aegean and the South Caucasus at the National Security Council and served in the State Department as the Deputy Director for Southern European Affairs, Special Assistant to the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, and Cyprus Desk Officer.Brink is the recipient of numerous performance awards. She holds Master’s degrees in International Relations and Political Theory from the London School of Economics and Political Science, as well as a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science from Kenyon College.Below is the text of Senator Peters’ remarks, as prepared for delivery:“Thank you Chairman Menendez and Ranking Member Risch. It is my honor to introduce Ambassador Bridget Brink to the Committee.“I also want to recognize Ambassador Brink’s family with her today – her husband Nick, who is also serving our country as a diplomat, and her two sons Jack and Cole. Like our servicemembers and their families, our diplomats do not serve alone. As every member of this Committee knows, their families often go unrecognized as our diplomats perform their crucial work in foreign lands thousands of miles from their country, so we thank them all for their service.“Ambassador Brink was born and raised in East Grand Rapids and graduated from East Grand Rapids High School in Michigan. Growing up she remembers driving by a sign that proudly recognized her hometown as the home of President Gerald Ford. President Ford’s decency, integrity, and humility served as a marker for the Midwest values that Ambassador Brink lives by. And Ambassador Brink still keeps Michigan very close to her heart, visiting family in West Michigan every year. Although she’s lived all across the globe through her career, she will tell you that her favorite place in the entire world to visit is the shoreline of Lake Michigan.“And that makes sense. As I have always said, the Great Lakes are more than a national treasure to Michiganders, they are ingrained in our DNA. Clearly the Great Lakes are in Ambassador Brink’s DNA as well.“Now, Ambassador Brink will have an opportunity to uphold those Michigan values at a time of incredible upheaval in Ukraine. And I know Ambassador Brink is ready for the challenge.“She is a seasoned diplomat who first joined the State Department in 1996 and has spent her career in places like Georgia, Serbia, Slovakia and Uzbekistan. Places where she learned the intricate dynamics that underpin much of the Post-Soviet order in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and where she learned early on how Russia chooses to treat its neighbors.“Ambassador Brink will be charged not just with supporting our Ukrainian partners in the immediate fight against the Russian invasion, but also in the recovery and rebuilding phases after. As someone who was working in U.S. Embassies during the conflict in the Balkans, and in Tblisi after the Rose Revolution, Ambassador Brink knows what it takes. Her leadership is more vital than ever. And her service across five administrations is fitting tribute to the apolitical service to country that we expect from our civil servants.“I am proud to recognize Ambassador Brink for her extraordinary professional achievements and to congratulate her on this opportunity to serve her country. Her success will be our country’s success and I can’t think of anybody more equipped for this position, and it’s why I encourage her swift confirmation. Thank you for this opportunity to introduce an absolutely extraordinary woman.”###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-recognized-by-non-partisan-lugar-center-as-one-of-the-most-bipartisan-senators,"Ranked 5th-Most Bipartisan Senator, 3rd-Most Bipartisan Democrat for His Work in 2021WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI) was recognized as the 5th-most bipartisan Senator — and 3rd-most bipartisan Democrat — in new rankings released by the non-partisan Lugar Center and McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University for his work in 2021. This follows Peters’ recognition as the #1 most effective Senator in the 116th Congress by the non-partisan Center for Effective Lawmaking. Peters earned the effectiveness recognition based on his ability to enact and advance bipartisan legislation – despite the fact that he was serving in only his first term and was in the minority party at the time.“Michiganders expect me to work across the aisle to get things done, and my top priority has been finding common ground to solve problems and deliver results for the people I represent. The best way to achieve that goal is by working with members of both parties, and I’m proud of my bipartisan record,” said Senator Peters. “Our nation faces enormous challenges that require both commonsense and innovative solutions. That is why I will continue working with all of my colleagues to improve the lives of people in Michigan and across the nation.”The Lugar Center established the Bipartisan Index to measure how often Members of Congress work across party lines, including the frequency with which a member reaches across the aisle when bills are introduced. It examines the number of times a member cosponsors legislation introduced by the other party and how often a member’s own legislation attracts cosponsors from the other party. The late and former U.S. Senator Dick Lugar described the Lugar Center’s Bipartisan Index by writing in an op-ed, “The aim of the Index is to highlight members’ willingness to get results, regardless of party.”Peters led and cosponsored many bipartisan legislative efforts that are now law. Last year he led and advanced a number of bipartisan provisions, including measures to:Protect the Great Lakes and Bolster Disaster Response and PreparednessStrengthen CybersecurityPostal Service ReformSupport First RespondersSave Taxpayer Dollars and Improve Government EfficiencyInvest in Domestic Manufacturing ###"

MARIE, MI – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, toured the Sherman Park beachfront in Sault Ste. Marie and highlighted the $500 million he secured in the bipartisan infrastructure law to fund a loan program he created to help communities in Michigan and across the nation invest in resilient infrastructure projects that will protect against coastal erosion, rising water levels, and severe flooding. This is the first funding for the program created by Peters’ Safeguarding Tomorrow through Ongoing Risk Mitigation (STORM) Act, which was signed into law last year. With the new funding Peters secured, the program will help states establish revolving loan funds that can be used to support local infrastructure projects to protect against natural disasters that have put homes, small businesses, property, and communities at risk, and caused millions of dollars in damages. Peters was joined by Sault Ste. Marie Mayor Don Gerrie and Executive Director for the Sault Convention & Visitors Bureau Linda Hoath. “The endless beachfronts like the one here at Sherman Park are essential to the tourism industry and local economy in the Soo and across Michigan. For years, I have heard from communities across our state that they need more federal support to help protect residents, homes, and small businesses from the impacts of coastal erosion and rising water levels on the Great Lakes,” said Senator Peters. “That is why I helped create a low-cost loan programs through the STORM Act, and the funding I secured will ensure these communities can access resources to help them build more resilient infrastructure that can withstand erosion and other natural hazards for years to come.” “Coastal erosion continues to damage homes and businesses, highlighting why communities like ours need help to invest in projects that will mitigate the effects of rising water levels and coastal erosion. I’m thankful to Senator Peters for his efforts to create and secure funding for a loan program that will allow cities like ours to build resilient infrastructure that will keep our residents safe,” said Mayor Gerrie. “The beachfront at Sherman Park is an essential part of the community in Sault Ste. Marie and I appreciate Senator Peters for his tireless work to ensure we can keep our coastlines like this one pristine for years to come.”  “Sault Ste Marie’s tourism industry is critical to supporting our economy and small businesses. When coastal erosion damages local attractions – like Sherman Park’s beach front – it threatens our local businesses and employees that depend on tourism for their livelihoods,” said Linda Hoath. “I am grateful to Senator Peters for his tireless work to create a low-cost loan program, and secure funding for it, so that communities like Sault Ste Marie can invest in mitigation efforts and protect our local economies in a cost-effective manner.” During the walking tour, Peters saw firsthand how these resources could help Sault Ste. Marie update their current infrastructure and invest in new structures like sea walls, breakers and barriers that will improve the city’s ability to address coastal erosion and rising water levels that damage property and businesses. The loan program and funding for Peters’ STORM Act will allow local governments to access needed funds to make critical infrastructure upgrades and help mitigate the impact of natural disasters in a more cost-effective way. Studies have shown that resilience and mitigation spending saves taxpayers an average of $6 for every $1 invested. Unlike existing Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants, the low-interest loans created by Peters’ STORM Act would allow local governments to invest in resiliency and mitigation projects that reduce the effects of shoreline erosion and rising and high water levels, along with other natural disasters. These loans would reach communities more quickly than FEMA’s traditional grants, and provide local communities with the capital necessary to invest in more resilient infrastructure. To download high-resolution photos from the visit, click here or on the images below.    Images are courtesy of Senator Peters’ office ### "

This comes after Peters recently led a letter with his Senate colleagues to Secretary Buttigieg, highlighting how autonomous vehicles have the potential to not only create good-paying American jobs and support existing ones, but also to save lives and ensure the United States will continue leading in the future of mobility. In his response to Peters, Buttigieg agreed there is economic opportunity in the deployment of autonomous vehicles and echoed that a federal framework is needed to execute the transition safely and in a way that benefits American workers.“The fact of the matter is that one day – I think we all know that cars will be both electric and they will be autonomous as well,” said Senator Peters. “There are really only two open questions… will those cars be made here in America with good-paying jobs, including good-paying union jobs? And second, will we enact policies today that will achieve the best outcomes for workers and the economy and society tomorrow?”“History has taught us that technological change is inevitable,” Peters continued. “While that has produced benefits for society, there’s plenty of examples unfortunately of workers getting left behind as this technology moves forward. I believe we can seize the moment to mold a new pattern – because good jobs and innovation, in my mind, do not have to be mutually exclusive.”Secretary Buttigieg responded, “We very much agree, and like you, are interested in making sure that this transition, whether we’re talking about electric or automated, is principally made in America – that it creates more opportunity. And it can, but we need to provide the right kind of policy framework.”To watch Peters’ exchange with Secretary Buttigieg, click here.As Chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, Peters has repeatedly highlighted how autonomous vehicles present an opportunity to expand domestic manufacturing and create new jobs, while supporting existing transportation jobs—in addition to fostering American innovation. In his field hearing in Detroit this March, Peters examined how Congress can bolster U.S. innovation for electric and autonomous vehicles by increasing domestic production of semiconductor chips and other technologies, while also delivering economic, environmental, and safety benefits for the American people.###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-helps-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-document-and-deter-russian-war-crimes-in-ukraine,"Bipartisan Legislation Overwhelmingly Passed House Last MonthWASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Senate Ukrainian Caucus, helped introduce the Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability Act, which would ensure the U.S. is undertaking coordinated efforts to collect and maintain evidence of war crimes and atrocities committed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Peters helped put forward this bipartisan legislation after recently returning from a congressional delegation to Europe, where he met directly with Ukrainian refugees and discussed the importance of sustaining and strengthening the trans-Atlantic alliance to maintain a forceful response against Russia’s war against Ukraine.“The atrocities we are seeing every single day being committed against innocent Ukrainians are horrendous and unacceptable – and Vladimir Putin and the Russian military must be held accountable for these crimes,” said Senator Peters, former Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Senate Ukrainian Caucus. “This bipartisan legislation will ensure we have the evidence needed so that the Russian government cannot hide behind their crimes. I’m proud to stand with the Ukrainian people against the Russian government’s illegal invasion and will continue working to make sure we have a strong, unified front with Ukraine.” The House version of this legislation passed the House Committee on Foreign Affairs unanimously and was adopted by the full House by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 418-7 last month.The Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability Act would issue a statement of policy and require a report to Congress within 90 days to ensure the U.S. is undertaking coordinated efforts to collect, analyze, and maintain evidence of war crimes and atrocities as defined in the U.S. Code committed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine and to deter the commission of such crimes by making Russian commanders, troops, and leaders aware of efforts to collect evidence and identify those committing these atrocities. The bill focuses on the development and maintenance of evidence and does not specify any specific prosecution venue in which such evidence may be used.### "
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/video-peters-highlights-selfridge-and-need-to-address-pfas-contamination-at-hearing-with-air-force-secretary,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a former Lt. Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve, again secured a commitment from Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall that Selfridge Air National Guard Base will continue to play an important role in the U.S. Air Force’s long-term plans. The renewed commitment – which Peters secured at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing – comes after Peters hosted Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks at Selfridge in December and first secured a long-term commitment from the Department of Defense (DoD) that ensures the base is a key facility to our national security last July.Peters also pressed Secretary Kendall on a letter he sent to DoD regarding their failure to meet major perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) reporting deadlines to Congress and to urge DoD to take additional action to protect Michigan communities from PFAS exposure.“Selfridge is a critical component of our national defense and plays a key role in Michigan’s growing cutting-edge defense capabilities,” said Senator Peters, a former Lt. Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve. “I’ve routinely highlighted Michigan’s military installations, innovation and strategic positioning to the Department of Defense, and this commitment from Secretary Kendall reaffirms the Air Force’s pledge to Michigan for the long-term. As we work to support Michigan’s defense footprint, I’ll also keep pressing to ensure PFAS remediation efforts continue and hold the Defense Department accountable to protect health and safety of Michiganders.” To watch Peters’ questioning at the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing click here. The renewed commitment builds upon Peters’ strong advocacy in Congress for Michigan’s robust and growing defense sector. Peters worked, alongside Senator Debbie Stabenow (MI), to secure significant commitments from the Department of Defense (DoD) including a pledge that Selfridge will continue to play a vital role in the future of our national defense. Peters also helped pass into law a strong national defense law, which included nearly $144 million in investments for military facilities across Michigan that Peters secured, including $28 million in funding for a new A-10 hangar and maintenance facility at Selfridge.In his letter to DoD, which was raised with Secretary Kendall, Peters holds the agency accountable for recently missing two key PFAS reporting deadlines. The first missed deadline was required due to a provision Peters authored into law as part of the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act that encourages DoD to enter into cooperative agreements with states regarding the testing and remediation of PFAS contamination. Peters’ provision also requires DoD to report to Congress if a cooperative agreement is not reached within one year of the request from the state. On March 31, 2021, Governor Whitmer invoked Peters’ provision and requested DoD meet Michigan’s PFAS standards at all DoD linked contamination sites. DoD has yet to respond to Governor Whitmer’s request and therefore missed the March 31, 2022 congressional reporting deadline. Peters is now calling on DoD to explain their resistance to enter into an agreement with the State of Michigan and promptly establish a timeline for finalizing the agreement.Additionally, DoD missed the March 1, 2022 deadline for reporting to Congress on the status of PFAS remediation efforts at 50 priority military installations, including the K.I. Sawyer and Wurtsmith Air Force Bases in Michigan. As a result, Peters urges DoD to prioritize using the most stringent PFAS standards, whether they be local, state, or federal, when it releases its cleanup plans and timelines.You can read full text of this letter here.###"

Peters was the first and only Senator to share his personal family story with abortion – which he discussed previously on MSNBC in October 2020 during the Amy Coney Barrett confirmation process. ELLE Magazine Excerpt:“With abortion rights under attack, ELLE brought together five members of Congress perhaps most qualified to discuss the issue—because they’ve been there themselves.“It’s been nearly 50 years since the Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade established the constitutional right to have an abortion in the United States. Today, millions of Americans are facing a potential future without that protection. It was reported on Monday that the Supreme Court has already privately voted to strike down Roe, per a leak of the initial draft majority opinion obtained by Politico. If the decision gets published as-is, most likely this summer, around half the states in the country are poised to ban abortion. Over the last few years, states have been passing ‘trigger laws,’ which make abortion illegal as soon as the Court allows it. Some states have also been voting in favor of a record number of other restrictions, including imposing patient waiting periods, burdening clinics with costly and medically unnecessary requirements aimed at shutting them down, and the policy du jour among Republicans: banning abortions at various points pre-viability—as early as six weeks, before most people even know they are pregnant. “Abortion remains legal, for now. But as we prepare for a nation without Roe, ELLE brought together five members of Congress who have been open about their personal experiences with abortion: “Representatives Cori Bush, Pramila Jayapal, Barbara Lee, and Jackie Speier, and Senator Gary Peters. The members gathered at the U.S. Capitol in February to discuss how to protect abortion access. Of the 536 members of the current Congress, these five are the only ones to have gone on the record with their abortion stories; there are likely many more, given that recent estimates have found that nearly one in four women in the U.S. will have an abortion in their lifetime. “These members chose to participate in ELLE’s historic roundtable discussion because they know the power that comes from making the political personal. In sharing their own stories, they are giving a voice to the hundreds of thousands of people who, each year, for hundreds of thousands of reasons, choose to have an abortion. Abortion patients are your neighbors, your friends, your colleagues, and, yes, even your elected officials. Below, in their own words, they discuss why abortion rights are so essential. Link to ELLE Magazine video here. Sen. Peters: [My then-wife and I] were expecting a second child, a child that we wanted and were looking forward to bringing into the world. But toward the end of the second trimester, her water broke. We knew something was really wrong. The physician said, “There’s no way this fetus can survive.” But because there was a faint fetal heartbeat, he had to get approval from the hospital board. And I’ll never forget listening to the message on the answering machine as he said, “I’m very sorry to say the hospital refused my request.” He said he was fearful that my wife had an infection, and that if she waited any longer to have an abortion she could lose her uterus. He said, “If you wait even longer, you’ll lose your life.” We were fortunate a friend of ours is an administrator at a different hospital, and he was able to get us in immediately. Peters: I was surprised at how many men came to me as well that said, “I went through this as well with my wife.” We don’t talk about it, but because we don’t talk about it, and we keep it in ourselves, it just eats away at us as well. It’s such a complex issue. It’s such an intensely personal issue, and to have politics get in the middle of it—to get hard-and-fast rules make decisions for people in one of the most vulnerable times that they will probably ever have in their life—is simply unacceptable. For full story click here.This conversation has been abridged and edited for clarity.

https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-holds-defense-department-accountable-for-missing-major-pfas-reporting-deadlines-urges-prompt-updates-to-congress-and-additional-action-to-protect-michigan-communities-from-exposure,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, is leading efforts to hold the Department of Defense (DoD) accountable for missing major perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) reporting deadlines to Congress and to urge DoD to take additional action to protect Michigan communities from PFAS exposure – including at sites like the decommissioned Wurtsmith and K.I. Sawyer Airforce Bases, as well as Camp Grayling. Peters addressed each of these concerns in two separate letters to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and requested the Department of Defense provide updates by the end of this month. In an Armed Services Committee hearing today, Peters pressed Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall on DoD’s missed deadlines and the Secretary’s personal PFAS-related priorities.“Michigan communities and families and our military are being harmed by PFAS contamination. While we’ve made progress on identifying and working toward mitigating these dangerous chemicals, it’s entirely unacceptable the Department of Defense missed key reporting deadlines required by law and has failed to implement detailed clean-up measures,” said Senator Peters. “It’s essential that Congress, our servicemembers and our local communities have a clear understanding how the Department of Defense is addressing this urgent environmental and public health issue. I’ll continue to press for answers and seek accountability to ensure PFAS remediation efforts prioritize the health and safety of Michiganders and all Americans.”In his first letter, Peters holds DoD accountable for recently missing two key PFAS reporting deadlines, which he raised directly with Air Force Secretary Kendall in a Senate Armed Services committee hearing today. The first missed deadline was required due to a provision Peters authored into law with Senator Debbie Stabenow as part of the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act that encourages DoD to enter into cooperative agreements with states regarding the testing and remediation of PFAS contamination. Peters’ provision also requires DoD to report to Congress if a cooperative agreement is not reached within one year of the request from the state. On March 31, 2021, Governor Whitmer invoked Peters’ provision and requested DoD meet Michigan’s PFAS standards at all DoD linked contamination sites. DoD has yet to respond to Governor Whitmer’s request and therefore missed the March 31, 2022 congressional reporting deadline. Peters is now calling on DoD to explain their resistance to enter into an agreement with the State of Michigan and promptly establish a timeline for finalizing the agreement.Additionally, DoD missed the March 1, 2022 deadline for reporting to Congress on the status of PFAS remediation efforts at 50 priority military installations, including the K.I. Sawyer and Wurtsmith Air Force Bases in Michigan. As a result, Peters urges DoD to prioritize using the most stringent PFAS standards, whether they be local, state, or federal, when it releases its cleanup plans and timelines.You can read full text of this letter here.In his second letter, Peters addresses concerns regarding elevated PFAS contamination levels surrounding the Camp Grayling Joint Maneuver Training Center. In May 2017, DoD officials first identified PFAS in Grayling groundwater above EPA health advisory levels. Since then, roughly 400 residential and groundwater monitoring wells have exceeded acceptable PFAS levels in the surrounding area. In July 2021, the DoD Office of Inspector General (OIG) included Camp Grayling in a report on the DoD’s efforts to control PFAS contamination. That report concluded that Camp Grayling’s handling of PFAS containments may be exposing people and the environment to preventable risks.Recently, DoD noted that 128 off-installation residential drinking water wells adjacent to Grayling Army Airfield were sampled for PFOS/PFOA and one well exceeded the EPA Health Advisory levels. In response to this public health threat to the surrounding community, Peters is calling on DoD to provide additional details on actions to keep residents safe and drinking water clean.You can read full text of this letter here.These actions build on Peters’ long-term efforts to address PFAS contamination in Michigan and across the country. In December, Peters convened a hearing to examine how servicemembers, their families and communities in Michigan and across the country have been harmed by exposure to toxic PFAS connected to military sites and raised the need to hold DoD accountable for their failure to act.Peters’ bill to help protect firefighters and emergency responders from PFAS exposure in the line of duty has passed the Senate. Peters also helped pass the bipartisan infrastructure law, which invests in clean drinking water and includes dedicated funding to address PFAS contamination. He supported or led provisions in the 2019 national defense bill banning the Department of Defense from purchasing firefighting foams containing PFAS. The bill also immediately prohibited the use of firefighting foams containing PFAS in military training exercises, and enhanced state cooperation with the Department of Defense regarding clean-up due to PFAS contamination stemming from military-related activities.In September 2018, Peters helped convene the first hearing on PFAS contamination in the Senate, assessing the federal response to contamination and remediation. He then convened a field summit in Grand Rapids in November 2018 to shine a light on how the local, state and federal governments are coordinating their response to PFAS.###"

https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-highlights-need-for-autonomous-vehicle-federal-framework-to-support-future-of-mobility,"In a Peters-Led Letter with Colleagues, Peters Highlights How Autonomous Vehicles Have Potential to Bolster Jobs & Save Lives, Presses for Department of Transportation to Engage on New Mobility TechnologiesWASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), Chair of the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, today pressed for a need to develop a comprehensive federal framework for autonomous vehicles. In a letter with colleagues to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), Peters highlighted how autonomous vehicles have the potential to not only create good-paying American jobs and support existing ones, but also to save lives and ensure the United States will continue leading in the future of mobility – and how there’s an opportunity for DOT to develop sound policy on a multi-faceted issue that impacts American competitiveness. Peters recently held a field hearing in Detroit on the future of the American auto industry and has continued conversations with stakeholders on developing policy that safely allows autonomous vehicle innovation to continue.“Autonomous vehicles hold great promise to deliver significant benefits for all Americans—but only if the federal government puts the necessary policies in place to achieve these benefits,” wrote Peters and his colleagues. “The federal government has the opportunity and responsibility to foster a domestic autonomous vehicle industry that is as safe as it is innovative, and that provides high-quality jobs across the economy, including in transportation”“As we look to the century ahead, the pace of innovation will only continue to accelerate, with significant implications for mobility, workers, the economy and society at large…Yet, we lag behind in shaping a regulatory framework that will foster this innovation while simultaneously protecting and encouraging all of the important benefits we believe autonomous vehicles are capable of delivering,” the Senators continued. “Our competitors on the global stage—particularly the Chinese government—have significantly invested in autonomous and connected vehicle technologies. That’s why securing the benefits associated with autonomous vehicles while lifting up our communities and workers will require a nuanced—and proactive—approach to policymaking… that is all the more reason why the federal government must engage on these issues now.”As Chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, Peters has repeatedly highlighted how autonomous vehicles present an opportunity to expand domestic manufacturing and create new jobs, while supporting existing transportation jobs—in addition to fostering American innovation. In his field hearing in Detroit last month, Peters examined how Congress can bolster U.S. innovation for electric and autonomous vehicles by increasing domestic production of semiconductor chips and other technologies, while also delivering economic, environmental, and safety benefits for the American people.Peters was joined on the letter by U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (MI), Raphael Warnock (GA), John Hickenlooper (CO), Mark Kelly (AZ), Bob Casey (CO), Jacky Rosen (NV), Mark Warner (VA), Jon Ossoff (GA), Alex Padilla (CA), Michael Bennet (CO) and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ).The full letter can be found below, or click here.Dear Secretary Buttigieg:Autonomous vehicles hold great promise to deliver significant benefits for all Americans—but only if the federal government puts the necessary policies in place to achieve these benefits. The federal government has the opportunity and responsibility to foster a domestic autonomous vehicle industry that is as safe as it is innovative, and that provides high-quality jobs across the economy, including in transportation. Our shared aim in meeting those goals were reflected in the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (USDOT) recently announced Innovation Principles. Like you, we believe that innovation, good American jobs—including union jobs—safety, equity, and environmental protection are not mutually exclusive, but should instead be our goal as we strive to shape technological progress in this country.Over the last hundred years, innovation in the transportation industry has been one of the largest drivers of human progress, providing tens of millions of jobs in all fifty states, supporting working families, enhancing safety, and strengthening environmental protections. This has required a collective effort of the public and private sectors, including the federal government, industry, unions, and other stakeholders.As we look to the century ahead, the pace of innovation will only continue to accelerate, with significant implications for mobility, workers, the economy and society at large—especially when it comes to our goals for growing the economy, increasing the number and quality of manufacturing and frontline transportation jobs, and maintaining existing good jobs in transit, freight, logistics, and passenger transportation. Yet, we lag behind in shaping a regulatory framework that will foster this innovation while simultaneously protecting and encouraging all of the important benefits we believe autonomous vehicles are capable of delivering.  As you know, the data shows that deaths on the nation’s roadways were up 12 percent in the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. This is a trend in the wrong direction. With an appropriate regulatory framework, autonomous vehicles have the potential to help reduce deaths and injuries from crashes, especially since they are not susceptible to one of the biggest safety risks on the road: impaired driving. And they can play a role in advancing numerous aspects of your recently announced National Roadway Safety Strategy.Autonomous vehicles may also improve equitable access to transportation by opening up options for people with disabilities or mobility challenges, as well as for areas that lack adequate transportation services. Furthermore, autonomous vehicles can reduce the need for parking in towns and cities, giving communities greater flexibility to provide more bike lanes, wider sidewalks, safer streets, and other features that improve quality of life for all road users. None of these benefits can be taken for granted; nor can we assume the United States will remain a leader in this arena. Our competitors on the global stage—particularly the Chinese government—have significantly invested in autonomous and connected vehicle technologies. That’s why securing the benefits associated with autonomous vehicles while lifting up our communities and workers will require a nuanced—and proactive—approach to policymaking. There are significant technical and economic challenges at hand. But that is all the more reason why the federal government must engage on these issues now.To that end, we respectfully request your insights regarding the following questions about how USDOT plans to address autonomous vehicles:1. What specific actions is USDOT considering in the near term regarding autonomous vehicles? What existing statutory authorities will USDOT consider using to maintain the nation’s leadership in developing and manufacturing autonomous vehicles here in the United States?2. In concert with other agencies as well as workers and relevant stakeholders, how and when will USDOT consider how transportation policy, especially around automation, will impact jobs and the future of work?3. What are your plans to modernize Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) to account for the rise of autonomous vehicles? What tools does USDOT have, or need, to enable data collection activities in order to inform future standards around autonomous vehicles?4. Regarding your current authority to exempt motor vehicles from FMVSS, how will you evaluate applications from manufacturers seeking to leverage this authority as an interim solution? What is USDOT doing to provide clarity about the timeline and procedures for the review process so stakeholders can plan accordingly?How and when will USDOT collaborate with state and local governments, in addition to legal experts and relevant stakeholders, to contemplate the implications of federal autonomous vehicle policies for State law regarding licensing, liability, and related issues?Thank you for your attention to these important issues. We look forward to continuing to work with you in building on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to craft transportation policy that improves the lives of the American people. ###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-announces-bipartisan-legislation-to-strengthen-network-security_,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, announced bipartisan legislation to strengthen and secure our communications systems, which are critical to our economic competiveness and national security. The Communications Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Act, which was introduced with Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS), would require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to permanently establish the Communications Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council (Council). The Council is responsible for advising the FCC on issues related to network security, resiliency, and interoperability of our communications systems. The Council has been re-chartered on a temporary basis every two years since 2009. This legislation would authorize the Council in statute, providing a permanent basis to continue the Council’s essential work.  “As we work to invest in domestic manufacturing and shore up our supply chains, it’s essential we strengthen our communications networks to protect against evolving threats to this critical infrastructure,” said Senator Peters. “Cyber or terror attacks have the potential to widely disrupt our networks and compromise our ability to communicate – especially in the event of emergencies. That’s why I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation to bolster and secure our communications networks and will work to see it signed into law.”“As the threat of cyberattacks grows, we must remain vigilant in protecting our communications network with the latest technology and safety measures,” said Senator Moran. “Establishing a permanent council at the FCC would preserve a critical space for the government and industry to collaborate on the challenges facing the telecommunications sector, including security threats.”Recommendations made by the Council are critical to public safety and homeland security-related communications matters such as the reliability of communications systems and infrastructure, 911 and emergency alert systems, and national security communications, including law enforcement access to communications. The Council brings together participants with expertise among first responders, private industry, and relevant government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.Companion legislation was introduced in the House by Representatives Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) and Tim Walberg (R-MI) and included in the House-passed economic competitiveness bill. Earlier this month, Peters was appointed to serve among select members of both the Senate and House to negotiate a final economic competitiveness bill that can be enacted into law. Peters will serve on the conference committee that will be tasked with working out differences between the House and Senate-passed economic competitiveness bills.###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-applauds-defense-department-move-to-begin-implementing-his-provision-to-ensure-guardsmen-and-reservists-receive-benefits-theyve-earned-,"Change in Defense Department Policy Was a Result of Peters-Led Bipartisan Provision in Previous National Defense Bill; Will Ensure Guardsmen and Reservists Receive a DD-214 Following Completion of their Service WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI) applauded the Department of Defense’s (DoD) announcement it will take steps toward standardizing service records across U.S. military components. This move by the Defense Department means that DoD will begin implementing a provision Peters passed to provide National Guardsmen and Reservists with the official documentation granted to other servicemembers following their retirement or completion of service. Currently, Reservists do not receive a separation document detailing their service and Guardsmen do not receive the same forms as Active Duty servicemembers after completion of service. The DD-214 form is often required by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and other private sector institutions to certify qualification for benefits. Under the announced DoD policy, Guardsmen and Reservists will receive DD-214-1 forms, which will more accurately document their complete time of service and ensure they receive the military benefits they have earned.“It is simply unacceptable that bureaucratic red tape has prevented Guardsmen and Reservists from receiving the benefits they’ve earned. It’s why I’ve repeatedly pressed this issue on a bipartisan basis to ensure members of the National Guard and Reserve can access their benefits,” said Senator Peters, member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and former Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve. “Particularly throughout the past two years, these servicemembers have stepped up to protect Americans during unprecedented crises – whether it was helping to bolster pandemic response efforts or defend our Capitol during the January 6 attack. I was proud to introduce bipartisan legislation last year to correct this policy oversight – and I’m pleased the Defense Department is building off this effort and taking the much-need and commonsense step to provide our Guardsmen and Reservists with a DD-214 form after leaving the service.”“This critical piece of documentation is not only an official reflection of servicemembers’ time in uniform – it also serves as a gateway to accessing the military benefits they have earned – as DD-214’s are often required by the Department of Veterans Affairs and state agencies to confirm veterans’ qualifications,” Peters continued. “This is an important start – and I’ll continue working to ensure this issue is fully addressed, including by formally codifying this policy into law and establishing a single-tier DD-214 document across all services.”“The Michigan National Guard applauds this positive step forward by the Defense Department – and thanks Senator Peters for spearheading this effort legislatively in Congress,” said Major General Paul D. Rodgers, Adjutant General of the Michigan National Guard. “Providing DD-214’s to our National Guardsmen in Michigan and across the country after completion of their military service will ensure they can receive the benefits they have earned through serving their nation in uniform, promptly and without difficulty. Addressing this issue that has challenged Guardsmen will have real and meaningful impacts on our servicemembers and their families across Michigan.”“With a DD-214 in-hand after leaving the service, National Guardsmen and Reservists across the country will soon be able to access the benefits they’ve earned without hassle and in a timely manner – the same as all other servicemembers,” said retired Brig. Gen. J. Roy Robinson, President of the National Guard Association of the United States. “We are grateful for Senator Peters’ leadership on this issue – and for his continued efforts to pass bipartisan legislation into law that would streamline the service documentation process altogether, and ensure equal support for servicemembers across the active duty and reserve components.”Peters previously introduced bipartisan legislation in May 2019 to help reserve component members of the United States Armed Forces – including members of the Reserves and National Guard – receive the benefits they have earned following their retirement or completion of service. A provision based on this legislation was signed into law as part of the national defense bill in December 2019 – this change announced by DoD was based off this provision. Peters has worked to build off this provision by introducing the bipartisan Record of Military Service for Members of the Armed Forces Act which would establish a single-tier document system so that all servicemembers receive the same all-purpose document and that there’s no difference between the active and reserve components.Peters has long been an advocate for Michigan’s servicemembers and veterans. Last year, Peters was inducted into the Michigan Military and Veterans Hall of Honor for his efforts to support our nation’s veterans and military. In 2017, Peters was recognized as Legislator of the Year by the Vietnam Veterans of America for authoring the bipartisan Fairness for Veterans Act into law. The legislation requires veteran discharge review boards to give liberal consideration to petitions for honorable discharge status if the servicemember has been diagnosed with PTSD, TBI or other related conditions connected to their military service. As of the fall of 2020, more than 1,500 veterans have had their discharges upgraded since his legislation was enacted.Peters also introduced and passed out of the Senate his bipartisan CADETS Act to expand the Student Incentive Payment Program eligibility age for financial assistance to cadets who attended one of the six State Maritime Academies and commit to a post-graduation service obligation to include any qualified student who will meet the age requirements for enlistment in the U.S. Navy Reserve at their time of graduation. In return for their commitment to serve, cadets can receive up to $32,000 in this incentive payment funding over four years to help offset the cost of tuition, uniforms, books, and living costs.Last year, Peters’ bipartisan bill to strengthen transparency and communication for veterans and caregivers participating in the VA’s caregiver program was enacted into law. Also, Peters’ bipartisan legislation to expand apprenticeship opportunities for veterans and allow them to use their GI bill benefits to secure a registered apprenticeship was signed into law in 2020. Peters also fought for and helped secure a measure in the national defense bill to expand the Department of Veterans’ Affairs list of medical conditions associated with Agent Orange exposure to include bladder cancer, hypothyroidism, and Parkinsonism.###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-passes-peters-bipartisan-resolution-supporting-national-safe-digging-month,"Resolution Designates April as National Safe Digging Month to Promote Safety for Homeowners and Utility WorkersDETROIT, MI – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI) applauded the recent Senate passage of his bipartisan resolution designating April as National Safe Digging Month, to build awareness of safe digging practices that protect homeowners and utility workers from damaging underground utility lines during excavation projects. Peters introduced this resolution with U.S. Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Deb Fischer (R-NE).“Every year, underground utility lines are damaged during excavation projects causing interruptions to critical services, harm to the surrounding environment, and often dangerous personal injuries,” said Senator Peters. “I applaud the Common Ground Alliance for their work to establish National Safe Digging Month – and was proud to help build on their efforts by passing this bipartisan resolution that will increase awareness and promote safe practices that keep Michigan homeowners and workers safe.”“Underground utilities are an important part of our country’s infrastructure, but poor preparation for excavation projects can put these lines and those who are digging at great risk,” said Senator Wicker. “I encourage all excavators who are planning a new project to use the 811 hotline to learn more about safe digging practices. Greater awareness of excavation safety can help us take a step toward better protecting homeowners and businesses, and ensuring important services are not interrupted.”“April is the time of year when digging projects large and small begin in earnest, and we truly appreciate that the U.S. Senate has passed the National Safe Digging Month resolution to remind Americans just how critical it is to protect themselves and their communities when excavating,” said Sarah K. Magruder Lyle, CEO and President of the Common Ground Alliance, the national association dedicated to protecting underground utility lines, people who dig near them, and their communities. “Whether digging with a backhoe or a simple shovel, Americans should always contact 811 beforehand to find out the approximate location of buried utilities and avoid striking essential infrastructure that we depend on every day.”“Far too often, we see the tragic results to people, property, and the environment when people fail to call 811,” said Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration Deputy Administrator Tristan Brown. “Hats off to Senators Peters, Fischer, Cantwell and Wicker for their continued leadership in Congress, raising awareness about this important issue, and for their longstanding commitment to improving pipeline safety.”Each year underground utility infrastructures are unintentionally damaged during digging and excavation projects, resulting in service interruption, environmental damage, personal injury, and even death in severe cases. These critical infrastructures includes pipelines, electric, gas, telecommunication, water, sewer, and cable television lines. Established by the Common Ground Alliance, National Safe Digging Month is designed to create awareness of safe digging practices including the “One Call” policy which encourages homeowners and excavators to call “811” to obtain information regarding the location of utility lines. Peters’ resolution designates April as National Safe Digging Month to support safety and awareness efforts – and because April is the beginning of the peak period when excavation projects are carried out around the country.Peters has been a strong supporter of enhancing pipeline safety, specifically to protect the Great Lakes. Peters passed his bipartisan legislation, the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act, into law in 2016, which has helped improve pipeline safety and oversight throughout the country. This legislation additionally included measures to improve the storage of hazardous materials, including directing the Department of Transportation to issue minimum safety standards for the operation and integrity management of underground natural gas storage facilities, as well as a provision to promote mapping technology to help prevent accidental pipeline damage during underground excavations.The full text of the resolution can be found here.###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-helps-confirm-judge-ketanji-brown-jackson-to-us-supreme-court,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI) released the following statement today after helping the Senate confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court with bipartisan support:“This is without question a challenging time not only for the Supreme Court but also for our democracy – and it is clear that Judge Jackson has the extensive experience and qualifications, temperament, impartiality and fidelity to the law that will undoubtedly serve our nation exceptionally well,” said Senator Peters. “I was deeply proud to vote for and help confirm Judge Jackson as our next Supreme Court Justice. This is a moment to recognize Judge Jackson as one of our nation’s brightest legal minds and a historic moment in our nation’s history that will ensure the Supreme Court further reflects the diversity of America.”Peters met last week with Judge Jackson and delivered remarks yesterday on the Senate floor highlighting her exceptional experience, qualifications and support from across the legal spectrum.Judge Jackson, who will be the first African American woman to serve on our nation’s highest court earned extensive and broad support during her confirmation process, including from prominent conservatives across the legal community, national law enforcement organizations such as the International Association of Chiefs of Police, civil rights organizations and the NAACP. The American Bar Association gave her its highest rating of “well qualified.” Judge Jackson was previously confirmed by this Senate three separate times and on a bipartisan basis – most recently last year by this very Senate to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.Before her confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals, Judge Jackson served on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. She was confirmed to the role unanimously and issued more than 500 opinions on cases involving a range of important issues. Jackson additionally has prior experience as a Vice Chair and Commissioner on the U.S. Sentencing Commission, as a federal public defender, as a lawyer in private practice, and as a law clerk at all three levels of the federal Judiciary, including for U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Stephen Breyer.### "
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-selected-to-negotiate-final-economic-competitiveness-bill,"On Conference Committee, Peters Will Be Tasked With Merging House and Senate-Passed Economic Competitiveness Bills; House and Senate-Passed Economic Competitiveness Bills Include Key Provisions Peters Secured to Strengthen Manufacturing & Expand Domestic Semiconductor ProductionWASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, was appointed today to serve among select members of both the Senate and House to negotiate a final economic competitiveness bill that can be enacted into law. Peters will serve on the conference committee that will be tasked with working out differences between the House and Senate-passed economic competitiveness bills. Through this role, Peters will lead the charge in crafting a critical bill to strengthen manufacturing and boost economic competitiveness on the global stage, including to lessen our dependence on foreign competitors like the Chinese government. Once the conference committee completes its work, the final bill will be voted on by the full House and Senate before being sent to the President’s desk to be signed into law.“I have long believed that you can’t be a great country if you don’t make things. A strong economic competitiveness bill is key to ensuring that Michigan and the United States continue to lead in manufacturing through the 21st century and outcompete anyone on the global stage – including the Chinese government,” said Senator Peters. “I’m honored to serve on this key committee tasked with bolstering investments in domestic manufacturing and innovation. I look forward to working in a bipartisan manner on this essential bill and will make it clear that we must expand production of semiconductor chips right here at home to secure our supply chains and be at the forefront of new technologies.”Peters has repeatedly pressed for action to address the ongoing semiconductor shortage that has stymied automotive innovation in recent years, and impacted workers and industries across the country – including the Michigan auto industry. Last month, Peters convened a field hearing in Detroit to examine how Congress can help bolster U.S. innovation for electric and autonomous vehicles by increasing domestic production of semiconductor chips and other technologies, while also delivering economic, environmental, and safety benefits for the American people.Peters secured multiple provisions in the competitiveness package that passed both the Senate and House to bolster U.S. semiconductor production, including a provision with U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (MI) to create a $2 billion supplemental incentive fund to support the domestic production of mature semiconductor technologies in the coming years and ensure that semiconductor projects that support critical manufacturing industries are given priority status, which would include the automotive sector. This is in addition to $50 billion already in the bill to incentivize the production of semiconductors of all kinds in the U.S.—for a total of $52 billion.The competitiveness bill also includes Peters’ bipartisan Investing in Domestic Semiconductor Manufacturing Act, which would ensure that federal incentives to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing include U.S. suppliers that produce the materials and manufacturing equipment that enable semiconductor manufacturing. In doing so, the legislation strengthens the supply chain for semiconductors and bolsters Michigan manufacturers. The package also authorizes increased funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, which has been a priority for Peters. Congress must now work to finalize the competitiveness the bill, negotiating differences between the House and Senate-passed bills, which Peters will play a key role in as a member of the conference committee.Additionally, Peters has raised this supply chain disruption with numerous Biden Administration officials in conversations both before and after President Biden took office – including during a roundtable discussion with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in Michigan. Peters has also introduced and advanced bipartisan legislation in the Senate to streamline federal efforts to strengthen and expand domestic manufacturing of semiconductor chips, and bolster American semiconductor production and supply chains.As Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters has also supported provisions to invest in a responsible federal use of artificial intelligence and provide new skills and opportunities for our federal workforce. Peters is working to help lock in America’s competitive advantage over the Chinese government in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence by leveraging American values, innovation and entrepreneurialism to advance this technology. To do so, Peters’ provision would allow the federal government to harness commercial breakthroughs to improve efficiency, better serve the American people and strengthen American economic competitiveness and national security, while safeguarding privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.The United States faces increasingly sophisticated cyber threats from foreign actors such as China and Russia, and we need a federal workforce that possesses the knowledge, skills, and competencies to counter those threats. To address this, Peters’ provisions would strengthen American competitiveness by investing in the future of the federal workforce – establishing a program to grow federal expertise and interagency coordination on cybersecurity to better meet emerging and mission-critical workforce needs and stay competitive on the global stage.###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/video-on-senate-floor-peters-highlights-support-for-us-supreme-court-justice-nominee-judge-ketanji-brown-jackson,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI) today delivered remarks on the Senate floor in support of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination to be an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. Peters met last week with Judge Jackson and during his remarks today, Peters highlighted her exceptional experience, qualifications and support from across the legal spectrum.“After my one-on-one meeting with Judge Jackson last week, I was convinced she is extraordinarily qualified and prepared to serve on the Supreme Court, particularly in this moment,” said Senator Peters. “During this process, Judge Jackson has not only earned bipartisan support for her confirmation but has the backing of diverse voices – including from the American Bar Association, which unanimously gave her its highest rating of ‘well qualified.’ Lawyers across the political spectrum, civil rights organizations, law enforcement groups, and chambers of commerce have all offered not just support but glowing support for her nomination.” To watch video of Senator Peters’ remarks on the Senate floor, click here.As the first African American woman nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court, Judge Jackson’s nomination is historic – and has received extensive and broad support, including prominent conservatives across the legal community, national law enforcement organizations such as the International Association of Chiefs of Police, civil rights organizations and the NAACP. Jackson was previously confirmed by this Senate three separate times and on a bipartisan basis – most recently last year to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals.“This is without question a challenging time not only for the Supreme Court but also for our democracy – and it is clear that Judge Jackson has the extensive experience and qualifications, the temperament, and impartiality and fidelity to the law that will undoubtedly serve our nation exceptionally well,” continued Senator Peters. “I am proud to support Judge Jackson as our next Supreme Court Justice and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in making history.”Before her confirmation to the D.C. Circuit, Judge Jackson served on the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. She was confirmed to the role unanimously and issued more than 500 opinions on cases involving a range of important issues. Jackson additionally has prior experience as a Vice Chair and Commissioner on the U.S. Sentencing Commission, as a federal public defender, as a lawyer in private practice, and as a law clerk at all three levels of the federal Judiciary, including for U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Stephen Breyer.Below are Senator Peters’ remarks, as prepared for delivery:“I rise in support of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States and look forward to proudly voting for her confirmation.“There are few Constitutional duties more important in my role as a U.S. senator than providing advice and consent on judicial nominations, and this is especially true for the Supreme Court. As we consider Judge Jackson’s nomination before this body, we are on the cusp of a historic, barrier-breaking moment – and on the verge of confirming the first African American woman to serve on the Supreme Court.“This is not only a significant milestone, but a moment to recognize Judge Jackson, who is one of our nation’s brightest legal minds and an incredibly impressive nominee.“Before I talk about Judge Jackson’s exceptional experience, qualifications and support from across the legal spectrum, it’s important to reflect on the critical importance of our nation’s highest court. Without question, Supreme Court rulings have a direct and a consequential impact on the lives of Michiganders and all Americans. Issues before the court include health care, women’s reproductive rights, workers’ rights, environmental protections, voting rights, and many life or death decisions that shape the law of the land.“Simply put, the Supreme Court is often the last line of defense for every day Americans – and an important guardian of the Constitution itself. “There’s no question that a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court is a tremendous responsibility – and we must have qualified, committed justices who will exercise judicial independence, follow the facts, and apply law and precedent fairly and impartially – without regard for their own personal views, partisanship or politics.“It’s clear that on every measure Judge Jackson has the credentials, qualities, work ethic and character needed to serve on the Supreme Court, and she will not only bring diversity but a unique life perspective and passion for the law that she developed at a very young age.“Judge Jackson’s interest in the law started as a preschooler, sitting next to her father while he studied cases for law school – while she worked in her coloring book. Despite being ambitious and a star student growing up, Judge Jackson faced resistance. When Judge Jackson told her high school guidance counselor that she was interested in attending Harvard University, the counselor told her that maybe she should set her sights lower than that.“But Judge Jackson would not be deterred, and she credits her high school debate coach with introducing her to several colleges. She went on to graduate magna cum laude from Harvard as an undergraduate and cum laude from Harvard Law School.“This was the beginning of Judge Jackson’s distinguished legal career. She clerked for three federal judges, including Supreme Court Justice Breyer – worked in private practice at prestigious law firms, and has served on the federal bench – on both the district court and the Court of Appeals, a position she was confirmed to just last year with bipartisan support by this very Senate.“Judge Jackson’s experience also has been shaped by representing every day Americans and hearing their cases. She will be the first Justice who previously served as a federal public defender and the only Justice who has served as a member of the bipartisan U.S. Sentencing Commission. She will also bring considerable criminal law experience to the Court.“Her breadth of experience, her record and temperament were on full display during her recent Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing. “Over the course of 24 hours and more than 600 questions, Judge Jackson not only demonstrated why she is qualified to serve on the Supreme Court but also why she was unflappable even when she faced outrageous, absolutely outrageous false attacks on her record during the Committee hearings.“During this process, Judge Jackson has not only earned bipartisan support for her confirmation but has the backing of diverse voices – including from the American Bar Association, which unanimously gave her its highest rating of “well qualified.” Lawyers across the political spectrum, civil rights organizations, law enforcement groups, and chambers of commerce have all offered not just support but glowing support for her nomination.“Former George H.W. Bush-appointed Fourth Circuit Judge Michael Luttig called Judge Jackson ‘eminently qualified’ and ‘as highly credentialed and experienced in the law as any nominee in history.’“Two dozen conservative and former Republican-appointed officials said: ‘…we are united in our view that she is exceptionally well-qualified, given her breadth of experience, demonstrated ability, and personal attributes of intellect and character. We think that her confirmation on a consensus basis would strengthen the court and the nation in important ways.’“And the International Association of Chiefs of Police said, ‘…During her time as a judge, she has displayed her dedication to ensuring that our communities are safe and that the interest of justice are served. Judge Jackson’s years of experience have shown she has the temperament and qualifications to serve as the next Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.’“After my one-on-one meeting with Judge Jackson last week, I was convinced she is extraordinarily qualified and prepared to serve on the Supreme Court, particularly at this challenging moment. This is without question a challenging time not only for the Supreme Court but also for our democracy – and it is clear that Judge Jackson has the extensive experience and qualifications, the temperament, and impartiality and fidelity to the law that will undoubtedly serve our nation exceptionally well.“I am proud to support Judge Jackson as our next Supreme Court Justice and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in making history.”###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-joins-president-biden-at-white-house-for-signing-of-his-historic-bipartisan-postal-service-reform-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – The President has signed into law historic, bipartisan legislation led by U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, to set the United States Postal Service on a more sustainable financial footing and support the goal of providing long-term reliable service across the country. Chairman Peters joined President Biden at the White House for the bill signing. The new law – which passed the House with 342 votes and the Senate with 79 votes – makes the first major reforms to the Postal Service in more than 15 years.“This historic, bipartisan law is a momentous achievement that shows when lawmakers put their differences aside and work together, we can deliver meaningful results for the American people. For nearly 250 years, the United States Postal Service has worked to deliver essential mail to businesses and households all across this nation. However, in recent years we saw how unfair policies forced this treasured institution to cut costs and delayed the delivery of medication, financial documents, and other critical mail,” said Senator Peters. “These long overdue reforms will undo these burdensome financial requirements, save the Postal Service billions of dollars to help prevent future cuts that harm service, and ensure this public institution is accountable and transparent to the American people. I am grateful to my colleagues for helping me lead this legislation and securing significant support for these reforms on both sides of the aisle. Together, our efforts will ensure the Postal Service can continue to connect Michiganders and all Americans for years to come.”To see video of Senator Peters discussing the signing ceremony, click here.The Postal Service Reform Act will provide key financial and operational reforms to the United States Postal Service. The law will eliminate the onerous prefunding requirement that has hurt the Postal Service financially, and integrate postal worker retirees’ health care with Medicare. Together, these two reforms would create more than $49 billion in savings for the Postal Service over the next ten years. In addition, the law will require the Postal Service to maintain its standard of delivering at least six days a week. The legislation will improve transparency of Postal Service operations to both customers and Congress by requiring the publication of easily accessible local weekly service data on the Postal Service website, as well as regular and detailed reporting to Congress on Postal Service finances and operations. The law also includes additional provisions for Postal Service effectiveness, accountability and growth.Peters has fought to protect the Postal Service and its nearly 250-year tradition of mail delivery. In 2020, Peters championed legislation to secure a $10 billion direct payment to the Postal Service to help recover from pandemic-related losses. He also conducted an investigation into operational changes at the Postal Service in 2020 that resulted in significant delays. Following Peters’ investigation, the Postal Service reversed many of these changes and service has significantly improved.### "
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/photos-peters-receives-us-navy-supply-corps-foundation-distinguished-alumni-award-addresses-navy-supply-corps-school-graduates,"NEWPORT, RI – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), a former Lt. Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, received the Navy Supply Corps Foundation Distinguished Alumni Award. Peters – who was previously recognized for the award last year by the Navy Supply Corps Foundation Distinguished Alumni Program – was recognized for his dedicated service to Michigan following his distinguished career in the U.S. Navy Reserve.“Without question, my experience as a supply corps officer has helped shape who I am. And I still use what I learned as a supply corps officer in representing Michigan in the U.S. Senate,” said Senator Peters. “I was deeply honored to receive this recognition. Whether it’s ensuring our military is prepared to complete their mission safely and effectively against evolving threats – or honoring our servicemembers and veterans – I’ll always work to ensure we are Ready for Sea to keep Americans safe.”Prior to receiving the award, Peters addressed supply corps officers graduating from their Basic Qualification Course at the Navy Supply Corps School in Newport, Rhode Island.“Defending freedom requires having the means to do so – and supply corps officers all carry major responsibilities in ensuring our Navy continues to be the most powerful naval force the world has ever known,” said Senator Peters. “It was an honor to address Supply Corps School graduates. Each and every one of them have stepped up – raised their hands to take an oath to serve our country – and potentially put themselves in harm’s way. We are forever grateful for their service.”“Senator Peters' military service as a Navy Supply Corps Officer and deployments abroad have had a lasting impact on him. He has stood up for our nation’s military and made veterans a priority,” said Rear Admiral (retired) Mike Lyden, Chairman of the Navy Supply Corps Foundation.Image courtesy of Senator Peters' officeImage courtesy of Jessica Wharton, U.S. Navy Supply Corps SchoolImage courtesy of Senator Peters' officeSenator Peters receives the Navy Supply Corps Foundation Distinguished Alumni Award and addresses graduates of the Navy Supply Corps School. To download photos, please click here.Peters volunteered for the U.S. Navy Reserve and was commissioned as a supply corps officer. He served for over a decade in units at Selfridge Air National Guard Base and earned a Seabee Combat Warfare Specialist designation and rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander. His reserve duty included time in the Persian Gulf region supporting Operation Southern Watch. After the September 11th terrorist attacks on our country, he volunteered again for drilling status.Peters has long been an advocate for Michigan’s servicemembers and veterans. Last year, Peters was inducted into the Michigan Military and Veterans Hall of Honor for his efforts to support our nation’s veterans and military. In 2017, Peters was recognized as Legislator of the Year by the Vietnam Veterans of America for authoring the bipartisan Fairness for Veterans Act into law. The legislation requires veteran discharge review boards to give liberal consideration to petitions for honorable discharge status if the servicemember has been diagnosed with PTSD, TBI or other related conditions connected to their military service. As of the fall of 2020, more than 1,500 veterans have had their discharges upgraded since his legislation was enacted.Peters also introduced and passed out of the Senate his bipartisan CADETS Act to expand the Student Incentive Payment Program eligibility age for financial assistance to cadets who attended one of the six State Maritime Academies and commit to a post-graduation service obligation to include any qualified student who will meet the age requirements for enlistment in the U.S. Navy Reserve at their time of graduation. In return for their commitment to serve, cadets can receive up to $32,000 in this incentive payment funding over four years to help offset the cost of tuition, uniforms, books, and living costs.Last year, Peters’ bipartisan bill to strengthen transparency and communication for veterans and caregivers participating in the VA’s caregiver program was enacted into law. Also, Peters’ bipartisan legislation to expand apprenticeship opportunities for veterans and allow them to use their GI bill benefits to secure a registered apprenticeship was signed into law in 2020. Peters also fought for and helped secure a measure in the national defense bill to expand the Department of Veterans’ Affairs list of medical conditions associated with Agent Orange exposure to include bladder cancer, hypothyroidism, and Parkinsonism. ### "

I urged the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Labor to provide this critical short-term assistance to Michigan businesses while we continue to work with the Administration and the labor community to reform this program, provide long-term certainty, and prioritize American workers.“As Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, I am intent on ensuring that these temporary visas are used appropriately, that they do not disrupt the local workforce, and that temporary workers are not subjected to exploitative labor practices. I look forward to continuing to work with Michigan’s labor and business leaders and the Administration to continue strengthening protections for Michigan workers and ensure that Michigan businesses have the support they need to succeed.” Today, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Labor (DOL) announced plans to raise the annual cap on H-2B temporary nonagricultural worker visas to make an additional 35,000 visas available to meet labor needs through September 30, 2022. These supplemental visas will provide temporary assistance for many of Michigan’s seasonal businesses to hire additional temporary personnel to supplement their operations during peak times. As Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Peters has worked with DHS and the labor community to find temporary solutions to help Michigan’s seasonal industries meet with staffing needs, while continuing to identify long-term solutions to reform the H-2B program and protect American workers.###"

https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-bipartisan-legislation-to-protect-commercial-satellites-from-cybersecurity-threats-advances-in-senate,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Bipartisan legislation authored by U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI) to require the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to provide voluntary cybersecurity resources to commercial satellite owners and operators has advanced in the Senate. Commercial satellites provide data and information used for navigation, agriculture, technology development, scientific research, and more. Industrial Control Systems – the technology involved in operating critical infrastructure networks like pipelines, and water and electric utilities – are also heavily reliant on commercial satellites. Peters’ legislation will help ensure these systems – which are critical to our national and economic security – are secure from online attacks. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, where Peters serves as Chair, approved the legislation following recent reports that the Russian government was behind a cyber-attack on an American-based satellite company, which provides broadband services to Europe, in order to disrupt Ukrainian military communications at start of the invasion.“Foreign adversaries, including the Russian government, and cybercriminals continue to target satellites that provide essential services. If they are able to successfully breach these networks, the consequences for the American people could be catastrophic,” said Senator Peters. “This bipartisan bill will help ensure small businesses and other organizations that own and operate commercial satellites have the necessary resources and information to secure their own networks.”Experts have shown increasing concern that commercial satellite hacks could have dire economic and security consequence. The Department of Defense has also raised concerns about this threat and recently sponsored a competition for white hat hackers to attempt breaching an active satellite. In 2014, American officials accused the Chinese government of hacking a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather satellite. As commercial satellites become more pervasive, hackers could shut satellites down, denying access to their service or jam signals to disrupt electric grids, water networks, transportation systems, and other critical infrastructure. Peters’ legislation will ensure the United States is prepared to address these threats as malicious hackers increasingly target commercial satellite systems.The Satellite Cybersecurity Act will require CISA to consolidate voluntary satellite cybersecurity recommendations to help companies understand how to best secure their systems. Some of these resources will be specific to small businesses who own and operate commercial satellite systems. Additionally, the bill requires CISA to develop a publicly available, online resource to ensure companies can easily access satellite-specific cybersecurity resources and recommendations to secure their networks. The legislation will also require the Government Accountability Office to perform a study on how the federal government supports commercial satellite industry cybersecurity. It will ensure a better understanding of how network vulnerabilities in commercial satellites could impact critical infrastructure.As Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters has led efforts to increase our nation’s cybersecurity defenses. His landmark bill to require critical infrastructure owners and operators to report to CISA if they experience a substantial cyber-attack or if they make a ransomware payment was signed into law as a part of the recent government funding legislation. Peters’ bill to enhance cybersecurity assistance to K-12 educational institutions across the country was also signed into law. Additionally, Senator Peters secured several provisions in the bipartisan infrastructure law to bolster cybersecurity – including $100 million fund to help victims of a serious attack recover quickly. ###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-legislation-to-save-taxpayer-dollars-by-ensuring-public-buildings-utilize-energy-efficient-lighting-passes-senate,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Senate has passed bipartisan legislation authored by U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, that would help save taxpayer dollars by directing the General Services Administration (GSA) to install the most life-cycle cost effective and energy-efficient lighting in public buildings. The legislation now moves to the United States House of Representatives for consideration.“By using more efficient lighting, the federal government can save taxpayer dollars in the long run by reducing its energy usage,” said Senator Peters. “This commonsense bipartisan bill will also ensure the government decreases its carbon footprint and helps combat climate change. Now that this bill has passed the Senate, I urge my colleagues in the House to pass it as soon as possible.”  The Bulb Replacement Improving Government with High-Efficiency Technology (BRIGHT) Act requires the GSA Administrator to ensure that public buildings are using the most life-cycle cost effective and energy-efficient technology to the extent practicable when performing normal maintenance, altering or constructing public buildings. The bill also requires GSA to issue guidance to federal agencies, and state, local and Tribal entities to further streamline efficiency and effectiveness across government. GSA previously released a series of reports that calculated that switching to LED lightbulbs would result in millions of dollars in cost-savings due to their superior lifespan and energy efficiency. Federal law does not currently require the government to maximize long-term cost and energy savings across lighting products.Peters has led numerous efforts to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent effectively and efficiently. He recently convened a hearing to ensure pandemic emergency relief funds have been effectively used to help Americans affected by COVID-19. Peters’ bipartisan bill to save taxpayer dollars by ensuring federal property assets are disaster resilient has advanced in the Senate. As a part of the American Rescue Plan, Peters secured $1 billion for the Technology Modernization Fund to modernize federal government systems that deliver critical services, like unemployment insurance, to Americans. Peters’ provision to help save billions of federal taxpayer dollars by curbing erroneous payments to deceased individuals was signed into law last Congress.  A law written by Peters to reduce duplicative software purchases called the MEGAByte Act has saved taxpayers more than $450 million since 2016.###"

Mayorkas, I’m pleased to announce that the Department has notified me that U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be establishing a new position to serve as a community relations liaison between the agency and Michigan’s Arab and Muslim American communities.“Community leaders have long raised serious concerns about experiences with the travel screening process, and this new role will be a vital link between these communities and CBP officials to help address these concerns and other important civil rights issues. This is a key step to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security and its component agencies are effectively serving all of our communities. As Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, I will continue working with Secretary Mayorkas and CBP to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security is able to facilitate secure and efficient trade and travel into the United States while protecting our borders and respecting Americans’ civil rights and liberties.”Earlier this month, Peters hosted DHS Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas in Metro Detroit to meet with leaders from Michigan’s Arab and Muslim American communities to discuss civil rights issues, including the challenges often confronted by members of these communities when going through security screening while traveling.This afternoon, Peters joined CBP Deputy Commissioner Troy Miller and Dearborn, MI Mayor Abdullah Hammoud for a virtual meeting, which included a discussion of the new position, which will be charged with serving as the key liaison between Michigan’s Arab and Muslim American communities and CBP leadership in Michigan and Washington, D.C. to help address these and other community concerns.###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-legislation-to-correct-retirement-error-for-customs-and-border-protection-officers-advances-in-senate,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Bipartisan legislation authored by U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI) to ensure U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers (CBPOs) can receive the retirement benefits they were promised when starting their service has advanced in the Senate. The bill corrects a mistake where Customs and Border Protection (CBP) incorrectly informed newly hired CBPOs that they would be eligible for proportional annuity, which means they would not have to retire at a certain age or reach 20 years of service to qualify for the benefit enhancement. However, when CBP realized their error – more than ten years after these officers had started their service – they rescinded these benefits and will now require at least 1352 officers, including 67 in Michigan, to meet additional requirements to receive the benefits they were initially promised when starting the job more than a decade ago. This has significantly impacted CBPOs’ ability to properly plan for their future and ensure they can retire comfortably with the benefits they expected.  The bill was approved by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, where Peters serves as Chair.“It is unacceptable that hardworking Customs and Border Protection officers have had their retirement plans disrupted due to a paperwork error that occurred almost 15 years ago. These officers – who put their lives on the line each and every day to ensure safe and efficient travel and trade across our borders – deserve better,” said Senator Peters. “This bipartisan bill will ensure these employees get the benefits they were promised by Customs and Border Protection, and I will continue to urge my colleagues to quickly pass this important legislation.""The CPBO Retirement Corrections Act would direct CBP to identify eligible individuals and notify them of the correction. Those impacted would then be eligible for a correction that would align their retirement benefits with the coverage they were promised. The legislation also includes a retroactive annuity adjustment for eligible individuals who retire before the date of enactment of this bill and grants the Department of Homeland Security the authority to waive maximum entry age requirements for eligible officers. ### "
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-bipartisan-legislation-to-help-at-risk-communities-invest-in-disaster-mitigation-projects-advances-in-senate,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Bipartisan legislation authored by U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI) to make permanent the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) National Risk Index (NRI), an online tool that utilizes data to identify communities that are most vulnerable to natural disasters, has advanced in the Senate. The bill would require FEMA to use data from the NRI, or a similar tool, to establish community disaster resilience zones (CDRZs) to designate the communities across the nation that are most in need of mitigation projects – and help them access federal funding and support to plan for mitigation and resilience projects. As damage from extreme weather events continues to cause billions of dollars in damages that taxpayers must cover, Peters’ legislation will help at-risk communities make important investments that will limit the damage caused by natural disasters. The bill was approved by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, where Peters serves as Chair. “Mitigation projects are the key to helping communities that are most vulnerable to natural disasters protect residents from these extreme weather events. Unfortunately, these communities often lack the necessary resources to fund efforts like flood walls, better storm water management facilities, and more,” said Senator Peters. “This commonsense, bipartisan legislation – which has now advanced in the Senate – will help the public and private sectors identify what areas require the most assistance to build resilient infrastructure. These investments will not only help ensure at-risk populations are safe from extreme weather events, but also save taxpayer dollars in the long run.”Vulnerable communities continue to face severe consequences from natural disasters – including loss of life and significant financial damage. Studies have shown that resilience and mitigation spending saves taxpayers an average of $6 for every $1 invested. By making permanent and utilizing data from the NRI, or a similar tool – which factors in expected annual losses, social vulnerability and community resilience – Peters’ legislation would help better allocate resources so at-risk communities can develop FEMA-approved hazard mitigation projects. The legislation is supported a variety of stakeholder groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Reinsurance Association of America (RAA), the National Wildlife Federation (NWF), the National Association of Counties (NACo), the BuildStrong Coalition, and the National Low Income Housing Coalition.As Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters has led several efforts to strengthen our federal disaster preparedness and response. Peters secured $500 million in funding as part of the bipartisan infrastructure bill for a program he created to help states establish revolving loan programs for local governments to carry out mitigation projects that reduce the risk of shoreline erosion, extreme flooding, and other natural disasters. Peters also convened a hearing with disaster preparedness and response experts to hear how worsening natural disasters, including flooding, severe storms, and wildfires, continue to threaten lives and livelihoods in Michigan and across the nation. Peters’ bipartisan legislation to protect Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Reservists from losing their full-time employment when they are called up to assist communities with disaster response has advanced in the Senate.###"

Last week, the Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing to assess the role semiconductors play in American manufacturing at-large. The field hearing Peters convened today helped build on those efforts by further examining how semiconductors impact innovation in the automotive industry specifically.The hearing – titled “Made in America: The Future of Automotive Innovation and Semiconductor Chips” – featured testimony from leaders on how Michigan can be positioned to continue being a leader in the future of mobility, including Glenn Stevens, Executive Director, MICHauto; Jay Rathert, Senior Director of Strategic Partnerships, KLA; Steve Dawes, Director, UAW Region1D; and Garrick Francis, Vice President of Federal Affairs, Auto Innovators.“Today, we’re bringing the committee to Michigan – because it’s here where this is not an abstract concept by any means – this is where auto manufacturing, the chip shortage, and related challenges are all taking place each and every day,” said Senator Peters during his opening remarks. “And this is where I think we will be continuing to lead into the future…Michigan established the American auto industry, transforming mobility and society, and quite frankly built the middle class, and will continue leading for many years into the future.”“…This chip shortage resulted in temporary layoffs, causing hardships for workers in an already challenging time. It also cut into one of the main drivers of our national economy, which is auto production. This is especially concerning because looking toward the future – cars will become even more dependent on chips,” Peters continued. “…Here’s the bottom line: we must remain focused on making our supply chains resilient by manufacturing critical goods in America. That includes semiconductor chips, but other supplies that are essential to millions of American jobs, like the auto industry.” To watch video of the hearing Senator Peters convened, click here.Peters is leading the charge – and has repeatedly pressed for action – to address the ongoing semiconductor shortage that has stymied automotive innovation in recent years, and impacted workers and industries across the country – including the Michigan auto industry. Peters secured multiple provisions in the U.S. competitiveness package that passed both the Senate and House of Representatives to bolster U.S. semiconductor production, including to create a $2 billion supplemental incentive fund to support the domestic production of mature semiconductor technologies in the coming years and ensure that semiconductor projects that support critical manufacturing industries are given priority status, which would include the automotive sector. This is in addition to $50 billion already in the bill to incentivize the production of semiconductors of all kinds in the U.S.—for a total of $52 billion.The competitiveness bill also includes Peters’ bipartisan Investing in Domestic Semiconductor Manufacturing Act, which would ensure that federal incentives to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing include U.S. suppliers that produce the materials and manufacturing equipment that enable semiconductor manufacturing. In doing so, the legislation strengthens the supply chain for semiconductors and bolsters Michigan manufacturers. The package also authorizes increased funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, which has been a priority for Peters. Congress must now work to finalize the competitiveness the bill, negotiating differences between the House and Senate-passed bills.Additionally, Peters has raised this supply chain disruption with numerous Biden Administration officials in conversations both before and after President Biden took office – including during a roundtable discussion with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in Michigan. Peters has also introduced and advanced bipartisan legislation in the Senate to streamline federal efforts to strengthen and expand domestic manufacturing of semiconductor chips, and bolster American semiconductor production and supply chains.Below is the text of Senator Peters’ remarks, as prepared for delivery:“I want to begin by explaining why we are here in Detroit. Last week, the Senate Commerce Committee had a hearing in Washington, D.C. about semiconductors and their role in manufacturing and the economy.“Today, we’re bringing the committee to Michigan – because it’s here where this is not an abstract concept by any means – this is where auto manufacturing, the chip shortage, and related challenges are all taking place each and every day. And this is where I think we will be continuing to lead into the future.“Our communities and families are steeped in these issues, and it’s important to have this conversation among the people and places that are experiencing them.“Michigan established the American auto industry, transforming mobility and society, and quite frankly built the middle class, and will continue leading for many years into the future. When Henry Ford introduced the first Model T of assembly line fame back in 1908, it did not contain a single semiconductor chip.“Indeed, for several more decades, that continued to be the case. By the 70s – some cars contained a handful of chips.“The role of chips in automobiles has ballooned since then, with modern cars using well over 1,000 semiconductor chips or more - spanning various costs, functions, and technologies.“Given these developments, it’s no surprise that a global chip shortage following the COVID-19 pandemic had a devastating impact on the auto industry.“This chip shortage resulted in temporary layoffs, causing hardships for workers in an already challenging time. It also cut into one of the main drivers of our national economy, which is auto production.“This is especially concerning because looking toward the future – cars will become even more dependent on chips.“As President Biden has said in visiting both Ford and GM right here in Michigan, ‘the future of the auto industry is electric.’ I would make a small addition to that statement: the future of the auto industry is electric as well as connected and autonomous.“In terms of electrification, novel semiconductor technologies promise to reduce charging times – extend range – and enhance performance for Electric Vehicles, among other benefits.“Not only will Electric Vehicles help save our planet by combatting climate change – they will also reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources and protect Americans from unpredictable gas prices.“When it comes to connected and autonomous vehicles – semiconductors chips will power the Artificial Intelligence and other capabilities necessary to make self-driving cars possible.“This aspiration can’t become reality soon enough – because lives are quite literally on the line.“Tragically, recent data shows that during the first nine months of 2021 – an estimated 31,720 people died in car crashes. This represents a jump of 12 percent compared to 2020. This is completely unacceptable.“Achieving a future with zero fatalities on our roads will be challenging and require many approaches – there is no silver bullet. But autonomous vehicles hold great promise to play a major role in reducing injuries in deaths by eliminating human error and impaired driving, which are commonly involved in crashes.“These trends – electrification and autonomy – mean that in the coming years, chips will play an even greater role in the most essential functions of automobiles: driving and powering the vehicle.“So how do we prepare for this future, and how do we prevent a repeat of problems like the chip shortage?“We need to shore up our supply chains by making the things we need, right here in America.“The pandemic has delivered a painful message. Our supply chains are efficient, but they are not resilient. So when something goes wrong, problems pile up quickly, depriving Americans of the things they rely on and contributing to inflation. And much of this is due to the fact that we are too reliant on overseas production.“Through my role leading the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, in 2019, I released a report on prescriptions drugs.“Among other issues, we found that America was over reliant on foreign manufacturers for prescription drug materials – and that we were poorly prepared in the event of a pandemic. Little did we know that a pandemic would be just around the corner a few months later. And we saw our overreliance with PPE and other challenges during COVID as well.“Fortunately, companies from GM and Ford and other auto suppliers stepped up during the pandemic by repurposing their facilities to produce essential items like ventilators and masks. But in the long term, we need a national strategy to protect our country.“Whether it comes to chips for the auto industry or other essential goods and materials, we need to start securing our critical supply chains. This is something we’re already doing when it comes to national defense.“As a former Naval officer in the U.S. Navy Reserve – and now a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee – I have fought to ensure that critical defense assets are made in the United States.“For example, Marinette Marine, which is right along the Michigan-Wisconsin border, is building the Navy’s Littoral Combat Ships – with about half the workers coming from Michigan, employing hundreds of Michiganders.“We would never rely on the Chinese government to build our warships. We build them here in America with American workers to ensure that in times of need, our military is prepared.“We must apply that same approach here with semiconductor chips – especially given how they are central to everything from automobiles to lifesaving medical devices.“That’s why it is imperative that Congress funds the CHIPS Act.“In particular, legislation I led with Senator Stabenow would provide $2 billion to incentivize the domestic manufacture of the so-called legacy chips that are in short supply and that manufacturers of all kinds rely on – especially in the auto industry. This $2 billion is in addition to $50 billion to ensure the United States becomes a leader in the manufacture of advanced chips and new semiconductor technologies that will drive innovation.“Here’s the bottom line: we must remain focused on making our supply chains resilient by manufacturing critical goods in America.“That includes semiconductor chips, but other supplies that are essential to millions of American jobs, like the auto industry.“I look forward to hearing today’s testimony about how we can build up American auto manufacturing and our economy by leveraging American-made chips and critical supply chains.”###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-introduces-bipartisan-legislation-to-prevent-conflicts-of-interest-in-federal-contracting,"Bill Will Ensure Federal Contractors Are Working in the Best Interest of the American PeopleWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, introduced bipartisan legislation to help identify and mitigate potential conflicts of interest between taxpayer-funded projects and government contractors’ other business opportunities. The federal government contracts with private companies to support important government functions – such as the delivery of services and the approval of prescription drugs. However, many contractors also conduct business with the private sector or other outside entities, and this can raise questions about the reliability of consultations, advice or projects under federal contracts.“When private companies hired by the federal government fail to disclose outside relationships that could conflict with public interests, taxpayers and federal agencies have no way of knowing whether a company is working in their best interests,” said Senator Peters. “This bipartisan, commonsense legislation will ensure federal consultants and contractors disclose other parts of their business that conflict with the work they are bidding to perform for the government. This will ensure taxpayer dollars are being used to hire contractors that are focused on working in the best interest of the American people.”Recent reports have highlighted the need to prevent conflicts of interest within companies that are awarded federal contracts. For example, McKinsey & Company, a management consulting corporation often hired by the federal government, was paid more than $140 million dollars since 2008 by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) to help support their oversight work of pharmaceutical companies – including determining the safety and efficacy of prescription pain medications. At the same time, McKinsey had not disclosed to the FDA that they were also consulting for several opioid manufacturers on how these companies could effectively market their products. This has called into question whether consultants from McKinsey were providing biased advice to the FDA, and whether that advice was influenced by their relationship with the drug makers whose business practices are a root cause of the opioid epidemic. Peters’ legislation will give federal agencies a process to evaluate similar potential conflicts of interest to ensure that federal consultants and other contractors are using taxpayer dollars to work in Americans’ best interests.The Preventing Organizational Conflicts of Interest in Federal Acquisition Act would require federal contractors to disclose other business relationships with entities that conflict with the work that an agency has hired them to do. Private companies currently under contract with the U.S. government would also have to disclose new potential business that opposes ongoing services they are providing to the American people. The bill would ensure federal contractors are aware of disclosure requirements and how working with agencies could impact other parts of their business. Finally, the legislation requires federal agencies to assess and update their procedures for determining whether contractors could have a conflict of interest.Below are statements in support of Peters’ bipartisan legislation:""The U.S. government increasingly relies on government contractors for their expertise on matters that threaten our nation's safety and security. Yet, based on current federal contract regulations, agencies cannot always discern whether government contractors have business relationships with foreign governments and private entities that could create a conflict of interest,” said Noah Bookbinder, President of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “To protect the integrity of services provided to the United States, CREW endorses the Preventing Organizational Conflicts of Interest in Federal Acquisition Act, which would require greater transparency in contractor business relationships in order to prevent conflicts of interest.”""Companies perform mission-critical government functions. Organizational conflicts present one type of ethics risk to the government, and they must be identified and avoided through careful government oversight, said Scott Amey, General Counsel for the Project on Government Oversight's. “Without more guidance, organizational conflicts of interest can result in unfair competitive advantages and biased contract awards—both of which compromise the impartiality of the federal government and the integrity of the contracting process.""“When government policymaking is tainted by conflicts of interest, it weakens the legitimacy and credibility of the entire process. That erodes public confidence in government and harms democracy,” said Scott Greytak, Director of Advocacy for Transparency International U.S. “This bill promotes greater transparency and accountability to ensure the public can trust that government is making decisions with their best interests at heart.”In his role on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters has worked to ensure government is effectively serving the American people. His bipartisan legislation to strengthen protections for Inspectors General so they can conduct independent oversight to root out waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars has advanced in the Senate. Peters also led several efforts to investigate multiple instances of wasteful spending and conflicts of interest during the previous Administration.###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-introduces-bipartisan-bill-to-improve-coordination-between-federal-agencies-and-state-and-local-governments-to-implement-critical-federal-programs,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, introduced bipartisan legislation to modernize and improve the way federal agencies interact with state, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) governments so they can more efficiently implement important federal programs. The federal government provides many essential services to Americans, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, including unemployment insurance and certain health benefits. Peters’ bill will streamline efforts to deliver these services, save taxpayer dollars and improve government efficiency by requiring the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Director the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs (OIA) to develop a strategic plan to increase cooperation between the federal and state and local governments.“Local governments play a vital role in delivering the federal resources that communities in Michigan and across the country rely on each and every day, but often don’t have the necessary tools and resources to ensure these important benefits and services reach every American who needs them,” said Senator Peters. “This commonsense, bipartisan bill will increase cooperation between all levels of government to improve the ability of state and local governments to provide critical services more efficiently and save taxpayer dollars as they help carry out many federal programs.”The federal government currently lacks a strategic plan to coordinate with localities to administer and oversee important services – leading to state and local governments often acquiring wasteful, duplicative, or ineffective systems to carry out federal policies. Peters’ bipartisan bill will help ensure tax dollars are not spent on unnecessary resources to execute core government responsibilities.The Improving Intergovernmental Cooperation and Reducing Duplication Act amends the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968 to modernize how federal and local governments cooperate so that SLTTs can better assist in the delivery of federal services. The bill requires the OMB Director and OIA Director to develop a strategic plan to increase intergovernmental cooperation to improve coordination between federal and SLTT governments, increase efficiency, and reduce costs to taxpayers. The legislation would require the OMB director update the more than 50 year old guidance on intergovernmental cooperation to ensure more effective delivery of federal services at all levels of government.Peters has led numerous efforts to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent effectively and efficiently. He recently convened a hearing to ensure pandemic emergency relief funds have been effectively used to help Americans affected by COVID-19. Peters’ bipartisan bill to save taxpayer dollars by ensuring federal property assets are disaster resilient has advanced in the Senate. As a part of the American Rescue Plan, Peters secured $1 billion for the Technology Modernization Fund to modernize federal government systems that deliver critical services, like unemployment insurance, to Americans. Peters’ provision to help save billions of federal taxpayer dollars by curbing erroneous payments to deceased individuals was signed into law last Congress.  A law written by Peters to reduce duplicative software purchases called the MEGAByte Act has saved taxpayers more than $450 million since 2016.###"

During the hearing titled “Developing Next Generation Technology for Innovation” – Peters stressed the importance of semiconductor technologies to the future of mobility, and the urgent need to pass CHIPS Act funding to strengthen domestic production and address the ongoing shortage that has hurt auto industries including in Michigan. Peters also emphasized the value Michigan offers to the semiconductor industry through its auto industry, robust STEM education and skills training programs, and world-class workforce. During the hearing, Peters talked about the upcoming field hearing he is convening titled “Made in America: The Future of Automotive Innovation and Semiconductor Chips.” It will examine how Congress can help bolster U.S. innovation for electric and autonomous vehicles by increasing domestic production of semiconductor chips and other technologies, while also delivering economic, environmental, and safety benefits for the American people. The field hearing will take place on Monday, March 28th at the Detroit Regional Chamber.The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act, which Congress previously passed into law, established federal incentives for domestic semiconductor chip production to expand American manufacturing and supply chains – helping create good-paying jobs, reinforce our global competitive edge, and strengthen our supply chain resiliency. The U.S. competitiveness package that passed both the Senate and House of Representatives included $52 billion in funding for the CHIPS Act to bolster U.S. semiconductor production. Congress must now work to finalize the competitiveness the bill, negotiating differences between the House and Senate-passed bills.“Semiconductor chips can be as small as a fingernail, but we know that these tiny devices have absolutely enormous impact across the economy and our society, and certainly a clear example is the auto industry,” said Senator Peters. “As we look to the future, chips are going to play an even more important role in mobility, as they are central for both electric vehicles as well as autonomous vehicles, which represents the future for the auto industry. That's why I'm excited to chair a hearing in Detroit this coming Monday… to examine the role of semiconductors in the future of automotive innovation. I certainly believe it's essential that we make our semiconductor supply chains as resilient as possible, not just efficient, but highly resilient, and I think my state of Michigan is particularly well positioned to lead this this effort. Not only will this grow jobs and economic activity in the semiconductor industry, it will also strengthen the entire economy, especially when it comes to not just cars, but all products that use these chips.“…Michigan knows how to make things, so it's no surprise we're seeing a major influx of investment around semiconductor technologies like KLA operating its second headquarters in Ann Arbor. Without a doubt in my mind, funding for the CHIPS Act will be critical for growing this forward.”To watch video of Senator Peters’ remarks, click here.Peters has repeatedly pressed for action and led efforts to address the ongoing semiconductor shortage that has stymied automotive innovation in recent years, and impacted workers and industries across the country – including the Michigan auto industry.

https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-introduces-bill-to-strengthen-federal-disaster-response-for-minority-rural-and-disabled-communities,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, introduced legislation to strengthen the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) disaster response efforts for underserved communities that often face barriers to securing federal aid following an emergency, such as flooding, wildfires, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The Achieving Equity in Disaster Response, Recovery, and Resilience Act would establish the Office of Civil Rights, Equity, and Inclusion (OCREI) at FEMA to increase access to and improve the quality of disaster assistance for, among others, minority, rural, and disabled communities. The office would be dedicated to reducing disparities in the delivery of disaster assistance. Peters introduced the bill with U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (CA).“We have repeatedly seen that when marginalized and rural communities face disasters – they are not only the most exposed to damage and the least able to recover financially – but they also often have more difficulty obtaining assistance from the federal government,” said Senator Peters. “From severe weather events in Michigan and across the nation that have devastated families and businesses – to the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic – recent emergencies have shown we must do more to protect our most vulnerable and underserved communities. This bill will help ensure that our federal government is giving all communities equitable access to disaster assistance.”“From wildfires to floods, natural disasters disproportionately impact marginalized and underserved communities, and these communities often face additional challenges in receiving federal disaster assistance,” said Senator Padilla. “We need to close these gaps and improve equity in disaster relief efforts. This legislation will empower FEMA to work closely with underserved communities in California and across the country and help reduce disparities in the delivery of disaster assistance.” Underserved communities such as minority, rural, and disabled communities regularly receive less, and lower quality disaster assistance, even though they are also often disproportionately affected by disasters. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has hit underserved and minority communities the hardest. Peters’ bill would establish a high-level office dedicated to understanding and advocating for the needs of underserved communities and coordinating the federal response so that the delivery of disaster assistance is equitable.The Achieving Equity in Disaster Response, Recovery, and Resilience Act would establish the OCREI at FEMA to improve access to and the quality of disaster assistance for underserved communities, and eliminate disparities in the delivery of disaster assistance to these communities. This bill would also classify rural communities as underserved communities and task this office at FEMA with reducing the disparities in the delivery of disaster assistance to those communities as well. The bill requires the OCREI to evaluate FEMA programs and activities to promote equity for underserved communities, enter into agreements with and award grants to nonprofits working to support underserved communities, and engage with federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial governmental entities and advocacy organizations in underserved communities on a regular basis. The bill also streamlines efforts to ensure a coordinated approach across FEMA to protect the rights and needs of individuals with disabilities in disaster response. Finally the legislation would require public reporting to ensure the office is held accountable for successful implementation of efforts to improve equity in all phases of disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.Below are statements in support of Peters’ legislation:“We commend this piece of legislation for recognizing and addressing two crucial realities. One, that climate change is real and it requires a full-scope effort to prepare our cities, neighborhoods, and homes for disaster scenarios and emergency events. Two, that the Middle Eastern and North African community is uniquely vulnerable during such scenarios and events, due in large part to systemic disinvestment from the broader communities in which we live,” said CEO of ACCESS, Maha Freij. “The Office of Civil Rights, Equity, and Community Inclusion promises to improve the quality of disaster assistance and expand access to include the communities that have historically been hit the hardest.”“This legislation will improve the quality of disaster assistance provided by FEMA and help deliver it to the communities most in need of support,” said National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson. “It will provide an advocate for underserved communities that can least afford the heavy costs of disaster recovery, including rural communities and low-income families served by electric cooperatives. We are grateful to Sen. Peters for introducing this important bill.”“We have seen time and time again how natural disasters, pandemics, and acts of terrorism have disproportionately devastated communities of color across the United States and how responses to these tragedies have been marred by racial and ethnic disparities,” said Marc Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League. “An Office of Civil Rights, Equity, and Inclusion would represent an important first step in rectifying that history, and ensuring that the federal government responds fairly and equitably to all communities when they need support. The National Urban League applauds Chairman Peters’ effort to right this historic wrong, and his commitment to identifying and addressing the shortcomings in the federal government’s emergency response efforts.""“Ensuring that critical disaster preparedness, response, and recovery support reaches the families and businesses who have been historically underserved is critical to helping those who often experience climate and disaster impacts first and worst,” said Jessie Ritter, senior director of water resources and coastal policy for the National Wildlife Federation. “Thank you to Senator Gary Peters for his leadership on this important legislation, which will work to advance equity and justice within FEMA and for all communities it serves.”“Natural disasters and the pandemic have had a significant impact on communities of color – its clear disparities still exist in our federal disaster response efforts,” said Yumeka Rushing, chief of strategy for the NAACP. “The Black community and other marginalized communities often face disproportionate effects when disaster strikes, but often don’t receive equal assistance to help recover from floods, wildfires, and severe weather events. We applaud Senator Peters for his continued leadership on this issue, and for his commitment to ensuring that our nation’s disaster response is equitable for every community. We cannot afford to leave anyone behind.”“We applaud Senator Peters for elevating the debate around disasters and emergencies disproportionately impacting low-income and minority communities across America. Equitable recovery has traditionally been a challenge,” said Michele Stockwell, Executive Director of Bipartisan Policy Center Action. “Lower income populations have fewer financial resources and, as a result, are more reliant on governmental assistance to address their recovery needs. It is critical that the design and implementation of the federal government’s response and recovery programs effectively address the needs of low-income and minority communities.”###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-bipartisan-legislation-to-help-secure-federal-information-technology-supply-chains-against-security-threats-passes-senate,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Legislation authored by U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, to help protect against cybersecurity threats and other technological supply chain security vulnerabilities that arise when the federal government purchases services, equipment or products has passed the Senate. The bipartisan Supply Chain Security Training Act would create a standardized training program to help federal employees responsible for purchasing services and equipment identify whether those products could compromise the federal government’s information security. The legislation now heads to the U.S. House of Representatives for consideration.“Federal employees purchasing software and equipment for the government must be able to recognize vulnerabilities in these products that could allow hackers to breach federal systems and disrupt our supply chains,” said Senator Peters. “This bipartisan legislation will help federal employees identify potential threats to federal cybersecurity, and stop foreign adversaries and cybercriminals as they attempt to compromise our national security.”Training and preparing federal acquisitions employees to recognize and mitigate these growing threats is an essential step in preventing hostile actors from compromising America’s national security. Previous breaches of federal information systems exploited vulnerabilities in the SolarWinds and Microsoft Exchange networks, highlighting the need for robust technological supply chain security and the importance of ensuring agency personnel responsible for managing these resources are well versed and up-to-date on cybersecurity threats and other attempts to steal sensitive or valuable information.The Supply Chain Security Training Act directs the General Services Administration (GSA), in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense (DOD) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to create a supply chain security training program for federal officials with supply chain risk management responsibilities. The bill would also require the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop guidance for federal agencies to adopt and use the training program and how to select officials to participate in the training.The bill is based on similar legislation Peters introduced last Congress. The legislation also builds on a recent executive order from President Biden that made it easier for federal agencies to share threat information, modernize their cybersecurity infrastructure and enhance federal software supply chain security in the wake of recent serious breaches.As Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters has led efforts to increase our nation’s cybersecurity defenses. His bill to enhance cybersecurity assistance to K-12 educational institutions across the country was signed into law. Peters secured several provisions in the bipartisan infrastructure law to bolster cybersecurity – including $100 million fund to help victims of a serious attack recover quickly. Peters’ bills to bolster federal cybersecurity and require critical infrastructure owners and operators to report to CISA if they experience a cyber-attack, and other organizations to notify the federal government if they make a ransom payment have advanced in the Senate.###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-legislation-to-strengthen-cybersecurity-coordination-with-state-and-local-governments-passes-senate-,"WASHINGTON, DC – Legislation authored by U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, to promote stronger cybersecurity coordination between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and state and local governments has passed the Senate. The bipartisan State and Local Government Cybersecurity Act would encourage federal cybersecurity experts to share information regarding cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities, and breaches, as well as resources to prevent and recover from cyber-attacks, with states and localities who are increasingly targeted by bad actors. The bill now heads to the House of Representatives for consideration.“Cybercriminals continue attacking state, local, tribal, and territorial government networks. The federal government needs to step in and take action to help these local communities – which often lack the resources to defend themselves – to quickly identify threats and seal up vulnerabilities in their information technology systems,” said Senator Peters. “This bipartisan legislation will help local governments provide critical services to residents even in the event of a cyber-attack, and I’ll continue to fight for its swift passage into law.”State and local governments increasingly find themselves targeted by high-profile cyber-attacks, costing taxpayers millions of dollars and threatening the data privacy of millions of Americans. A cyber-attack that hit the city of Tulsa in May exposed residents’ Social Security numbers. Last year, the city of Knoxville paid hackers to unlock city computer systems, and a ransomware attack cost the city of New Orleans millions of dollars. In 2019, the Board of Commissioners from Genesee County in Michigan reported similar attacks on their network, after hackers locked their system and demanded payment for its release.The State and Local Government Cybersecurity Act would facilitate coordination between DHS and state and local governments in several key areas. The legislation would permit the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) to provide state and local actors with access to improved security tools, policies and procedures, while also encouraging collaboration for the effective implementation of those resources, including joint cybersecurity exercises. The legislation would also build on previous efforts by the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) to prevent, protect, and respond to future cybersecurity incidents. These changes would also ensure that government officials and their staffs have access to the hardware and software products needed to bolster their cyber defenses.As Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters has led efforts to increase our nation’s cybersecurity defenses. His bill to enhance cybersecurity assistance to K-12 educational institutions across the country was signed into law. Peters secured several provisions in the bipartisan infrastructure law to bolster cybersecurity – including $1 billion to help state, local, tribal, and territorial governments deter attacks from malicious cyber actors and modernize systems to protect sensitive data, information, and public critical infrastructure. Peters’ bills to bolster federal cybersecurity and require critical infrastructure owners and operators to report to CISA if they experience a cyber-attack, and other organizations to notify the federal government if they make a ransom payment have advanced in the Senate.###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-and-collins-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-increase-transparency-of-reliance-on-foreign-manufacturers-for-medical-products_,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Gary Peters (D-MI), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Susan Collins (R-ME), a member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, introduced bipartisan legislation that would strengthen requirements for foreign manufacturers of medical products that are distributed in the United States to register with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA recently reported about 78% of facilities that produce active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) – the key ingredients that give a drug its intended effect – are located outside of the United States. Despite current law, some foreign manufacturers have failed to register with the FDA, limiting the agency’s visibility into where certain drugs are made and in what amount, and making oversight of drug safety and shortages more difficult. The senators’ bill would close a loophole by requiring foreign manufacturers to register with FDA and provide information on the facilities involved in the production process, including when a product undergoes processing in multiple countries before reaching the United States.“Our nation’s longstanding dependence on foreign manufacturers for critical drugs and medical supplies continues to present a serious public health and national security risk. The FDA needs to know exactly where these important products are made at every step of the manufacturing process to ensure safety, anticipate possible shortages, and prepare for future public health challenges,” said Senator Peters. “This commonsense, bipartisan bill will help increase visibility into our medical supply chain and provide the FDA with a clearer picture of foreign-made medical products to help ensure they are safe and effective for all Americans.”“During the ongoing public health emergency, the last thing patients should have to worry about is whether there will be an adequate supply of the medications they need,” said Senator Collins. “Given that nearly 80 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing facilities are located overseas in countries like China and India, it is important for the FDA to have greater visibility into the drug supply chain.  Our legislation will help prevent disruptions of medications and builds on the drug manufacturing reporting requirements in the MEDS Act I co-authored that became law in 2020.”The Registration of Certain Foreign Establishments Act requires foreign manufacturers that distribute medical products in the United States – from active pharmaceutical ingredients to finished drugs – register with the FDA and identify all other facilities where manufacturing occurred, regardless of whether the product undergoes further processing before being imported into the United States. Foreign-made medical products include key drug ingredients, prescription and over the counter medications, and medical supplies such as personal protective equipment. And as recalls for prescription and over the counter medications continue to rise, this requirement will ensure the FDA can identify every foreign establishment where a drug was manufactured in order to address any manufacturing problems that arise.The senators’ legislation builds off of findings from Peters’ 2019 report, A Price Too High: Cost, Supply, and Security Threats to Affordable Prescription Drugs, that identified vulnerabilities in our nation’s medical supply chain and provided recommendations to address growing shortages of critical drugs and national security concerns related to our nation’s dependence on foreign sources for these products.###"

Metropolitan Police, the National Guard, and others, whose valiant efforts defended democracy that day and thwarted an attempted insurrection.”  Peters continued: “We cannot take our democracy for granted, it is built on the promise that every American is committed to the same core values of free and fair elections, the peaceful transfer of power, and an accountable government by and for the people. If we lose that shared commitment to continue upholding our most cherished principles, we risk losing the very freedoms and rights that have made our nation a beacon of light for the entire world.”To watch video of Senator Peters’ remarks, click here.As Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters led the Senate’s first bipartisan investigative hearings and released a joint bipartisan report on the security, planning, and response failures related to January 6th attack. Peters has also led efforts to address the broader national security threat posed by domestic terrorism. Last year, he convened a hearing with experts to examine the amplification of domestic extremist content on social media platforms. He also convened a two-part hearing with experts representing faith-based, civil rights, and academic and policy research organizations on the continued rise of domestic terrorism, including white supremacist and anti-government violence.Below is the text of Senator Peters’ remarks, as prepared for delivery:“One year ago today, a shocking, violent, and unthinkable attack on the U.S. Capitol shook the very foundation of our democracy.“I was here, in this chamber, as we conducted the ceremonial certification of our election. And I remember, as our proceedings were abruptly paused, the confusion as we all evacuated the chamber. In that moment, none of us were aware of the brutal altercations unfolding all around us, as our heroic law enforcement officers and first responders fended off the violent mob of insurrectionists.“The images from that day are horrifying, and they are images we can never forget.“We are forever indebted to the brave U.S. Capitol Police officers, the D.C. Metropolitan Police, the National Guard, and others, whose valiant efforts defended democracy that day and thwarted an attempted insurrection. Not only did this attack leave frontline officers with serious physical injuries, it also took the lives of five officers.“The attack has also taken an unimaginable mental and emotional toll on the first responders, the Capitol Hill community, and Americans all across our nation, who witnessed the assault on the heart of our democracy with their own eyes. “Sadly, as we mark this solemn anniversary, the threat we all watched become a violent act one year ago, has only continued to grow.“In my role as Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I was proud to lead the first bipartisan oversight hearings, investigation, and report on the immediate changes needed to secure the Capitol and prevent a future attack.“Since that report was released last June, nearly 16 of the 20 recommendations we made have been implemented, or are well underway. The Capitol is secure, and we are much better prepared for a potential future attack.“But let’s be very clear, we must do more to tackle the threat of domestic and violent extremism, especially as more and more people embrace conspiracy theories and outright lies, and report that they believe violence can be justified to get their desired political outcomes.“Once relegated to the fringes of our society, these kinds of views are now creeping further into the mainstream, and that presents a grave threat to the future of our democracy.“There is no one easy solution to address this matter. But there are actions that we can take to protect our democracy and strengthen it for generations to come.“Most significantly, our nation’s political leaders, no matter their political affiliation, must condemn the violence that occurred on these grounds one year ago, and speak out against the lies and conspiracies about the 2020 election that have compelled further threats and acts of violence.“We must also address how this disinformation, and other extremist content, spreads online, reaches new audiences, and drives too many people down a rabbit hole of radicalization.“We have seen all too clearly how the spread of such extreme content online can swiftly become real-world violence. More action must be taken to limit the amplification of disinformation and extreme content online, and to prevent extremist views from reaching that tipping point into violent acts.“And our counterterrorism agencies must ensure they are effectively focusing on the threat at hand, by ensuring they have sufficient personnel and resources devoted to domestic terrorism and domestic violent extremism.“Finally, today, and every day, all Americans must remain committed to protecting our democracy. We cannot take our democracy for granted, it is built on the promise that every American is committed to the same core values of free and fair elections, the peaceful transfer of power, and an accountable government by and for the people.“If we lose that shared commitment to continue upholding our most cherished principles, we risk losing the very freedoms and rights that have made our nation a beacon of light for the entire world.“Every member of this body, and every American, has a vital role to play in strengthening our democracy. Elected officials on both sides of the aisle, and at every level of government, should make clear that the lies and violent actions that took place on January 6th have no place in our country, and commit themselves to restoring faith in our democratic institutions, by ensuring that everyone can make their voices heard in our democracy through the ballot box.“One year ago, we saw our democracy endure against a violent attempted insurrection.“But we must be very clear-eyed moving forward, we cannot let efforts to weaken and erode confidence in the future of our democracy continue.“Let’s come together, and tackle the very real challenges our nation faces. In times of adversity, our country persevered because we came together as one. We must channel that spirit as we strive to create a more perfect union today, tomorrow, and for generations to come.”###"

It’s a day that we as a nation can never forget. Thanks to the heroic efforts of U.S. Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police officers, the National Guard, and other law enforcement officers who defended our democracy that day – the insurrection failed. There is no question that this attack took a serious toll on our brave first responders, the Capitol Hill community, and our entire nation. But tragically – instead of coming together as a nation to completely condemn this violence – we have only seen this threat to our democracy grow as political leaders continue to spread the lies and disinformation that spurred the attack.“I was proud to lead the first bipartisan investigation and report focused on the immediate security and policy changes needed to protect the Capitol. While many of the recommendations from that report are being successfully implemented – we must do more to tackle the grave national security threat posed by domestic terrorism and violent extremism. The increasing number of people who believe political violence is justifiable, adopt extremist ideologies, and embrace conspiracy theories threaten our very democracy and our future as a free and prosperous nation.“Every one of us has a responsibility to help defend our democracy. We must unequivocally condemn the lies and provocations that provoked the violent attack – no matter our political persuasion. Congress should also do everything in its power to protect our democracy. We must pass voting rights legislation that will ensure every American’s voice can be heard at the ballot box, help restore faith in our electoral process, and support elections workers’ efforts to impartially and safely manage our elections.“As we saw one year ago, our democratic principles can endure unimaginable challenges, but we must remain clear-eyed and relentless in our efforts to stop these threats from further eroding our democratic way of life.”To watch a video summary of Senator Peters’ bipartisan report detailing the security, planning, and response failures related to the violent and unprecedented attack on January 6th, click here.   As Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters led the Senate’s first bipartisan investigative hearings and released a joint bipartisan report on the security, planning, and response failures related to January 6th attack.

Today, I convened a committee briefing with Administration officials to get additional information on how this cybersecurity threat is affecting the federal government, critical infrastructure, and other entities, and what the Administration has been doing to help remediate the issue. I was pleased to hear how our government has swiftly mobilized to respond to this threat – including by requiring federal agencies to secure their systems and by offering support to impacted organizations.“However, I remain concerned that we will likely never know the full scope and impacts of this widespread vulnerability, or the risk posed to critical infrastructure. Our federal government still lacks the necessary insight to understand the threat facing our nation, protect our networks, and impose consequences on malicious hackers. I will continue pushing to pass my bipartisan legislation to require critical infrastructure companies to report a substantial attack or when they pay ransom so the government can better assess national risk, prepare for national security impacts, and execute coordinated responses.“As Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I’ll continue to work with the Administration to monitor and mitigate the impacts of this serious vulnerability. I remain committed to working with President Biden and my colleagues to protect the American people from online attacks and fight back against foreign adversaries and other criminals who continue threatening our networks.”As Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters has led efforts to increase our nation’s cybersecurity defenses. His provision to provide staffing for the National Cyber Director office to improve cybersecurity policy was signed into law as a part of the annual defense bill.

https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-bipartisan-provision-to-combat-human-trafficking-signed-into-law-as-part-of-national-defense-bill,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – A provision authored by U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, that would enhance our nation’s ability to combat the rise of human trafficking has been signed into law as a part of the National Defense Authorization Act. The provision, which is based off of Peters’ DHS Blue Campaign Enhancement Act, would increase coordination between Department of Homeland Security components and the Blue Campaign, a national public awareness effort designed to educate law enforcement and the public to recognize human trafficking.“Federal and local law enforcement must have the training and resources to stop human trafficking – especially as these horrific crimes continue to go underreported in Michigan and across the nation,” said Senator Peters. “I was proud to help enact these reforms that will help address the threat of human trafficking. They will also provide law enforcement across the nation with additional means to disrupt and dismantle human trafficking organizations.”Thousands of men, women and children continued to be trafficked in the United States – including in Michigan. According to DHS, traffickers might use violence, manipulation, or false promises of jobs or romantic relationships to lure victims into trafficking situations. Based on calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline, the Polaris Project found that in 2019 there were at least 14,597 sex trafficking victims and survivors in the United States. However, the actual number of these crimes may be much larger because these crimes often go unreported. In addition, the Michigan Human Trafficking Commission says that an extremely high number of human trafficking cases involve the sexual exploitation of a child. Eradicating these heinous crimes will require stronger anti-trafficking policies and ensuring that law enforcement professionals and the public are able to recognize indicators of human trafficking.Peters’ provision to the annual defense bill requires the Director of the Blue Campaign to develop online, interactive training videos and other web-based training opportunities for federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement officers. These trainings will help to raise public awareness about the indicators of human trafficking and ensure law enforcement can respond quickly and effectivity. The provision also establishes a Blue Campaign Advisory Board within DHS, which will consult with the Director the Blue Campaign on the development of effective awareness tools for distribution to partners that will help them identify and prevent instances of human trafficking. The provision was led in the House by U.S. Representatives Peter Meijer (R-MI) and Lou Correa (D-CA).Peters’ bipartisan legislation to make permanent the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Center for Countering Human Trafficking (CCHT), which oversees DHS’s efforts to combat human trafficking and the importation of products that are made with forced labor, has also advanced in the Senate.###"

The bill also includes nearly $144 million in investments that Peters – who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee – secured for military facilities across Michigan. Passage of the legislation also comes after Peters hosted Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks at Selfridge Air National Guard Base earlier this month to highlight defense innovation and Michigan’s contributions to our national defense. “The national defense bill is critical to maintaining our competitiveness on the global stage – particularly as other nations, like the Chinese government, look to expand their influence,” said Senator Peters, a former Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “I’m pleased this bipartisan bill was signed into law – which not only helps solidify the Department of Defense’s commitment to Michigan – but provides a pay raise for servicemembers, helps address PFAS contamination and supports innovative military research and development that’s happening in Michigan.”“Michigan is fortunate to have Senator Peters as an advocate who works to advance our priorities and ensures the Michigan National Guard receives the federal investments necessary to support all of our missions,” said U.S. Army Major General Paul D.

In March, Peters was recognized as the #1 most effective Senator in the 116th Congress by the non-partisan Center for Effective lawmaking. Peters earned this recognition based on his ability to enact and advance bipartisan legislation – despite the fact that he was serving in only his first term and was in the minority party at the time. Peters built off this distinction and continued delivering results for Michigan this year, including as Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.Today, Peters released a series of videos highlighting some of the many accomplishments this year. Whether it was:See below on how Senator Peters has achieved results for Michigan this year:Peters helped pass the American Rescue Plan into law to deliver COVID-19 relief to Michiganders. The package included funding to distribute direct stimulus checks, accelerate vaccine distribution, help schools reopen safely, extend unemployment benefits, and support small businesses. As Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters authored provisions in the bill that dramatically ramped up mass vaccine distribution – like we saw at Ford Field. Also included was the expanded Child Tax Credit – a tax cut that has helped support the immediate needs of Michigan families such as food, clothes and child care. The bill also reauthorized and provided $10 billion in federal funding to the State Small Business Credit Initiative, including $1.5 billion set-aside for minority-owned businesses, which helps small businesses grow and create jobs. Peters previously led the effort to reauthorize the program in the Senate and championed the original language creating the program in the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 as a member of the House of Representatives. To further his work to keep the Great Lakes clean, Peters authored and passed legislation into law to create the U.S. Coast Guard Great Lakes Center of Expertise for Oil Spill Preparedness and Response to study the impacts of oil spills in freshwater environments. The inspiration for this bill came in 2017 when the then-Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard told Peters at a hearing that the agency was not prepared for an oil spill in the Great Lakes, saying that more science and research was needed. In October, Peters announced that the Center of Expertise will be headquartered in Michigan with locations in Sault Ste. Marie and Ann Arbor. Peters helped pass the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act into law, which invests in Michigan infrastructure, including roads, bridges, high-speed internet, electric vehicles and the Great Lakes. The legislation provides $1 billion for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI), which is the largest investment in the program in history. In 2019, Peters secured the first increase in GLRI funding since the program was established a decade ago.As Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters secured a historic $500 million provision to help Michigan communities address the impacts of natural disasters as a part of the new law. The Senator secured the first funding for a loan program he created to help states establish revolving loan funds for local governments to carry out mitigation projects that reduce natural disaster risk. These projects could include upgrades to address extreme flooding, shoreline erosion and rising water levels that have put homes, small businesses, property, and communities at risk, and caused millions of dollars in damages – especially in Michigan. Peters authored the bipartisan Safeguarding Tomorrow through Ongoing Risk Mitigation (STORM) Act, which was signed into law earlier this year, to create this new loan program. Peters highlighted how the program could help communities across Michigan like Oak Park and Grand Rapids.  As Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters held a hearing about how communities in Michigan and across the country have been harmed by exposure to toxic Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) connected to military sites. Peters convened the hearing after a Department of Defense (DoD) Inspector General report found that DoD failed to adequately control PFAS contamination at military sites across the nation – resulting in preventable harm to servicemembers, their families, and the surrounding communities. At the hearing, Peters raised the need to hold DoD accountable for their failure to act – and that they must do more to help clean up contaminated sites. ###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-introduces-bipartisan-bill-to-streamline-federal-manufacturing-support-programs,"DETROIT, MI – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI) announced he introduced bipartisan legislation to streamline federal efforts to boost domestic manufacturers and support workers. The Strengthening Support for American Manufacturing Act, which Peters introduced with U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), would assess the U.S. Department of Commerce’s efforts to support manufacturers and suggest solutions to improve the Department’s manufacturing programs to better serve manufacturers – many of which are small businesses. This bill builds on Peters’ efforts to coalesce U.S. manufacturing policy by establishing a National Institute of Manufacturing that would serve as a hub for federal manufacturing programs – and comes as the U.S. works to mitigate global supply chain issues caused by the pandemic that have hurt workers and disrupted industries nationwide.“You can’t be a great country if you don’t make things – and in Michigan, manufacturing has been a core part of our state’s economy. It is essential we have a streamlined federal manufacturing strategy that can support businesses, create good-paying jobs, and secure our economic competitiveness on the world stage,” said Senator Peters, a member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. “However, for too long our country has lacked a coherent, national manufacturing strategy like our foreign competitors – particularly the Chinese government. Additionally, federal support for manufacturers is often fractured, uncoordinated and difficult to navigate. That’s why I was proud to introduce this bipartisan bill to generate a more efficient, unified approach to federal manufacturing policy, and ensure we remain a global manufacturing leader for generations.”“The global supply chain crisis resulting from our dependence on Communist China underscored the importance of strengthening American manufacturing,” said Senator Blackburn. “The Strengthening Support for American Manufacturing Act will streamline programs run by the Department of Commerce to eliminate government waste and improve efficiency. This legislation will benefit the manufacturing community based in Tennessee and across the U.S.”The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report in 2017 identifying 58 programs across 11 different federal agencies that serve U.S. manufacturing, several of which are housed within the U.S. Department of Commerce. The vast number of programs may complicate their administration and presents a barrier to manufacturers knowing about and accessing valuable resources. The Strengthening Support for American Manufacturing Act would address these issues by identifying ways to improve the Commerce Department’s management of these programs, and putting forth legislative recommendations to create a single agency responsible for administering them.Peters has made strengthening domestic manufacturing and supply chains a top priority. He introduced legislation in 2019 to establish the National Institute of Manufacturing to connect manufacturers to critical resources and function as the focal point for developing a national strategy, ensuring American manufacturing policy can rapidly respond to changes in the global marketplace. Peters, who serves as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, Maritime, Freights, and Ports, recently led a hearing that examined ocean shipping supply chain challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and how these supply chain disruptions have caused businesses and consumers to experience major delays and price increases. Peters also championed a provision included in the bipartisan infrastructure law to strengthen Buy American requirements and close loopholes to ensure that the federal government is spending taxpayer dollars on American-made products that support American companies and workers, and create American jobs. In September, Peters’ bipartisan legislation to revamp the Manufacturing.gov website to serve as a one-stop hub to connect manufacturers with federal manufacturing programs and resources passed the U.S. Senate.As part of the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, Peters helped secure provisions to promote domestic production of personal protective equipment and strengthen the Manufacturing Extension Partnership to boost small- and medium-sized manufacturers. The competitiveness bill additionally included Peters’ bipartisan legislation to revive and elevate the National Manufacturing Advisory Council. The Council advises the federal government on manufacturing programs and provides private sector guidance and insight to the federal government, but it has only met intermittently in recent years. Peters’ legislation would revive and elevate the Council, establishing it as a critical component in federal manufacturing policy and strategy.Peters also secured multiple provisions in the competitiveness package to address the ongoing semiconductor shortage, including to create a $2 billion supplemental incentive fund to support the domestic production of mature semiconductor technologies in the coming years and ensure that semiconductor projects that support critical manufacturing industries are given priority status, which would include the automotive sector. This is in addition to $50 billion already in the bill to incentivize the production of semiconductors of all kinds in the U.S.—for a total of $52 billion.

The bill would create a training program to help federal employees responsible for purchasing and managing AI technologies better understand the capabilities and risks they pose to the American people. It would also help ensure the United States maintains a global leadership role in rapidly developing technologies as foreign competitors like the Chinese government continue to prioritize investments in AI technologies. The bill now moves to the U.S. House of Representatives for consideration.“In order to use artificial intelligence properly and in a way that ensures our nation can compete with our foreign adversaries – federal workers need to understand the technical and ethical implications of these technologies for the safety, security, and freedoms of Americans,” said Senator Peters. “This important bill will help our government better understand artificial intelligence and ensure we are using it in a manner that is consistent with American values and our democracy.”The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has raised the need to train the federal workforce on AI, especially those who procure and manage these technologies. While there are clear benefits to using AI, experts remain concerned that if used improperly, this technology could harm U.S. citizens and compromise national security. The Artificial Intelligence Training for the Acquisition Workforce Act would help train federal employees who purchase and manage AI technology for government agencies to ensure it is being used for the betterment of all communities.The bipartisan bill would require the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to provide and regularly update an AI training program for federal employees who manage and purchase this technology for the federal government. The training aims to help federal employees better understand the benefits of AI, as well as the ethical and national security risks posed by these technologies. The legislation also encourages the OMB director to work with scholars and experts from the public and private sectors to create the training. It would also ensure that OMB is tracking the participation and feedback of participants to identify possible ways to improve the training.The legislation builds on Peters’ efforts to ensure AI is used safely and ethically. His bipartisan legislation to secure and protect information handled by federal contractors using artificial intelligence (AI) technology, such as biometric data from facial recognition scans, has advanced in the Senate. A provision Peters helped author to ensure that the use of AI across the federal government is effective, ethical, and accountable by providing resources and guidance to federal agencies was signed into law as a part of last year’s government funding bill.###"

Peters authored the provision requiring the federal agency overseeing pipeline safety to take this action as part of the bipartisan PIPES Act which establishes federal pipeline policy.“The Great Lakes are more than an economic engine and ecological treasure for Michigan – they provide drinking water for over 40 million people and are simply part of who we are as Michiganders,” said Senator Peters, a member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. “We know a pipeline spill in the Great Lakes would be catastrophic. That’s why I applaud PHMSA for formally implementing my provision subjecting the Great Lakes to higher standards for pipeline operators. We must ensure proper oversight is in place and I will continue working to protect the Great Lakes for future generations.”The Interim Final Rule issued today ensures that hazardous liquid pipelines that could affect the Great Lakes or coastal environments are covered by enhanced standards for safety protocols, risk management, inspections, and repairs. For more information about today’s announcement from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) – the federal agency overseeing pipeline safety – click here.Under the PIPES Act signed into law in 2016, Peters authored a provision that designated the Great Lakes as an Unusually Sensitive Area, making pipelines in the Great Lakes subject to higher standards for operating safely. The bill also added coastal beaches and marine coastal waters as areas that should be considered when making an “Unusually Sensitive” determination. Since the PIPES Act of 2016 was signed into law by President Obama, Peters has worked to ensure that PHMSA has the resources to implement legislation into law.Peters has worked to protect the Great Lakes for future generations. Peters successfully worked across the aisle to secure the first increase in Great Lakes Restoration Initiative funding since the program was established a decade ago. The bipartisan infrastructure law that Peters helped pass also includes $1 billion for the GLRI, which is the largest amount of funding provided for the program to date. Peters also cosponsored legislation that was signed into law earlier this year reauthorizing GLRI for another five years.To further his work to keep the Great Lakes clean, Peters authored and passed legislation into law to create the U.S. Coast Guard National Center of Expertise for the Great Lakes to study the impacts of oil spills in freshwater environments. The inspiration for this bill came in 2017 when the then-Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard told Peters at a hearing that the agency was not prepared for an oil spill in the Great Lakes, saying that more science and research was needed. In October, Peters announced that the Center of Expertise will be headquartered in Michigan with locations in Sault Ste. Marie and Ann Arbor.To support local communities facing rising water levels, coastal erosion, and flooding that have put homes, property, and communities at risk, Peters authored and passed the STORM Act into law. The bill authorizes FEMA to help states establish revolving loan funds that local governments could access to help mitigate the impacts of rising water levels, coastal erosion, and other natural disasters in a more cost-effective way. Peters secured an initial $500 million for the program in the bipartisan infrastructure law. ###"

The Navy Supply Corps Foundation Distinguished Alumni Program recognizes individual Supply Corps Officers who have distinguished themselves after their Naval career. Peters was recognized for his dedicated service to Michigan following his distinguished career in the U.S. Navy Reserve.“I am deeply honored by this recognition. My time as a Supply Corps Officer has shaped who I am personally and as an elected official,” said Senator Peters, a former Lt. Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve. “During my time in the Navy Reserve, I served with some of the most patriotic individuals I’ve ever met. For us, it never mattered what our political ideology was – we focused on working together to accomplish our goals. The dedication of those I served with in the Navy Reserve reinforced in me that we must keep the promises we’ve made to those who have worn the uniform and served our country. Joining the Navy Reserve was one of the best decisions I have ever made – and the lessons I learned will continue guiding my work.”Peters volunteered for the U.S. Navy Reserve and was commissioned as a supply corps officer. He served for over a decade in units at Selfridge Air National Guard Base and earned a Seabee Combat Warfare Specialist designation and rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander. His reserve duty included time in the Persian Gulf region supporting Operation Southern Watch. After the September 11th terrorist attacks on our country, he volunteered again for drilling status.Peters has long been an advocate for Michigan’s servicemembers and veterans. Last month, Peters was inducted into the Michigan Military and Veterans Hall of Honor for his efforts to support our nation’s veterans and military. In 2017, Peters was recognized as Legislator of the Year by the Vietnam Veterans of America for authoring the bipartisan Fairness for Veterans Act into law. The legislation requires veteran discharge review boards to give liberal consideration to petitions for honorable discharge status if the servicemember has been diagnosed with PTSD, TBI or other related conditions connected to their military service. As of the fall of 2020, more than 1,500 veterans have had their discharges upgraded since his legislation was enacted.Peters also introduced the bipartisan CADETS Act to expand the Student Incentive Payment Program eligibility age for financial assistance to cadets who attended one of the six State Maritime Academies and commit to a post-graduation service obligation to include any qualified student who will meet the age requirements for enlistment in the U.S. Navy Reserve at their time of graduation. In return for their commitment to serve, cadets can receive up to $32,000 in this incentive payment funding over four years to help offset the cost of tuition, uniforms, books, and living costs.This past January, Peters’ bipartisan bill to strengthen transparency and communication for veterans and caregivers participating in the VA’s caregiver program was enacted into law. Also, Peters’ bipartisan legislation to expand apprenticeship opportunities for veterans and allow them to use their GI bill benefits to secure a registered apprenticeship was signed into law last year. In last year’s defense bill, Peters fought for and helped secure a measure to expand the Department of Veterans’ Affairs list of medical conditions associated with Agent Orange exposure to include bladder cancer, hypothyroidism, and Parkinsonism.###"

The bill would ensure federal agencies are able to quickly and securely adopt cloud-based technologies that improve government operations and efficiency. It will also make FedRAMP more accountable to the American people and create private sector jobs in companies that provide cloud services. The legislation was approved by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, where Peters serves as Chair.“Quickly adopting cloud-based systems will help federal agencies improve digital services for the American people and save taxpayer dollars. While using these technologies will bolster our nation’s competitiveness – we must also ensure they are safe from relentless cyber-attacks and that the sensitive information stored by cloud-based federal systems is secure,” said Senator Peters. “This important bipartisan bill will modernize and expedite the process by which agencies can receive approval to securely use cloud technologies, create good-paying jobs, and incentivize cloud companies to create more effective products.”Cloud storage and other technologies are widely used by the federal government. FedRAMP has defined the responsibilities of federal agencies since 2011 to ensure cloud-based information technology is used appropriately. Updating and making this program permanent will ensure it is accountable to Congress and that cloud-based products procured by federal agencies are secure. Cloud storage and other technologies are widely used by the federal government. FedRAMP has defined the responsibilities of federal agencies since 2011 to ensure cloud-based information technology is used appropriately. Updating and authorizing this program will ensure it is accountable to Congress and that cloud-based products procured by federal agencies are secure. Under FedRAMP, there are currently are more than 200 Cloud Service Providers serving 183 federal agencies. Thirty percent of these providers are small businesses and investing in this technology will help these companies grow their business and hire new workers. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues pushing agencies to adopt these technologies so federal employees can effectively serve the American people while working remotely, Peters’ bipartisan legislation will help ensure that agencies' processes of moving safely to the cloud are streamlined and efficient. Peters’ legislation comes after an announcement from Microsoft, which provides cloud services to multiple federal agencies, that Russia-backed hackers have been relentlessly targeting cloud service companies and others since this summer.The Federal Secure Cloud Improvement and Jobs Act updates and authorizes FedRAMP for five years to ensure that cloud-based information technology can be quickly adopted by the federal government while ensuring that it is secure. The bill modernizes the process by which cloud products are deemed safe and can receive FedRAMP authorization. The legislation also establishes metrics to ensure proper implementation of FedRAMP, and requires the creation of a Federal Secure Cloud Advisory Committee to improve communication between federal agencies who utilize cloud technologies and the companies that provide them.As Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters has led efforts to increase our nation’s cybersecurity defenses. His bill to enhance cybersecurity assistance to K-12 educational institutions across the country was signed into law. Peters secured several provisions in the bipartisan infrastructure law to bolster cybersecurity – including $100 million fund to help victims of a serious attack recover quickly.

https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-bipartisan-bill-to-strengthen-domestic-semiconductor-manufacturing-advances-in-senate,"WASHINGTON, DC – The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee approved a bipartisan bill introduced by U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI) to strengthen federal efforts to expand domestic manufacturing of semiconductor chips. The Securing Semiconductor Supply Chains Act of 2021, which Peters introduced with U.S. Senator Rick Scott (R-FL), would direct the U.S. Department of Commerce’s SelectUSA program – in collaboration with federal agencies and state economic development organizations – to develop strategies to attract investment in U.S. semiconductor manufacturers and supply chains. The bill now heads to the full Senate for consideration. U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) is also a lead cosponsor of the bill.“The ongoing semiconductor shortage has caused major disruptions for Michigan’s manufacturers and automakers, and exposed an overreliance on foreign producers that threatens our economic and national security,” said Senator Peters, a member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. “This bill will shore up our domestic supply chains by boosting our semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and driving investments in American manufacturing. This is particularly critical for our economic competitiveness on the global stage, as others such as the Chinese government continue to invest in research and development of new technologies. I’m pleased that the bill advanced in the Senate, and I’ll continue working to ensure it’s passed into law.”“Commerce Committee passage of the Securing Semiconductor Supply Chains Act today is great news and an important step toward fixing America’s chip shortage that has had negative impacts on families, businesses and our national security,” said Senator Scott. “As Communist China’s aggression grows in this industry, the United States must become more competitive on a global scale and I thank my colleagues for their support of this important bill.”“Tennessee manufacturers rely on semiconductors to support local and global supply chains. The semiconductor shortages made it abundantly clear that we cannot continue to depend on Communist China for critical materials for manufacturing and producing American products,” said Senator Blackburn. “This legislation with Senator Peters will encourage economic development with local leaders to identify resource gaps and address challenges faced by Tennessee businesses in meeting their bottom line.”“As global demands continue to grow and evolve across every phase of the semiconductor process, it is critical that we find innovative opportunities for public/private collaboration as we work to keep the future of this industry planted firmly in the U.S.,” said Quentin L. Messer, Jr., CEO of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation. “We are pleased to support Senator Peters and his colleagues in championing these efforts to strengthen national security and create transformational economic opportunities both here in Michigan and throughout the nation.”“I applaud Senator Peters’ leadership in working across the aisle to advance his legislation that will boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing and strengthen our supply chains,” said Governor Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council. “This critical bill will ensure the state and federal coordination needed to promote American manufacturing and increase economic opportunity for American autoworkers. We support this legislation and urge Congress to pass this bill swiftly so it can be signed into law.”The SelectUSA program was established in 2011 to improve federal efforts that attract job-creating business investments in the United States and support U.S. firms. Peters’ bill comes amid a report issued in June by the Biden Administration, which emphasized that the SelectUSA program could be leveraged to strengthen private sector investments across the semiconductor manufacturing supply chain.The Securing Semiconductor Supply Chains Act of 2021 would direct the SelectUSA program to engage with state-level economic development organizations about how they are attracting foreign direct investment to onshore activities related to semiconductor manufacturing, and identify what resource gaps or other challenges they face in achieving that goal. SelectUSA would then be required to develop strategies to increase investments in semiconductor manufacturing.Peters has repeatedly pressed for action to address the semiconductor shortage crisis. Peters, who serves on the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, secured multiple provisions in the competitiveness package that passed the Senate this year to address the semiconductor shortage – particularly for the future. Peters worked closely with U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (MI) on provisions to create a $2 billion supplemental incentive fund to support the domestic production of mature semiconductor technologies in the coming years and will ensure that semiconductor projects that support critical manufacturing industries are given priority status, which would include the automotive sector. This is in addition to $50 billion already in the bill to incentivize the production of semiconductors of all kinds in the U.S.—for a total of $52 billion.As the authors of the $2 billion supplemental incentive fund provision, Peters and Stabenow recently urged Congressional leadership to ensure their provision is included in the final competitiveness package. Peters also led a letter to the Taiwanese government urging it to increase chip production and do everything possible to mitigate the ongoing chip shortage. Peters has raised this supply chain disruption repeatedly with numerous Biden Administration officials in conversations both before and after President Biden took office – including during a roundtable discussion with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in Michigan last month.In the Build Back Better Act, Peters is also working to establish an office within the Department of Commerce that would monitor supply chains and the U.S. industrial base, as well as take steps to mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities. ###"

Agencies across the federal government face growing cyber threats, but struggle to hire and retain qualified cybersecurity employees.“Cyber-attacks pose a significant threat to our nation and are only becoming more sophisticated and frequent. To fight back against this threat, protect American networks, and safeguard personal information – the federal government must have a highly skilled cyber workforce,” said Senator Peters. “This commonsense legislation will help provide federal cybersecurity professionals with the tools and skills to deter foreign adversaries and criminal organizations from breaching our nation’s information technology systems and disrupting the lives and livelihoods of Americans.”Government agencies often cannot compete with the salaries and other benefits offered by tech giants in Silicon Valley, but they provide valuable opportunities to serve the country and defend our cyber front lines. The Federal Rotational Cyber Workforce Program Act creates a civilian personnel rotation program for cybersecurity professionals at federal agencies. This program would enable employees to serve across multiple government agencies, allowing them to gain experience beyond their primary assignment and expand their professional networks.

The hearing highlighted how these supply chain challenges have led businesses and consumers to experience major delays and price increases. Among those who testified was Paul Doyle of Coastal Automotive, which is headquartered in Michigan.While the underlying supply chain issues are multifaceted, the hearing looked at some of today’s most serious problems – particularly during the holiday season. Specifically, the hearing examined the business and operational practices around ocean shipping that have contributed to these challenges.MLive: Supply chain issues hamper auto industry, but Sen. Gary Peters sees Michigan as part of the solution“Michigan’s automotive industry has been in the crosshairs of the global supply chain disruption since the beginning of the pandemic. On Tuesday, Dec. 7 Sen. Gary Peters led a congressional subcommittee looking for solutions.[…]“In his opening remarks Peters (D-Bloomfield Township) put a spotlight on Michigan not only as a victim of the supply chain disruption but as a potential remedy. He offered the St. Lawrence Seaway between the U.S. and Canada as a possible solution, calling it underutilized.“‘As we explore solutions to strengthen our shipping and supply chains, we must be sure to look to the Great Lakes – I would say our nation’s best coast – to help fill in the gaps when possible,’ Peters said.” WDIV NBC 4 Detroit: Senator Gary Peters among several lawmakers hearing testimony today on the challenges facing the ocean shipping supply chain“Senator Gary Peters among several lawmakers hearing testimony today on the challenges facing the ocean shipping supply chain. Michigan businesses and consumers are dealing with delays and price increases due to the pandemic. Peters says Michigan could be part of the solution.“‘If you look at some of the smartest investments we can probably make in order to bring in even more trade into our country, in a cost effective way, is to have more of that go through the Great Lakes … making investments in those parts to take on additional cargo and commerce would actually help us deal with supply chain issues. It'll be great for the economy in Michigan.’”  WJKB FOX 2 Detroit: Michigan Senator Gary Peters saying one short fix would be to send more products through the Great Lakes that would mean investment in those ports and more jobs for the state of Michigan“The group testified that some progress is already being made to reduce the congestion but more needs to be done. Michigan Senator Gary Peters saying one short fix would be to send more products through the Great Lakes that would mean investment in those ports and more jobs for the state of Michigan.“‘One solution that came out and was certainly encouraged by the folks who were on the panel was that as we see congestion, significant congestion at the ports on our East Coast and our West Coast – a real opportunity is to have more of that trade go up the St. Lawrence Seaway into the Great Lakes and to ports in Michigan.’“As for a long term fix, Senator Peters says the US should build more products at home and not rely on other nations like China.”  WLAJ ABC 53 Lansing: Senator Gary Peters is well known for his work on committees dealing with national defense, but he is also the chair of a subcommittee focused on shipping and maritime policy“Senator Gary Peters is well known for his work on committees dealing with national defense, but he is also the Chair of a subcommittee focused on shipping and maritime policy. That committee held a hearing today to discuss the ongoing supply chain issues facing the US. In his opening remarks, Senator Peters discussed how the supply chain problems have impacted Michigan small businesses and the auto industry. However, he also pointed to how Michigan might be able to help remedy the problem.“‘I believe the Great Lakes ports can play a significant part in reducing backlogs. Ports in Michigan and across the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway system are ready made relief valves that are currently underutilized. And as we explore solutions to strengthen our shipping and supply chains, we must be sure to look to the Great Lakes, I would say our nation's best, coast to help fill in the gaps when possible.’”  WILX NBC 10 Lansing: Peters led a meeting today in Washington to discuss the challenges posed by COVID-19 on the ocean shipping supply chains“‘Small businesses and families throughout Michigan as well as all across the country are experiencing higher prices and major delays associated with importing and exporting their products and their supplies.’“A familiar statement that hits home with business owners and families across the mitten state. Senator Gary Peters, a Democrat from Michigan, is the head of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. He led a meeting today in Washington to discuss the challenges posed by COVID-19 on the ocean shipping supply chains.“‘These shortages and disruptions pose not only a threat to our national security, but also have devastating impacts on Michiganders, their families, businesses, works workers all across the country."" WOOD NBC 8 Grand Rapids: US Senator Gary Peters heard firsthand just how much the supply chain weaknesses globally are hindering business here at home“‘It was clear in testimony today that we need to have more transparency as to what sort of supplies are out there and where the bottlenecks are, so that we can work through this in the short term. The good news is that testimony that we heard today was that things are getting a little better. We hope that that continues to get better as we move forward. But it also was clear that we need to look at the long term. We have to make sure that we're making investments in port facilities to accommodate this trade.’”“Now some of that investment could be right here in Michigan. The Senator said he found it encouraging that ports on the Great Lakes could be used to ease some of the stress on overwhelmed east and west coast ports. That would mean investment in those sports and more jobs here in the state.”###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-stabenow-urge-president-biden-to-prioritize-great-lakes-projects-in-infrastructure-funding,"Lawmakers Ask President Biden to Invest in Soo Locks, Clean Up Areas of Concern and Stop Asian Carp from Reaching the Lakes  WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Senators Gary Peters (D-MI) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today urged President Biden to prioritize projects that impact the Great Lakes Region when implementing the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The lawmakers focused their request on three priorities: funding the Soo Locks modernization project to completion, cleaning up all remaining areas of concern that threaten public health and economic development, and accelerating work at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam to stop invasive carp from entering the Great Lakes.“The Great Lakes are national treasures powering our economy, providing drinking water to over 48 million people, and defining our region’s way of life. These waters support jobs, commerce, agriculture, transportation, and tourism for millions of people across the country. As Senators representing Great Lakes states, we thank you for signing into law the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and we ask that you work to ensure that the following projects of critical importance to the Great Lakes Region receive the funding they require,” said the lawmakers.In addition to Senator Peters and Senator Stabenow, the letter was signed by Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Senator Bob Casey (D-PA), Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Senator Tina Smith (D-MN).The letter can be found here and below.Dear Mr. President:The Great Lakes are national treasures powering our economy, providing drinking water to over 48 million people, and defining our region’s way of life. These waters support jobs, commerce, agriculture, transportation, and tourism for millions of people across the country.As Senators representing Great Lakes states, we thank you for signing into law the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and we ask that you work to ensure that the following projects of critical importance to the Great Lakes Region receive the funding they require.The Soo Locks in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan serves as a gateway to transport nearly 80 million tons of goods and raw material that supply the region's manufacturing, mining, and agricultural industries. The Soo Locks facility currently consists of four parallel locks: the Poe, the MacArthur, the Sabin, and the Davis. However, only the Poe and MacArthur locks are operational, and only the 1,200-foot Poe is of sufficient size for the passage of the vessels that carry 70% of all iron ore between Lake Superior and the lower Great Lakes. It is for this reason that an unscheduled outage of the Poe Lock would devastate the regional and the national economies, harm our manufacturing sector, and threaten our national security. The June 29, 2018, Economic Validation Study and Post Authorization Change Report for the Soo Lock project noted that ""the strategic importance of the Soo Locks cannot be overstated."" And a report by the Department of Homeland Security concluded it was ""hard to conceive"" of a single piece of infrastructure more consequential in terms of impact to the economy from an unexpected and sustained closure.Building a second Poe-sized lock will provide the resiliency needed to ensure this critical infrastructure remains open for commerce, and work on this project – spearheaded by the Army Corps of Engineers – is already underway. As you know, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides $11.6 billion in construction funds to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Given the importance of the Soo Lock project to the Great Lakes region and the national economy as a whole, we urge you to provide in Fiscal Year 2022 the full amount of funding needed to complete the Soo Locks project. Providing this funding up front will not only ensure the project’s timely completion, but also reduce its overall cost.The Great Lakes face serious and urgent threats as decades of environmental damage threaten public health, economic development, and the waters we all rely on. This legacy of pollution is no more clearly felt than in sites of extreme toxic contamination and environmental degradation known as Areas of Concern (AOCs). These 30 sites found across the region, together with degraded former industrial sites or brownfields, are significant impediments to community and economic revitalization. The threats they pose have too often disproportionately impacted our most vulnerable low-income, tribal, and communities of color.Through the Great Lakes Legacy Act, supplemented by the GLRI, the EPA has successfully accelerated the restoration of AOCs. Since 2004, the EPA has mobilized strong collaborative partnerships with states, federal agencies, municipalities, and businesses while leveraging millions of dollars from non-federal sponsors to clean up these sites.Over the next 5 years, the agency has identified construction and restoration projects likely to move forward across 14 AOCs requiring an estimated $1.5 billion in federal funding, potentially leveraging over $650 million in non-federal investment. Without an increased federal commitment, this potential could go unmet as existing funding trends are estimated to only meet a third of the identified federal need in the coming years prolonging public health threats and delaying community and economic revitalization.As such, we ask that your Administration allocate sufficient funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to enable EPA to complete its work on the remaining Areas of Concern.The USACE is undertaking multiple efforts to stop Asian carp from reaching the Great Lakes. These actions are critical to protecting the Great Lakes ecosystem and our $7 billion recreational fishing, $16 billion boating industries, and $6 trillion regional economy.On December 29, 2020, USACE and the State of Illinois signed a design agreement to complete Pre-Construction Engineering and Design (PED) for a comprehensive suite of measures to counter Asian carp at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam, a critical choke point to halt the spread of invasive species in the Illinois River. At present, the electric dispersal barrier in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal is the only structural measure to deter Asian carp from reaching Lake Michigan, which would result in irreparable damage in the Great Lakes.To prevent Asian carp from reaching the Great Lakes now and in the future, we urge you and your Administration to allocate sufficient funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to cover the entire federal contribution for Preconstruction Engineering and Design (PED) at Brandon Road.Thank for your consideration of these requests. We look forward to continuing to work with you and your Administration to ensure the lasting health of our Great Lakes.###"

Peters convened the hearing after a Department of Defense (DoD) Inspector General report found that DoD failed to adequately control PFAS contamination at military sites across the nation – resulting in preventable harm to servicemembers, their families, and the surrounding communities. At the hearing, Peters raised the need to hold DoD accountable for their failure to act – and that they must do more to help clean up contaminated sites.“Exposure to these chemicals, whether through contact with firefighting foam, or contamination found in groundwater sources, presents serious health and environmental risks to first responders, servicemembers, their families, and the communities surrounding these military sites,” said Peters during his opening statement. “According to this report, despite having information that PFAS exposure presented concerning health and environmental risks, the Department of Defense failed to warn servicemembers, their families, and local communities about these potential risks for five years – unnecessarily putting them in harm’s way.”Peters continued: “Moving forward, there is more the Department could do to expand their blood testing plan to better track the long-term health consequences of PFAS exposure. Finally, the Department of Defense must do more to work collaboratively with communities and state and local stakeholders who have suffered from PFAS contamination over the years.”To watch video of Senator Peters’ opening remarks, click here. For text of Peters’ opening remarks, as prepared, click here.To watch video of Senator Peters’ questions for panel 1 click here. To watch video of Senator Peters’ questions for panel 2, click here.   The hearing’s first panel included federal government witnesses from DoD. The second consisted of state-level independent experts – including Tony Spaniola, Co-Chair of the Great Lakes PFAS Action Network. During the hearing, Peters and Spaniola discussed how the PFAS crisis has caused significant harm to Michigan communities. For example, PFAS has contaminated local water supplies as well as fish and wildlife due to firefighting activities at the now decommissioned Wurtsmith Air Force Base in Oscoda, as well as at other sites across the state including Camp Grayling, Selfridge Air National Guard Base, K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base, and the Alpena Regional Airport. More than 2 million Michiganders have been exposed to PFAS contamination in their drinking water and PFAS have been found in every Great Lake. Peters questioned federal government witnesses about the findings and recommendations in the Inspector General report and why DoD failed to alert people about potential harm or exposure to PFAS from military sites on a timely basis. Peters also pressed the first panel of witnesses on why DoD continues to delay remediation efforts at military sites across Michigan and the nation to prevent future harm from exposure to PFAS chemicals – as well as clean up the existing contamination. Both panels of witnesses discussed how these harmful chemicals have affected the human and environmental health of communities across the nation. The committee discussed what more lawmakers can do to ensure the federal government – including DoD – is working with local governments and organizations to combat the PFAS crisis. The hearing is a part of Peters’ long-term efforts to address PFAS contamination in Michigan and across the country. His bill to help protect firefighters and emergency responders from PFAS exposure in the line of duty has passed the Senate. Peters also helped pass the bipartisan infrastructure law, which invests in clean drinking water and includes dedicated funding to address PFAS contamination. He supported or led provisions in the 2019 national defense bill banning the Department of Defense from purchasing firefighting foams containing PFAS. The bill also immediately prohibited the use of firefighting foams containing PFAS in military training exercises, and enhanced state cooperation with the Department of Defense regarding clean-up due to PFAS contamination stemming from military-related activities. In September 2018, Peters helped convene the first hearing on PFAS contamination in the Senate, assessing the federal response to contamination and remediation. He then convened a field summit in Grand Rapids in November 2018 to shine a light on how the local, state and federal governments are coordinating their response to PFAS. ###"

Peters helped pass this historic package through the Senate, which includes funding to distribute direct stimulus checks, accelerate vaccine distribution, help schools reopen safely, extend unemployment benefits, support small businesses and help local and state governments carry out essential functions.“There’s no question Michiganders need more relief from this pandemic – and the American Rescue Plan will provide the shot in the arm Michiganders and folks across the country need to get through this unprecedented public health and economic crisis,” said Senator Peters, Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. “With $1,400 stimulus checks and robust investments to help schools safely reopen and accelerate vaccine distribution, significant relief is on the way to Michiganders. I’ll continue working with the Biden Administration to ensure Michigan has the resources and support needed to defeat this virus and emerge even stronger than before.”“Addressing COVID-19 remains a top priority for Sterling Heights. This pandemic has had a tremendous financial impact on our community, with a $20 million loss in projected revenue. The funding that we’d receive through this bill would help us continue to provide essential services that residents and businesses rely on – including allowing police officers and firefighters to continue responding to emergencies,” said Mayor Michael Taylor of Sterling Heights. “This bill also provides crucial support for vaccine distribution, and our City stands ready to use that support so that we get the vaccine into the arms of all our residents. No matter political party lines, we must take an all-hands-on deck approach to finally defeat this virus. That’s why I thank Senator Peters for his leadership on this bill and throughout this pandemic to support Michigan.”“We appreciate Senator Peters’ efforts to provide aid to small businesses – both in this bill and throughout the pandemic,” said Tim Herman, CEO of the Flint and Genesee Chamber of Commerce. “We’ve been proud to help businesses and restaurants in Flint and Genesee County secure funding and provide technical assistance throughout this crisis. The financial support in this bill will help small businesses – including minority-owned businesses – and is instrumental to jumpstarting Michigan’s economy recovery. We look forward to continuing to partner with Senator Peters in these efforts.”“The American Rescue Plan will help me significantly – in addition to a direct $1,400 stimulus check, I will also receive $1,400 for each of my two children,” said Jessalynn Johnson, a mother of two from Grand Rapids. “This pandemic has put my family through unimaginable challenges. These checks will not only help me pay bills – but also pay down student loan debt and spend more at local small businesses, which supports our community economy during these difficult times. I thank Senator Peters for his push to make sure these checks were included for Michiganders like me and people across the country.”“We need a bill designed to help workers get through this pandemic and emerge stronger than before – and the American Rescue Plan is that bill. When we invest in Michigan workers, our whole economy is better off,” said Cajsa Maki, Field Coordinator of the Upper Peninsula Regional Labor Federation. “Whether it’s expanding help for workers out of a job through no fault of their own – sending stimulus checks to workers so they can make ends meet – or getting the resources needed to open our schools safely, the American Rescue Plan is a huge win for Michigan. We thank Senator Peters for his leadership and for all he’s doing to support Michigan workers.”Measures in the American Rescue Plan that Peters supported or led, particularly through his role as Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, included:###"

In addition, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found that “[a]s of December 2020, there were more than 10.7 million unemployed individuals, compared to nearly 5.8 million individuals at the beginning of the calendar year,” and further warned the “pandemic will likely remain a significant obstacle to more robust economic activity,” wrote the Senators.The Senators continued: “These deaths are unacceptable.  The economic fallout must also be remedied.  As such, we must examine and understand the federal government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and any needed reforms to combat this and future pandemics.”As leaders of the Senate’s primary oversight committee, Peters and Portman are seeking detailed information from the White House, National Archives and Records Administration, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Defense, State Department and the Office of Management and Budget to analyze challenges and flaws in the federal pandemic preparedness and response efforts. The Senators wrote to the National Archives in order to gain access to documents and information related to the previous Administration’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.The committee will examine critical steps during the federal government’s initial pandemic response in the U.S. and identify reforms to strengthen pandemic preparedness and response to prevent future pandemics from significantly affecting our nation’s health, safety and economic security.

Our Guardsmen deserve better. I have shared my concerns with National Guard leadership and Major General William Walker, Commanding General of the D.C. National Guard. I will continue pressing to ensure our Guardsmen have access to safe and adequate food — they have earned nothing less.“I can’t thank our Michigan National Guardsmen enough for all they’ve done – not just during this deployment, but throughout the pandemic in distributing life-saving personal protective equipment, supporting vaccine distribution efforts and assisting in response during the catastrophic dam collapse in Midland County. Our state is forever indebted to them.”  Senator Peters met today with members of the Michigan National Guard. For more photos, click here.###"

The Senate is considering the package that will provide critical aid to Michiganders and Americans across the nation, includes funding to distribute stimulus checks, accelerate vaccine distribution and help schools reopen safely.“We must act quickly to meet the urgency of this moment by swiftly passing the American Rescue Plan,” said Senator Peters. “This is about relief for Michiganders and Americans who are reeling and desperately trying to make ends meet, funding to help schools safely reopen, resources to speed up vaccine distribution and support for small businesses fighting to staying afloat.”“We are beginning to emerge from a very dark winter — but our work is not done,” Senator Peters continued. “We cannot be complacent — we cannot let up. This virus does not take a day off, and so neither can we. There’s widespread support across the country for this package — from mayors, to governors to economists across the political spectrum and the majority of Americans. We must deliver comprehensive and urgently needed relief, and we can do just that by passing the American Rescue Plan.”Click here to watch Senator Peters’ remarks on the Senate Floor. Below are Senator Peters’ remarks, as prepared for delivery:“As we near the one-year anniversary of the Coronavirus pandemic gripping our country, there is no question that Michiganders and people all across our country are still hurting.“While we are making important progress in the fight to combat this virus, this public health and economic crisis continues to take a significant toll — on families — workers who are out of a job— educators — students — small businesses — hospitals — and communities all across our country. “We passed targeted, temporary relief in December. But we knew at that time it was not enough.“We need more robust, meaningful relief.“We must act quickly to meet the urgency of this moment by swiftly passing the American Rescue Plan.“This is about relief for Michiganders and Americans who are reeling and trying to make ends meet – funding to help schools safely reopen – resources to speed up vaccine distribution – and support for small businesses fighting to staying afloat.“I continue to hear from Michiganders from all across the state who are struggling to put food on the table, pay their rent and keep the lights on.“These folks aren’t asking for a handout—they simply want a lifeline to get to the other side of the pandemic.“When we passed $600 relief checks in December, I pledged that we must do more—and that we could do that by providing people with an additional $1,400—to fulfill the promise of $2,000 relief funds.“With the American Rescue Plan, the majority of Michiganders and Americans who received these relief checks in December are going to be eligible once again.“This bill would mean a family of four could receive an additional $5,600.“That support is vital to make sure that people survive and more families do not fall into poverty as a result of this pandemic and can get back on their feet as quickly as possible. “We know that millions of workers across our country, including workers in Michigan — are on the verge of seeing unemployment benefits expire on March 14th.                                                                                             “We cannot abandon folks who are out of work through no fault of their own because of COVID-19. They have seen this pandemic disrupt their jobs and their incomes.“The need for unemployment assistance is widespread — and it is necessary – in Michigan.“For example – there were over 840,000 active claims from Michiganders for unemployment assistance in Michigan in just February. That’s up from 529,000 in January.“And these claims for assistance come from every county all across our state.“We need to act now so these individuals remain eligible for unemployment benefits, including if they were self-employed workers like small business owners, freelance workers, independent contractors or gig workers.“We must ensure families receiving unemployment have enough assistance to get by, which is why I support an additional $400 in weekly benefits.“We also need to provide certainty that this assistance will continue to be there for them in the months ahead, not just for the next few days.“The American Rescue Plan will do just that by bolstering our state unemployment programs with additional federal support through August 29.“To help families get back to work, we all know that we must also safely reopen our schools.“Many parents and educators are struggling to assist children through lessons while juggling other work and caregiving demands during the pandemic.“The American Rescue Plan reflects a point of consensus that we want our students to return to in-person learning as quickly and safely as possible – and that the more resources we can provide the better.“In response to the negative impact that COVID-19 has had on education, a stronger and urgent investment in our schools is absolutely critical for achieving safe operations and recovering from gaps in learning.“That is why the American Rescue Plan is absolutely essential. This legislation will provide $170 billion in emergency funding to our schools and to our students, with $130 billion for K-12 schools.  “The funding will help schools take steps based on science and recommended by the CDC to ensure students and educators can safely return to the classroom.“This includes repairing ventilation systems —reducing class sizes and implementing social distancing guidelines — purchasing personal protective equipment — and hiring support staff to care for students’ health and for their well-being.“Every family and community has been facing a very unique set of challenges. And we need to provide robust funding relief so schools and parents have what they need to keep children connected with learning opportunities that are both safe and effective. “And while these are important steps — we also know that if we’re going to come back stronger from this pandemic, we also need to support the backbone of our economy, which is our small businesses.“While we have passed several rounds of relief for small businesses, too many of our hard-hit small businesses are still reeling — from restaurants — to boutiques — to family-owned and minority-owned businesses.“The American Rescue Plan has significant small business relief — including: $25 billion in grants for restaurants and bars that have lost revenue because of the pandemic; $15 billion for Economic Injury Disaster Loan Advance grants; $7 billion in funding for Paycheck Protection Program loans and expanded eligibility for non-profits.“Additionally, this package reauthorizes and provides $10 billion in federal funding — including $1.5 billion specifically for minority-owned small businesses — to the State Small Business Credit Initiative.“I was proud to help establish this program in 2010 while serving in the House of Representatives.“This program is a proven success. In Michigan, it has helped small businesses create or retain over 12,000 jobs and it strengthens state programs that support financing of small businesses, allowing them to both grow and create more jobs.“I am pleased to again champion this program — and with additional investment — it will again provide crucial support to small businesses in Michigan and all across our country. “And finally — to completely get this pandemic under control — we must ramp up the distribution of vaccines. That’s one of my top priorities as Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.“Thanks to the extraordinary work of our scientists, researchers and vaccine makers — especially those in my home state of Michigan — we now have three safe and effective vaccines.“But I know that many people have been frustrated and downright angered by the difficulties they have experienced trying to secure vaccines for their loved ones or for themselves.“But I’m encouraged that President Biden and his Administration have been working tirelessly to expand vaccine production and speed up vaccine distribution.“But to get these additional vaccines in arms, it will take additional resources. Through my work on the Senate Homeland Security Committee — I have been leading the charge to ensure that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has the essential staff — supplies —transportation — and other resources necessary to ensure every vaccine dose is actually reaching the arms of Americans.“I have spoken with President Biden both in the Oval Office and at the Pfizer facility in Portage, Michigan about the critical need to expedite the deployment of vaccines — and do everything in our power to ensure vaccines are free and widely available to every community as quickly and efficiently as possible.“The American Rescue Plan includes $50 billion to help FEMA support a national vaccination program to efficiently administer vaccines — including in underserved communities.“It also provides frontline medical professionals the personal protective equipment, testing supplies and workforce needed to slow and to eliminate the spread of COVID-19.“All of these resources are mission critical as FEMA plays a leading role in assisting the federal government’s response to COVID-19 — by coordinating medical supply acquisition and distribution — and assisting state and local governments with funds for response activities —such as vaccine distribution and overtime pay for public health officials.“As we consider the American Rescue Plan there are signs of hope — particularly with ramped-up vaccine production.“We are beginning to emerge from a very dark winter —but our work is not done.“We cannot be complacent — we cannot let up. This virus does not take a day off — and so neither can we.“We must pass the American Rescue Plan. This package is not only what the American people need but it is what they want.“There’s widespread support across the country for this package — from mayors, to governors to economists across the political spectrum and the majority of Americans.“We must deliver comprehensive and urgently needed relief — and we can do just that by passing the American Rescue Plan.“This package will not mark the end of our efforts to crush this virus, but it will provide a massive shot in the arm — to help families, to safely open our schools and to accelerate the deployment of vaccines.“I urge all of my colleagues to support the motion to proceed and final passage.”###"

Peters pushed for information on how our nation’s law enforcement and intelligence agencies misjudged the likelihood of violence and why a response from the National Guard was delayed once the building was breached. Peters also continued to raise the alarm about domestic terrorism and how our national security apparatus has not effectively focused on this growing and deadly threat.Peters convened the bipartisan oversight hearing jointly with Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Roy Blunt (R-MO), Chairwoman and Ranking Member of the Rules and Administration Committee, to examine the security and intelligence failures that led to a breach of the U.S. Capitol and ensure such an attack never happens again. This was the second joint hearing examining the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The previous hearing featured testimony from current and former officials responsible for securing the area surrounding the U.S. Capitol on the preparations and response efforts on January 6, 2021.Testifying before the committee were: Melissa Smislova, Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary, Office of Intelligence and Analysis, Department of Homeland Security; Jill Sanborn, Assistant Director, Counterterrorism Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation; Robert Salesses, Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Homeland Defense and Global Security, Department of Defense; and Major General William J. Walker, Commanding General of the District of Columbia National Guard.“The January 6th attack must mark a turning point. There can be no question that the domestic terrorist threat – including violence driven by white supremacists and anti-government groups – is the gravest terrorist threat to our homeland security,” said Peters, in part during his opening statement. “Today’s witnesses are uniquely qualified to discuss what intelligence was produced in the days leading up to the attack – what officials missed as they assessed the likelihood of violence that day – and why our intelligence community failed to heed the crystal clear warnings that were broadcast on social media and publicly reported in the days leading up to the 6th – that a violent attack on the Capitol was imminent.”Peters continued: “The January 6th attack on the citadel of our democracy remains a dark stain on our nation’s history. Our committees have a responsibility to continue that each of us have a responsibility to carry out our oversight duties in a serious and nonpartisan way.” To watch video of Senator Peters’ opening remarks, click here.

In our conversations, she has made clear her commitment to addressing challenges affecting Michigan workers: whether it is getting through this pandemic – honing a greater federal focus on manufacturing strategy – or more aggressively using the tools at the Commerce Department to self-initiate investigations into trade abuses.“Through my role as Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I also look forward to working with Secretary-designate Raimondo on strengthening the Census Bureau and ensuring an accurate census – which the previous Administration repeatedly undermined. There is no shortage of pressing challenges facing our economy and our nation, but I know Secretary-designate Raimondo is prepared and equipped for this new role.”Peters has spoken with Raimondo on key Michigan priorities and secured commitments to work together on issues including strengthening manufacturing and ensuring a level playing field against unfair trade practices that have hurt workers like Michigan’s cherry growers.###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-releases-gao-report-showing-more-action-is-needed-to-address-pfas-contamination,"Peters will Continue to Champion Efforts to Fight PFAS Crisis & Help Michigan CommunitiesDETROIT, MI – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, released a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) that shows the federal government needs to take further action to clean up and prevent contamination from per- and polyfluoralkyl substances (PFAS). The report found that the Trump Administration made limited progress in protecting communities and drinking water resources from exposure to toxic “forever” chemicals known as PFAS, and much of the progress identified in the report was due to Congressional efforts.  Peters originally requested the report in 2019, along with U.S. Senator Tom Carper (DE), to obtain information about ongoing federal agency efforts to address the PFAS contamination crisis and to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being used effectively.“Exposure to PFAS chemicals continues to harm the health and wellbeing of families in Michigan and across America. This report clearly shows that while progress is being made, the federal government must step up their efforts to ensure our drinking water is safe and protect communities from these hazardous chemicals,” said Senator Peters. “From establishing a national drinking water standard to securing the resources needed to cleanup affected communities– I will continue working with the Biden Administration to ensure we address PFAS contamination in Michigan and across the nation.”“Communities across the country are impacted every day by exposure to PFAS chemicals in their drinking water,” said Senator Carper. “This report lays out where we stand on addressing this critical issue affecting millions of Americans, and its findings are crystal clear: we have a lot of work to do. I’ll be continuing the fight in Washington to ensure all families have access to clean water.”READ THE REPORT HEREThe report found that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has made some progress on only three out of six regulatory actions laid out in a 2019 plan to address the PFAS crisis. This includes measures required by the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), including ensuring that products containing PFAS chemicals are not imported into the United States without first being reviewed by the EPA. However, the report also found that under the previous Administration, the EPA failed to complete three additional regulatory actions laid out in their plan to combat these harmful chemicals, including taking a step back on efforts to designate PFAS as a hazardous substance. Peters is committed to working with the Biden Administration to quickly implement science-based safeguards to address the PFAS crisis.As the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters has led Congressional efforts to address PFAS contamination in Michigan and across the country. Peters supported or led provisions in the 2019 national defense bill banning the Department of Defense from purchasing firefighting foams containing PFAS. The bill also immediately prohibited the use of firefighting foams containing PFAS in military training exercises, and enhanced state cooperation with the Department of Defense regarding clean-up due to PFAS contamination stemming from military-related activities. His bill to help protect firefighters and emergency responders from PFAS exposure in the line of duty passed the Senate last year. In September 2018, Peters helped convene the first hearing on PFAS in the Senate, assessing the federal response to contamination and remediation. He then convened a field summit in Grand Rapids in November 2018 to shine a light on how the local, state and federal governments are coordinating their response to PFAS.###"

He urged the Senate, which is scheduled to begin considering the package next week, to pass it swiftly. The American Rescue Plan includes funding to distribute direct stimulus checks, accelerate vaccine distribution and help schools reopen safely.Peters supports the American Rescue Plan and has spoken directly with President Biden and Vice President Harris in the Oval Office about the need to swiftly pass this legislation. Last week, he joined President Biden during a visit to Pfizer’s facility in Portage, where they thanked Michigan workers and discussed the importance of ramping up vaccine production and equitable distribution.“As we close in on the one-year anniversary of this pandemic gripping our nation, it’s very clear that more action is needed to deliver urgent relief to struggling Michiganders and emerge from this public health and economic crisis,” said Senator Peters, Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. “Whether it’s direct stimulus checks – ramping up vaccinations – or ensuring schools have the resources to safely re-open – the American Rescue Plan has the robust relief needed to help our state and country get through this pandemic. The vast majority of Americans – as well as mayors, governors, business leaders and economic experts from across the political spectrum – support this bill, and I will work with my Senate colleagues to swiftly pass this package and send it to the President’s desk.”Critical provisions in the American Rescue Plan include:###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-asks-biden-administration-to-increase-transparency-on-northern-border-pandemic-travel-restrictions,"Peters Continues to Fight to Expand Safe and Accessible Northern Border Travel for MichigandersDETROIT, MI – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, is asking the Biden Administration to prioritize communication and provide clear information to Michiganders and Americans on continuing land border travel restrictions at the Northern Border. In the letter, Peters requested additional information to ensure Michiganders are aware of current protocols, and requested that the Administration publicly disclose criteria driving the status of the protocols, and clearly state how they intend to begin easing travel restrictions while ensuring that health and safety protocols related to the pandemic are being followed.“I, as well as my constituents from Michigan, have concerns about the impacts of land border travel restrictions on border communities—personal and economic. I share your goals to establish public health protocols that protect the lives of Americans, improve the safety of travel, and promote the revival of our economy. To achieve these goals, I urge you to consider several matters for public health protocols for travel at land ports of entry,” wrote Peters.Peters continued: “We must also ensure public health protocols protect DHS frontline workers who have continued to facilitate trade and travel at land ports of entry throughout the pandemic. I appreciate your administration’s commitment to reviewing the public health measures at land ports of entry with a goal of making travel safe and galvanizing our economy.”The letter also asks the administration consider how restrictions could be clarified or adjusted to address concerns of cross-border communities. These communities currently face unique challenges due to travel restrictions, which are made worse due to differences between U.S. and Canadian exemption policies for categories, such as family.As the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters has fought to strengthen border security and ensure secure and efficient lawful trade and travel at Michigan’s ports of entry. Peters has pressed for more personnel at Michigan’s border crossings to ensure that trade and travelers can cross safely and efficiently, and his bill to hire more agricultural inspectors at our ports of entry was signed into law last year. A bipartisan measure coauthored by Peters was signed into law requiring federal officials to assess all ports of entry, including finding ways to reduce wait times for passengers and cargo at the border. Peters has also fought to address inconsistencies in the cargo screening standards for Michigan’s ports, including the Port of Monroe, to ensure Michigan remains a key hub for international commerce.Text of the letter is copied below and available here.February 26, 2020Dear President Biden:I write to request your consideration of several matters as you review agency recommendations for public health protocols at land borders following your Executive Order on Promoting COVID-19 Safety in Domestic and International Travel. I, as well as my constituents from Michigan, have concerns about the impacts of land border travel restrictions on border communities—personal and economic. I share your goals to establish public health protocols that protect the lives of Americans, improve the safety of travel, and promote the revival of our economy. To achieve these goals, I urge you to consider several matters for public health protocols for travel at land ports of entry.In the implementation of public health measures at land ports of entry, it is essential to prioritize communication and clarity to our citizens. I have consistently raised the importance of transparent communication about the status of border restrictions with affected communities. As you consider public health protocols, I urge you to include procedures to clearly communicate current protocols, publicly disclose criteria driving any travel restrictions or measures, and the intended stages for off-ramping restrictions. It is also critical to provide clear information about what is required to determine an individual’s exemption from restrictions, such as proof of vaccination or other documentation.The restrictions at land ports of entry, which were recently extended and will soon reach one full year, were urgently set into place at the beginning of the U.S. and Canada spread of the virus and have seen few changes. Over this period, Michigan’s cross-border communities have faced challenges conducting daily life. These communities have integrated economies and work forces, as evidenced by the thousands of healthcare workers that live in Canada and work in Detroit. Such challenges are compounded by differences between U.S. and Canadian exemption policies for categories, such as family. As I have previously asked the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), I urge the administration to consider how restrictions may be clarified or adjusted to address the concerns of cross-border communities as agencies engage the Canadian government to evaluate the status of public health measures.We must also ensure public health protocols protect DHS frontline workers who have continued to facilitate trade and travel at land ports of entry throughout the pandemic. I appreciate your administration’s commitment to reviewing the public health measures at land ports of entry with a goal of making travel safe and galvanizing our economy.In Michigan, cross-border travel is inherently essential and I look forward to working with you so that we may fully return to it.###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-reintroduces-legislation-to-ensure-public-buildings-utilize-energy-efficient-lighting,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, reintroduced a bipartisan bill that would help save taxpayer dollars by directing the General Services Administration (GSA) to install the most life-cycle cost effective and energy efficient lighting in public buildings. The bill previously passed through Committee during the 116th Congress.“Utilizing the most energy efficient lighting systems in public buildings could save taxpayers in Michigan and across the nation millions of dollars in the long run,” said Senator Peters. “I am proud to introduce this legislation and will continue my bipartisan efforts to make our federal buildings more energy efficient, and ensure that taxpayer dollars are being used effectively as possible.”“Investing in energy efficiency helps reduce our energy usage, which means less pollution in our air and lower costs,” said Nick Occhpinti, government affairs director for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters. “The BRIGHT Act is commonsense legislation to save money and reduce energy usage. We thank Sens. Peters and Johnson for their leadership on moving us toward cleaner, more efficient energy use.”“The path to halt climate change’s devastating toll requires tough decisions, vigilance and diligence, but Sen. Peters’ BRIGHT Act is a bright spot; it’s simple and cost-effective,” said Conan Smith, President and CEO of Michigan Environmental Council. “Not only will it limit fossil fuel use as we transition to a clean energy future, it puts the taxpayer dollars those fossil fuels burn through to better use. As our nation, states like Michigan and cities like Ann Arbor set bold carbon neutrality goals, the BRIGHT Act serves as a guiding light.”Currently, there is no legal guidance in the federal government to maximize long-term cost and energy savings across lighting products. The bipartisan Bulb Replacement Improving Government with High-Efficiency Technology (BRIGHT) Act requires the GSA Administrator to ensure that public buildings are using the most life-cycle cost effective and energy efficient technology to the extent practicable when performing normal maintenance, altering or constructing public buildings. The bill also requires GSA to issue guidance to federal agencies, and state, local and Tribal entities to further streamline efficiency and effectiveness across government. GSA previously released a series of reports that calculated that switching to LED lightbulbs would result in millions of dollars in cost-savings due to their superior lifespan and energy efficiency.As top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters has led several efforts to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent effectively and efficiently. A law written by Peters, the MEGAByte Act, has saved taxpayers more than $450 million since 2016. Peters’ bipartisan bill to save taxpayer dollars by updating policies to help federal agencies adopt electric vehicles, which are more energy efficient than traditional gas-powered vehicles was also signed into law last year. ###"

I have long been concerned about our supply chain security and have raised alarms through my role on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.“Today’s executive order takes important and necessary steps to better secure our supply chains against vulnerabilities – particularly the semiconductor shortage currently impacting the auto industry in Michigan and around the U.S. I look forward to working with the Biden Administration to address the current semiconductor shortage crisis and will continue fighting for autoworkers in Michigan and across the country.”Peters has repeatedly raised the alarm and worked to address our nation’s supply chain shortages, and supports the Biden Administration’s decision to use the Defense Production Act to help address these shortages. Earlier this month, Peters joined a bipartisan letter to the Biden Administration, urging them to take swift action to address the semiconductor shortage and mitigate impacts on the American auto industry. Peters has raised this supply chain disruption repeatedly with numerous Biden Administration officials in conversations both before and after President Biden took office.In 2019, Peters released a report on the rising prices of prescription drugs and ways to lower costs. The report delved into shortages and supply chain challenges and how dependence on foreign sources could lead to national security risks. He previously sent a letter to the FDA pressing them on their efforts to counter drug shortages. Before the pandemic took full grip of the country, Peters led a bipartisan effort pressing the Administration for information on the security of the nation’s medical supply chain, as COVID-19 inched closer to the country. Peters raised alarms that COVID-19 could lead to shortages of critical drugs and medical equipment.Last year, Peters passed bipartisan legislation into law shoring up our nation’s agricultural supply chain to ensure the safe and secure trade of agricultural goods across our nation’s border.###"

Peters pushed for information about breakdowns in intelligence gathering, security preparations and the delayed response during the first oversight hearing on the Capitol attack.Peters convened the bipartisan oversight hearing jointly with Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Roy Blunt (R-MO), Chairwoman and Ranking Member of the Rules and Administration Committee, to examine the security failures that led to a breach of the U.S. Capitol and ensure such an attack never happens again. The committees heard testimony from current and former officials responsible for securing the area surrounding the U.S. Capitol on the preparations and response efforts on January 6, 2021, when a criminal mob was able to breach the Capitol complex. Testifying before the committee were: Robert Contee, Acting Chief, Metropolitan Police Department; Michael Stenger, former Senate Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper; Paul D. Irving, former House Sergeant at Arms; and Steven Sund, former Chief, U.S. Capitol Police.“There is no question that there were colossal breakdowns in the intelligence gathering and security preparations leading up to the events of January 6th – as well as during the coordination and response efforts once the attack got underway,” said Peters, in part, during his opening statement. “Our goal today is to begin to understand where those breakdowns and failures occurred – and to determine if there are policy and structural changes Congress must make to prevent a future attack of this nature.” Peters continued: “As the committees charged with oversight, strengthening homeland security and maintaining Capitol operations – we have a solemn duty to thoroughly examine the security breakdowns and make needed reforms. I am hopeful we will be able to work together and carry out this responsibility in a serious and a nonpartisan way…The attack on January 6th was an extraordinary event that requires exhaustive consideration. The American people deserve answers on why their Capitol was breached.”  To watch video of Senator Peters’ opening remarks, click here.

https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-stabenow-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-strengthen-american-manufacturing-and-create-jobs-in-michigan,"The Make It in America Act will Ensure the Federal Government Spends Taxpayer Dollars on American-Made GoodsWASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Gary Peters (MI) and Debbie Stabenow (MI) today introduced their bipartisan bill to strengthen our Buy American laws. The Make It in America Act will make it harder for federal agencies to use waivers to get around Buy American requirements, requiring the federal government to give preference to American companies and spend taxpayer dollars on American-made products and American jobs.Peters has led numerous efforts to support American manufacturers and workers. This past December, Peters’ bipartisan bill to grant Manufacturing Extension Partnerships (MEP) federal funding to help small and medium-sized manufacturers across the country expand growth, maintain staff and adapt to market changes was signed into law. Peters also previously introduced bipartisan legislation to ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to buy American-made iron, steel and manufactured products for federally funded infrastructure projects. Additionally, Peters previously introduced legislation that would address outsourcing and reform the tax code to reward businesses that bring jobs back from foreign countries.“Ensuring that the federal government is spending taxpayer dollars on products made by American workers will create jobs and level the playing field for our small businesses and manufacturers,” said Senator Peters, a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. “I’m proud to join Senator Stabenow in announcing this commonsense legislation that would strengthen Buy American rules, invest in Michigan and American workers and help rebuild a stronger economy.”In 2018, Senator Stabenow released her Buy American report that found exceptions and waivers to the Buy American Act allowed federal agencies to spend $92 billion on foreign-made products between 2008 and 2016. Senator Stabenow’s Make It in America Act addresses the abuses identified in this report. The bill is part of her American Jobs Agenda, which will ensure we are making products in America, closing loopholes that send jobs overseas, and holding countries like China accountable for unfair trade practices.“Michigan’s workers and manufacturers are the best in the world. This bill would make sure they are first in line when it comes to government contracts and spending. It’s common sense that American tax dollars should be used to create American jobs by purchasing American products, not products made overseas,” said Senator Stabenow.  Each year, federal agencies spend billions in taxpayer dollars to buy products from the private sector. The 1933 Buy American Act requires federal agencies to give preferential treatment to manufacturers of high quality, American-made goods and products. Unfortunately, loopholes, waivers, and outright violations have allowed federal agencies to buy products overseas — leaving our American manufacturers behind. The Make It in America Act would close loopholes in our Buy American laws and make waivers public. For example, the bill would stop the use of the “public interest” waiver if a foreign contract would decrease American employment. The bill would also increase American-made content from 50 to 75 percent to ensure that manufactured products bought by the federal government are made with American-made components. The bill would also require that each waiver to the Buy American Act be publicly posted online with detailed justifications. The bill would create a new “Made in America Office” within the Office of Management and Budget, charged with reviewing waivers to the Buy American Act and ensuring compliance with other Buy American laws. This office mirrors President Biden’s executive order to create a central office dedicated to enforcing Buy American laws.Finally, the Make It in America Act would give small- and medium-sized American manufacturers the first opportunity to provide products for federally-funded transportation projects.###"

While there, Peters joined President Biden in thanking the Michigan workers and researchers who are manufacturing and distributing COVID-19 vaccines across Michigan and the country.“It was great to welcome President Biden back to Michigan today in one of his first official trips as President. This visit is a reflection of all the Michigan workers who have been involved in this extraordinary undertaking. Their efforts are not only saving lives but bringing us closer to finally defeating this virus,” said Senator Peters. “As Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, I will continue working with the Biden Administration to ensure that vaccines are free and widely available to every community as quickly and efficiently as possible.”Peters was also on MSNBC’s Morning Joe this morning to preview the visit and discuss vaccination efforts and the need to pass robust COVID-19 relief through the American Rescue Plan. You can watch that interview by clicking here.As Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which oversees FEMA, Peters has pressed for not only an increased pace in getting vaccines into peoples’ arms, but he has also called for a comprehensive distribution plan to help cash-strapped states better distribute vaccines. He has also urged better communication with local communities so they too have visibility into how much vaccine supply they can expect. That’s a challenge he discussed with President Biden and Vice President Harris in the Oval Office earlier this month. Peters also supports the American Rescue Plan, which will provide robust relief to not only ramp up vaccination efforts, but provide resources needed to support workers, provide stimulus checks and support small businesses.###"

The Subcommittee oversees a number of key priorities for Michigan, including the federal agency that oversees pipeline safety and the agency responsible for issuing guidance related to self-driving vehicles and technology.The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) oversees pipeline safety across the country. Senator Peters has worked with PHMSA in raising concerns regarding Line 5, which runs underneath the Straits of Mackinac, and has passed bipartisan legislation into law strengthening the agency’s emergency authority to take action to address unsafe pipeline conditions that risk harming public health and safety or the environment. Peters also previously authored provisions that were signed into law designating the Great Lakes as a high consequence area and improving oil spill response plans to address ice cover.“The Great Lakes not only provide drinking water for 40 million people, but they are also an economic driver for our state and are simply part of who we are as Michiganders,” said Senator Peters. “We already know how a pipeline spill in Michigan can have long-term and damaging consequences. A pipeline spill in the Straits of Mackinac would be catastrophic for Michigan – we must do everything we can to protect the Great Lakes for future generations, and I look forward to continuing to work with PHMSA through my subcommittee chairmanship.”The Committee additionally oversees the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), an agency that works closely with the American auto industry. Peters has repeatedly called for a federal framework to usher in the safe deployment of new mobility technologies that will transform the industry, including self-driving vehicles.“We must position ourselves as the global leader in automotive innovation for the future, and that means ensuring we have up-to-date guidelines so that self-driving vehicles can be safely deployed, consumers can be protected and these life-saving technologies can be developed and built in the United States,” said Senator Peters. “I’ve been encouraged by my conversations with President Biden’s Administration, and I’m looking forward to working with my colleagues on a framework that will strengthen the American auto industry and autoworkers while prioritizing safety and innovation.”In addition to PHMSA and NHTSA, the Surface Transportation, Maritime, Freight, and Ports Subcommittee additionally oversees the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Amtrak, the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, the Transportation Security Administration (Rail & Pipeline Security), the Surface Transportation Board, the National Transportation Safety Board (Surface Safety Programs), the Maritime Administration and the Federal Maritime Commission.###"

After carefully listening to all the evidence presented in this trial, it is overwhelmingly clear that Donald Trump violated his oath of office by inciting a violent, deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol and our democracy.“The facts show that Trump intentionally promoted false conspiracies — including here in Michigan — that provoked an assault on the peaceful transfer of power. The bipartisan vote to hold Trump accountable in both the House and the Senate reflects the gravity of his misconduct. “My focus remains on the challenges that the Senate must address — first and foremost is the need for a robust COVID relief package that addresses the health and economic crisis Michigan is facing. We must provide more support to help struggling families and small businesses, speed up vaccine distribution, give resources to help schools safely reopen and help communities on the frontlines, so they are not forced to lay off health professionals, teachers, firefighters and law enforcement officers.”  ###"

This historic legislation will save moms’ lives, end racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes, and achieve maternal health justice for women of color. The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world and the only rate that is rising. Michigan has a rate of 16.4 deaths per 100,000 live births.The Momnibus builds on existing maternal health legislation and the Black Maternal Health Momnibus of 2020 with 12 bills to comprehensively address?the drivers of the maternal health crisis.?The Momnibus makes critical investments in addressing social determinants of health, funding community-based organizations, growing and diversifying the perinatal workforce, and improving data collection processes. The?Momnibus also?includes new legislation to address the impacts of COVID-19 on maternal and infant health. “No new mother seeking medical attention in order to give birth should ever be denied access to quality health care,” said Senator Peters. “It is unconscionable that African American women and their newborns are much more likely to experience preventable health complications – and even pass away – than other patients. This maternal health crisis has existed for far too long – and this pandemic has only shined a greater light on the need to address it. It is past time that we close this resource gap and make commonsense investments to save women’s lives, and that’s why I’m proud to help introduce this bill.”“As one of the wealthiest countries with some of the best health care in the world, the high rate of maternal and infant mortality in the United States is a complete travesty,” said Senator Stabenow. “What makes these rates even more outrageous is that these deaths are preventable. This legislation is an important step forward in addressing these unacceptable disparities in maternal health care for communities of color.” The maternal mortality rate in the United States is significantly higher among Black women, who are three to four times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy-related complications. Hispanic, Native American, and Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) women also suffer from disproportionately high rates of adverse maternal health outcomes.The Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act is composed of multiple bills sponsored by Black Maternal Health Caucus Members.

The legislation will improve government transparency by requiring federal agencies to publish easily understandable justifications for their budget requests on a single, central website each year. Congressional budget justifications are plain-language explanations of how agencies propose to spend money that they request from Congressional appropriators. The materials would also be posted on each agency’s website. The bill was unanimously approved by the committee and passed by the House last Congress.“Hardworking Americans have a right to know how their hard earned tax dollars are being spent, but it can be incredibly difficult to find this information,” said Senator Peters. “With the federal government spending more than $100 million in Michigan alone, it is important that we strengthen accountability for government agencies and reassure Michiganders that their tax dollars are being put to good use. That is why I am proud to reintroduce this bipartisan bill and will fight for its swift passage into law.”“Ohioans and all Americans should be able to easily evaluate how the federal government is spending their hard-earned tax dollars,” said Senator Portman. “This bipartisan legislation will improve federal government transparency by requiring federal agencies to publish their annual budget justifications on a centralized website. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation to ensure the transparency Americans deserve on government spending.”""Spending is often how the federal government makes its priorities clear, and federal agency Congressional budget justifications are the plain-language requests of where and how the Executive branch would like Congress to spend the American people's money,"" said Daniel Schuman, policy director, Demand Progress. ""Sens. Peters and Portman's legislation would make sure the federal government puts its money where its mouth is by requiring agency requests for funding to be publicly available on a central website so everyone can understand what funds federal agencies have requested and why.""“Senators Peters and Portman should be commended for leading the way on this commonsense good government bill,” said Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, Government Affairs Manager at the Project on Government Oversight. “It is absolutely essential that Congress and the public have access to information as to how federal agencies are spending taxpayer dollars and the Congressional Budget Justification Transparency Act will go a long way toward ensuring that access.”The Congressional Budget Justification Transparency Act would amend the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 to require that agency budget justifications be made publicly available on a centralized, searchable website, as well as each agency’s own website. It also requires the Office of Management and Budget to keep an updated list of agencies that are expected to submit budget justifications, the date of submission to Congress, the date the justification is posted online, and a link to the materials online.###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-stabenow-colleagues-urge-biden-administration-to-address-global-semiconductor-shortage-mitigate-impacts-to-us-auto-manufacturing,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senators Gary Peters (MI) and Debbie Stabenow (MI) joined their colleagues in a bipartisan push, urging the Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese to work with Congress in addressing the global semiconductor shortage facing auto manufacturing. In addition to this letter, the Senators have been urging a number of Biden Administration officials directly to take action.“We write to express our concerns about the impact that the global shortage of automotive-grade semiconductor chips will have on auto manufacturing in the United States. This shortage threatens our post-pandemic economic recovery, the consequences of which stand to be especially acute in dominant auto manufacturing states like ours,” wrote the Senators. “We believe that the incoming administration can continue to play a helpful role in alleviating the worst impacts of the shortage on American workers, and we urge you to work with us to address the global semiconductor shortage.”In their letter, the Senators highlighted how the shortage threatens to disrupt the post-pandemic economic recovery and may impact production in communities across the country – including in Michigan. “All sectors of the economy need access to semiconductor chips, however we ask that the auto industry be recognized as the significant semiconductor consumer it is in any engagement,” continued the Senators. “We also strongly urge you to support efforts to secure the necessary funding to swiftly implement the semiconductor-related provisions in the most recent National Defense Authorization Act, which would boost the production of semiconductor manufacturing and incent the domestic production of semiconductors in the future. While this is not an immediate fix, this engagement is also vital to maintain the competitive advantage of American auto manufacturing.”Peters and Stabenow were joined in the letter by Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), John Cornyn (R-TX), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Todd Young (R-IN), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Mike Braun (R-IN), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Tim Scott (R-SC), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), and Lindsey Graham (R-SC).The full letter can be found below and here.Dear Director Deese,We write to express our concerns about the impact that the global shortage of automotive-grade semiconductor chips will have on auto manufacturing in the United States. This shortage threatens our post-pandemic economic recovery, the consequences of which stand to be especially acute in dominant auto manufacturing states like ours. We believe that the incoming administration can continue to play a helpful role in alleviating the worst impacts of the shortage on American workers, and we urge you to work with us to address the global semiconductor shortage.Automobiles have come a long way over the last 100 years.  Today’s cars are full of high-end electronic components that improve vehicle efficiency and safety.  These electronic components rely upon semiconductors to function; they are just as essential to a modern car as the engine and transmission.  Therefore, we are concerned about the consequences that the global shortage in semiconductors poses for the auto assembly and supplier sector. In what should be good news for our country’s economic recovery, demand for cars and trucks is now up, yet auto manufacturers unfortunately lack the necessary number of semiconductor chips to produce vehicles to meet that demand.  Already some auto companies have idled U.S. plants and/or curtailed certain vehicle production in the United States as a result of the shortage of these key components. For every job on an automobile or light-truck assembly line, ten additional jobs are created or supported in the economy.  As Senators from auto states, we are therefore concerned about the impact of the semiconductor shortage on our workers, our communities, and the nation’s broader economic recovery. Encouraged by your past support of the auto industry, we believe you can play an important role in reducing the impact of the global semiconductor shortage and take action to encourage increased production to meet immediate market needs. Specifically, we hope that you will consider engaging with semiconductor-producing nations, as well as the leading semiconductor manufacturing companies on this important issue.Your leadership will help ensure that adequate quantities of semiconductors are made available for purchase by auto companies and their suppliers producing in the United States.  All sectors of the economy need access to semiconductor chips, however we ask that the auto industry be recognized as the significant semiconductor consumer it is in any engagement. We also strongly urge you to support efforts to secure the necessary funding to swiftly implement the semiconductor-related provisions in the most recent National Defense Authorization Act, which would boost the production of semiconductor manufacturing and incent the domestic production of semiconductors in the future.  While this is not an immediate fix, this engagement is also vital to maintain the competitive advantage of American auto manufacturing. We thank you for your attention to the global semiconductor shortage, and we appreciate your consideration of our request.###"

The Small Business Access to Capital Act would reauthorize and provide $10 billion in federal funding to the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI), which helps small businesses grow and create jobs. SSBCI funds the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and other state-led lending programs that leverage private financing to help small businesses access the capital they need.“Since the onset of this pandemic, small businesses in Michigan and across the country have gone above and beyond to support their local communities during this critical time. We must ensure small businesses have the resources they need to get through this pandemic,” said Senator Peters, a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. “I have been proud to champion the State Small Business Credit Initiative because it is a proven success in our state, and proper investment in the program today could provide crucial support to small business owners across the nation. I’m pleased to help reintroduce this bill, and I look forward to working in a bipartisan manner to ensure that our small business owners receive the help they have earned.”“The COVID-19 crisis has taken an incredible toll on small businesses in our state and across the country, and made us appreciate even more their importance to our communities and our economy. Given the stress of this pandemic on so many small businesses, access to capital is more important than ever. I look forward to working with Senator Peters to pass this legislation,” said Senator Stabenow.“Michigan has been a leader in utilizing the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) to boost investment and create jobs in hard times like these. With $100 million in SSBCI funding, we’ve been able to leverage nearly $600 million in investments and helped businesses create or retain over 12,000 jobs across the state,” said Governor Whitmer. “We stand ready and eager to deploy new funds and thank Sen. Peters for his leadership to renew, improve, and expand this critical program through his important legislation. This will go a long way to help us grow Michigan’s economy and support countless jobs as we come out of the pandemic.”“Michigan businesses are doing everything they can to survive and thrive during COVID-19, building on successful partnerships between state and federal governments to provide access to capital is a critical win for businesses who are the backbone of our economy and their communities,” said Brad Williams, Vice President of Government Relations, Detroit Regional Chamber.“The MBA appreciates Senator Peters willingness to put forth legislation to help small businesses in Michigan,” said T. Rann Paynter, President & CEO, Michigan Bankers Association. “Michigan’s well-established track record speaks to our success in leveraging innovative programs and funds like SSBCI to support our state’s workforce during times of crisis,” said Mark A. Burton, CEO, Michigan Economic Development Corporation. “Businesses of all industries and sizes benefit from the impact of the SSBCI funding helping to create economic opportunities for Michigan workers. Senator Peters’ leadership in establishing and supporting this program has been critical for Michigan’s economy, and this legislation will help advance our state’s path to economic recovery.”“The Michigan Credit Union League supports programs that help leverage public funds for providing capital to small businesses. Senator Peters has consistently sought to help small businesses with their capital needs, especially those hardest hit in tough economic times like these,” said Dave Adams, President and CEO, Michigan Credit Union League. “The Small Business Access to Capital Act of 2021 would help state economic development entities gain access to additional SSBCI funds that have recently been exhausted due to extraordinary pressures on these small businesses.”""CDFA is grateful to Senator Peters for his continued leadership on the State Small Business Credit Initiative,"" said Toby Rittner, President and CEO, Council of Development Finance Agencies (CDFA). ""Small business support programs are urgently needed, and state development finance agencies are ready to immediately deploy capital to businesses through this innovative and proven program.""Michigan is home to over 870,000 small businesses that employ nearly 50% of the workforce in the state. Michigan previously exhausted all SSBCI federal funding, expending over $100 million that leveraged a total investment of nearly $600 million, including private capital. This investment has helped businesses create or retain over 12,000 jobs across the state.The Small Business Access to Capital Act – which Peters and Stabenow previously introduced in 2020 – builds on the initial program's success by providing an additional $5 billion in formula funds to all states based on the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 Peters championed as a member of the House of Representatives. Michigan would receive over $260 million in new formula funding: more than every state except Florida and California. The bill will also create a new, competitive $5 billion pool of funding for states that have already capitalized on funding from the 2010 program, equaling $10 billion in funding for the program in total.###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-leads-colleagues-in-reintroducing-bipartisan-bill-to-protect-firefighters-from-hazardous-pfas-chemicals,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, reintroduced a bipartisan bill to help protect the health and safety of firefighters, emergency responders and the communities they serve. The Protecting Firefighters from Adverse Substances (PFAS) Act, which passed the Senate last Congress, directs federal agencies to develop best practices, training, and educational programs to reduce, limit and prevent exposure to PFAS, also known as ‘forever chemicals’ because they do not naturally break down. The bill would also require guidance to be issued on alternative foams and personal protective equipment that do not contain PFAS.“Protecting firefighters from harmful exposure to dangerous PFAS chemicals is the least we can do for these heroes who put their lives on the line to keep our communities safe,” said Senator Peters. “I am proud to reintroduce this bipartisan bill that will help protect the health and safety of first responders by limiting their exposure to these harmful chemicals in the line of duty.”“Firefighters are exposed to harmful PFAS chemicals when fighting fires, which could result in disastrous health consequences,” said Kevin Sehlmeyer, State of Michigan Fire Marshal. “By introducing this legislation, Senator Peters continues to show his clear commitment to protecting Michigan’s firefighters from PFAS exposure by providing resources to ensure these brave heroes, who risk their lives to keep our communities safe, are not unnecessarily put at risk in the line of duty.”""Fire fighters have dedicated their lives to protecting others and keeping their communities safe. Unfortunately, these brave men and women are exposed to dangerous ‘forever chemicals’ while serving their communities, subjecting them to higher risks of cancer and other serious health effects,” said Harold A. Schaitberger, General President of the International Association of Fire Fighters.  “The IAFF supports measures to address these chemicals and commends Senators Peters for his continuous efforts to help protect fire fighters, emergency medical responders, and the communities they serve from unnecessary PFAS exposure.""“I thank Senator Peters for his continued leadership on the PFAS Act,” said Chief Richard R. Carrizzo, the President and Chairman of the Board of the International Association of Fire Chiefs. “As we learn more about PFAS, it is important for fire departments to adopt policies to reduce firefighters’ and the general public’s exposure. This legislation will develop helpful guidance that local fire departments can use. I welcome the PFAS Act’s reintroduction and urge Congress to pass it as soon as possible.”“I’d like to thank Senator Peters for his leadership in introducing the PFAS Act. Firefighters have a greater risk of contracting and dying from cancer than the general public as a result of duty-related exposures,” said Steve Hirsch, Chairman of the National Volunteer Fire Council. “Enactment of this important legislation will lead to improved health and safety outcomes for firefighter, EMS, and rescue personnel.”Emergency response teams are frequently exposed to harmful per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in firefighting foams and personal protective equipment as they work to keep communities safe. PFAS substances have been linked to a number of health problems, including certain cancers.The Protecting Firefighters from Adverse Substances (PFAS) Act would direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) – in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Fire Administration, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health – to develop educational resources to help protect firefighters, emergency response personnel, and the communities they serve from PFAS exposure. This would include information for federal, state, and local firefighters on training and best practices to prevent and reduce exposure to PFAS from firefighting foams and protective gear, as well as resources that identify alternatives for firefighting tools and equipment that do not contain PFAS. Peters was joined by U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and Thom Tillis (R-NC) in introducing the bill.As top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters has led Congressional efforts to address PFAS contamination in Michigan and across the country. Peters supported or led provisions in the 2019 national defense bill banning the Department of Defense from purchasing firefighting foams containing PFAS. The bill also immediately prohibited the use of firefighting foams containing PFAS in military training exercises, and enhanced state cooperation with the Department of Defense regarding clean-up due to PFAS contamination stemming from military-related activities. In September 2018, Peters helped convene the first hearing on PFAS in the Senate, assessing the federal response to contamination and remediation. He then convened a field summit in Grand Rapids in November 2018 to shine a light on how the local, state and federal governments are coordinating their response to PFAS.###"

We’re in an unprecedented economic and public health crisis. It’s very clear that we must pass robust relief for Michiganders who are struggling to put food on the table, afford their bills and make ends meet – and we must pass this relief swiftly. The relief bill that was passed late last year cannot be the final round of assistance.“That’s why I support the American Rescue Plan, which will extend unemployment benefits and include $1,400 stimulus checks to individuals, increase support for small businesses, include resources to speed up vaccine distribution, and help our schools safely reopen under the guidance of public health officials and experts.“As the Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, I also discussed the importance of FEMA’s role as we work to increase the pace of getting vaccines into people’s arms and improve communication with local communities so they too have visibility into how much vaccine supply they can expect.“I agree with the bipartisan group of economists, mayors and governors in saying that we must act boldly and quickly – and that not doing enough can jeopardize our ability to get through this pandemic. I will continue working to ensure Michigan and communities across the country have the resources and support needed to emerge from this stronger than before.”###"

From securing our Northern Border and boosting Michigan’s role as a hub for international commerce, to shoring up cybersecurity vulnerabilities and addressing the rise of white supremacist and anti-government violence – I’ll continue my efforts to ensure the federal government is fulfilling its top mission to keep Americans safe.”Peters continued: “Congress has a responsibility to ensure that taxpayer dollars are used efficiently and that the government is providing high quality services to people in Michigan and across the country. Whether it’s working to preserve the U.S. Postal Service’s longstanding tradition of reliable delivery, cutting wasteful spending or conducting thorough oversight of government programs, I will continue working to make government more efficient and effective for all of the people it serves.”Peters’ initial priorities as Chairman include:In addition to chairing the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee in the 117th Congress.###"

From domestic terrorism – including the rise of white supremacist violence – to cyberattacks from foreign adversaries – to tackling a deadly pandemic – DHS continues to face daunting challenges. Challenges that have only been made more difficult to address due to years of chaos during the previous Administration.“That is why former Homeland Security Secretaries, from both Republican and Democratic Administrations, senior homeland security officials, and law enforcement organizations have urged the Senate to quickly confirm Mr. Mayorkas because they know he is well-prepared for the difficult tasks that lie ahead. “The Department of Homeland Security needs leadership, and it needs it now. By voting to confirm Mr. Mayorkas, this body can show every American we are committed to ensuring they are safe and secure.”###"

From ushering in technological revolutions, to redefining culture, to advancing civil rights, their remarkable achievements have had an immeasurable impact on our state and the entire country.“While we celebrate these great leaders of the past, we must also recognize the history being made today. My friend and former Senate colleague Kamala Harris is now the first black woman to serve as Vice President, and Lloyd Austin has become the first black Defense Secretary in our country’s history. We are also finally seeing expedited efforts by the new Administration to place Harriet Tubman on the 20-dollar bill. She continually risked her life so that people like Vice President Harris and Secretary Austin could one day pursue their dreams.“Although there have been significant strides, there is still so much more that needs to be done. Let us remember the sacrifices and contributions of African Americans not just this month, but throughout the entire year as we all work to build a more inclusive society that lives up to the highest ideals of our nation.”###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-stabenow-governor-whitmer-applaud-president-bidens-actions-to-reopen-health-insurance-marketplace,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Gary Peters (MI) and Debbie Stabenow (MI) and Governor Gretchen Whitmer welcomed the announcement by President Biden that he will use his executive authority to reopen the federal marketplace selling Affordable Care Act health plans. During the COVID-19 crisis, millions of Americans have lost their health insurance. The open enrollment period for 2021 insurance coverage ended on December 15, 2020. President Biden’s executive order reopens the sign-up period and provides people in Michigan without insurance the opportunity to secure the critical coverage they need during this unprecedented public health crisis. The special enrollment period will begin on February 15, 2021 and end on May 15, 2021. People in Michigan looking to sign up for health coverage should visit healthcare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596.“Michigan families shouldn’t need to worry about accessing quality, affordable health coverage for the care they need – especially during this pandemic,” said Senator Peters. “I’ve repeatedly pressed to reopen enrollment because we are in an unprecedented public health crisis and Michiganders need access to health care coverage. I’m glad President Biden’s Administration is taking this important step to reopen enrollment and I look forward to working with them to get through this pandemic together.” “Michigan families shouldn’t have to choose between getting care for COVID-19 and being left with thousands of dollars in bills that they’re unable to pay,” said Senator Stabenow. “President Biden’s reopening of the health insurance marketplace comes at a critical time for our state. He knows that families in Michigan are in desperate need of help right now and need access to affordable, comprehensive health coverage.” “No Michigander should have to worry about access to quality, affordable health care, especially during a pandemic,” said Governor Gretchen Whitmer. “In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Michigan saw an estimated 46% increase in the number of uninsured adults, and there are still thousands of people who need coverage. President Joe Biden’s executive order to reopen the health insurance marketplace will go a long way in expanding health coverage to Michiganders, and I couldn’t be more grateful for his leadership during this difficult time.”From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Peters, Stabenow and Whitmer have repeatedly called for actions to make it easier for those without health insurance to acquire coverage through the health insurance marketplaces.In October, the senators sent a letter requesting an extension of the enrollment period. Governor Whitmer also requested an extension for the open enrollment period. In March, the senators urged the Trump Administration to open a special enrollment period so that people without health insurance could purchase a health care plan through the health insurance marketplace.###"

When a violent mob breached the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, Officer Goodman diverted a group of rioters away from the Senate Chamber, delaying their access to the Senate chamber and protecting the lives of those inside. Peters introduced the bipartisan bill with 34 of his Senate colleagues, and companion bipartisan legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives was introduced. The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest civilian honor bestowed by Congress.“When the citadel of our democracy was under siege earlier this month, Officer Eugene Goodman did not flinch, and his quick, heroic actions may have saved lives,” said Senator Peters, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. “The Senate and our country owe him a debt of gratitude. His courage and brave actions will never be forgotten, and I hope that we can come together to recognize Officer Goodman by awarding him the Congressional Gold Medal.”Text of the legislation can be found here.###"

During Raimondo’s confirmation hearing today, Peters secured commitments to work together on a number of key priorities, including a need for a comprehensive manufacturing strategy and federal policy and ensuring a fair playing field for workers like those in Michigan’s cherry industry who have been hurt by unfair trade practices. Peters previously met with Raimondo shortly after she was nominated to lead the Department of Commerce.“We’re in an unprecedented economic crisis due to the pandemic. We need strong leadership at the Commerce Department to jumpstart our economy, create jobs and build back better,” said Senator Peters. “In my conversations with Secretary-designate Raimondo — and at today’s hearing — she has demonstrated a commitment to strengthening our manufacturing sector and standing up for American workers. I urge my colleagues to quickly confirm her nomination through the Senate, and I look forward to working with her and the Biden Administration to advance a number of issues important to Michigan.” Peters discusses Michigan priorities with Secretary of Commerce-designate Gina Raimondo. You can watch the video by clicking here.Peters previously introduced the National Institute of Manufacturing Act that would establish an independent federal institute to serve as the hub for federal manufacturing programs that would be led by a Chief Manufacturing Officer (CMO) responsible for creating and implementing a National Strategic Plan for Manufacturing across the executive branch. The National Institute of Manufacturing Act would coordinate federal manufacturing programs across multiple agencies in order to better address both short-term supply chain issues caused by the Coronavirus pandemic and longer-term problems related to a lack of a national manufacturing strategy and accountability for implementing a strategy. The legislation was supported by a number of organizations, including Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, the Alliance for American Manufacturing, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, the Michigan Manufacturing and Technology Center (MMTC) and the American Foundry Society.Peters has fought tirelessly for Michigan’s cherry growers. He has met with Michigan cherry growers and has heard firsthand about how illegal dumping and unfair trade practices from countries like Turkey have devastated their businesses. Peters introduced bipartisan legislation that would create a task force within the Department of Commerce to investigate potential trade abuses for small and medium-sized industries. Under current law, the Commerce Department has the authority to self-initiate investigations into dumping and subsidies, but rarely utilizes this authority. The majority of their investigations begin only after companies or industry representatives lodge formal complaints. Small and medium-sized businesses, including agricultural producers, manufacturers, parts suppliers, and paper goods producers, often lack the resources needed to identify unfair practices and bring them to the attention of the Commerce Department. Peters’ legislation would better ensure the Commerce Department has the resources needed to support American businesses looking to expand both here at home and throughout the international marketplace.###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-statement-on-president-bidens-buy-american-executive-order,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI) today released the following statement on President Biden’s Buy American executive order to strengthen American manufacturing:“In Michigan, we make things – it has always been in our DNA, and I firmly believe that you cannot have a strong economy or nation without a robust manufacturing sector. President Biden understands that and has always stood with the American worker. His plan focuses on the immediate support needed to grow and protect American businesses in a time when our country is facing an economic crisis unlike any other. Michigan and American workers can outcompete and outwork anyone – and prioritizing them will better ensure that we can get through this pandemic together and stronger than before.“I have pushed for more Buy American policies, and I’m also glad to see President Biden directing federal agencies to utilize the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, which I have worked to strengthen in order to connect agencies to small and medium-sized manufacturers. As incoming Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I’m looking forward to working with the Biden Administration to ensure we strengthen our supply chain and invest American taxpayer dollars in American businesses.”This announcement builds on Peters’ efforts to support domestic manufacturers. Peters previously introduced bipartisan legislation to ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to buy American-made iron, steel and manufactured products for federally funded infrastructure projects. In November, the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee advanced Peters’ bipartisan Helping Manufacturers Respond to COVID-19 Act, which would grant Manufacturing Extension Partnerships (MEP) throughout the country federal funding to help carry out their mission of providing resources to help manufacturers expand growth, maintain staff and adapt to market changes. This legislation was enacted into law, as part of a larger bill, in December 2020.Last July, Peters worked to include an amendment providing grants to Manufacturing Extension Partnerships (MEP) to help small manufacturers meet cybersecurity requirements as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021 which he helped to pass in December. Peters also authored bipartisan legislation that was signed into law in 2020 to adjust federal cost-share ratios and implement new accountability and oversight provisions within the MEP program. Peters also authored the original provisions of the CARES Act, signed into law in March, which authorized a waiver of the cost-share requirements.###"
https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-backs-biden-plan-to-increase-coronavirus-vaccine-and-medical-supplies-using-defense-production-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, joined 26 of his Senate colleagues in supporting President Joe Biden’s plan to quickly utilize all available authorities under the Defense Production Act (DPA) to rapidly increase the production of COVID-19 vaccines and stockpiling of other critical medical supplies in the United States. Companies and workers across Michigan are continuing to produce the supplies needed to respond to the pandemic. Fully utilizing the DPA will provide them with support and certainty from the federal government to ensure that their hard work helps get the pandemic under control.The DPA has not been fully utilized as a part of the federal pandemic response. This has created continued supply chain issues with dangerous impacts on the nation’s efforts to control the pandemic, including scaling up vaccine production and distribution. In their letter to Biden, Peters and his colleagues expressed support for executive action to utilize all authorities under the DPA to increase the supply of coronavirus vaccines available to all Americans.“The DPA can help us reach our goal of vaccinating enough of the American public to achieve herd immunity by ramping up production of sterile needles, rubber stoppers, syringes and other vaccine supplies now,” wrote the Senators.The Senators continued: “We need to use every tool available to make up the ground we have lost. The DPA could also be used to regulate vaccine distribution, ensure that companies do not charge for the vaccine in the future and enhance production of materials needed for vaccines to address future pandemics.”As the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters has led several efforts to ensure development of the Coronavirus vaccine is rooted in science and transparency and that its distribution is efficient, swift and equitable. Peters previously pressed the Trump Administration for information on their preparations to meet the enormous challenge of coordinating the wide distribution of Coronavirus vaccines. He also released a report highlighting shortcomings in the Trump Administration’s vaccine distribution plans and providing recommendations to ensure that vaccines are safe, effective, trusted by the public, free, and widely available to every community – which included utilizing the DPA. Peters also introduced legislation to address shortages of medical supplies and personal protective equipment by encouraging domestic production.The full text of the letter is available here.  ###"
