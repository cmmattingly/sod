https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-votes-to-advance-electoral-count-act-reforms-in-key-committee,"September 27, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) today joined with a bipartisan group of Senators in the Senate Rules and Administration Committee to advance a package of comprehensive Electoral Count Act (ECA) reforms by an overwhelming vote of 14-1. The Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act – which contains several policy recommendations from Senator King’s ECA discussion draft released in February – seeks to update procedures for the counting and certification of electoral votes for the presidency. Before the committee vote, Senator King identified two amendments he declined to offer during today’s proceedings: one that would randomize judges to review challenges, in order to avoid “forum shopping”; the other, a clarifying amendment that would state that votes can only be rejected due to legitimate procedural issues, not due to a member disliking the outcome of the election.The bill now heads to the Senate floor for consideration by the full body.“Today, the Senate Rules and Administration Committee took a critical step to better protect American democracy and remove dangerous ambiguities from our presidential elections,” said Senator King. “The need for these reforms could not be more clear. In 2021, factions attempted to exploit the outdated Electoral Count Act to overturn the results of a free and fair election and stoke violence at our capitol. Now, as some continue to raise doubts about our electoral system, we must ensure that the ECA cannot used as a weapon against our democracy by disappointed candidates of either party. The Electoral Count Reform Act prevents abuse of the 1887 law by clarifying the Vice President’s role in counting electoral votes, raising the threshold needed for Congressional objection to the elections, and ensuring that there are not multiple slates of electors submitted by a state. All told, this makes the process for certifying a presidential election clearer and more resistant to attack.“Make no mistake, this bill is no substitute for the comprehensive voting rights and process reforms we need to confront the wider challenges facing our democracy,” Senator King continued. “While I continue to look for ways to better protect the democratic process for all Americans registered to vote before and on election day, this effort will better guarantee that the will of the voters cannot be undermined after votes are cast. I’m heartened to see the bipartisan support this package received and I look forward to the full Senate passing these reforms before the conclusion of this Congressional session.”The Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act updates the outdated and vague 1887 Electoral Count Act to ensure that electoral votes tallied by Congress accurately reflect the will of the voters in each state. The bill replaces ambiguous provisions with clear procedures to ensure the counting of electoral votes can’t be exploited. Key provisions in the bill include: Senator King has been a leader on reforming the Electoral Count Act (ECA) of 1887, and in February, released a discussion draft with Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) to inform Senate-wide efforts to update the law to reflect 21st century threats. Last month, in a hearing of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, King questioned election experts on ECA reform proposals and what provisions must to be in any final bill to effectively protect America’s electoral process."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/collins-king-join-bill-to-give-maine-same-sex-couples-tax-refunds-they-should-have-received,"September 27, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King are co-sponsoring legislation allowing same-sex couples to claim tax refunds that were denied to them before nationwide recognition of their marriages occurred. The Refund Equality Act would give same-sex couples in states like Maine who were able to marry before the Supreme Court’s Windsor decision the larger federal tax refunds received by similarly situated, heterosexual married couples during those years. During the years between the first state legalization of same-sex marriage in 2004 and federal recognition for tax benefits in 2013, straight couples who filed jointly could claim multiple standard deductions that same-sex couples were not eligible for. “Maine voters legalized same-sex marriages in our state nearly a decade ago, and since Obergefell, all Americans have had the right to marry the person whom they love,” said Senator Collins. “We should not have a situation where married couples are treated differently from other married couples.  This bill is another important step to promote equality and prevent discrimination.”“Marriage is one of life’s great gifts; it brings companionship, love, and support. Along with the obvious personal and emotional benefits of partnership, marriage is also supposed to present financial benefits and the ability to claim joint deductions that can result in significant tax savings,” said Senator King. “All married couples who qualify for these tax refunds deserve them, but for too many years, legally wedded same-sex couples in Maine and across the nation were not eligible. The Refund Equality Act would right this wrong and allow same-sex couples to receive the tax refunds that were withheld before they received federal recognition of their marriages. This bill is purely about fairness, giving people what they are owed, and recognizing the many promises of marriage.” Prior to the Supreme Court’s 2013 Windsor decision, the Defense of Marriage Act (“DOMA”) prevented federal recognition of same-sex marriages. In 2004, while the DOMA was still in effect, Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage, and Maine later did so in 2012. In the intervening years between state legalization and federal recognition, same-sex spouses could be married in states where it was legal, but could not file a federal joint income tax return. This often meant that same-sex couples received fewer tax deductions and benefits than heterosexual couples who could file jointly did. The Refund Equality Act enables same-sex couples who were legally married before federal recognition to re-file their tax returns for those years as “married, filing jointly,” – receiving any tax benefits that separate filing status denied them. "
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/with-threats-on-rise-king-backs-legislation-to-protect-election-workers,"September 26, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King, a member of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration with oversight over federal elections, is cosponsoring comprehensive legislation to address the rise in threats targeting election workers. The Election Worker Protection Act would provide states with the resources to recruit and train election workers and ensure these workers’ safety, while also instituting federal safeguards to shield election workers from intimidation and threats. The bill includes provisions that were developed with input from election officials across the nation – including Maine’s Secretary of State Shenna Bellows.“Democracy doesn’t run itself  – it takes thousands of hardworking people working across the country to ensure Americans’ voices are heard,” said Senator King. “As threats against election officials rise, we have a responsibility to protect these patriotic Americans as they work to maintain the foundation of our historically rare democracy. Along with funding for additional training and recruitment, the Election Worker Protection Act will give election workers the support they need to do their jobs and stay safe from those seeking to undermine our very system of government. It is sad and deeply frustrating that this bill even needs to be discussed, but with the continuing prevalence of anti-democracy conspiracy theories pushed by extreme political factions, I fear it has become a necessity.”A group of 15 Secretaries of State, including Maine’s Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, joined a letter supporting the Election Worker Protection Act and calling on Congress to take action to protect election workers.“Additional action is needed at the federal level to ensure that all election workers have the necessary support and protection to do their jobs. The Election Worker Protection Act makes clear that these attacks on election workers will not be tolerated,” wrote the Secretaries. “We know what tools are needed to protect election workers, and we look forward to working with Congress to advance this legislation.”The Election Worker Protection Act would: Senator King has been one of the Senate’s most outspoken voices for the need to protect American democracy against growing threats and increase voter trust. In October 2021 he delivered an impassioned speech on the Senate floor urging action on voting rights, stating that we are currently “at a hinge of history” that will determine the future of the American experiment in self-government. He built on these arguments in a speech from the Senate floor where he called for reforms to the filibuster to allow for common sense voting rights legislation to pass. In addition to the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, Senator King cosponsored the For the People Act and Senator Jon Ossoff’s (D-Ga.) Right to Vote Act, which would establish a first-ever statutory right to vote in federal elections — protecting U.S. citizens from laws that make it harder to cast a ballot. He also released the draft Electoral Count Modernization Act to shape the conversation around establishing clear, consistent, and fair procedures for the counting and certification of electoral votes for the presidency."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/with-overdoses-rising-senators-king-and-capito-designate-september-as-national-recovery-month,"September 26, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Angus King (I-Maine) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W. Va.), today applauded the unanimous passage of their bipartisan resolution designating September, 2022 as “National Recovery Month.” The Senators’ resolution comes as overdoes are rising across the nation. 2021 saw a 15 percent increase in overdose deaths nationwide, with communities across the country losing over 100,000 loved ones – including 600 in Maine, a record high for the state. The resolution specifically recognizes the many challenges contributing to growing substance use disorders and the need for more community resources and education to help address the crisis.In addition to Senators King and Capito, the resolution was cosponsored by Senators Joe Manchin (D-W. Va.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.).“To anyone suffering from substance use disorders, your communities and loved ones are here for you – we see you and we want to help,” said Senator King. “The last few years have not been easy, there have been periods of immense stress, difficult isolation, and unexpected hardships for all Americans. These conditions have been even more challenging for those battling substance use disorders. During this year’s National Recovery Month, we must recommit ourselves to supporting those struggling with this deadly public health issue, providing more resources to address our nation’s opioid epidemic, and becoming more compassionate as communities. Together, recovery is possible.”“Raising awareness of the available treatment and recovery measures is incredibly important as addiction continues to devastate communities and families in West Virginia and across the country. I am hopeful that with this resolution, which designates the month of September as ‘National Recovery Month,’ that more people will become educated about treatment options and supports for those in recovery. This is a critical component of the spectrum of solutions needed to save lives and fight back against the scourge of addiction, and I am proud to lead my colleagues in introducing this resolution,” Senator Capito said.“The drug epidemic continues to ravage our communities across West Virginia. From April 2021 to April 2022, we lost 1,420 West Virginians to drug related overdoses, and the COVID-19 pandemic made this heartbreaking issue much worse,” Senator Manchin said. “Every West Virginian has been impacted by substance use disorder, and it is our responsibility to provide our family, friends and neighbors with the support and recovery services they need and deserve. I am proud to join my bipartisan colleagues in designating September as National Recovery Month to help bring awareness to this crisis facing so many of our fellow West Virginians and Americans.""“Every New Mexican deserves to live a life free from substance use disorder, and have the opportunity to access the support and medical care necessary to reach their fullest potential. As we continue to address the opioid epidemic, it is vital that we remove the stigma surrounding recovery services and support our friends and family in recovering from substance use disorder,” said Senator Luján. “I’m proud the Senate passed this resolution that recommits us to the importance of better serving those experiencing substance use disorder and providing a pathway to recovery.”Thirteen percent of Americans reported starting or increasing substance use during 2020, largely due to increased stress and isolation from the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s estimated that the total cost to the country from substance abuse disorders, including the costs of healthcare, lost productivity, and involvement of the criminal justice system, is $78,500,000,000 annually – a figure that continues to grow. Senators King and Capito have consistently worked on a bipartisan basis to address America’s tragic substance use disorder epidemic. Along with their annual designation of September as National Recovery Month they have joined on efforts to improve telehealth, create a better approval process for opioids, and to support mental health outreach. "
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senator-kings-september-podcast-highlights-inflation-reduction-act-benefits-to-maine,"September 24, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Office of U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) today released the September episode of Senator King’s “Inside Maine” podcast, in which Senator King and his guests discussed the significant benefits coming to Maine communities from the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act – a historic package to address rising energy and healthcare costs, fight climate change, create jobs and cut the deficit. Senator King was joined by four expert guests who helped to explain key commonsense provisions in the bill: Senator Tim Kaine (D-Virginia), AARP Maine State Director Noel Bonam, Executive Director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association Jeremy Payne, and Maine Society of CPAs Treasurer Mike Santo. During the conversation, Senator King and his guests discussed how the fully-paid-for bill will reduce drug costs for seniors, support America’s  affordable energy future, and make the IRS work better for Maine taxpayers.“The Inflation Reduction Act is a historic effort to lower healthcare and energy costs, fight climate change, and reduce the deficit,” said Senator King. “Included in the package are commonsense provisions that will save Maine people thousands of dollars a year on their energy bills, and reduce drug costs for seniors by capping Medicare recipients’ out-of-pocket drug costs and allowing Medicare to finally negotiate the price it pays for pharmaceuticals. The law also includes my provisions to reduce the deficit by trillions by fully funding the IRS and making sure massive corporations are paying their fair share. It was great to be joined by four experts on Inside Maine this month who helped preview the tangible benefits this bill will have for Maine people. I look forward to keeping in touch with them to hear their continued work on the issues facing Maine.”Senator King was first joined by Senator Tim Kaine (D-Virginia) who worked with Senator King on many of the bill’s key provision – including to go after wealthy tax cheats and invest in clean energy. Senator Kaine gave an overview of the package, and highlighted several of the key parts of the bill that will make a difference for working people in Maine and Virginia.Next, King spoke with AARP Maine State Director Noel Bonam who had previously urged Senator King to ensure Medicare drug price negotiation was included in the bill. Bonam explained the importance of the drug pricing provisions, and what it will mean for Maine seniors. He specifically pointed to the out-of-pocket cost cap as a “gamechanger.”  Continuing the episode, King was joined by Executive Director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association Jeremy Payne who helped explain the clean energy provisions in the bill. Payne laid out how the historic clean energy investments will fight climate change, create more affordable and reliable American energy, and create thousands of new energy jobs in Maine.Senator King closed out the episode with Maine Society of CPAs Treasurer Mike Santo who laid out the serious funding and staffing shortage facing the IRS, and the hurdles this has caused Maine people and small businesses. Santo detailed how the new IRS funding will mean better tax service for working people, and debunked several myths about new audits going after middle class Americans.The Inflation Reduction Act will:LOWER HEALTH CARE AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTSCUT ENERGY COSTS AND ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGEREDUCE THE DEFICT AND CLOSE TAX LOOPHOLESThe “Inside Maine Podcast with Senator Angus King” is a 30-minute program that aims to help keep Maine people informed about issues of the day, how they affect life in the state, and how they factor into Senator King’s work as one of two independents in the U.S. Senate.

https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/collins-king-join-legislation-to-ensure-recognition-of-ukraines-sovereign-borders,"September 23, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – After Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans to annex parts of Ukraine into the Russian Federation, U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King joined bipartisan legislation to ensure the United States does not recognize any Russian claim over Ukraine’s sovereign territory. The Non-Recognition of Russian Annexation of Ukrainian Territory Act stands with the brave men and women fighting for their freedom in Ukraine by prohibiting any U.S. government department or agency from taking action that would validate Russia’s claims to Ukrainian lands. It also serves to counter Putin’s land ownership lies that he could use to justify potential military escalations.“Vladimir Putin’s push to annex parts of Ukraine is a blatant attempt to give his brutal and unjustified invasion a veneer of legitimacy,” said Senator Collins. “The Ukrainians have inspired the world with their determination to defend their democracy, and their recent advances in the eastern part of the country demonstrate their ability to succeed when they have the support of the United States and our allies. By refusing to acknowledge Russian claims on Ukraine’s territory, this legislation would reaffirm our solidary with Ukraine and help the Ukrainians to preserve their sovereignty. I will continue to support doing everything in the United States’ power to give the courageous Ukrainians the tools they need to fight for their freedom and pressure Russia to bring an end to its terrible war.”“No matter what Vladimir Putin says, every single inch of Ukraine belongs to Ukrainians. No sham election, fake proclamation, or attempted annexation will change Ukraine’s internationally-recognized borders,” said Senator King. “This bill is an important effort to reaffirm Ukraine’s sovereignty and sends a strong, bipartisan message to the brave men and women in Ukraine that the United States Senate stands with them in their fight for freedom. Make no mistake, Ukraine will continue to push back Putin’s delusions of a new Russian Empire and fight for the land that is theirs.”The bill is backed by a bipartisan group of nearly thirty of the Senators. Since the start of Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion, Senators Collins and King have worked consistently together to support the brave men and women in Ukraine fighting for their freedom. They recently celebrated President Joe Biden signing their Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act into law, and they have worked to ensure Putin feels the consequences of his heinous actions. "
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-pushing-pentagon-for-increased-action-to-address-pfas,"September 23, 2022WASHINGTON, DC — U.S. Senator Angus King, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is pushing the Department of Defense (DoD) to expand efforts to combat per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances?(PFAS) at current and former military instillations. In a bipartisan letter with almost forty of his Senate colleagues, Senator King calls on Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to improve PFAS-related planning and to better implement the budget Congress has appropriated to address the growing issue. The efforts would help the military identify and remediate PFAS contamination at Maine’s former Brunswick Naval Air Station – what is now the Brunswick Executive Airport.“As you know, PFAS chemicals have emerged as widespread contaminants to the drinking water sources of military bases across the country largely due to their presence in aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF),” wrote the Senators. “Members of the military, veterans and civilians who have served at military installations and/or live in the surrounding communities found to have been contaminated with PFAS face health risks related to exposure to PFAS chemicals, as these materials are found in AFFF, in personal protective equipment used by firefighters and in standard consumer products.” “Over the past six years, Congress has increased funding by $1 billion for the Department to accelerate PFAS testing and remediation, more than doubling the amount requested in the annual budget request during that time frame,” continued the Senators. “We are, however, concerned that DoD has failed to adequately prepare for additional funding being made available. It is our understanding that one of the major obstacles in the way of Congress putting more resources toward this problem is a lack of planning by the Department on how to execute a higher funding level.”“DoD has a responsibility to place greater emphasis on addressing these pollutants impacting service members, military families and defense communities. Therefore, we strongly urge the Department to match Congress’ urgency for addressing testing and remediation by developing requirements-based plans, policies, and programs and appropriately increasing DoD’s annual budget requests for PFAS-related activities, including for PFAS destruction,” the Senators conclude. “Our service members, military families, veterans and defense communities deserve the Department’s full attention to appropriately address the scope and severity of PFAS contamination. We ask you to honor that responsibility and take the steps necessary to prioritize this hazard impacting our communities.” As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator King has worked to address PFAS contamination across America’s communities, especially where it has been caused by the Department of Defense. He recently secured multiple PFAS-fighting provisions in the draft 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, and secured millions in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to combat PFAS in water.The letter can be read in full here and below.++ Dear Secretary Austin:We write with continued concern about the Department of Defense’s (DoD) efforts to address contamination from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Nearly 700 military installations nationwide have known or suspected PFAS contamination, exposing service members and their families, and civilian communities near DoD installations to these toxic chemicals[1]. Given Congress’ continued commitment to provide funding to address PFAS contamination, we respectfully request that the Department similarly prioritize planning and programming for PFAS testing and remediation. As you know, PFAS chemicals have emerged as widespread contaminants to the drinking water sources of military bases across the country largely due to their presence in aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) used by the military. Members of the military, veterans and civilians who have served at military installations and/or live in the surrounding communities found to have been contaminated with PFAS face health risks related to exposure to PFAS chemicals, as these materials are found in AFFF, in personal protective equipment used by firefighters and in standard consumer products. The prevalence of PFAS allows for multiple pathways for exposure. The recently released National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report calls for expanded access to PFAS testing for Americans with a history of exposure to the chemicals and points to health risks such as high cholesterol, decreased fetal and infant growth and increased risks of kidney cancer for those exposed to PFAS[2]. These health concerns pose a significant hazard to the safety of our communities, and individuals either previously or currently exposed to toxic PFAS chemicals, underscoring the urgency of reducing exposure.Over the past six years, Congress has increased funding by $1 billion for the Department to accelerate PFAS testing and remediation, more than doubling the amount requested in the annual budget request during that time frame. As evidenced by the historic $517 million authorization for PFAS-related activities included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022, Congress has indicated a willingness to provide even greater funding to address these challenges. We are, however, concerned that DoD has failed to adequately prepare for additional funding being made available. It is our understanding that one of the major obstacles in the way of Congress putting more resources toward this problem is a lack of planning by the Department on how to execute a higher funding level. Simply put, DoD is not sufficiently prioritizing PFAS testing, remediation and disposal as part of its annual budget process, nor is the Department adequately developing the appropriate plans to utilize even higher funding levels as provided by Congress.DoD has a responsibility to place greater emphasis on addressing these pollutants impacting service members, military families and defense communities. Therefore, we strongly urge the Department to match Congress’ urgency for addressing testing and remediation by developing requirements-based plans, policies, and programs and appropriately increasing DoD’s annual budget requests for PFAS-related activities, including for PFAS destruction. Further, we expect that, as a part of this analysis, the Department will address past planning and programming deficiencies that DoD has claimed limits their ability to execute higher levels of funding, and we request that DoD provide a plan to Congress no later than upon the release of the President’s Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2024 on how the Department is prepared to execute increased funding levels for PFAS-related activities. Finally, we support DoD’s cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency on PFAS, including collaboration on research and testing efforts, and encourage the Department to continue investing in joint efforts to address PFAS.Our service members, military families, veterans and defense communities deserve the Department’s full attention to appropriately address the scope and severity of PFAS contamination. We ask you to honor that responsibility and take the steps necessary to prioritize this hazard impacting our communities. [1] United States Government Accountability Office. (June, 2021).

https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-highlights-how-ukraine-conflict-shows-need-for-clean-energy-independence,"September 22, 2022Watch or download Senator King’s remarks HERE WASHINGTON, D.C – U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) today spelled out how the conflict in Ukraine and Europe’s resulting energy crisis demonstrates the urgent need for America to have a clean energy future that does not rely on foreign adversaries. In a hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, King questioned Spencer Nelson, Managing Director of Research and New Initiatives at ClearPath Clean Energy Foundation, on the importance of expediting the construction of domestic energy and mining infrastructure that will allow the country to independently achieve its energy goals. The Senator pointed to comprehensive permitting reform as an important, necessary step to reach these goals. Last week, King spoke from the Senate floor on the importance of permitting reform and America’s clean energy future.“We've got to understand that in order to get to a clean energy future, we have to rationalize and correct the deficiencies in the permitting or we'll never get there, because we're going to need to permit transmission, we're going to need to permit pump storage projects, we're going to need to permit mining operations. And so you can't be for electronic vehicles and be against lithium mining in the US. We’ve just got to resolve that,” said Senator King. “Seven to ten years [to permit a mine]. What I say to people when they tell me something is going to take years is that Eisenhower retook Europe in eleven months. Don't tell me it's going to take ten years – that's ridiculous. I hope we're going to really make some serious inroads into those deadlines. Meaningful deadlines and coordination of agency consideration and conclusions within a reasonable period of time; otherwise we'll never get there. We will simply not get to the clean energy future that we desire.”“I think deadlines are important, and the other piece is domestic supply chain. I met yesterday with two heads of state from European countries. We have in front of us the all-time example of how dangerous it is to rely on other countries for critical supplies. Europe is facing a really huge challenge this winter because of their reliance on Russia,” Senator King continued. “You look back and you say, what were they thinking? I don't want to be in that position ten years from now saying, what were they thinking about getting critical minerals from China that power our country? Mr. Nelson, am I right about that? I mean, it just seems to me we not only can see the problem, we can see the real impact of it right before our eyes this winter in Europe.”“The more that our future energy system relies on other countries, the less control we have over it. We've certainly seen that our increase in oil and gas production has put us in a very strong position in terms of global energy production because we're now a net producer of oil and gas, and that's been helpful,” replied Mr. Nelson. “I think we can also be a net producer of energy storage technologies and all types of clean energy technologies as well.” As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator King has advocated for climate solutions that support Maine communities, unlock America’s clean energy future, and strengthen national security. Along with his speech from the Senate Floor in support of permitting reform, King has been one of the Senate’s most vocal advocates for improving energy storage technologies and development. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Senator King is also among the Senate’s loudest voices advocating for conserving public lands and encouraging outdoor recreation. Senator King helped lead the passage the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) into law; the legislation includes the Restore Our Parks Act – a bill led by Senator King – and the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Permanent Funding Act. Over the course of his time in the Blaine House, Governor King was responsible for conserving more land across Maine than all Governors before him combined."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-votes-for-cleaner-elections-and-clearer-campaign-ads-to-improve-democratic-process,"September 22, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine), today voted for the DISCLOSE Act, comprehensive legislation to strengthen the democratic process by creating more transparency in political spending and elections. The legislation, which failed to gain any Republican votes and reach the necessary sixty-vote threshold, would require organizations spending money in federal elections to disclose their donors, help get foreign money out of elections, and require all election ads to state by whom they are funded. The effort was cosponsored by Senator King, and builds on his continued efforts to create a more transparent, fair democratic process.“The foundation of American democracy is that everyday people can make their voices heard and hold their leaders accountable. Dark money is a real and present threat to these democratic values – it removes accountability from our political process, and drowns out the voices of voters with those of anonymous special interests,” said Senator King. “Not only are incessant ads paid for by ‘Americans for Green Grass’ frustrating, they’re a real threat our democratic principles. If a nurse in Stonington donates $75 dollars to their political candidate it’s disclosed, but if a billionaire wants to pour millions into an election they can do it anonymously – it simply makes no sense, and it’s not fair.“The DISCLOSE Act would have ended this disparity and brought long overdue transparency to our political process by requiring dark money groups to finally disclose who is backing them. It also would have taken a much-needed step to keep foreign money out of American elections,” Senator King continued. “Sunlight is the best disinfectant, especially for dark money’s corrosive effects on our democratic process. I’m disappointed that my Republican colleagues didn’t support this commonsense effort; I honestly don’t understand why it could be even slightly controversial.”  Citizens United and subsequent Supreme Court rulings currently permit super PACs and certain types of tax-exempt groups, such as 501(c)(4) nonprofits, to spend unlimited sums in elections. Many of those groups are not required to disclose their donors, allowing wealthy corporations and individuals to spend unlimited, undisclosed – or “dark” – money without being publicly tied to the television attack ads and other election activity the groups carry out.The Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light On Spending in Elections (DISCLOSE) Act includes provisions to:Strengthen Dark-Money DisclosureClose Loopholes in the Foreign Money BanPromote transparency in Election AdsSenator King has been committed to improving voter trust and engagement in America through increased transparency. He has previously introduced the Real Time Transparency Act, which would require that all political contributions of $1,000 or more be filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) within 48 hours, and cosponsored the Sunlight for Unaccountable Non-Profits (SUN) Act, which would require the IRS to publish the names of any donors who give more than $5,000 to tax-exempt political organizations. Senator King also cosponsored the Spotlight Act, which aims to identify the dark money political donors that seek to influence political debate anonymously."

The Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument Access Act, cosponsored by Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine), would authorize the expansion of KWW by giving the National Park Service (NPS) permission to acquire land from willing donors or sellers that better connect the Monument to the Millinocket region and major roadways. View a map of the proposed parcels HERE.During the hearing, Chairman King received testimony from Steve Richardson of Shin Pond – a prominent leader in the Katahdin region business community – on the benefits of the effort, its impact on Millinocket and the surrounding communities, and potential changes that could improve the bill.Beginning the hearing, Chairman King gave an opening statement laying out the significant benefits his bill would bring to the Katahdin community.“This bill will allow specific parcels to be added to the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument from willing donors or sellers, improving access to the Monument from the south, and the Millinocket region. This new access will make it easier for visitors to enter the monument and will help towns like Millinocket and East Millinocket capture some of the economic opportunities from these visitors,” began National Parks Chairman King. “Visitors will benefit because many services they are looking for—restaurants, hotels, retail shops, and more—already exist to the south and are not as readily available to the north, where you currently enter the Monument.“Land will only be added to the monument if willing landowners sell or donate their land. Additionally, we have included language to explicitly protect the continued access to many important uses, including snowmobiling, hunting, fishing, and foraging for fiddleheads,” added Senator King.King continued by laying out some of the community feedback he’s received on the bill, and detailed how he is improving the bill through local engagement efforts.“Since I put out this bill, I have heard from groups that have additional concerns I intend to address, specifically the use of ATVs and logging,” continued Senator King. “Local ATV clubs have been working for years to build a connector trail that crosses one of the parcels that is covered by this legislation. My intention is for this bill to maintain existing uses and access, and when we consider this bill in markup, I will make sure language is included to protect ATV access to this trail.”“I’ve also heard concerns about making sure that log trucks can still travel safely and efficiently through these parcels. This is important because as we grow the recreation economy we also must make sure the traditional forest products sector continues to function unimpeded, and continue to promote a more diversified forest products sector in the region,” Senator King emphasized. “Currently logging trucks travel through the monument and the Park Service has worked with stakeholders in the region to make sure there is appropriate signage – and the on website it says, ‘Logging trucks always have the right of way.’ I am confident that we can make clarifications and amendments that will fully retain current access while improving safety and supporting the forest economy.”After his opening statement, Senator King turned to testimony on the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument Access Act from Steve Richardson of Shin Pond who explained the significant economic boost KWW has brought the Katahdin area, and how the bill would expand on these successes.“To me, this legislation is about the future. It's about making it possible for our kids to stay in the region and thus in Maine. Millinocket, a town south of the monument, was once home to the largest paper mill in the world. Families made their living in the woods and in the mills, and there were good jobs with benefits for anyone willing to work hard. But that changed, through no fault of the good men and women of the Katahdin region. Our communities have had to adapt to a new reality and take new approaches to our natural resources and our economy,” said Steve Richardson. “The monument is an important part of that transition. It is a beacon of hope, drawing new people, more visitors, and increased investment to our communities, all the while protecting a very special place for the enjoyment of generations to come.”“This legislation you're considering is all about connecting all people with the Monument. The Monument is paying off for the communities in the region,” continued Mr. Richardson. “My son recognized that with the creation of the monument, our store had an opportunity to serve new types of customers. It was a risk, but he believed that once people learned about the beautiful history of our region and about the monument, they would come. He began to stock kayaks, canoes, paddleboards, camping gear and the like. I'm happy today to say that he was correct. The store has experienced minimum 20% year over year increases over the past six years. This is true for many businesses in the Katahdin region as more people have come to take advantage of what is offered and some visitors have luckily become full time residents.“There is a need in our region to improve access to Katahdin Woods and Waters. The legislation from Senators King and Collins protects traditional recreational uses, allows the National Park Service to work with willing sellers, promotes greater investment in our region, and will help businesses and working people,” Mr. Richardson concluded. “I appreciate their support on this matter and ongoing support for the monument and hope the Senate will support this bill as well.”During his questioning, National Parks Chairman King asked Michael Caldwell, Associate Director for Park Planning at the National Park Service, to ensure that any park expansion would respect local heritage industries like logging.“Mr. Caldwell, I understand the importance that working forests have access to get their woods out. Can you talk about how the Park Service deals with this issue in other parts of the country to have the safe cohabitation, if you will, of visitors and the forest products industry?” asked Senator King.“We honor all the agreements that we have, and I think you alluded to that earlier when you identified even the signs and the website. But we're authorized elsewhere in the country for commercial use, say, in places, parts of the Foothills Parkway and the Smokies or Delaware Water Gap, for example. The Park Service balances those needs with those commercial uses versus the needs of the visitors on those roads,” assured Associate Director Caldwell. “So it is something that we do elsewhere when we have those authorizations in places similar to Katahdin Woods.Concluding the hearing, Steve Richardson highlighted the need for this effort now as Americans embrace the great outdoors.“We have a nation now that has turned to the outdoors rather than sitting home and looking at the screen,” said Mr. Richardson. “That's going to help the National Parks all over this country. It has helped businesses because we have people every week. Last week I talked to a gentleman from West Virginia and another one from Texas. That was in northern Maine, and I'm sure they would have never been there if it weren't for the fact that they now are outdoors. They're trying to find places to go and thank goodness they're picking our area.”The Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument Access Act, cosponsored by Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine), would authorize the expansion of KWW by giving the National Park Service (NPS) permission to acquire land from willing donors or sellers that better connect the Monument to the Millinocket region and major roadways. View a map of the proposed parcels HERE. The bill also includes provisions to allow the NPS to acquire buildings for Monument administration and visitor services outside of park boundaries. All expansions will occur with the cooperation of willing landowners, and will protect traditional hunting, fishing and snowmobile usage on the acquired property.As Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on National Parks and a lifelong advocate for conservation, Senator King has spent decades championing environmental stewardship and advocacy. Senator King was an active participant in discussions to ensure that the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument would not be designated against the will of local citizens; after it became clear that the monument had widespread public support, continued Maine’s longstanding outdoor traditions, and yielded economic benefits to the region, he pushed against a 2017 Department of the Interior review that threatened to roll back the designation. Senator King also recently led the Great American Outdoors Act to address the $12 billion maintenance backlog in our national parks. For his continued leadership, Senator King was awarded the inaugural National Park Foundation “Hero” Award."

https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-outlines-evolving-nuclear-threat-landscape-assesses-americas-defenses,"September 20, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine), chair of the Senate Strategic Forces Subcommittee with jurisdiction over the nation’s nuclear arsenal, today highlighted the wide range of evolving nuclear challenges threating America’s national security. In a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator King pressed Franklin Miller, Principal of the Scowcroft Group, and Eric Edelman, Director of the United States Institute of Peace, on how to wisely address new 21st century threats including nuclear terrorism, hypersonics, and Russia’s possible use of tactical nuclear weapons.Senator King began his questioning by calling attention to the serious threat of nuclear weapons in the hands of non-state actors and terrorists and discussing possible ways to prevent the nightmare scenarios.“Here's my concern: terrorists with nuclear weapons. Deterrence depends upon the other side having a fear of death and a fear of destruction and a fear of the loss of their country and their infrastructure and their capital city. What about people who, A, don't care about dying and B, have no capital city?” asked Senator King. “We need another theory or an adjunct to the theory of deterrence to deal with the threat of terrorists with nuclear weapons. We've got countries, Iran and North Korea, probably the most likely with building with fissile material. Iran's a week or two away from enough fiscal material. How do we deal with this threat? Mr. Miller, your thoughts? It seems to me this is a whole new category that, frankly, I don't think we're addressing.”“I think [terrorists] are outside the realm of nuclear deterrence. That's the realm of special operations forces, it's the realm of intelligence, it's the realm of conventional forces. It’s also the realm of prevention, it's the [Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons], it's working with allies and likeminded states to prevent those people from getting the fissile material and from getting the weapons knowledge,” replied Mr. Miller. “As you pointed out, you can get the weapons knowledge, but that's different than classic deterrence.”“I agree. That's the problem. The theory of deterrence doesn't apply to the situation, which I think is one of the most serious likely threats,” continued Senator King.“We need to hunt those people,” Mr. Miller assessed.“I would suggest perhaps a Manhattan Project to figure out how to detect nuclear material from space or from a distance as our best defense because deterrence won't work,” Senator King hypothesized.  Continuing his questioning, Senator King explored how the threat of hypersonic weapons “changes the strategic balance,” and how the United States should prepare for the new threats.“It seems to me, Mr. Miller, that hypersonics changes the strategic balance altogether. And you suggested, I think it was you that was talking about the danger, you can have a nuclear weapon essentially dwelling in low Earth orbit over Washington,” said Senator King. “If the President, the Vice President and the leadership of Congress is gone, we're decapitated. There's no one to make the decision to launch, which undermines the deterrence because of the lack of a second strike, as you outlined. Should we have the Vice President live somewhere else in the country? Should we disperse our leadership in some way? Because I think you raise a very important point. Without the threat of a second strike, of a retaliatory strike, deterrence doesn't work.”“I’ll be very careful in answering your question, because once upon a time I was involved in continuity of government programs. We need a survivable continuity of government to include nuclear command and control. Even a fractional orbital ballistic system would not come out of the clear blue sky. It would not come in a time of total peace,” replied Mr. Miller. “In a time of building tension I think it is incumbent on the government to establish a survivable nuclear command and control system which may include dispersing senior officials to more remote locations than Washington, DC. I think the government has practiced that in the past. It can always be improved. But I think the point that you raise is particularly important.”Concluding his questioning, Senator King raised the discussion that has surrounded President Putin’s potential consideration of tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine.“Mr. Edelman, what is our doctrine with regard to response to the use of a tactical nuclear weapon?” asked Senator King. “The President made a statement to Mr. Putin. Is that a doctrine? What is our deterrent strategy for the use of a low yield nuclear weapon, either as a demonstration in the middle of the Arctic Ocean or in terms of a strike on a city in Ukraine?”“Senator, I think our deterrent posture has always been based on the notion of calculated ambiguity that we would determine at the time of use how we would respond to a weapon and a use of a weapon. I think that remains very useful today,” replied Mr. Edelman. “I think this goes back to some of the foundational thinking about deterrence in the Cold War, and in particular the work of Thomas Schelling, who, famously, in Strategy of Conflict, wrote in 1960 that the risk that leaves something to chance in the mind of your adversary, the notion that if they do this, they're moving down a road, the consequences of which they cannot calculate, is perhaps the strongest deterrent that we have in that regard. I thought the President's statement to Scott Pelley on 60 Minutes on Sunday was exemplary.” As Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Strategic Forces – which oversees the United States’ nuclear arsenal and posture – Senator King has been an outspoken voice on the need to address the growing nuclear capacity of our adversaries. Senator King recently expressed concern about the emerging threats of Russia and China’s development of “nightmare weapon” hypersonic missiles, which he has described as “strategic game-changers.”"
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-casey-highlight-dangers-of-senior-fall-incidents-call-for-stronger-prevention-efforts,"September 20, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – As part of Fall Prevention Awareness Week, U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) and Bob Casey (D-Penn.), Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, today urged the Biden administration to improve senior fall-prevention efforts. In a letter to Center for Disease Control Director (CDC) Dr. Rochelle Walensky and Acting Administrator of the Administration for Community Living (ACL) Alison Barkoff, the Senators call for better data on the risk and prevalence of falls, collaboration with this data to shape fall-prevention, and a more proactive effort to share fall risks with seniors and people with disabilities. In 2019 alone, falls were responsible for more than 3 million emergency room visits for adults aged 65 and older, and more than 34,000 deaths.“We know that you are aware of the often avoidable tragedy of falls injuries that occur hundreds of times every single day across America, and that a significant portion of these falls are preventable,” said Senators King and Casey. “Your agencies have developed research and information that can reduce the numbers of these preventable falls and therefore, better protect the health and well-being of older adults and people with disabilities. In 2019, as part of the Supporting Older Americans Act, the most recent reauthorization of the Older Americans Act, Congress required the Comptroller General to conduct an inventory of federal programs ‘an inventory of federal programs… that support evidence-based fall prevention,’ … as well as to require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to issue a set of recommendations.”“In light of this information, we believe the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Administration for Community Living (ACL) can each enhance efforts to protect seniors and people with disabilities from avoidable falls,” the Senators continued. “We write to you to draw attention to the findings of the GAO report and to request details of your plans to incorporate the recommendations of the report into the prevention activities of your agencies in the coming months of 2022 and beyond.”The Senators then lay out the three provisions they would like to see implemented:1.      The Director of the CDC should expand the scope of its analysis of Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data to include the prevalence of falls and fall-related injuries among adults under age 65 who may be at higher risk of falls.2.      The Administrator of ACL should identify a collaborative mechanism to facilitate sustained information sharing on all populations at risk of falls and in need of evidence-based fall prevention, home modifications, or home assessments.3.      The Administrator of ACL should share and highlight information on falls risk and related resources for adults with disabilities who are younger than 60 more prominently among its disability network to inform state and local planning efforts.“An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. By further investing in fall prevention, we can reduce serious injuries for the hundreds of thousands of individuals who experience preventable falls each year,” conclude the lawmakers.The full letter can be read HERE and below.+++Dear Director Walensky and Acting Administrator BarkoffIn 2019, falls were responsible for more than 3 million emergency room visits for adults aged 65 and older, and more than 34,000 deaths. We know that you are aware of the often avoidable tragedy of fall injuries that occur hundreds of times every single day across America, and that a significant portion of these falls are preventable. We thank you both for your efforts to ensure those at-risk for falls and associated health consequences have access to information and care that can prevent fall occurrences. Your agencies have developed research and information that can reduce the numbers of these preventable falls and therefore, better protect the health and well-being of older adults and people with disabilities.In 2019, as part of the Supporting Older Americans Act (P.L. 116-131), the most recent reauthorization of the Older Americans Act, Congress required the Comptroller General to conduct “an inventory of federal programs… that support evidence-based fall prevention, home assessments, and home modifications for older individuals and individuals with disabilities,” as well as to require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to issue a set of recommendations from their reporting. On July 28, 2022, the GAO issued their report, titled: “Older Adults and Adults with Disabilities: Federal Programs Provide Support for Preventing Falls, but Program Reach is Limited.”[1]In this report, GAO identified three recommendations for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Administration for Community Living (ACL), and we would like to know your plans to carry out these recommendations, and what steps your agencies are already taking to reduce the incidence of avoidable falls.As you know, accidental falls are the single leading injury-related cause of death among adults aged 65 or older, and a leading source of health care expenditures for Medicare and Medicaid. It has been estimated medical costs for fall-related injuries were $50 billion for 2015 alone, and three quarters of that cost was borne by Medicare and Medicaid.[2] As a larger number of people age into Medicare, these figures are only expected to rise.  It is also well documented that most falls occur at home and that many are preventable. In light of this information, we believe the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Administration for Community Living (ACL) can each enhance efforts to protect seniors and people with disabilities from avoidable falls. We also believe the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) must take additional steps as a payor to reduce falls. With collaborative efforts, CMS, ACL, and CDC fall prevention programs can be complementary to one another and prevent serious injuries to hundreds of thousands of Americans. By working together, across government, we can tackle this preventable threat to the health and independence of older adults and people with disabilities.  We write to you to draw attention to the findings of the GAO report and to request details of your plans to incorporate the recommendations of the report into the prevention activities of your agencies in the coming months of 2022 and beyond. The recommendations from the GAO report were as follows:Please provide us with the following information about your plans to address the GAO recommendations:An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. By further investing in fall prevention, we can reduce serious injuries for the hundreds of thousands of individuals who experience preventable falls each year. Your efforts to communicate prevention strategies and coordinate across federal agencies has the potential to save lives, reduce costs borne by the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and help older adults and people with disabilities continue to live the highest quality of life in their own homes and communities.  We look forward to your responses, and we look forward to working with you to promote health, safety and independence among the country’s seniors and people with disabilities. Sincerely,[1] https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105276 [2] Medicare and Medicaid paid an estimated $28.9 billion and $8.7 billion, respectively, for fall-related medical costs in 2015.

The day recognizes America’s servicemembers who have been Prisoners of War, those still Missing in Action, and their families.“On National Prisoners of War and Missing in Action Recognition Day, we join together to honor the brave men and women of our Armed Forces who have been Prisoners of War, and for those who remain Missing in Action—including the 477 Mainers still unaccounted for,” said Senator King. “This solemn day is a painful, important reminder of the sacrifices endured by servicemembers, and the immense, incalculable loss and uncertainty borne by their families and communities.  Let us renew our commitment to bring answers and closure to the loved ones of those Missing in Action, and to care for all those who have endured the painful silence of these losses.“Today, I join people across Maine and our nation in saying, “You Are Not Forgotten.” The phrase is reminder of our duty to leave no American servicemember or veteran behind – no matter where they may be. I stand humbled and grateful to those who answered the call of their nation to protect our way of life. We also pay tribute to those who have been POW/MIA and have returned to their loved ones. We have a solemn obligation to take care of them and their families so that they can enjoy the freedoms they sacrificed for.  “To the families who have lost their sons and daughters, and to the comrades who have lost their friends and companions, know that today and every day we stand with you through your hardships, and in honoring the selfless service of America’s POW and MIA.”"

In the role, which was recommended by the CSC, Fick will coordinate America’s international response to cyberthreats and shifting cyber dynamics. Senator King previously introduced Ambassador Fick to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and urged his urgent confirmation.“Today, with the confirmation of Cape Elizabeth’s Nate Fick, the United States has taken a historic, long overdue step to address our rapidly-changing cyber environment. With Ambassador Fick coordinating our global cyberdiplomacy, America will be better positioned to respond to growing threats, inform the development of global rules of engagement, and create desperately needed international norms for cyber,” said Senator King. “Our country has lagged behind in shaping policies beyond our shores to defend us in this war without borders. I hope that ends today. This unanimous confirmation is a testament to the importance of the role and to Nate’s impressive qualifications. I look forward to seeing the Ambassador’s work, and to our continued partnership on the cyber issues facing our country.”Nathaniel Fick is a Cape Elizabeth, Maine resident and was previously the general manager of Elastic Security, where he led Elastic’s information security business. He also served as CEO of Endgame, a cybersecurity software company, from 2012 through its acquisition by Elastic in 2019. Fast Company magazine named him one of the One Hundred Most Creative People in Business, and under his leadership, Forbes selected Endgame as one of the one hundred best cloud companies in the world. Fick started his career as a U.S. Marine Corps infantry and reconnaissance officer, including combat tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. Fick holds a BA in classics from Dartmouth College, an MPA from Harvard Kennedy School, and an MBA from Harvard Business School.The Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy (CDP) began operations in April 2022 after its creation was recommended by the Cyberspace Solarium Commission. The Bureau leads and coordinates the State Department’s work on cyberspace and digital diplomacy. Fick is the first Ambassador at Large for the Bureau where he will now build on the CDP’s work to encourage responsible state behavior in cyberspace and advance policies that protect the integrity and security the United States.As Co-Chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC), and a member of the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, Senator King is recognized as one of Congress’ leading experts on cyberdefense and is a strong advocate for a forward-thinking cyberstrategy that emphasizes layered cyberdeterrence. Since it officially launched in April 2019, dozens of CSC recommendations have been enacted into law, including the creation of a National Cyber Director."

In a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, King questioned U.S. Air Force General Anthony Cotton, nominee to be Commander of United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM), on the growing challenge posed by hypersonic missiles and cyberattacks – stressing the importance of STRATCOM staying ahead of the 21st century weapons. Senator King, Chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, specifically asks General Cotton to routinely test their systems for cyber weakness, a process known as “red teaming.”“Another area of strategic change has happened in the last four or five years, and that is hypersonics,” said Senator King. “We've thought of strategic forces as nuclear weapons and nuclear deterrence. Hypersonics are a new threat that is a strategic threat, particularly, for example, the Chinese putting a hypersonic glide vehicle in orbit, which radically changes things like how much time we might have to react to an attack. Do you view hypersonics as a serious strategic challenge?”“Senator I do, and I see it as a warning challenge,” replied General Cotton. “I think as far as when we have a conversation, if confirmed, I think my fellow combatant commanders will have to have a discussion and understand how to kind of relook missile defense, relook missile warning, understand what a sensor layer looks like that can achieve those effects to give time, because I need to give decision space to the decision maker.”“Well, I think it's safe to say that the bullet on bullet theory of missile defense is out the window when you're talking about hypersonics,” Senator King continued. “Another area is cyber. You've talked about it. You've indicated how important it is, particularly with [nuclear command, control, and communications]. Will you commit to red teaming and pen-testing and hackers for hire to test the security of the systems that you're developing? I don't think you really know how secure you are until somebody attacks you. And I hope, I want it to be a friendly attack.”“Senator, if confirmed, that would be one of the first directions I would give to the [National Intelligence Council],” affirmed General Cotton.+++Continuing his questioning, Senator King also highlighted the increasing threat of nuclear non-state actors who are not dissuaded by typical nuclear deterrents and asked General Cotton to carefully evaluate the nightmare scenario.“A new strategic challenge or a different strategic challenge and I don't expect really an answer, but perhaps you could consider this for the record. That is non-state actors with nuclear weapons,” said Senator King. “The deterrent theory doesn't work if you don't have a capital city and if you don't care about dying, and we have a proliferation of nuclear weapons and we have rogue states developing nuclear weapons and nuclear materials, the chances of those materials falling into the hands of a terrorist organization, it seems to me, are increasing gradually but steadily. I hope you will give this some thought, because it's a major strategic challenge that doesn't fit within the ambit of what has been our historic deterrence strategy for dealing with nuclear threats.” As Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Strategic Forces – which oversees the United States’ nuclear arsenal and posture – Senator King has been an outspoken voice on the need to address the growing nuclear capacity of our adversaries. Senator King recently expressed concern about the emerging threats of Russia and China’s development of “nightmare weapon” hypersonic missiles, which he has described as “strategic game-changers.”"

These initial projects will expand markets for climate-smart commodities; leverage the greenhouse gas benefits of climate-smart commodity production; and provide direct, meaningful benefits to production agriculture, including for small and underserved producers.“By supporting innovative and environmentally friendly logging and farming practices as well as expanding market opportunities, this funding is a win-win for producers as well as our climate,” said Senators Collins and King and Representatives Pingree and Golden in a joint statement.  “We are particularly pleased that USDA is investing in two projects that are being spearheaded in Maine.  This funding will allow Wolfe’s Neck Farm to launch an initiative to help farmers implement climate-smart techniques and access the marketplace for climate-smart commodities.  Moreover, this funding will benefit our forest products industry by supporting the New England Forestry Foundation’s effort to help landowners and loggers improve forest health and market locally-grown, healthy, low-carbon building materials.  In addition to mitigating the impact of climate change, these projects will provide substantial economic benefits to our rural communities.”Two of the projects with a direct impact on Maine include:“We are grateful to the Maine Delegation for their support of our project,” said Alec Giffen with the New England Forestry Foundation.  “In our view, this is a transformational opportunity to pay landowners and loggers for practices that will both mitigate climate change and improve productivity of the land while benefitting wildlife.”Funding for other projects that cover multiple states, including Maine, and will support Maine farmers include:"
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-cornyn-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-keep-national-defenses-on-cutting-edge-of-technology,"September 15, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) have introduced bipartisan legislation to help keep America’s national defenses keep up with rapidly changing technologies. The American Defense Programs, Logistics, and Acquisitions for our Nation’s Security (American Defense PLANS) Act would study the Department of Defense’s (DOD) acquisition and modernization efforts and create recommendations for how DOD programs can continue to modernize with evolving defense challenges.“Technology wins wars. From the long bow at the Battle of Agincourt to nuclear weapons in World War Two, technological advancements frequently turn the tides of battle and define conflicts,” said Senator King. “As America faces growing threats from global adversaries like Russia and China, our defense technology must keep up with the times, and prevent our enemies from gaining a competitive advantage. This bipartisan bill will help the Department of Defense stay on the cutting edge of rapidly-evolving capabilities, keep our warfighters well equipped, and make sure our nation is ready to address any potential threat. It’s a critical step in keeping America safe – and without it, I fear we could someday pay the price.”“Ensuring America has the most technologically advanced military in the world is a matter of survival, plain and simple,” said Sen. Cornyn. “By seeking out recommendations for modernizing our military, we work towards making sure our national defense is well-positioned for success in this rapidly-changing threat environment.” In order for the United States to match threats posed by China and Russia, Department of Defense (DOD) programs and acquisitions need to keep pace with rapidly-changing critical defense technologies and evolving adversary capabilities. The American Defense PLANS Act legislation directs the Office of the Secretary of Defense to conduct an outside study of DOD programs to make recommendations for how these programs and acquisitions can keep up with an shifting technological landscape. The study would be led by independent organizations that are established leaders in national security and technology. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Strategic Forces – which oversees the United States’ nuclear arsenal and posture – Senator King has been an outspoken voice on the need to keep up with evolving national security threats. Senator King has recently expressed concern about the emerging challenges posed by Russia and China’s development of “nightmare weapon” hypersonic missiles, which he has described as “strategic game-changers.” He’s also worked to ensure the Department of Defense has the tools at their disposal they need to protect America’s national security. "

The medals he earned are a testament to this extraordinary service, and an important physical representation of the debt of gratitude he is owed by all Americans,” said Senator King. “I’m deeply grateful for Michael’s service, and glad we could award him the medals he earned.”Michael Cunningham received the following medals for his service: Mr. Cunningham earned the medals in the Vietnam War, but did not receive them until today due a shortage of medals available in Vietnam. "
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/collins-king-announce-nearly-25-million-to-strengthen-maines-forest-economy,"September 14, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King today announced $2,498,588 in federal funding to strengthen Maine’s forest products sector and expand markets for the industry. The investment from the U.S. Forest Service’s Wood Innovations Grant and Community Wood Grant programs will help four businesses across the state invest in high-demand 21st century forest products like cross-laminated timber, new pine resources, and wood biomass fuels. The funding was requested by Senators Collins and King earlier this year and builds on the work of the state’s Forest Opportunity Roadmap (FOR/Maine) Initiative, which has worked to expand economic opportunities for the forest products industry.“The future of Maine’s forest products industry is bright. With new technologies like cross-laminated timber and biomass energy, the historic sector has a chance to overcome the obstacles of the last few decades and restore jobs in our state’s logging communities,” said Senators Collins and King. “This new funding from the Forest Service will build on the momentum of the Maine forest industry’s comeback and provide critical support to four innovative companies that are finding new customers for our high-quality wood products. It’ll mean more jobs, more economic growth, and more Maine products around the globe. We’re proud to have supported this investment and look forward to seeing its impact in partnership with the FOR/Maine Initiative.”“We are very excited to receive this grant and are grateful for the Senators’ continued support of Robbins Lumber and Maine’s forest products industry in general,” said Alden Robbins, Vice President of Robbins Lumber and Chairman of the North Eastern Lumber Manufacturers Association. “This grant will be instrumental in getting the maximum value out of the White Pine resource, keeping Maine manufactured lumber competitive in the global market, and retaining good paying, foundational jobs in our area.”Wood Innovations Grants are being awarded as follows:    Community Wood Grants are being awarded as follows:  The U.S. Forest Service’s Wood Innovations Grant and Community Wood Grant programs work with state and local partners to support projects that reduce fuels, improve forest health, reduce forest management costs, and promote the economic and environmental health of communities.Senators Collins and King have been staunch advocates for the Forest Opportunity Roadmap (FOR/Maine) Initiative, an industry-led coalition that is helping to diversify the state’s wood products businesses, attract investments, and develop greater economic prosperity for rural communities impacted by mill closures. The FOR/Maine Initiative was funded in part by the Economic Development Assessment Team (EDAT) requested by the Senators in 2016 in order to create strategies for job growth and economic development in Maine’s rural communities. In 2019, $8.1 billion in economic impact and 31,822 jobs were tied to Maine’s forest products sector – approximately 1 out of every 25 dollars of Maine’s GDP and 1 out of 25 Maine jobs respectively."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/maine-delegation-presses-fisheries-agency-for-fair-treatment-of-maine-lobster-fishery,"September 13, 2022WASHINGTON — After the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) gave lobster industry participants just two business days to submit proposals for a new risk reduction plan to protect right whales and denied lobstermen and their allies access to a key data tool, Maine’s congressional delegation pushed back today against these decisions by the agency. In their letter to NMFS, Congressman Jared Golden (ME-02), Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Angus King (I-ME), and Congresswoman Chellie Pingree (ME-01) called out the agency for drastically accelerating the timeline for proposals in the aftermath of a recent decision by the U.S. District Court invalidating a biological opinion for the North Atlantic Right Whale.“NMFS should not prioritize expediency when doing so compromises the very survival of Maine’s lobster fishery.  This approach will also undermine stakeholder faith in the process and may ultimately yield a new regulatory framework that does not provide additional protections for right whales while potentially shutting down the entire lobster industry,” wrote the members of Congress. The Maine delegation also urged NMFS to provide immediate access to the Decision Support Tool (DST), a data model used by the agency to determine how much risk is associated with a specific state or fishery, to state fisheries regulators and industry members. “Given the DST will be used to determine future regulatory actions by your agency on the lobster fishery,” continued the Members of Congress. “We strongly urge you to make it available to stakeholders immediately or change the timeline of the scoping period to ensure that state fisheries regulators and industry have had time to contemplate measures using the DST to identify proposals that protect right whales and preserve the lobster fishery.” Read a copy of the letter here."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-on-senate-floor-permitting-reform-needed-to-reach-clean-energy-future,"September 13, 2022WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine), a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today delivered a forceful speech on the Senate Floor explaining the need for pragmatic, realistic, and rapid permitting reform to reach America’s clean energy goals – calling on energy and environmental organizations to break free of entrenched stances. In his comprehensive address, where he detailed his decades of experience in renewable energy and conservation, he cited the words of Abraham Lincoln in seeking to reset the tone in DC, “we must disenthrall ourselves … and we will save the planet.”King began his speech by highlighting four key lessons he learned from his decades of experience in the renewable energy industry:“I learned some lessons when I was working in the field of developing alternative or renewable energy. The most important lesson is there’s no free lunch when it comes to energy. There are always costs and benefits. There are always impacts that some people think are terrific, other people think are not so good. There are always trade-offs,” Senator King began. “The second lesson I learned is that you may have global goals, renewable energy, but local impacts, and you often have a controversy about a particular project. The third thing I learned is that change is hard. Everybody’s for progress, nobody’s for change. Change is difficult, whether it’s for a local community, a state, or a nation.“The fourth thing, permitting is hard,” added Senator King. “People have to understand that this is a major, a major change that’s going to require trade-offs, that’s going to require us to make decisions and to understand, again, to go back to my basic premise, there’s no free lunch.”He continued by laying out the serious threats of climate change, and the challenge that presents the country:“We are now undertaking the largest and most far-reaching energy transition in human history,” Senator King continued. “The transition to fossil fuels took about 150 years, going back to around 1800. You can see the graph, it goes up, but we really got into the real heart of the fossil fuel economy in the mid-20th century – 150 years. We’re talking about transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewables over 15 years. Not 150, but 15. We have to grasp that this is an enormous undertaking, and it’s going to involve change. “So, we are literally in a race with climate change. That’s why it’s going to have to happen in the next 10, 15, 20 years, because the consequences of not doing it are catastrophic, and we’re already seeing that. I think that we’ve reached a point where most Americans realize that climate change is real. The fishermen in Maine know it. The loggers know it. The farmers know it. The people who work with the land and the sea and the atmosphere understand what’s happening. They see it. The animals know it. They know what’s happening. And that’s why we have to make this transition. That’s why it’s so important that we make this transition, and it’s got to be fast. We don’t have time to do it for over 150 years, or even 50 years. It’s a huge change. It’s going to involve dislocation, and it’s going to involve trade-offs.”Senator King went on to explain how the clean energy and climate challenge is only possible with tradeoffs:“However, and this is what I want to really stress, you can’t be in favor of electrification, you can’t be in favor of renewable power, you can’t be in favor of electric vehicles if you’re not in favor of mining the lithium that you need for the batteries. Or covering a lot of farmers’ fields with solar panels. You can’t have those things without paying a price,” said Senator King. “It would be nice if you could. I would love it if I could wave a wand and say we’re going to get rid of fossil fuels and we’re going to have an all-renewable future. Yes, I want that. But we have to recognize that in order to get there, there are some things we have to do that, heretofore, we really haven’t been very likely to like. “Geography is a problem. Technology is a problem. This will require trade-offs. But we have to keep in mind that we’re talking about a global goal. We’re talking about literally saving the Earth, but we have to understand that there are going to be costs to do so.”The Senator concluded his remarks with a direct appeal to the environmental community, urging them support the necessary tradeoffs to fight climate change:“Historically, and if you go back to the beginning of the environmental movement in the 60’s and 70’s and lord help me, I was there, the environmental movement was about stopping things. The environmental movement began with a proposed oil refinery on our coast. People wanted to stop it because they didn’t think it was the appropriate place. But if you think about that, a lot of the environmental movement has been about stopping things, stopping projects, stopping highways, stopping whatever. What we have to do now is think about facilitating getting things done in order to get to the renewable future that we want,” emphasized Senator King. “I’m not saying lower the standards, but I’m saying the process itself should not be used as a weapon to undermine projects that are necessary to achieve our ultimate climate goal.”“Lincoln said ‘the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty. Therefore, we must rise with the occasion. As our cases new, we also must think anew and act anew.’ And then here’s the key line, ‘we must disenthrall ourselves,’ Lincoln said, ‘and then we shall save our country.’ We must disenthrall ourselves and save our country. It means think in new and different ways, let go of the way you thought about these kinds of issues in the past. Disenthrall ourselves, Mr. President, and then we shall save our planet,” Senator King concluded.  As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator King has advocated for climate solutions that support Maine communities and has been one of the Senate’s most vocal advocates for improving energy technologies and development as a way to unlock America’s clean energy future. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Senator King is also among the Senate’s loudest voices advocating for conserving public lands and encouraging outdoor recreation. Senator King helped lead the passage the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) into law; the legislation includes the Restore Our Parks Act – a bill led by Senator King – and the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Permanent Funding Act. Over the course of his time in the Blaine House, Governor King was responsible for conserving more land across Maine than all Governors before him combined.Senator King’s full speech can be watched HERE and a transcript can be read below.+++This is an unusual set of comments for me because I will start out with personal history which I hope will make sense in terms of what I want to address. I started working in the alternative energy industry in 1983. When I say industry, actually very small company developing hydro projects in Maine and New England. We then worked on biomass projects. Later on, worked on wind power. And also the development of large-scale conservation. My professional life has largely been occupied with energy, and particularly with renewable energy. At the same time, I have a deep history in Maine in environmental matters. I represented the environmental community in Maine before the Maine legislature in the 1970’s – if you can believe anybody around here was still doing things in the 1970s. I also as Governor was very active in conservation matters and am proud to say during my eight years as Governor of Maine we put aside and set into conservation and protection status more land than in the prior 175-year history of Maine combined. This has been a passion of mine, the protection of the environment, for my entire life. So, history of renewable energy development and also environmental advocacy. I learned some lessons when I was working in the field of developing alternative or renewable energy. The most important lesson is there’s no free lunch when it comes to energy. There are always costs and benefits. There are always impacts that some people think are terrific, other people think are not so good. There are always trade-offs. In fact, I will never forget going to hearings on hydro projects and having people object, saying ‘we like hydro but not on our river, not on this side. By the way, we don’t really think you should be ruining the rivers. Why don’t you go do wind power?’ Low and behold, 20 years later, I worked in the area of wind development, wind power, and people came to our hearings and said, ‘we don’t really need to spoil the view in our mountains, do more hydro.’ I’m not making that up, Mr. President. I actually lived that kind of sort of conflict. The second lesson I learned is that you may have global goals, renewable energy, but local impacts, and you often have a controversy about a particular project. The third thing I learned is that change is hard. Everybody’s for progress, nobody’s for change. Change is difficult, whether it’s for a local community, a state, or a nation.The fourth thing, permitting is hard. Getting permits for renewable energy projects were lengthy, time-consuming and expensive. This was a serious learning that I had during this period, that if you want to develop even the most beneficial project, you’re going to have to go through an often arduous permitting process, and somebody isn’t going to like it. Always will be trade-offs. These were sporadic, small projects, and indeed in New England today, and I just checked this morning, about 10% of our electricity comes from renewables. This is after almost 40 years of development of these projects – about 10%. We’re now talking about a transition in energy to fully renewable future. Well, if you do the math that means 10 times the amount of renewable energy development that we’ve done in the last 40 years, in the next 10 to 15 years. People have to understand that this is a major, a major change that’s going to require trade-offs, that’s going to require us to make decisions and to understand, again, to go back to my basic premise, there’s no free lunch. We are now undertaking the largest and most far-reaching energy transition in human history. The transition to fossil fuels took about 150 years, going back to around 1800. You can see the graph, it goes up, but we really got into the real heart of the fossil fuel economy in the mid-20th century – 150 years. We’re talking about transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewables over 15 years. Not 150, but 15. We have to grasp that this is an enormous undertaking, and it’s going to involve change. So, we are literally in a race with climate change. That’s why it’s going to have to happen in the next 10, 15, 20 years, because the consequences of not doing it are catastrophic, and we’re already seeing that. I think that we’ve reached a point where most Americans realize that climate change is real. The fishermen in Maine know it. The loggers know it. The farmers know it. The people who work with the land and the sea and the atmosphere understand what’s happening. They see it. The animals know it. They know what’s happening. And that’s why we have to make this transition. That’s why it’s so important that we make this transition, and it’s got to be fast. We don’t have time to do it for over 150 years, or even 50 years. It’s a huge change. It’s going to involve dislocation, and it’s going to involve trade-offs. That’s really the question that I want to address today. There’s broad agreement, I believe, that we need change, that we need to develop responses to the global climate change crisis. There’s certainly agreement in the environmental community, as far as that question is concerned. There’s nobody in the environmental community that I know that doubts climate change or doubts the necessity of taking dramatic action to meet it. Climate change is as real as it gets, and we have to address it. How do we address it? Non-fossil fuel electrification. If we do that, we can address the CO2. We’re talking about emissions of CO2. Is it a problem? Well, the average over the past million years of CO2 in the atmosphere is about 280 parts-per-million.  It varies up and down. People say it’s a natural cycle. Yeah, it varies up and down about 250, 300 parts-per-million. It’s now at about 420 parts-per-million it’s gone up 20 in the last two, three years. The last time we were over 400 parts-per-million of CO2 in the atmosphere, the oceans were 60 feet higher. We are in uncharted territory in human history right now, and we have to deal with it, and we have to deal with it in a hurry. Where’s all that CO2 coming from? Well, here’s a rough breakdown of the CO2 budget, about 30% from the generation of electricity – 30% to 35%. Another 30% to 35% from transportation, the combustion of fossil fuels in vehicles. The last 30% to 35% comes from space heat and industrial use. So that’s the budget we have to deal with. How do we tackle that? Electronification with electricity from renewable sources. If you have an electric vehicle and you’re feeling really good about saving the environment, you’re not saving the environment if the power for that electric vehicle comes from fossil fuels. You’re saving the environment if the power for that electric vehicle comes from renewables. So that’s what we’re talking about. But there are problems with renewables. Remember, I said I worked in the wind power business. The wind doesn’t blow all the time. The sun doesn’t shine all the time. The term is intermittency. That’s the issue, that’s the issue with renewables, is intermittency, the fact that there has to be something to supply power when the sun doesn’t shine, the wind doesn’t blow. The answer to that is storage.  Mr. President, the real green new deal is energy storage. If we can solve that problem in a cost-effective way, then we really can have a realistic, all-renewable future, because what you have with energy storage plus renewables is essentially baseload power without CO2, and that’s really the direction that we’re moving in. However, and this is what I want to really stress, you can’t be in favor of electrification, you can’t be in favor of renewable power, you can’t be in favor of electric vehicles if you’re not in favor of mining the lithium that you need for the batteries. Or covering a lot of farmers’ fields with solar panels. You can’t have those things without paying a price. It would be nice if you could. I would love it if I could wave a wand and say we’re going to get rid of fossil fuels and we’re going to have an all-renewable future. Yes, I want that. But we have to recognize that in order to get there, there are some things we have to do that, heretofore, we really haven’t been very likely to like. One of the other issues is renewable power is a lot of the renewable power is in places where there aren’t people. So we have to get that renewable power to the places where there are people. You know what that means? Transmission, new transmission lines, new rights of way. People aren’t going to be too crazy about that, but you can’t have a renewable energy future without having transmission. And you can’t have a renewable energy future without having batteries or some storage technology that, chances are, is going to require minerals and Earth minerals that you have to mine. Geography is a problem. Technology is a problem. This will require trade-offs. But we have to keep in mind that we’re talking about a global goal. We’re talking about literally saving the Earth, but we have to understand that there are going to be costs to do so. So, let’s talk about permitting. One of my favorite stories is when God came to Moses and said, Moses, I have good news and bad news. Moses says, ‘God, give me the good news.’ God says, ‘I’m going to empower you to part the waters of the Red Sea, allow my people to go free, then have the waters come back and inundate the Pharaoh’s army.’ Moses says, ‘that’s wonderful, God. What’s the bad news?’ God says, ‘you have to prepare the environmental impact statement.’ We’ve got to understand that permitting it is part of the process of going to a renewable future. Now, when I was governor of Maine I had a very clear policy – no diminution, no cutting, no cutting corners of environmental standards, but I wanted the most timely and predictable environmental permitting process in the country.  I don’t think those two things are in any way mutually exclusive. When I talk here and work with my colleagues here about permitting reform, I’m talking, we’re talking, about the process, not the standards. We’re not talking about lowering the standards, saying you can emit more or you don’t have to meet clean water standards. I sit at Edmund Muskie’s desk in my office. Lightning would strike me if I was lowering the water quality or air quality standards. But we’ve got to talk about a process that’s timely and predictable – predictable. The estimates are that to permit a mine in this country takes about ten years, about ten years. Mr. President, we don’t have ten years to spend on a permitting process if we’re going to solve this problem in time to save the country and the planet. We’ve got to figure out how to do this in a more timely way. How are we going to do it? I don’t know the details of the various discussions that are going on here, but I have some thoughts that I’ve suggested to Senator Manchin and others. One is one-stop shopping. You shouldn’t have to go to five agencies. Go to one agency in charge of the permitting process and let them lead it. Don’t make the applicant go to five, six, seven different agencies. Secondly, deadlines, real deadlines, deadlines that mean something. So that the agencies, if it says 180 days, they’ve got to have a decision in 180 days. Eisenhower retook Europe in 11 months. There’s no reason that we can’t get decisions out of some of these agencies in less than a year. So deadlines and reasonable time frames, I think, is part of this process. Accelerated appeal process, where an appeal from an environmental decision on a renewable energy project or related to a renewable energy future can go to the courts, get a fair hearing, but in a timely basis, not go through a long process that takes, again, years. Another suggestion I have, this goes back to my experience of working on renewable energy projects, there should be credit given for the nature of the project you’re doing. In other words, if you’re doing a project that is going to contribute to the solution of the problem of global climate change, you shouldn’t be treated as a strip mall. Some weight should be given to the import and the value, the environmental value of the project vis-à-vis the incidental environmental cost and I could be criticized for using the word incidental but the small costs that may be involved in getting there. I think that’s got to be how we approach this whole permitting question. So why am I here today? I’m here today to talk to my friends in the environmental community. And I do mean friends, people I’ve worked with all my life. To have them change the way they think about the environmental process and what they have conventionally and historically thought about this kind of action. Historically, and if you go back to the beginning of the environmental movement in the 60’s and 70’s and lord help me, I was there, the environmental movement was about stopping things. The environmental movement began with a proposed oil refinery on our coast. People wanted to stop it because they didn’t think it was the appropriate place. But if you think about that, a lot of the environmental movement has been about stopping things, stopping projects, stopping highways, stopping whatever. What we have to do now is think about facilitating getting things done in order to get to the renewable future that we want. I think that’s a very, very important way to look at this process. You can’t be for EVs if you’re against mining lithium. Let me give you just a couple of numbers on what I’m talking about. Copper – remember I talked about transmission – copper, copper wires to transmit electricity.  The estimate is we’re going to need as much copper annually by 2050 as has been mined in the entire prior history of the world. One year we’re going to need that much. The estimate is that in order to achieve our climate goals, we’re going to have to triple, triple the grid, the wires, the rights of way, the towers, the grid infrastructure has to be tripled in order to absorb the new and transmitted and distribute the new energy that’s going to be needed. If you have electric vehicles, you’re going to need more wires to get the power. That’s going to be a huge increase. Between doubling and tripling is the estimate of the strength of the grid.The international energy agency, not me and not some commercial group, but the international energy agency – says that by 2040 – that’s not that long from now, barely over 15 years, we’re going to need 42 times the amount of lithium that we have; 25 times more graphite; 21 times more cobalt; 19 times more nickel, 7 times more rare earth elements. We have two choices, Mr. President. We can buy those things from other countries, particularly countries that may be potential adversaries. Do we really want to be dependent on China for this kind of essential material to our environmental future? I don’t think so. But if we’re going to say we don’t want to import it, we’ve got to get it out of the ground here. And we can’t spend ten years deciding it. I’m not saying lower the standards, but I’m saying the process itself should not be used as a weapon to undermine projects that are necessary to achieve our ultimate climate goal. Mr. President, this is a change. This is a change of thinking that’s required by the reality that we face. And I’m here because I want to face that reality. I want to do something about climate change. I want to take the action that’s necessary, not token actions but the real deal. But it’s going to involve these enormous commitments of time, effort, and money and also our understanding particularly in the environmental community that there’s no free lunch. On December 2, 1862, Abraham Lincoln came to this congress to talk about the progress of the Civil War. His problem was that the Congress was being the Congress. They were doing politics, and they really he didn’t feel were taking it seriously or understood the massive change that was sweeping over the country. And at the end of that speech, the afternoon of December 2, 1862, Abraham Lincoln gave what I think is still the best analysis of how you deal with change that I’ve ever encountered. And I think it applies exactly in this situation.  Lincoln said ‘the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty. Therefore, we must rise with the occasion. As our cases new, we also must think anew and act anew.’ And then here’s the key line, ‘we must disenthrall ourselves,’ Lincoln said, ‘and then we shall save our country.’ We must disenthrall ourselves and save our country. It means think in new and different ways, let go of the way you thought about these kinds of issues in the past. Disenthrall ourselves, Mr. President, and then we shall save our planet. "
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-cosponsors-bipartisan-bill-to-replenish-americas-defense-weaponry-replace-arms-sent-to-ukraine,"September 12, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is cosponsoring bipartisan legislation to rapidly replenish stockpiles of weapons and defense technologies provided to Ukraine. The Securing American Acquisitions, Readiness, and Military Stockpiles Act (Securing American ARMS Act), would give the Department of Defense (DOD) enhanced procurement authorities to refill America’s stocks of artillery, anti-tank weapons, and other systems that are being used to support Ukraine in their fight against Russia’s unprovoked invasion. The bill is an important effort to ensure the United States can defend itself against all threats, while also aiding Ukraine’s defense against Vladimir Putin’s barbaric war.“With an Arsenal of Democracy from the free world, Ukraine’s brave armed forces are repelling Russia’s unprovoked invasion and thwarting Putin’s delusions of a new Soviet Union. It’s imperative the United States has the necessary weapons stockpiles to continue supporting Ukraine, while also ensuring our country is fully equipped to address the global threat landscape we face,” said Senator King. “The bipartisan Securing American ARMS Act would give the Department of Defense the rapid procurement tools they need to both maintain our own defenses and aid allies like Ukraine. It’s a commonsense step to improve our national security, support the industrial base, and further stymie Putin’s empire-building ambitions. I’m glad the bill has already received broad, bipartisan support, and hope we can get it passed quickly.”The Securing American ARMS Act would amend the DOD’s emergency acquisition authorities to allow them to use non-competitive procedures to quickly award a contract in order to replenish defense article stocks sent to an ally or partner after an attack by a foreign adversary of the U.S. While the DOD can use expedited procedures to speed up defense procurement in certain situations, backfilling depleted stockpiles is not one of them. This legislation lays out an exemption to permit the DOD to expedite the acquisitions process and decrease the time it takes to send aid in case of such an attack, subject to the following conditions:The bill is also cosponsored by U.S. Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Rick Scott (R-FL), Gary Peters (D-MI), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), and Lindsey Graham (R-SC). As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Armed Services Committee, and Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator King has forcefully condemned Russia’s attacks on Ukrainian sovereignty and worked to inflict maximum economic pressure against Vladimir Putin’s deadly expansionist war. He recently voted to provide significant economic and military support to Ukraine, has advocated for new sanctions against Putin, and called for maximum intelligence sharing with Ukrainian officials. Earlier this year, King joined a bipartisan Congressional delegation to Poland and Germany where he met with NATO leaders, Ukrainian refugees, and U.S. servicemembers for a first-hand look at the humanitarian crisis and America’s efforts to support Ukrainians. "
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-statement-on-anniversary-of-september-11th-attacks,"September 11, 2022BRUNSWICK, ME. – Today, U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) released the following statement on the 21st anniversary of the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks: “Twenty-one years ago, on September 11th, 2001, a heinous act of political violence took the lives of nearly 3,000 Americans, and the nightmare of terrorism struck our nation,” said Senator King. “Across the country, we watched together in horror as everyday Americans simply going about their daily business were targeted. It was one of the darkest days our nation has ever faced, but also one that showed the strength, values, and resilience of our people. As these vicious zealots sought to tear apart our nation and intimidate our people, the essence of America shone through – with countless undertaking heroic efforts to help their countrymen in need.“Today, we must remember all those who were lost on that terrible morning: from everyday New Yorkers and Pentagon workers, to the brave first responders and passengers of Flight 93 who sacrificed their lives to save thousands when it mattered most. In recent months, America continued to demonstrate the endurance of our response, and brought justice to one of the last living conspirators of the attack. “I also hope we can use this day to reflect on the shared values that make us Americans, and the national unity that shone so brightly in the aftermath of these attacks. Twenty-one years ago, we banded together to as a nation to reject hate, division, and fear – with the deep divisions we face at this moment in time, I believe we can do it once again.”"

In a letter to the Aquarium’s board led by Senator King, the Maine leaders highlight the significant factual omissions of Seafood Watch’s lobster report, criticize the organization for holding the Maine lobster industry to an impossible “guilty until proven innocent” standard, and call for answers on several key questions.“The recent decision by Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch to “Red List” Maine lobster with scant evidence of impacts on right whales is a reckless piece of activism that will inflict substantial negative real-world consequences on an important and iconic industry in Maine,” write the Maine Congressional Delegation and Governor Mills. “In a courtroom, we require evidence before convicting someone of a crime; but you are seeking to sentence Maine’s lobstermen with conjecture, assumptions, and guesswork instead of hard facts. If anything, the publicly available facts rebut this aggressive action that will impact the livelihoods of thousands of people in Maine, and make it clear that you should immediately reverse the irresponsible designation.”The Maine leaders then lay out three key facts left out of Seafood Watch’s “Red List” assessment:“By ignoring these clear facts, Seafood Watch isn’t encouraging safe fishing; instead, you are damaging the reputation of your certification process by misleading consumers. There’s an easy way to fix this – now that you’ve seen the facts, reverse your decision and take lobster off the ‘Red List,’” continued the Maine leaders.If the decision is not reversed, the leaders call for answers on five key questions:“In any fair system of justice or public proceeding, it’s required to provide evidence of wrongdoing before a verdict can be rendered – innocent until proven guilty. The process you have undertaken turns this principle on its head. How would you like to be the defendant in a process where the standard is guilty until proven innocent?” the Maine leaders conclude. “You have appointed yourself Judge, Jury, and Executioner of the Maine lobster industry – ignoring clear facts, and not meeting even the most basic burden of proof before coming to a conclusion.”You can read the full letter HERE and below.+++ Jennifer Dianto Kemmerly Vice President of Global Ocean Initiatives Monterey Bay Aquarium 886 Cannery Row, Monterey, CA 93940To the Board of Monterey Bay Aquarium:The recent decision by Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch to “Red List” Maine lobster with scant evidence of impacts on right whales is a reckless piece of activism that will inflict substantial negative real-world consequences on an important and iconic industry in Maine – which as noted in your report, is the single most valuable fishery in the United States. If you are going to make claims that will do concrete harm to a proud, responsible industry, you should have – and present – concrete facts to support these claims; not assumptions, not inferences, not possibilities, but evidence. But as you admit in your report, “due to a lack of information, it is often not possible to assign entanglements to a specific fishery.”[1]In a courtroom, we require evidence before convicting someone of a crime; but you are seeking to sentence Maine’s lobstermen with conjecture, assumptions, and guesswork instead of hard facts.If anything, the publicly available facts rebut this aggressive action that will impact the livelihoods of thousands of people in Maine, and make it clear that you should immediately reverse the irresponsible designation:Yet, none of these demonstrable, objective facts were considered in Monterey Bay’s Seafood Watch “Red Listing” decision.Not only that, your assessment fails to make the critical distinction between the Maine lobster fishery and Canadian fisheries. Since 2017, NOAA data has shown that the majority of mortalities in right whale population has been attributed to vessel strikes in Canada. These vessel strikes are not at the hand of the lobstermen in Maine.With ocean waters continuing to warm due to climate change, the omission of this distinction becomes even more unacceptable. The overwhelming majority of lobsters caught in Maine come from outside of right whale critical habitat, which represents less than three percent of the overall risk to the species. Right whales have been chasing migrating feed north and spending more time in Canadian waters (the Gulf of St. Lawrence and into the Labrador Sea), and less in the waters used by Maine fishermen, but you chose to ignore this development in your assessment.Maine lobstermen have long been committed to environmentally conscious, sustainable fishing. Your evaluation ignores the work they have been taking with the Maine Department of Marine Resources since the 1990s to support the sustainably of several large whale species.As part of ongoing collaboration with NOAA and other regulators, lobstermen have agreed to gear markings; implemented sinking ground lines; have moved to weaker lines; inserted “weak links” into vertical lines; and increased the size of their trawls to reduce the number of vertical lines in the water. Through these efforts, the Maine lobster fishery has removed an estimated 30,000 miles of line from the water in order to protect whale species.According to data collected by NOAA, these efforts have been effective, but it seems you just don’t care. Out of the ten right whale entanglements in U.S. lobster gear from 1997 through 2017, for which the set location and type of gear are known, eight occurred before 2009 and the other two involved gear from Massachusetts that was successfully removed. In your report, you refused to take these efforts into account, saying that the “effects on mitigation of whale entanglement have yet to be determined.”5 This overlooks the progress Maine lobstermen have made and is a sweeping, arbitrary assumption that all fisheries using lines and traps are a risk.By ignoring these clear facts, Seafood Watch isn’t encouraging safe fishing; instead, you are damaging the reputation of your certification process by misleading consumers. There’s an easy way to fix this – now that you’ve seen the facts, reverse your decision and take lobster off the “Red List.”If not, you owe Maine people an explanation to several key questions about your harmful “Red Listing” decision:Your accusation that Maine lobstermen are to blame for the troubles of North Atlantic Right Whales is flat out wrong. Right whales are not dying in Maine lobster gear and the report blindly ignores everything that Maine lobstermen have done to create a sustainable industry. Make no mistake, your designation will have a real world impact – with the industry already facing challenges, the inaccurate designation will hurt the thousands of hardworking lobstermen, their families, and businesses across our state.In any fair system of justice or public proceeding, it’s required to provide evidence of wrongdoing before a verdict can be rendered – innocent until proven guilty. The process you have undertaken turns this principle on its head. How would you like to be the defendant in a process where the standard is guilty until proven innocent?You have appointed yourself Judge, Jury, and Executioner of the Maine lobster industry – ignoring clear facts, and not meeting even the most basic burden of proof before coming to a conclusion. Your report repeatedly confesses that there is not any hard evidence to back your claim, and admit that Maine lobster is being “Red Listed” not on a factual basis, but “until there is more specific information available regarding which fisheries are responsible for the unattributed entanglements.”[5]That’s not science, that’s irresponsible conjecture, a baseless smear, and an egregious violation of the scientific principles you claim to stand for. This is among the most irresponsible actions we have ever seen in our years of public service, and we are deeply disappointed that you have allowed this action to – perhaps irreparably – tarnish the name of your previously-respected institution. We appreciate your attention to this incredibly important matter, and await your prompt reply. Each day which goes by with this designation in effect compounds the damage to the lobster industry and the good people of Maine."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/statement-from-senator-king-on-absurd-seafood-watch-designation,"September 06, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today released the following statement after Seafood Watch added Maine lobster to their ‘Red List’. Today's decision by Seafood Watch to 'Red List' Maine lobster is simply absurd and flies in the face of common sense. The Maine lobster industry – one of our state's most important economic drivers and a source of pride – has long been committed to environmentally conscious, sustainable fishing. There hasn’t been a whale entanglement attributed to Maine lobster gear since 2004 and no documented right whale death has ever been attributed to Maine lobster gear. By ignoring these facts, Seafood Watch isn’t encouraging safe fishing; all they’re doing is damaging what’s left of their reputation and hurting Maine people unnecessarily in the process. Make no mistake, this decision will have a real world impact – with the industry already facing challenges, the accusations of the designation will hurt thousands of families and businesses across our state. I hope the millions around the world who enjoy the delicious crustacean will see through this farce, continue to support the iconic industry, and join me in pushing for Seafood Watch to reverse this irresponsible decision and take lobster off the so-called 'Red List'."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/collins-king-co-sponsor-bill-to-address-hazing-on-college-campuses,"September 06, 2022Washington D.C.—As college students across the country return to campus for the new academic year, U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King are co-sponsoring legislation to prevent and respond to hazing.  The Report and Educate About Campus Hazing (REACH) Act would require these incidents to be reported as part of a college’s annual crime report and establish a definition of hazing to clarify what constitutes a reportable offense.  The legislation would also require institutions to establish a campus-wide, research-based program to educate students about the dangers of hazing.“Hazing is a harmful, far too common practice that damages students’ mental health and wellbeing, and in some tragic cases it has even led to serious injuries or death,” said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement.  “Students have a right to feel safe and accepted so that they can focus on their studies and fully participate in the college community.  This bill would increase accountability and transparency as well as require colleges to take steps to help reduce these dangerous incidents.”""With college students across the country experiencing mental health challenges at record rates, it has never been more important to promote the safety and well-being of our campus communities,” said University of Maine Vice President for Student Life and Inclusive Excellence and Dean of Students Robert Dana.  “We applaud Senators Collins and King for their bipartisan support of the REACH Act.  This legislation will leverage the nationally recognized, evidence-based hazing prevention education we offer at the University of Maine and our transparent reporting about any hazing incidents that unfortunately occur at postsecondary institutions.”""Findings from our national studies about student hazing reveal an urgent need for more attention to hazing as a campus safety issue,"" said Dr. Elizabeth Allan, Professor of Higher Education at the University of Maine.  ""Although we know hazing is a campus-wide issue and impacts thousands of students involved in groups and teams each year, most are unaware of the warning signs and how to report hazing when it does occur.  Policy initiatives are a vital part of a comprehensive approach to prevention and the REACH Act combines both evidence-informed education as well as a reporting mechanism for all institutions to standardize hazing incident tracking in a transparent way.  Together, these policy components will support hazing prevention while bolstering campus safety, student belonging and well-being."" Since 2000, there have been more than 50 hazing-related deaths on America’s college campuses."

During the visit, Senator King met with GMRI leaders to discuss how their Climate Center Project and Blue Economy Initiative will help the state’s coastal communities overcome 21st century challenges like climate change, a rapidly shifting economy, and more competition from around the globe. He also joined GMRI President and CEO Don Perkins for a tour of the site where CDS investments are expanding their efforts. Senator King secured this federal funding in the recently-passed 2022 Omnibus Appropriations Package.“Maine’s coastal communities are changing. From a warming climate to an evolving economy, the Gulf of Maine faces both historic opportunities and challenges that will define our state’s success for generations. In partnership with the federal government and non-profits like the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, we can adapt in order to grow our economy, strengthen our communities, and address the threats of climate change,” said Senator King. “These two new Congressionally-Directed Spending investments will provide GMRI the tools it needs to expand their important climate efforts and help the seafood industry adapt to these rapidly shifting dynamics. This will mean a brighter future for Maine’s coast and all the people who rely on it. Today’s visit was a powerful reminder of how Congressionally-Directed Spending is being responsive to our state’s needs and the hard work that is being done to secure a better Maine. I’m incredibly proud that we were able to help GMRI receive this funding.”“Without a doubt, climate change is the foremost ocean challenge of our time,” said GMRI President/CEO Don Perkins. “With support for our Climate Center and Gulf of Maine Ventures work, we’ll help coastal communities mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change, while also realizing emerging economic opportunities in our region.”Based in Portland, GMRI is a leading research nonprofit focused on the marine ecology of the Gulf of Maine and the many challenges of ocean stewardship and economic growth in the region. They received two Congressionally-Directed Spending investments from Senator King in the 2022 Omnibus Appropriations Package:Authorized in 2021 on a bipartisan basis, Congressionally-Directed Spending reflects funding priorities advocated for by a state’s Senators and Representatives, and is included in annual federal appropriations legislation to provide a specific amount of discretionary funding to a state, locality, or nonprofit organization for projects with demonstrated civic and community value. In the 2022 Omnibus Appropriations Package, which passed 68-31, Senator King secured funding for 93 Maine projects for a total of $137,252,598."

In the ninth interview of the series, conducted in partnership with the Library of Congress’ Veterans History Project, Senator King spoke with Gardiner resident Auta Main, who served in the Air Force as a Russian Linguist during the height of the Cold War. During the interview, Auta shared with the Senator her story of joining the military to support her family, the high-stakes work of linguistics and communications during the Cold War, and what it was like serving as a closeted gay woman during the 70s.“It was an honor to speak with Auta Main and hear the story of her courageous service in this episode of ‘Answering the Call: Maine’s Veteran Voices.’ From joining the Air Force to support her family, to her current work with veterans, Auta has continuously shown what it means to selflessly defend our nation and the principles of our founders,” said Senator King. “Along with her critical work as a Russian linguist during the Cold War, Auta has helped the country live up to our promises of equality and opportunity. As a gay woman serving in the 70s, she paved the way for the current generation of LGBTQ+ servicemembers to live openly without fear. Her lifetime of dedication is a true inspiration, and I am grateful she could join me to share her story.”Auta Main grew up in Dresden, Maine with her seven siblings in a three bedroom house with just one bathroom. They were a rural, working class family, with her father working as a pipe fitter at BIW. Auta had two uncles who had served in Korea, but she never considered military service until she realized her college scholarships weren’t going to be enough and that her older sister was struggling to pay her college bills. So when an Air Force recruiter approached Auta, it was a path to support both herself and her family and she enlisted in 1976.Leaving the state for the second time in her life, Auta took her first flight ever to basic training in San Antonio and recalls the physical, mental, and emotional tests that left little time for homesickness or anxiety. Even more importantly, she remembers a strong sense of purpose, camaraderie, and duty she quickly came to love. As she and her fellow recruits began choosing their fields, Auta, who knew members of the Russian community in Dresden, decided to become a Russian linguist. The Air Force linguists received trainings in intercepting and translating Russian radio frequencies, a post that would take Auta to Germany.Auta served for almost 3 years in Augsburg, Germany where she worked to intercept Soviet radio messages. While the frequencies she intercepted were primarily military exercises and counter-intelligence, she became skilled in recognizing the types of vehicles they were using by the background noise alone. In the height of the Cold War, it was clear this work was being closely watched by USSR intelligence, and was critical to maintaining peace.Auta’s time in the Air Force was also a time of personal discovery. She had enlisted with a male fiancé waiting for her back in Maine, but the first time she fell in love was in the Air Force, with a woman. As she began to fully understand her sexual orientation, she faced the threat of expulsion if she was ever outed. Auta saw other queer women threatened and pushed out, and said that the homophobia was a large part of why she decided to leave the Force. Auta married her wife just two weeks after the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage, and they now live happily together in Maine. As she reflects on LGBTQ+ rights in the military she remarks, “Let people who want to serve, serve!” and is glad to see so many service members today being able to celebrate their identities without shame or fear. She now works to help veterans transition from military to civilian life.The Veterans History Project is an effort by the Library of Congress to collect, preserve and distribute the personal accounts of American war veterans so that future generations may hear directly from veterans and better understand the realities of war. The interviews and primary documents from the project are then used by researchers, historians, students, and filmmakers across the country. Senator King joins many other Members of Congress who’ve participated in the project. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator King has been a staunch advocate for America’s servicemembers and veterans. Over the last year, he’s worked to honor and preserve veterans’ stories with his “Answering the Call” interview series in partnership with the Library of Congress, and with the Honoring Purple Heart Recipients Act of 2022 that would honor and recognize the sacrifices of Purple Heart medal recipients. King also recently celebrated the Senate’s passage of the PACT Act, which would provide veterans exposed to toxic hazards their earned healthcare and benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)."

We have significant economic and national security interests in the High North, and can no longer afford to delay investments in the critical region,” said Senator King. “With the Arctic warming and opening for activity, we must be ready to capitalize on new opportunities while confronting areas of growing tension – including Russia’s blatant disregard for global norms and China’s increasing aggression.“The nations of the High North are already defining the future of the region, with even non-Arctic nations like India pursuing large strategic investments. The United States must match these infrastructure investments and be at the table with a Senate-confirmed Ambassador that will bring the full authority of our nation to the Arctic. It’s a choice between advancing our interests or watching the rest of the world define our future.“I’m glad President Biden has established this new ambassadorship. I look forward to meeting the eventual nominee, evaluating their credentials, and hopefully supporting a swift confirmation to the critical post,” concluded Senator King. “There is still more work to be done, but this is an essential step forward that I’ve been urging for years.”As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Armed Services Committee, and Co-Chair of the U.S. Senate Arctic Caucus, Senator King is an advocate for Maine and America’s interests in the North Atlantic and Arctic region. Along with Caucus co-chair Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), King introduced the Arctic Commitment Act this month to improve America’s posture and opportunities in the Arctic. He’s been calling for the appointment of an Arctic Ambassador since 2015, and has continued to press the Administration on the effort this year.

Yet, according to the National Taxpayer Advocate (NTA), the paper return backlog has actually increased by 1.3 million and the agency has only been able to meet 12 percent of its hiring goals. Additionally, refunds are currently taking six months or longer on average compared to previous historical processing times of four to six weeks and the agency has left four out of five phone calls it receives unanswered.The lawmakers added, “[W]e believe that the IRS must take additional steps to improve customer service issues, decrease processing delays, and work-down the backlog of paper returns and correspondence by continuing the maximum use of overtime and surge teams, as well as the continued suspension of automated notices and collections—which have been critical in reducing pandemic-related tax return and correspondence backlogs.” In addition to Senators Collins and King, the letter was also signed in the Senate by Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). "

The new law, which unanimously passed the U.S. Senate in January, will help create jobs and strengthen American national security by fast-tracking the permitting process for makers of semiconductors and other key national security products. Combined with the now-law CHIPS for America Act, these bills will help spur a massive advancement in the domestic production of advanced technologies. The legislation was introduced by Senator King with his colleagues Senators Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio).“From basic household appliances to advanced defense systems, almost every piece of modern life relies on semiconductors. As supply chains struggle and tensions with China rise, it’s abundantly clear America can no longer afford to be dependent on competitors for these critical technologies,” said Senator King. “Our bipartisan permitting reforms will encourage a rapid expansion of the domestic semiconductor production critical to the nation’s long-term economic success and security. This is a commonsense step to support innovation – and, partnered with the historic investments of the CHIPS Act, will be a major boost to American competitiveness in the 21st century. I’m grateful to Senators Hagerty and Portman for their partnership on this bill and to President Biden for signing it into law.”The Senators’ bipartisan law will reduce the time it takes to obtain the permitting necessary to build semiconductor and other key manufacturing facilities in the United States, encouraging these businesses to locate their operations in the United States. It’s expected to create American jobs, reduce the nation’s dependence on China, and shore up supply chains that are essential to national security. As Co-Chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission and the Senate Semiconductor Caucus, and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee, Senator King has been committed to advancing American competitiveness in 21st century technologies while improving national security and strengthening supply chains. He recently celebrated the passage of the CHIPS for America Act, a historic investment in the United States’ leading-edge technology manufacturing and scientific innovation. Along with advocating for more semiconductor manufacturing, King has been a leader in expanding 21st century broadband connections across America, and is one of the Senate’s strongest advocates for American energy storage technology."

AMI is producing innovative textiles, and they deserve world-class opportunities. Together, with businesses like AMI and the Export-Import Bank’s new Make More in America Initiative, I’m hopeful that we can grow Maine’s access to international markets and strengthen our state’s economy.”“The Export-Import Bank of the United States is committed to expanding our outreach to small businesses across the country so we can support them as they grow their export business into diverse markets,” said Vice Chair Pryor. “I thank Sen. King for inviting me to Maine to discuss the resources available through EXIM for small businesses to increase their competitiveness and boost global sales. This, in turn, fulfills EXIM’s mission of supporting U.S. job growth through exports.”“We were excited to host Senator King and Judith Pryor, Vice Chair of EXIM Bank! It was a fantastic opportunity to show the major improvements we're making at AMI: upgrading facilities, adding specialized equipment, and developing a larger, skilled workforce,” said AMI President and CEO Kathie Leonard. “The devastation of COVID proved America needs a strong defense and commercial industrial base including small and medium sized manufacturers that can meet US demand and compete globally. AMI is one of the many that is in recovery thanks to the support of federal and state governments working together.”  Auburn Manufacturing Inc.

Early shortages of personal protective equipment demonstrated the challenges of supply chains dependent on adversarial foreign nations. Demands place on healthcare workers exacerbated workforce challenges particularly in underserved and rural communities. For those of us working on issues of national cyber resilience, COVID-19 was accompanied by another epidemic – that of ransomware.Ransomware attacks on the HPH sector have skyrocketed in the past two years as opportunistic criminals recognized that hospitals may pay quickly to resolve issues and protect patient safety. Meanwhile, the troves of personally identifiable information and personal health information make organizations in the sector valuable targets for both criminal and nation-state hackers.Against this backdrop, we were heartened to see the White House host an executive forum on healthcare cybersecurity and the recognition by your Department and the other participants of the importance of improving the cybersecurity of this vital critical infrastructure sector. We also appreciate the FDA’s prioritization of medical device cybersecurity and the growing ability of the Department’s Critical Infrastructure Protection Division and the Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) to explain cyber threats through a sector-focused lens.We remain concerned, however, about the lack of robust and timely sharing of actionable threat information with industry partners and the need to dramatically scale up the Department’s capabilities and resources. With cyber threats growing exponentially, we must prioritize addressing the HPH sector’s cybersecurity gaps.As former co-chairs of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, and authors of the Sector Risk Management Agency (SRMA) legislation now in use, we recognize the important partnership between the executive and legislative branches to properly organize and resource public-private collaboration to protect against cyber threats. Thus, we are requesting a briefing from your office on the status of efforts to strengthen the department’s capabilities as the SRMA and to operationalize collaboration with the organizations throughout the sector.As part of this briefing, we would appreciate an assessment of:We and our colleagues can only conduct effective oversight if we understand the challenges that your department and the HPH sector are facing. As such, as part of the briefing, I would welcome an unclassified threat briefing from your office on the cybersecurity risks to this most vital critical infrastructure sector.Thank you for your attention to this important issue. I look forward to working with you to improve the cybersecurity of the healthcare and public health sector and, by extension, make our nation more resilient in cyberspace.Sincerely,"

The new law expands VA benefits eligibility for more than 3.5 million veterans with exposure to toxic hazards like burn pits and Agent Orange – meeting the present and future needs of America’s servicemembers. “Today, America has taken a historic, long overdue step to meet the solemn commitment of support we owe to our veterans,” said Senator King. “Thousands of America’s men and women in uniform have been exposed to toxic substances in the line of duty, and for far too long, our nation left these servicemembers to battle the resulting health issues alone. After years of advocacy from veterans groups, the just-signed PACT Act finally addresses this moral failure by providing hazard-exposed veterans the full benefits, support, and healthcare they deserve. The law will save lives, and makes it abundantly clear that America will always support the needs of those who served. I’m deeply grateful for everyone who worked to make today’s signing possible, and for President Biden’s support of the critical effort. The effort may have hit a few roadbumps, but at the end of the day, Congress came together and overwhelmingly delivered on our nation’s enduring promise to our servicemembers.”Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson deployed to Kosovo and Iraq with the Ohio National Guard and died in 2020 from toxic exposure as a result of his military service. The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022 will: As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator King has been a staunch advocate for America’s servicemembers and veterans. He has made addressing the mental health and suicide epidemic facing America’s veterans one of his top priorities, and after hearing the suggestion during a Veterans History Project Interview, secured a report on servicemember suicide in the committee draft of the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act.

https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-introduces-bill-to-improve-access-to-katahdin-woods-and-waters,"August 10, 2022BRUNSWICK, ME – U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine), Chairman of the Senate National Parks Subcommittee, has introduced bipartisan legislation to improve visitors’ access to the Katahdin Woods and Waters (KWW) National Monument and support more tourist activity in the region. The Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument Access Act, cosponsored by Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine), would authorize the expansion of KWW by giving the National Park Service (NPS) permission to acquire land that better connect the Monument to the Millinocket region and major roadways.The bill also includes provisions to allow the NPS to acquire buildings for Monument administration and visitor services outside of park boundaries. All expansions will occur with the cooperation of willing landowners, will protect traditional hunting, fishing and snowmobile usage on the acquired property, and are expressly forbidden from being done through eminent domain.“Since its establishment, Katahdin Woods and Waters has helped thousands of people from around the world enjoy Maine’s unmatched beauty and brought important economic opportunity to our state,” said Senator King. “The Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument Access Act would build on the Monument’s successes and let more people experience this Maine treasure. The expansions the bill authorizes would allow for a smoother entry into the park, bring visitors closer to the heart of the Millinocket community, and further expand the Katahdin region’s tourism economy. It’s an important step to support the future of the Monument and Maine’s outdoor recreation heritage. I’m grateful for the local leaders who have helped develop this bill, and hope it can continue to receive bipartisan support across Congress.”“With vast acres of forests, scenic trails, pristine rivers, and breathtaking views of Mount Katahdin, KWW is a true paradise for outdoor enthusiasts,” said Senator Collins. “By facilitating the creation of a second entrance, this commonsense bill would allow more visitors to explore the monument more easily from the south, while preserving existing access to hunting, fishing, and snowmobiling. Additionally, by enhancing the accessibility of KWW, this bill would provide a boost to Millinocket, East Millinocket, and other local communities, helping to create jobs.  I have supported efforts to make KWW a success, and this legislation would help the Katahdin region thrive and chart a better economic future.”The expansion is widely supported by Katahdin region leaders. National Parks Subcommittee Chairman King hopes to hold a hearing on the legislation later this year and welcomes feedback from the community about how the measure can be improved as it moves through the legislative process.“The Katahdin Chamber of Commerce supports the bipartisan KWW Access Bill as it creates additional access to the Monument in order that all communities in the Katahdin region can benefit from enhanced economic opportunities,” Tom Shafer, President of the Katahdin Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors“As a business owner in the Katahdin region I have seen increased foot traffic over the last five plus years. Although many factors have contributed, the designation of the National Monument and the increasing support of the Monument from the local communities certainly has to be high on the list,” said Jamie Brundrett, Owner of the Katahdin General Store. “With the ability to create greater access to the monument through willing landowners, I believe my business will continue to see additional incremental growth.” The Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument Access Act would give the Department of the Interior authority to acquire multiple parcels to the south of the Monument. View a map of the parcels HERE. The bill also gives the Secretary of the Interior authority to acquire or lease essential facilities for the administration and visitor services outside of park boundaries. As Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on National Parks and a lifelong advocate for conservation, Senator King has spent decades championing environmental stewardship and advocacy. Senator King was an active participant in discussions to ensure that the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument would not be designated against the will of local citizens; after it became clear that the monument had widespread public support, continued Maine’s longstanding outdoor traditions, and yielded economic benefits to the region, he pushed against a 2017 Department of the Interior review that threatened to roll back the designation. Senator King also recently led the Great American Outdoors Act to address the $12 billion maintenance backlog in our national parks. For his continued leadership, Senator King was awarded the inaugural National Park Foundation “Hero” Award."

Combined with Senator King’s just passed semiconductor permitting reform bill, these two efforts reduce America’s reliance on China and will help spur a massive, rapid expansion in the domestic production of semiconductors and advanced technologies.“There are few technologies more fundamental in the 21st century than semiconductors – they’re an essential part of the cars we drive, the houses we live in, and the defense systems that protect our nation,” said Senator King. “Today, the United States took a significant step to produce these modern building blocks at home and reduce our nation’s reliance on foreign competitors. The just-signed CHIPS for America Act will make a massive investment in the domestic production and development of the semiconductors critical to our national security and economy. Combined with my recently passed semiconductor permitting bill, these actions will kickstart a new era of American innovation, create thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs, and help address the supply chain issues driving rising prices for cars and consumer electronics worldwide.

https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-votes-for-inflation-reduction-act-to-lower-costs-fight-climate-change-and-cut-the-deficit,"August 07, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King, (I-Maine) today voted for the Inflation Reduction Act, an historic package to address rising energy and healthcare costs, fight climate change, create jobs and cut the deficit. The legislation includes significant, commonsense changes to Medicare that caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $2000 a year and allows Medicare to negotiate lower prices for many of the drugs it purchases. The bill will also make investments to help reduce consumers’ short-term energy costs and support America’s renewable energy future. The Inflation Reduction Act is fully paid for, and includes Senator King’s proposals for a 15% corporate minimum tax and stronger IRS tax enforcement to reduce the deficit by trillions. Combined, the unprecedented effort – which passed 51-50 with the Vice President’s tie breaking vote – will mean lower costs for Maine people, a stronger economy, and a more aggressive national approach to slowing climate change.“From electric bills to groceries, people across Maine are struggling with rising prices. While there are dozens of causes of inflation, they boil down to one result: your money isn’t going as far as it used to,” said Senator King. “The Inflation Reduction Act is a major step to address growing daily expenses and bring both immediate and long-term inflation relief to Maine people. This historic legislation will cut costs, create jobs, and curb climate change while reducing the federal deficit.“The bill directly addresses areas where costs are rising the most, including healthcare and energy prices. After years of Maine people – especially seniors – spending too much on their medications, the bill will allow Medicare to negotiate significant discounts for America’s seniors and cap beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket medication costs at $2,000 per year. It also extends critical Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies to keep premiums low,” Senator King continued. “This will mean lower healthcare costs and less financial stress for the 30% of our state enrolled in Medicare and the more than one hundred thousand Maine people who receive healthcare through the ACA.“Along with healthcare, the historic package works to drive down the costs of oil and gas, while investing in a future of American-produced clean energy. With investments in the domestic production of fossil fuels, we can put more gas on the market and lower prices while we transition to cleaner energy sources,” continued Senator King. “Combined with support for household energy savers like heat pumps and insulation, the bill could cut energy expenses for the average Maine family by almost $2,000 a year – and that’s just the short-term benefits. Looking to the future, we can lower long-term energy costs by incentivizing clean, affordable, American-produced energy. That’s why the Inflation Reduction Act provides much-needed funds to boost domestic manufacturing of wind, solar, hydropower, battery storage, and other key technologies. It’ll help to reduce carbon emissions by nearly 40% from 2005 levels and create thousands of good-paying jobs nationwide.“Beyond these significant inflation-cutting investments, the Inflation Reduction Act legislation will also reduce the deficit by an estimated $1.9 trillion over the next two decades by closing tax loopholes long exploited by massive corporations and the wealthiest Americans. This won’t raise taxes one cent on working people – instead, it makes sure a welder at BIW won’t be paying more in income taxes than a giant multinational company,” Senator King concluded. “With all these provisions combined, the Inflation Reduction Act is a huge step to lower healthcare and energy costs, cut carbon emissions, and reduce the deficit for decades. It’s a game-changing piece of legislation that addresses today’s challenges and set Americans up for continued success in the decades ahead.”The Inflation Reduction Act will:LOWER HEALTH CARE AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTSCUT ENERGY COSTS AND ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGEREDUCE THE DEFICT AND CLOSE TAX LOOPHOLES"

https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-statement-on-senate-approval-of-sweden-and-finlands-nato-accession,"August 03, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King, a member of the Senate North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Observer Group, today released the below statement after the Senate voted near-unanimously to admit Sweden and Finland into the defensive alliance following Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The vote comes shortly after Senator King joined a bipartisan Congressional Delegation to Eastern Europe, Turkey, and Finland.  “Six months ago, Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops to invade Ukraine with no provocation, hoping to divide the NATO Alliance and to rebuild the Soviet Union. He has failed on both counts. The United States and our allies have stood steadfast against Russian aggression, reaffirmed our commitment to NATO, and provided Ukraine with the tools to hold strong against Putin’s attacks. Today, the U.S. Senate took a historic step to build on this resolute response by approving Sweden and Finland’s applications to join the defensive alliance. “The addition of these two allies will make NATO stronger and more united in the face of Putin’s misguided ambitions. Combined, Sweden and Finland are a significant boost to the defensive capabilities of the alliance. I saw firsthand the benefits of these potential new members earlier this year, when I traveled to Finland as part of a bipartisan Congressional Delegation shortly after they formally requested to join NATO. It was clear the nation and its leaders shared our commitment to promoting democracy, countering Russian aggression, and strengthening the international rule of law. I am hopeful that both applications will continue to move forward swiftly.“This vote has made one thing abundantly clear: the free world stands united against Vladimir Putin’s would-be empire building, and is ready to respond against his illegal and immoral military attacks. NATO, the United States, and the U.S. Senate will not allow him to destroy freedom-loving nations; we will stand with our allies, as we have in the past, united against despotism.”"

In a hearing of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee focused on changes to the ECA, King laid out threats the ambiguous law poses to our democracy, stressed the urgent necessity of reforms, and shared insights from the more than a year of work he’s done on modernization efforts. Senator King has been a leader on reforming the ECA, and in February, released a discussion draft with Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) to inform Senate-wide efforts to update the law to reflect 21st century threats.“This is not a partisan issue. This is a mechanical issue. This is a rules issue that involves how our government should work, no matter who's in charge,” said Senator King. “This coming January 6, 2025, a Democratic vice president will be in that chair and I just think that what we have to emphasize, that we shouldn't try to game this out on a partisan basis and think that this favors one side or the other. I don't think it does, because there's no telling what the circumstances will be in particular states or here in the Congress in future years.”“The very first class I took in government in college – the very first class… the professor said: ‘the thing that America has achieved that has been rarely achieved in world history is the peaceful transfer of power.’ That's unusual in world history. And the way we've achieved that is by having a written constitution and a set of rules that have guided us,” Senator King continued. “If you have ambiguity and confusion, that opens the way to conflict and ultimately violence, as we saw on January 6. So the core concept is the peaceful transfer of power. And underlaying that is a clear set of rules and principles that people can all understand and accept in advance.”“So I don't think there's a more important matter before us in this Congress, and it's one that I hope that we can resolve quickly. And, again, it should be on an entirely bipartisan basis, and it's a fundamental issue that goes to the heart of our democratic system,” Senator King concluded.+++After his opening statement, King questioned election law experts Bob Bauer and Derek Muller about the dangers and implications of the “independent legislature” theory which gives vast power over elections to state legislatures.Senator King: “I want to raise an issue that hasn't been discussed. All of you very comfortably asserted that this was constitutional, that the [Electoral Count Reform Act] was constitutional. Mr. Muller, I think you used the term well within constitutional balance. I'm worried about the implications of the so called independent legislature theory. And the theory basically holds that there's a subtle difference between the election clauses, the clause in article one and the election clause in article two. Article one says, ‘legislatures and the state shall set election rules’, but then semicolon, ‘Congress may amend or override those rules. In the election clause for the president it talks about, ‘the state shall select electors in a manner the legislature shall direct.’ There's no provision for congressional express provision as there is in article one. There’s no provision for congressional — no express provision as there is in article one. And there are those who assert, and apparently we now have three Justices – Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch – who appear to accept this independent legislature theory that nothing can override and they can do anything they want whenever they want. Mr. Bauer, let me start with you. Since you're a graduate of the same law school that I am, I'll give you the privilege of beginning. What do you think of this theory? And is this a concern in the context of what we're discussing here today?”Mr. Bauer: “No, I don't believe it is. There's been a lot of different meanings assigned to the term independent state legislative doctrine. But I think one thing is very clear, which is whatever state legislatures may do in the matter of appointing electors, they cannot violate other constitutional provisions. They are still faced with the requirement that their actions be consistent with the due process and equals protection clause with the right to vote under the first amendment. So there are constraints and I don't think in the most extreme form that somebody might suggest that one might understand independent state legislature doctrine. I don't think that would be an accurate statement of what is available to state legislatures under our constitution.”Senator King: “Mr. Muller, your thoughts?”Mr. Muller: “Congress has the power to define the time of choosing electors. One of the really important things this bill does is by eliminating the fail-to-make-a-choice provision and saying all of the rules have to be in place as of election day, then it puts in place that if you're going to hold a popular election, we're going to follow those rules, there's no opportunity to show up later and do something else. And so while there might be in the most aggrandized theory of the independent state legislature to say the legislature can do whatever it wants, perhaps that's true, but it has to do it on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, and it has to have laws in place well before that election.”Senator King: “So the power in the Congress to set the date is a constraint on the legislature acting retroactively?”Mr. Muller: “Correct.”Senator King: “That's reassuring. Mr. Gore, do you agree?”Mr. Gore: “I do agree that the independent state legislature doctrine is not implicated by the Reform Act, and I agree with Professor Muller's reasons for that and I'll just add that this provision that clarifies that the governing law for presidential elections is state law enacted by state legislatures prior to Election Day, further allays any concerns there might be under that doctrine.”In February, after months of consultation with experts, elections officials, lawyers, and historians, Senator King released a draft Electoral Count Modernization Act to establish clear, consistent, and fair procedures for the counting and certification of electoral votes for the presidency. He intended that his draft with Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Chair of the Senate Rules Committee, and Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) could assist the discussions other groups and Senators were having about reforming the outdated law."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-murkowski-introduce-comprehensive-arctic-trade-and-security-bill,"August 03, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Angus King (I-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Co-Chairs of the Senate Arctic Caucus, have introduced bipartisan, comprehensive legislation to improve America’s posture and opportunities in the Arctic. The Arctic Commitment Act includes a wide variety of Arctic-focused provisions pertaining to national security, shipping, research, and trade. The bill requires reports on eliminating Russia’s monopoly on Arctic shipping and establishing a permanent U.S. maritime presence in Alaskan and Maine locations, while prescribing improved coordination among federal agencies on Arctic matters.“The United States is an Arctic Nation, and it is long overdue that we think and act strategically to seize the new opportunities of the High North, as well as the challenges of the region,” said Senator King.  “We cannot be bystanders in the region when we are at a true inflection point in the Arctic.  We must be participants – and part of that leadership role includes investments in infrastructure, and standing up for our national interests through military and policy means that demonstrate our commitment and vision to making our presence a priority there.  I thank my Co-Chair on the Senate Caucus for sharing this bipartisan perspective as we make our intentions clear to pursue and defend America’s interests.”“I have long raised the importance of Alaska’s location and the immense value being an Arctic nation provides to our nation,” said Senator Murkowski. “This leadership role requires our attention, stewardship and active effort. I am proud to introduce this comprehensive Arctic bill—covering everything from arctic shipping, to national security, to domain awareness and presence, and strengthening our relationships with fellow Arctic nations. Opportunities abound in the Arctic, but accompanying them are great challenges and serious competition. This legislation takes measures to help protect our Arctic interests, project our capabilities in the High North, leverage our strategic location, and deepen relations with Arctic allies. The United States is an Arctic nation, and we must invest and lead in the region.”The Arctic Commitment Act works to improve America’s standing in the Arctic by: As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Armed Services Committee, and Co-Chair of the U.S. Senate Arctic Caucus, Senator King is an advocate for Maine and America’s interests in the North Atlantic and Arctic region. Along with Caucus co-chair Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), King recently supported Finland and Sweden joining the NATO alliance, and supported the decision of Arctic intergovernmental forums, including the Arctic Council and Arctic Economic Council, to publicly denounce Russia’s unprovoked attacks against Ukraine and stand with America’s partners. King recently laid out the challenges and opportunities of a warming arctic in an article in the Wilson Quarterly, and in this year’s National Defense Authorization Act, he successfully secured the inclusion of provisions to increase America’s activity and opportunities in the Far North."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/for-americas-cyberdefense-king-backs-maine-resident-for-key-diplomacy-post,"August 03, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine), Co-Chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC), today introduced Nathaniel Fick, nominee to be the State’s Department’s Ambassador at Large for Cyberspace and Digital Policy, to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In his opening remarks, King highlighted the significant importance of the diplomatic role which was recommended by the CSC, and urged members of the Committee to expeditiously advance the well-qualified Cape Elizabeth resident’s nomination. The CSC Co-Chair also used his appearance before the Committee to stress the importance of cyberdiplomacy and internationally agreed-upon legal and ethical norms in the 21st century.“One of [the CSC’s] principal recommendations was the creation of an office or a bureau in the State Department to deal with international issues relating to cyber, and they can be anything from coordinating international response to a cyber-attack to establishing norms and standards in cyberspace, a kind of Geneva Convention of cyber,” Senator King said in his introductory remarks. He then added that the United States needs to be “participating in international panels that set standards for the Internet that, frankly, this country has not been as active in as we should be.”Nathaniel Fick is a Cape Elizabeth, Maine resident and is the general manager of Elastic Security, where he leads Elastic’s information security business. Previously, he was CEO of Endgame, a cybersecurity software company, from 2012 through its acquisition by Elastic in 2019. Fast Company magazine named him one of the One Hundred Most Creative People in Business, and under his leadership, Forbes selected Endgame as one of the one hundred best cloud companies in the world. Fick started his career as a U.S. Marine Corps infantry and reconnaissance officer, including combat tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. Fick holds a BA in classics from Dartmouth College, an MPA from Harvard Kennedy School, and an MBA from Harvard Business School.Touting Mr. Fick’s qualifications and background, Senator King said “If you took a blank sheet of paper and tried to design a person to fit this new position, you would have come up with someone of Nate Fick, extraordinary qualifications and background.” Citing his Marine Corps service, King added that Fick “Served in Iraq and Afghanistan, later served as the CEO of a nonprofit, the center for New American Security, at which time he dealt with issues of cyber and international ramifications of cyber. He then has worked in the private sector as the CEO of a software company, again involved in issues of cyber… Immensely well qualified, very thoughtful, engaged in this issue. And I think, as I said, I cannot imagine a better candidate to fulfill this position. And the fact that he's from the state of Maine is simply gravy.”The Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy (CDP) began operations in April 2022 after its creation was recommended by the Cyberspace Solarium Commission.  The Bureau leads and coordinates the State Department’s work on cyberspace and digital diplomacy. If confirmed, Fick will be the first Ambassador at Large for the Bureau where he will build on the CDP’s work to encourage responsible state behavior in cyberspace and advance policies that protect the integrity and security the United States. As Co-Chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC), and a member of the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, Senator King is recognized as one of Congress’ leading experts on cyberdefense and is a strong advocate for a forward-thinking cyberstrategy that emphasizes layered cyberdeterrence. Since it officially launched in April 2019, dozens of CSC recommendations have been enacted into law, including the creation of a National Cyber Director."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senator-king-gains-commitment-for-accountability-from-intelligence-inspector-general-nominee,"August 03, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – In a confirmation hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) urged a top nominee to support accountability in the Intelligence Community by protecting whistleblowers. During his questioning, King stressed the historic importance of America’s whistleblower protections at otherwise secret agencies, and asked Terrence Edwards – nominee to be Inspector General at the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) – if he would protect these long-standing, uncommon laws. Edwards agreed with Senator King, and pledged to “absolutely” protect the critical form of government oversight.“Part of the [Inspector General’s] responsibility is the oversight and management of the whistleblower process. It's interesting, I learned some time ago the first whistleblower law in the US preceded the Constitution. It was in 1788 the Continental Congress passed the first whistleblower law. And it is again, it's sort of anomalous for the government to pay people to differ with its own activity,” said Senator King. “So can you commit to this committee that you will have a fair, open and reasonable process for dealing with whistleblowers and not in any way try to suppress information that might come forward?”“Yes, I will absolutely commit to that,” replied Mr. Edwards. “Whistleblowers are essential to this process and to oversight. We must make sure, and if I confirm, I will make sure that all of the processes in my office to educate them, to open and welcome them, to report any concerns that they have are effective, confidential and freeze them from any chances of reprisal.”+++During his questioning, Senator King also highlighted the importance of inspectors general in the Intelligence Community being independent from their agency, and having the fortitude to “bite the hand that appointed you.”“The real qualification for this job is back bone, is the willingness, and in fact the relishing, of taking a position that is contrary to that of the people who hired you. And give me some reassurance because as Senator Rubio pointed out at the beginning, the odd thing about these jobs that we're talking about here is you're going to work for a secret agency. Nobody else is watching other than this committee and it's comparable committee in the House,” said Senator King. “In other words, the public doesn't there's no newspaper that reports that can know what's going on within the NRO, that knows about the contracts, how they're structured. So it's doubly important, it seems to me, because of the secret nature of the agency. And that makes your job doubly important because very few other people are looking. Reassure me that you're willing to bite the hand that appointed you.” As a member of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees, and Co-Chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC), Senator King is seen as a highly-influential voice in the intelligence and national security conversation. He has worked to provide America’s Intelligence Community the tools they need to meet 21st century challenges, while ensuring the agencies have proper oversite and accountability. "
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/collins-king-urge-pentagon-to-address-childcare-issues-at-portsmouth-naval-shipyard,"August 02, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins, a member of the Appropriations Committee, and Angus King, a member of the Armed Services Committee, are calling on the Department of Defense (DOD) to expand childcare resources at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNSY) after new DOD guidance has caused dozens of the shipyard’s civilian employees to lose access to the vital service. In a letter to Deputy Secretary of Defense Katherine Hicks with New Hampshire Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, the lawmakers stress the importance of childcare for shipyard employees, express serious concern about the new prioritization policy, and request immediate action to assist impacted families.“We respectfully request your urgent support for the Department of Defense (DoD) civilian families of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard’s (PNSY) childcare center who were recently displaced from the center as a result of the childcare prioritization guidance. The center accommodates families from multiple services including Navy, Army and Air Force, as well as DoD civilian employees who are invaluable contributors to the important work being done at PNSY on behalf of the nation,” said the Senators. “While we understand the childcare capacity issues DoD is facing, it is simply unacceptable to displace families from DoD childcare centers without facilitating a seamless and equitable transition of care to an alternative center.”“In June of this year, the Department announced revised supplanting regulations that adversely impacted DoD civilian families utilizing PNSY’s childcare center. The subsequent decision by the Navy forced several dozen DoD civilian families to obtain alternative childcare facilities off-base,” the Senators continued. “The impact of this decision and the subsequent displacement of civilian families not only harms civilian workforce readiness but also further impairs recruiting and retention, which have been longstanding challenges for our public shipyards. Reliable childcare is a strong incentive to work at PNSY, and everything should be done to increase capacity on installations and implement programs to secure commensurately affordable childcare in the community for families that are unable to use on-base childcare services.”“We urge you to ensure that you are putting in place long-term staffing, resourcing and facilities plans that will provide the childcare needed to meet increasing demand in the region,” the Senators conclude. “Adequately and swiftly addressing shortfalls in quality of life such as childcare, housing and parking for the DoD civilian workforce is essential to our national security readiness and sustaining our military-industrial base. We are deeply proud of the important work being done for our nation at PNSY and believe that we must take every step necessary to ensure we are providing for the essential workers that we rely on.”The full letter can be read in full here and below.+++Dear Secretary Hicks:We respectfully request your urgent support for the Department of Defense (DoD) civilian families of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard’s (PNSY) childcare center who were recently displaced from the center as a result of the childcare prioritization guidance. The center accommodates families from multiple services including Navy, Army and Air Force, as well as DoD civilian employees who are invaluable contributors to the important work being done at PNSY on behalf of the nation. While we understand the childcare capacity issues DoD is facing, it is simply unacceptable to displace families from DoD childcare centers without facilitating a seamless and equitable transition of care to an alternative center. Given the significant resources the Department has at its disposal and proactive stance to submit reprogramming requests to the Congress for mid-year ‘fact of life’ issues, we urge the Department to provide additional resources for childcare for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard employees as well as other affected childcare centers.As you know, in June of this year, the Department announced revised supplanting regulations that adversely impacted DoD civilian families utilizing PNSY’s childcare center. The subsequent decision by the Navy forced several dozen DoD civilian families to obtain alternative childcare facilities off-base. Affected families were only given a 45-day notice of their displacement and inadequate support to locate new accommodations for their childcare needs, leaving civilian families scrambling to care for their children. Although the Navy provided some assistance to help impacted families identify Maine and New Hampshire accredited childcare providers, many of these are already at capacity, not conveniently located or overly expensive for the affected families to afford. The Navy’s efforts to mitigate the impact on displaced families has fallen short of what we owe our invaluable civilian workforce.The impact of this decision and the subsequent displacement of civilian families not only harms civilian workforce readiness but also further impairs recruiting and retention, which have been longstanding challenges for our public shipyards. Reliable childcare is a strong incentive to work at PNSY, and everything should be done to increase capacity on installations and implement programs to secure commensurately affordable childcare in the community for families that are unable to use on-base childcare services. We understand that current Navy childcare capacity limitations stem largely from staffing challenges at the PNSY childcare facility and that there are efforts underway to hire additional qualified direct care staff. Finally, in light of anticipated growth in operations at PNSY and the nearby Pease Air National Guard Base, we anticipate a sustained increase in demand for childcare services in the area. Therefore, we urge you to ensure that you are putting in place long-term staffing, resourcing and facilities plans that will provide the childcare needed to meet increasing demand in the region. Further, we request that the Department do its utmost to streamline hiring processes for qualified direct care staff to swiftly address this issue. We also urge you to work with states to ensure that all available federal child care support funding is fully, effectively and efficiently utilized. In order to ensure that the Navy is moving to address the childcare concerns that we have identified, we request a briefing on the Navy’s response plans to address acute childcare challenges at PNSY and long-term plans to meet childcare needs in the region. Adequately and swiftly addressing shortfalls in quality of life such as childcare, housing and parking for the DoD civilian workforce is essential to our national security readiness and sustaining our military-industrial base. We are deeply proud of the important work being done for our nation at PNSY and believe that we must take every step necessary to ensure we are providing for the essential workers that we rely on. Thank you for your and service to our country."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-again-votes-to-secure-roe-protections-as-scotus-prepares-to-rule-on-abortion-case,"May 11, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. –Today, U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) voted to advance the Women’s Health Protection Act, legislation which would codify the longstanding precedent of Roe v. Wade into federal law and protect a woman’s right to make these vital healthcare decisions. The King-sponsored bill, which fell short of the threshold required to move forward, would have secured a healthcare provider’s right to provide abortion services if they choose and a patient’s right to receive those services; providers who choose not to provide this care based on religious beliefs will in no way be compelled to do so. This vote comes shortly after the release of a draft Supreme Court ruling indicating the high likelihood of the Court overturning Roe v. Wade.“For nearly 50 years, Roe v. Wade has protected the most basic, private healthcare rights of half the nation,” said Senator King. “This longstanding precedent has been reaffirmed time and time again, but the makeup of the current Court and the contents of the draft opinion published last week show that these rights are now facing their most serious threat in half a century. We cannot move backwards, which is why today I voted to secure the protections of Roe and defend the ability of millions of women to make decisions about their own health, safety, and lives.“The Women’s Health Protection Act is not a radical change – in fact, it would have primarily maintained the status quo of the last 49 years of healthcare policy. I’ve closely examined this legislation and believe it preserves American women’s existing right to access critical, lifesaving care with the support of trained medical professionals, regardless of the Court’s upcoming ruling. The bill would not undermine existing protections for healthcare providers who decline to perform abortions based on personal beliefs, while ensuring that women are still able to make decisions regarding their own body. Without these protections, this healthcare service would become more difficult to access for millions, and the lives of low-income Americans who cannot afford to travel to a state where abortion is legal will be put at risk.“Unfortunately, this effort fell short. I’m deeply frustrated that our commonsense bill to protect this essential right is not advancing, and truly worried that the upcoming Supreme Court ruling will likely fulfill the clear, decades-long goal of conservative leaders to impose their personal and religious views on women across America. But despite today’s setback, we will continue looking for ways to protect the rights and healthcare of women across our country – because we cannot, and will not, return to a world that prevents women from making their own decisions about their body.”The Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA) would safeguard the rights established by nearly fifty years of Supreme Court precedent following Roe v. Wade by protecting the right to an abortion prior to fetal viability. If Roe is overturned, WHPA would still protect access to abortion. WHPA would also address the growing number of state laws that undermine women’s healthcare rights by imposing medically unnecessary restrictions designed to block or impede access to this care. WHPA does not place any requirements on doctors, nurses, and healthcare professionals to provide abortion care, nor does it allow lawsuits against individuals who refuse to provide abortion care. WHPA says that doctors, nurses, and hospitals may provide abortion care if they so choose; not that they must do so. "
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/kings-acadia-affordable-housing-bill-gets-support-from-national-parks-service,"May 11, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine), Chairman of the Senate National Parks Subcommittee, today led a Subcommittee hearing with a top National Park Service (NPS) official to review critical legislation designed to support America’s National Parks and the communities that rely on them – including his bill to expand affordable housing on Bar Harbor. During the hearing, King received strong support for his proposals from Michael Caldwell – Associate Director of Park Planning, Facilities, and Lands at the NPS – and highlighted why his bipartisan legislation to expand housing near Acadia National Park is vital to Maine communities.“In 1986, the Acadia Boundary Act was passed. That was a piece of legislation that fixed Acadia National Park's boundaries as well as adding and subtracting various pieces of land. At that time, the piece of land in question in this bill was to be transferred to Bar Harbor for the purposes of a trash transfer station, but it turns out this wasn't the place for that station, and legislation was so specific it couldn't be transferred for any other purpose,” said Senator King. “This bill now replaces this use with an affordable workforce use and allows the Parks Service to hang on to 15 acres for its own housing needs…“Co-Chair Daines and I have talked a number of times about the importance of the people that work in our National Parks. And as you know, housing is an issue because often parks are situated in the middle of high-value real estate and so housing is a problem,’ continued Senator King. “The bill that you so graciously offered your support to conveys land from 40-acres from Acadia to the town of Bar Harbor. And that in itself, the fact that the land will have no cost, will be a major support for the development of housing on that site.”“Thank you, Senator King. Certainly, we know of your interests in housing at Acadia and also the barter system. [NPS] Director Sams has consistently communicated to the field, to all employees in the National Parks Service, that employees are his number one priority and housing is very much an important part of that. Without some of the housing we have in our units, those units just could not operate,” replied Mr. Caldwell. “So we're attacking this issue on a number of fronts across the National Parks System, including new FY23 Budget requests for both the construction on NPS land and leasing and local communities of additional housing, exploring the potential for public-private partnerships to solve some of the housing needs that not only the National Parks Services have but also our gateway communities.”+++Continuing his questioning, National Parks Subcommittee Chairman King received support from Mr. Caldwell for his bill with Senator Steve Daines (R-Mont.) to reduce crowding on public lands and support partnerships with gateway communities. Significant portions of this bill were included in the Outdoor Recreation Act that was passed by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last week.“I'd like to mention a bill introduced by Co-Chair Daines – the Gateway Community and Recreation Enhancement Act. I was honored to work with him on this bill, which will help provide support to our gateway communities that are so vital to the success of our national parks across the country,” said Senator King. “The bill will also help provide additional vital data to visitors that will help improve their experience, telling them when an attraction is especially busy, when might be a better time of the day to visit, or suggesting a nearby alternative attraction that isn't as busy at that time. Last week, the full Energy and Natural Resources Committee included a number of provisions from this Gateway Communities Bill in a larger, Outdoor Recreation Act. And I want to thank Chairman Manchin and Ranking Member Barrasso for that inclusion.”“I think informing the public is important. In the bill we talked about and passed last week, there are provisions for technology for alerting people to where parks are crowded, but the other is other regional assets that may not be national parks,” continued Senator King. “For example, in Moab you're near the Reef, certainly near Arches and other National Parks, but there's Deadhorse Point State Park, which is an astonishing place and it would be nice if there was an app that would talk about public resources within the region. I hope that's something that the department will look at.” “I think we certainly support the spirit of making sure we're communicating and connecting visitors to those places where they go,” replied Mr. Caldwell. “This nation is blessed with some incredible state parks and I think certainly our visitors appreciate when we make those connections.”+++During the hearing, Chairman King also highlighted the importance of legislation by Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) to preserve biodiversity and combat invasive species.“Another bill we will consider is sponsored by my colleague from Maine, Sen. Collins, and it would encourage the use of native plant species within the Parks Service,” said Senator King. “Using native plants will help preserve biodiversity and increase the benefits that local flora provides to our wildlife, human health, and the environment. It will also help prevent the future spread of invasive species.” A member of the Energy and Natural Resources and Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Senator King is among the Senate’s loudest voices advocating for public lands and encouraging outdoor recreation. In the April episode of his “Inside Maine” podcast and radio show, King highlighted the importance of National Parks and outdoor recreation with National Parks Subcommittee Ranking Member Senator Steve Daines (R-Mont.); Senator King was also recently awarded the inaugural National Park Foundation (NPF) “Hero” Award. Senator King helped lead the passage the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) into law; the legislation includes the Restore Our Parks Act – a bill led by King – and the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Permanent Funding Act. The historic legislative package continues Senator King’s career-long focus on conservation efforts, dating back to his work prior to running for elected office through his years as Governor and his service in the Senate. Over the course of his time in the Blaine House, Governor King was responsible for conserving more land across Maine than all Governors before him combined. "
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-portman-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-expand-public-private-partnerships-that-fund-national-parks-improvements-maintenance,"May 11, 2022WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senators Angus King (I-Maine), chair of the Senate National Parks Subcommittee, and Rob Portman (R-Ohio), today introduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation to grow the public-private partnerships that support our National Parks. The National Park Foundation Reauthorization Act of 2022 would reauthorize federal funding for the Congressionally-chartered National Park Foundation through fiscal year 2030 and increase the authorization level from $5 million to $15 million. The National Park Foundation uses its funding to match private donations that help finance crucial deferred maintenance, Service Corps, historic preservation, and other signature projects and programs of the National Park Service at national parks in Maine and around the country. Senator Steve Daines (R-Mont.) is a cosponsor, and companion legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representatives Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) and Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.).“America’s National Parks are among the world’s greatest treasures, providing memorable experiences to millions from around the globe. For more than 50 years, the Congressionally-chartered National Park Foundation (NPF) has played a vital role in protecting these lands for current and future Americans,” said National Parks Subcommittee Chairman King. “From expanding camping access at Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument to restoring wetlands in Smoky Mountains National Park, the NPF has successfully worked to preserve and expand access to America’s parks. Our bipartisan funding expansion and reauthorization for the NPF will strengthen this essential federal conservation partner, enabling them to continue supporting our national parks and the communities across the country that rely on them.”“The National Park Foundation is an incredibly important partner to our national parks, bringing together federal and private funding to help preserve these natural and cultural treasures for our future generations to enjoy,” said Senator Portman. “Increasing funding for the National Park Foundation, as this legislation would do, will help us strengthen relationships with private partners and support efforts to restore our national parks.”“We proudly support the National Park Foundation Reauthorization Act of 2022 and commend Sens. Portman and King, and Reps. Westerman and Grijalva for introducing this vital legislation,” said National Park Foundation President and CEO Will Shafroth. “Since receiving federal funds for the first time in 2018, the National Park Foundation has leveraged the federal funding through the power of private philanthropy to match and more than double this critically important federal investment, adding to the tens of millions of private, philanthropic dollars the National Park Foundation and a growing community of park partners invest in America’s national parks each year.” The National Park Foundation was created in 1967 as the official nonprofit partner of the National Park Service (NPS). Its mission is to generate private support and build strategic partnerships to protect and enhance America’s national parks for present and future generations. The National Park Foundation has, to date, received a total of $23 million in federal appropriations. Each year, the Foundation works to, at a minimum, double the impact of the federal dollars — meaning an annual appropriation of $15 million would have an impact of at least $30 million in national parks around the country.A member of the Energy and Natural Resources and Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Senator King is among the Senate’s loudest voices advocating for public lands and encouraging outdoor recreation.

In a hearing of the Armed Services Committee, Senator King began by recognizing the tremendous efforts of the intelligence community leading up to Russia's unprovoked invasion before highlighting America’s recent failure to accurately assess the strength of competing forces and asking Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines to reconsider how they evaluate the will to fight of both our allies and adversaries. Director Haines committed to taking a look at the issue.“We all believe the Intelligence Community did a really excellent job of predicting the invasion, alerting the world as to what was going on, what the disposition of Russian troops were, the involvement of Belarus – all of that. What we missed, was the will to fight of the Ukrainians and the leadership of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and we also missed that in Afghanistan,” said Senator King. “I realize will to fight is a lot harder to assess than the number of tanks or volume of ammunition or something, but I hope the Intelligence Community is doing some soul searching about how to better get a handle on that question. We had testimony on this committee and the Intelligence Committee that Kyiv was going to fall within three days or four days and the war would last two weeks – and that turned out to be grossly wrong. Are you looking at this question of how to evaluate will to fight and domestic leadership?”“Yes Senator, you heard from General Berrier obviously a number of things the DIA is doing. For the Intelligence Community at large we have a process at the National Intelligence Council taking a look at these issues,” replied Director Haines. “It is, I would say, a combination of will to fight and capacity in effect. The two of them are issues that are, as you indicated, quite challenging to provide effective analysis on, and we’re looking at different methodologies for doing so.”+++Continuing his questioning, King pressed Lieutenant General Scott Berrier – Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) – how the DIA’s predictions for the war in Ukraine and Afghanistan missed the mark by such significant margins, why they failed to consider the will to fight of both forces, and if they will update their assessments for future conflicts. Calling the DIA’s view of Ukraine’s response capabilities “grossly wrong,” King also noted how better predictions could have allowed the U.S. to better support Ukraine ahead of the war.“General Berrier this is your lane, assessing military capability. A big part, as you testified earlier, the Ukraine War is going the way it is, is that the Ukrainians are fighting for their land and the Russians don’t have the same will to fight. I hope this is something you’re focused on because again, I think that we failed on this question in Afghanistan,” said Senator King. “In Afghanistan we had testimony over and over that the government would last six months or a year beyond the departure of U.S. troops; it lasted minus two weeks. Is this something that you’re focused upon?”“Senator I am focused on it, and I really appreciate this dialogue because I think there’s an important nuance that we have to discuss. One is the will to fight and the other is the capacity to fight. So in closed briefings, we talked about this capacity to fight, and given the correlation of forces that the Russians had and what the Ukrainians had, it was the thought of senior analysts that it wasn’t going to go very well for a variety of factors,” said Lieutenant General Berrier. “But there was never an Intelligence Community assessment that said that the Ukrainians lacked the will to fight. Those assessments talked about their capacity to fight.”“But there wasn’t an assessment that they did, either. The assessment was Ukraine would be overrun in a matter of weeks. That was grossly wrong,” replied Senator King.“Well we assessed their capacity to face the size of the Russian forces that were massed on their border was going to be very difficult for them,” continued Lieutenant General Berrier. “All I’m saying is the Intelligence Community needs to be able to do a better job on this issue,” Senator King concluded. “…I’m just trying to make the point that there was a significant issue that we missed that had a major influence on how this has unfolded. And had we had a better handle on the prediction, we could have done more to assist the Ukrainians earlier.”"
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/collins-king-applaud-presidents-signing-of-ukraine-lend-lease-bill-they-co-sponsored-into-law,"May 09, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Angus King (I-Maine), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, celebrated President Joe Biden signing their Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act into law. The bipartisan legislation, which passed the Senate unanimously and the House of Representatives 417-10, authorizes the President to enter into lend-lease agreements with Ukraine to provide military equipment to protect civilians, and mirrors the ""Lend-Lease Act"" from World War II, which gave Europe weapons to fight Hitler.“The people of Ukraine are inspiring the world by their courage in the face of increasing cruelty and mounting evidence of atrocities and war crimes committed by Putin’s military,” said Senator Collins.  “Over and over again, they have proven their determination to fight for their country and protect their people from Russia’s unjustified invasion.  As the ‘arsenal of democracy,’ the United States should do everything in our power to give the Ukrainians the tools they need to defend their freedom.  This bipartisan legislation builds on Congress’ unified commitment to support Ukraine by reducing bureaucratic barriers and accelerating the transfer of weapons, military equipment, and other supplies. This additional lethal aid will place further pressure on Russia to bring an end to this terrible war.”“Nearly a century ago, President Franklin Roosevelt established the United States as the ‘Arsenal of Democracy’ by signing the World War II Lend-Lease Act into law to give Europe the tools they needed to defeat Hitler,” said Senator King. “Today, as another brutal dictator with ambitions of an empire wages war against a sovereign neighbor, the United States has stepped up to support democracy and its brave fighters in Europe. The bipartisan Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act gives the President the authority he needs to strengthen our already effective military aid to Ukraine. It sends a loud message to the rest of the world that the U.S. believes Ukraine can win this war, and that the free world stands united against Putin’s heinous actions. I’m glad the President has cemented our role as a defender of democracy, and will continue working to support the Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom.”As part of the Arms Export Control Act authority, the President can lend and lease defense articles to U.S. partners and allies when it is in the United States’ national security interest. However, current bureaucratic barriers and other limitations made these authorities impractical for the current crisis facing Ukraine. This enhanced lend-lease authority streamlines the President’s ability to lend the defense articles necessary to defend civilian populations in Ukraine and will require the President to establish expedited delivery procedures for any military equipment loaned or leased to Ukraine to ensure timely delivery to Ukraine. Senators Collins and King, both members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, have forcefully condemned Russia’s attacks on Ukrainian sovereignty. They recently joined a bipartisan Congressional delegation to Poland and Germany where they met with NATO leaders, Ukrainian refugees, and U.S. servicemembers for a first-hand look at the humanitarian crisis and America’s efforts to support Ukrainians. Before Russia began its attacks, they cosponsored a resolution supporting the American partner in the face of Russian aggression and called for maximum intelligence sharing with Ukrainian officials. They also recently participated in a virtual conversation on the escalating threat posed by Russia in Eastern Europe with Ambassadors from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. "
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-cosponsors-bill-to-ease-supply-chain-pressures-on-auto-industry,"May 09, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) is cosponsoring bipartisan legislation to ease the effects of supply chain challenges on Maine car dealerships facing higher costs and limited inventory. The Supply Chain Disruptions Relief Act would make a common-sense tax adjustment for dealerships that cannot maintain a minimum level of inventory, so that these small businesses don’t suffer costly penalties for supply chain shortages out of their control.“The auto industry has been among the hardest hit by global supply chain issues, which have created extreme challenges for Maine’s car dealerships,” said Senator King. “As we work to address the pressing shortages facing both consumers and the industry, this bipartisan legislation will provide much needed temporary relief to the small auto businesses across our state that are working to keep their doors open and support their employees. Rising costs for car dealerships have contributed to high inflation, which is squeezing household budgets across Maine and the nation. Let’s pass this bill quickly, so we can ensure our local businesses aren’t subjected to unnecessary tax burdens that get passed on to consumers.“From necessary production parts being unavailable to transportation systems that are jammed up, supply chain issues are making it difficult for Maine’s franchise auto Dealers to get and maintain inventory,” said John Emerson, Head of the Maine Auto Dealers Association. “Over half of the Dealers in Maine, including many smaller family run stores, are on Last In First Out (LIFO) methods, meaning when inventory drops drastically it creates a taxable phantom profit. Dealers are asking for three years of relief to let inventories rebuild – this is not a forever forgiveness, but this would give Dealers some time to recover.”Auto dealerships often use the Last-In First-Out (LIFO) inventory method, which can result in a large tax bill for dealerships that don’t maintain a minimum level of inventory at the close of the year; unfortunately, the COVID pandemic has created a shortfall in available vehicles. The Supply Chain Disruptions Relief Act would provide a statutory determination that the requirements for a qualified liquidation under Section 473 have been satisfied for new motor vehicle dealers that have had a reduction of new vehicles held in LIFO inventory.  Senator King has worked to address the causes and impacts of the global supply chain issues challenging Maine communities. He recently introduced a bipartisan bill to improve America’s access to the critical minerals required for technology production, and helped pass the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act which would invest in American technological production and innovation."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-joins-bipartisan-resolution-to-honor-americas-teachers,"May 06, 2022Washington, D.C. – To honor our nation's teachers and commemorate National Teacher Appreciation Week, U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) led a bipartisan resolution – co-sponsored by Senator Angus King (I-ME) – to recognize the important work of teachers across the nation, thank them for their efforts to prepare students for success, and acknowledge the additional challenges teachers faced during the COVID-19 pandemic.“As a Senator, I have visited more than 200 schools throughout Maine,” said Senator Collins. “In communities large or small, urban or rural, the school is the town’s pride and joy. It is the dedicated and caring educators who make it so. This resolution honors the indefatigable efforts of our teachers and expresses our gratitude for all that they do to prepare our children for success.”“Teachers have always answered the call to serve, going above and beyond to ensure our students have a foundation of skills and tools that will last a lifetime,” said Senator Brown. “Throughout the past two years, teachers and educators have found unique ways to support and stay connected with their students. We must continue to honor the work of our education staff through policy that supports teachers in their efforts to develop the next generation of leaders.”“As the son of two public school teachers, I’m eternally grateful for the contributions of America’s educators,” said Senator King. “From the moment they walk into a classroom, Maine’s teachers lay the foundation for our children’s success and provide an invaluable, often underappreciated service to our communities. During this Teacher Appreciation Week, I hope we can all take time to celebrate the educators throughout Maine and across the nation who devote their lives to teaching the next generation.”In addition to Senators Collins, Brown, and King, the resolution is co-sponsored by Senators Alex Padilla (D-CA), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Jack Reed (D-RI), Tina Smith (D-MN), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), Tom Carper (D-DE), Gary Peters (D-MI), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and Bob Casey (D-PA)."

The funding will be utilized to provide additional contract tracing, testing, and proactive screening services for the employees of Maine Medical Center.“Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the employees of MaineHealth and Maine Medical Center have provided lifesaving care to Maine people to support the health and safety of our communities,” said Senators Collins and King. “These health care providers have undertaken immense personal risks, and many have put their own health on the line to save others. This funding will allow Maine Medical Center to provide additional testing, contract tracing, and proactive health screenings for its employees so these heroes can protect themselves as they continue to lead the fight against COVID-19.”“Maine Medical Center is grateful for this federal support of programs designed to prevent the additional spread of COVID to our care team and patients,” said Maine Medical Center (MMC) President Jeff Sanders. “MMC continues to use a layered strategy to reduce transmission of COVID within our facilities, and federal funds make a difference in our ability to cover these mitigation strategies.”During the COVID-19 pandemic, Maine Medical Center and MaineHealth provided guidance and protocols to tens of thousands of employees. Emergency protective measures, including health screening questionnaires, call centers for COVID-19 health and safety measures, and testing services for 22,267 employees allowed Maine Medical Center to protect its workers while providing life-saving care to Maine residents. This funding was awarded to the state of Maine by the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Agency. The grant is part of FEMA’s Public Assistance Program, which provides funding to state, tribal, territorial, local governments, and some private non-profits so that communities can quickly and efficiently respond to and recover from major disasters or emergencies. MaineHealth and Maine Medical Center received this funding as a private non-profit medical care facility responding to the COVID-19 emergency. "
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/collins-king-join-bipartisan-group-urging-reconsideration-of-russias-market-economy-status,"May 06, 2022Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Angus King (I-ME) joined a bipartisan group of their colleagues in sending a letter to Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo to urge her to reconsider Russia’s status as a market economy within the meaning of the anti-dumping (AD) law of the Tariff Act of 1930.Although the Commerce Department classified Russia as a market economy in 2002, Russia has increasingly backtracked on its commitment to a free market economy. Now, after its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has taken further steps to centralize control over the Russian economy. Classifying Russia as a non-market economy would give the United States more flexibility to impose additional anti-dumping duties, and it would increase pressure on Russia for its violation of international norms in invading Ukraine. “Russia imposes restrictions on eight of the eleven types of capital transactions tracked by the International Monetary Fund, and since Russia’s invasion, the conversion of the ruble has become only more difficult. Recently, the Central Bank of Russia announced it will prevent banks from selling foreign currency to Russians and limit how much foreign currency individuals can withdraw from their accounts. These edicts are explicitly designed to restrict access to foreign currency,” wrote the Senators. The Senators continued, “Russia’s economy is also marked by government ownership and control over production. According to Russian government sources, the state’s share in the Russian economy may be as high as 70 percent. This growth of economic intervention by the Russian government tracks the rapid expansion of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in Russia. According to the International Monetary Fund, Russia has the third most SOEs per capita in the world.” In addition to Senators Collins and King, the letter was co-signed by Senators James Lankford (R-OK), Rob Portman (R-OH), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Mike Braun (R-IN),  Todd Young (R-IN), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Jack Reed (D-RI), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Steve Daines (R-MT), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Roger Wicker (R-MS).

https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/collins-king-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-detail-document-russian-war-crimes-in-ukraine,"May 06, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Angus King (I-Maine), members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, have joined a bipartisan group of their Senate colleagues to introduce the Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability Act, which would ensure the U.S. is undertaking coordinated efforts to collect and maintain evidence of war crimes committed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The bill was passed last month by the House of Representatives by an overwhelmingly bipartisan 418-7 vote.“The world has watched in horror as Putin has used brute military force in an attempt to subjugate the peaceful country of Ukraine, killing countless innocent civilians in his path,” said Senator Collins. “From Bucha to Mariupol, the abject cruelty and viciousness of the Russian occupation have been on full display.  Our bill would help ensure that these atrocities are identified and preserved, exposing war crimes committed by Putin, Russian generals, and soldiers.  As we continue to support the Ukrainians in their fight to defend their people and their democracy, this effort will place additional pressure on Russia to bring an end to this terrible war.”“Russia’s barbaric invasion has devastated Ukraine, demolished cities, and killed an untold number of Ukrainians who want nothing more than to live peacefully in their home country. This unprovoked assault is horrific, and it is absolutely essential that those responsible pay the consequences,” said Senator King. “Our bipartisan bill is an important step to hold Vladimir Putin and his accomplices accountable for their atrocities – and puts Russian leaders on notice that the world is watching their every step.”The Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability Act would issue a statement of policy and require a report to Congress within 90 days of its passage to ensure the U.S. is undertaking coordinated efforts to collect, analyze, and maintain evidence of war crimes and atrocities committed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine and to deter the commission of such crimes by making Russian commanders, troops, and leaders aware of efforts to collect evidence and identify those committing these atrocities. The bill is co-sponsored by U.S. Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Rick Scott (R-FL), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Gary Peters (D-MI), John Boozman (R-AR), Tim Kaine (D-VA), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) Senators Collins and King, both members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, have forcefully condemned Russia’s attacks on Ukrainian sovereignty.

https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-breaks-down-global-causes-of-high-energy-costs-for-american-consumers,"May 05, 2022Watch Senator King’s remarks HERE, and download broadcast quality video HERE WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) today detailed the global factors that are contributing to rising costs for oil and gas for households and consumers nationwide. In a hearing of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator King explained how oil prices are driven by worldwide shifts in supply and demand, that in turn dictate the cost of gasoline – which is why there is no single solution or policy that can provide price relief at the pump.“This has been a fascinating discussion, instead of mixing apples and oranges we’ve been mixing gas and oil. Let’s talk about them separately… oil is a global commodity. The price of oil is affected marginally by what’s going on in the U.S., but it’s affected by everything from Iran’s sanctions to Russia’s removal from the market to how oil is produced in Venezuela or Nigeria,” said Senator King. “It’s a worldwide commodity, it’s not something that we can set. The oil companies wake up in the morning and they look in the Wall Street Journal, if it says it’s $101 a barrel Brent Crude, that’s the price.”“The high price of gasoline is a reflection of the high price of oil, and the high price of oil is a reflection of the global market. I was in Germany with Senator Marshall – I did the calculation, we drove by gas stations – they’re paying $8.50 a gallon, not $5.00, not $4.50. At that time it was almost exactly double the price in the United States,” Senator King continued. “So to blame President Biden or anybody else for the worldwide price of oil to the Keystone Pipeline is just nonsense. I think we really need to be clear about that – the high price of oil is a global price that’s high everywhere in the world, the inflation of gasoline is high everyplace in the world, and in fact in many places in the world it’s worse than here.”+++Later in the hearing, Senator King was able to get a degree of certainty from the Energy Secretary when it came to the liquid natural gas market price structure, where the United States has more influence as the world’s largest LNG exporter.  After explaining the importance of domestic natural gas, King asked Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm to evaluate all the data before making any long term natural gas export commitments that would drive up energy prices.“Natural gas is not a global commodity, it’s a local commodity, the price has been very different here – it’s was about $3.50 here for a million BTUs and it was about $13 or $14 in China. That’s an advantage for the United States. We have now vastly increased the capacity for exports – supply and demand – we have dramatically increased the worldwide demand for our natural gas, we’re now the largest LNG exporters,” said Senator King. “I hope before you make more approvals of these long term commitments that you will have that data in hand.”“For sure,” committed Secretary Granholm.As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources, Senator King has long been a fierce advocate for American energy independence and low costs for American consumers as we transition into our clean energy future. As energy prices rise in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, King called on the White House to reevaluate exports in order to reduce domestic energy and heating costs, and has stressed the importance of energy efficiency for cheaper, cleaner power. He also recently urged U.S. energy companies to invest in production capacity and increase oil output instead of returning profits to shareholders."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-urges-top-army-official-to-address-veteran-suicide-epidemic-by-studying-improving-transition-to-civilian-life,"May 05, 2022Watch Senator King’s questioning HERE, and download broadcast quality HEREWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) today asked a top Pentagon official to address the mental health and suicide epidemic facing America’s veterans by providing more resources for retiring servicemembers. In a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator King highlighted the unacceptable number of military suicides that occur during the transition from active duty to veteran status and asked Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth to take large-scale action to address the crisis. King also continued his calls for the Department of Defense to commit as many resources to the transition out of the Armed Services as they do to recruiting.“I work with a lot of veterans in Maine, and one of the problems that keeps coming up is the weakness of the transition from active duty to veteran status – the handoff from the Defense Department to the VA,” said Senator King. “Many of the veteran suicides take place in that relatively short period of time between active duty and civilian status. I believe that you should put as much resources, and time and effort and people into transition out as you do to recruiting in. Can you address that problem?”“Certainly Senator, and I think there is data that shows that transition out of the service back into the civilian community can be a critical time. We do try to work very closely with the Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure that there is a warm handoff, and with the transition programs we have for folks getting out of the Army, we try to make sure that they have the resources to know what to expect, to try and link them to employment resources, and things like that,” replied Secretary Wormuth. “I think that it something that we can continue to work on, and frankly I’ve heard some folks say ‘the transition programs helped me learn how to tie a tie and to do a resume,’ but psychologically making the adjustment to going back into the civilian world isn’t something that I’ve heard people say that they get as much emphasis on. So I think that’s an area we could work on.”“I hope you will, and I hope you’ll not only commit to working on it, but work on it in a systematic way. Perhaps appoint a task force or some group whose responsibility it is to talk about and think about and work on this problem,” Senator King concluded. “As you know, we have an epidemic of veteran suicides, and suicide in the military, this is one place where I think we can make a difference. So thank you very much and I hope you will follow up in an urgent way on this problem.” Representing one of the states with the highest rates of veterans per capita, Senator King has worked to address the epidemic of military and veteran suicides. In February, he pushed a top Pentagon nominee to prioritize military suicide prevention by using data and technology to improve coordination between the Department of Defense and the VA. The conversation came shortly after Senator King sat down with a 20-year Air Force Veteran to discuss the issue of insufficient data on military suicides as part of his monthly interview series Answering the Call: Maine’s Veteran Voices. Senator King has also recently introduced the Save Our Servicemembers (S.O.S.) Act, which would work to improve Department of Defense’s servicemember suicide prevention efforts, and cosponsored legislation to designate 9-8-8 as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Veterans Crisis line which the Senate unanimously passed last year. In addition, Senator King has consistently worked to improve the services for Maine veterans across the state, including at the Togus campus in Augusta. "

The national program, authorized and funded through the American Rescue Plan, can be used by homeowners in default because of COVID-19 to pay home-related expenses including their mortgage, utilities, and property taxes.“The pandemic has been hard for a lot of Maine people, stretching wallets thinner and forcing hardworking folks to reach deeper in their pockets to make ends meet. Thankfully, the American Rescue Plan is delivering relief for those who need it,” said Governor Janet Mills. “With the Homeowner Assistance Fund, Maine people may be eligible for support with their mortgage, utilities, property taxes, and other expenses that can help get them through this tough time.”“The American Rescue Plan was designed to help families and communities recover from the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and this program displays how the legislation is continuing to deliver on those goals,” said Senator King. “People across our state have been impacted by the pandemic’s economic fallout and today’s action will help families access the support they need to stabilize their household budgets. I’m deeply grateful to Governor Mills for her ongoing leadership in the face of this crisis, and will continue to work hand-in-hand with her administration to help Maine people weather these challenges.”“Thousands of Mainers are still struggling to make ends meet due to pandemic hardships and urgently need relief to stay in their homes,” said Congresswoman Chellie Pingree. “Thanks to the historic American Rescue Plan, eligible homeowners in Maine won’t have to choose between buying groceries or gas and paying their electric bills or mortgage. I’m proud to have supported this legislation from the beginning, and I’m thrilled to see its investments are delivering lasting relief to Mainers.”“If you fell behind on paying your mortgage, your utilities, your property taxes, or other home-related expenses during the pandemic, financial relief may be available through the federal government and we are ready to help you apply for it,” said Will Lund, Superintendent of the Bureau. “I encourage all eligible Maine homeowners who have past due bills to apply for this assistance.”The American Rescue Plan provided all states and territories funds to help homeowners at risk of default, foreclosure, and displacement as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Maine Homeowner Assistance Fund can help homeowners: Homeowners can apply for up to $25,000 in mortgage benefits, including up to $15,000 in property tax assistance and $10,000 in utility payment relief. Maximum benefits under all aspects of the program cannot exceed $25,000 per household. Payments will be made on behalf of homeowners directly to creditors including mortgage servicers, municipalities, or utility companies. To be eligible for assistance, homeowners must be below certain income limits, own and occupy a 1 to 4-unit dwelling in Maine, and have experienced a COVID-19 related financial hardship after January 21, 2020. Those hardships can include, for example, a temporary job loss. Answers to common questions about the Homeowner Assistance Fund can be found here.To determine if they are eligible for assistance, homeowners can begin the application process at www.Maine.gov/HomeAssist. Those with questions can contact the Bureau of Consumer Credit Protection’s hotline at 1-888-664-2569 or Maine Housing Counselors who are partnering with the Bureau. Legal assistance provided by Pine Tree Legal Assistance and Legal Services for the Elderly is also available to homeowners who are facing imminent loss of their home.The Homeowner Assistance Fund builds on Governor Mills’ efforts to ensure all Maine people have a safe place to call home, including investing millions in state and federal funds to build more affordable housing; modernizing outdated zoning restrictions; banning pandemic-related evictions and providing significant rental relief; providing property tax relief and restoring revenue sharing to Maine’s municipalities, which helps reduce property taxes, and more."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-introduces-bill-to-help-create-affordable-workforce-housing-on-mount-desert-island,"May 05, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – With housing shortages on Mount Desert Island threatening economic growth in the region, U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine), Chairman of the Senate National Parks Subcommittee, is introducing bipartisan legislation to help create more affordable year-round and seasonal housing on Mount Desert Island. The legislation, which is co-sponsored by Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine), would transfer part of an undeveloped parcel of land in the Village of Town Hill from Acadia National Park to the Town of Bar Harbor for the specific development of affordable housing, while the remainder of the parcel would be used by the National Parks Service (NPS) to construct NPS staff housing to keep pace with the park’s popularity and increased visitation. The proposal is supported by the National Park Service, the Town of Bar Harbor, and the Island Housing Trust.“From National Park Service rangers to hotel staff in Bar Harbor, workers on Mount Desert Island play a vital role in our state’s economy and deserve access to high-quality, affordable housing,” said National Parks Subcommittee Chairman King. “As Acadia’s visitation rises and the need for staff to support tourism increases, it’s imperative the availability of affordable housing keeps pace. This bill will help meet growing housing needs and support continued economic success on MDI for years to come.”“The dedicated staff who work at Acadia National Park and in the hospitality industry in the surrounding towns make it possible for millions of visitors to enjoy the stunning natural beauty of Mount Desert Island each year. Unfortunately, a lack of affordable housing has contributed to workforce shortages and created significant hardships for employees who need to live nearby,” said Senator Collins. “This bipartisan bill would expand the supply of much-needed workforce housing on MDI, helping to ensure that employees have an affordable place to live and strengthening the economy in the region.”“Mount Desert Island, like much of Maine, is experiencing an extreme housing shortage. Families and future residents most greatly impacted by this shortage include the workforce that supports and creates our community. Identifying and modifying the use of this Federal Land located in Town Hill exemplifies a truly great partnership between the Park and the surrounding communities,” said Bar Harbor Town Manager Kevin Sutherland. “The Town of Bar Harbor is grateful to Senator King for his efforts to introduce this bill to assist the housing shorting on Mount Desert Island.”“The Island Housing Trust receives phone calls and emails weekly from people looking for affordable housing – some have taken jobs here but just can’t find a place to live. When workers can’t find housing, businesses struggle to find workers, leading to businesses reducing hours or even shutting their doors permanently as we experience high visitation and high demand for services. This is a real crisis,” said Marla O’Byrne, Executive Director of Island Housing Trust. “This is why making workforce housing possible on the park's parcel in Town Hill is so important for the communities on Mount Desert Island. We need workers who provide the vital services that make a community strong and resilient, and they need homes.”Acadia National Park currently retains an undeveloped parcel (55.3 acres) in the village of Town Hill, in Bar Harbor. The 1986 park boundary act directed the National Park Service (NPS) to convey this Town Hill parcel, without monetary consideration, to the town of Bar Harbor for use by any town as a solid waste transfer station. However, this transfer never occurred, and the need for a centralized transfer station has diminished in recent years. As a result, this legislation would amend the existing requirement to address more pressing current needs, and is being introduced with full support from both the National Park Service and local officials. The Park Service could retain up to 15 acres to address its own housing needs.If passed, this legislation would direct the NPS to work with the towns and other stakeholders on MDI to develop a plan to use the Town Hill parcel for affordable year-round and seasonal employee housing.  A member of the Energy and Natural Resources and Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Senator King is among the Senate’s loudest voices advocating for public lands and encouraging outdoor recreation. He was recently awarded the inaugural National Park Foundation (NPF) “Hero” Award. Senator King helped lead the passage the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) into law; the legislation includes the Restore Our Parks Act – a bill led by Senator King – and the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Permanent Funding Act. The historic legislative package continues Senator King’s career-long focus on conservation efforts, dating back to his work prior to running for elected office through his years as Governor and his service in the Senate.

https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-introduces-bipartisan-resolution-designating-tomorrow-as-childrens-mental-health-awareness-day,"May 04, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) has introduced a bipartisan resolution designating tomorrow, May 5th as National Children’s Mental Health Awareness Day with his colleague Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas). The resolution seeks to raise awareness of mental health crisis facing America’s children and the importance of connecting children with appropriate mental and behavioral health support. It builds on Senator King’s efforts to draw attention to the mental health epidemic within the COVID-19 pandemic.“The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged Maine people in countless ways – both seen and unseen. As we’ve worked to stay healthy, we’ve all experienced increased stresses, social isolation, and the loss of loved ones – and few have been more affected than our nation’s children,” said Senator King. “Maine’s children have seen significant disruptions to their education and social routines and are now experiencing a dramatic increase in mental health challenges. We must do more to provide our young people with the support they need in these turbulent times, so I hope that this Children’s Mental Health Awareness Day will raise awareness of this youth mental health crisis, and encourage more Maine children and their families to access the mental health support they need.”The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that nearly half of adolescents (49.5 percent of the population aged 13 to 18) will experience a mental disorder. This has only been aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic, with recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that emergency department visits for suspected suicide attempts for kids aged 12 to 17 increased by 31 percent from 2019 to 2021, with a 50.6 percent increase for girls in the age range. Any Maine person struggling with mental health can call 211 for resources and help. Senator King has worked to address the startling rise in mental health issues from the COVID-19 pandemic. He has pushed for additional resources to address the epidemic, including proposals he highlighted in a recent op-ed for the Bangor Daily News. King recently introduced several pieces of legislation to address the crisis, including legislation to require private health insurance to cover three behavioral health care visits each year, support social-emotional learning for children, increase access to mental health resources in schools, and address childhood trauma."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/kings-parks-public-lands-bills-advance-out-of-energy-and-natural-resources-committee,"May 04, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine), Chair of the Senate National Parks Subcommittee, today celebrated action by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to advance legislation that will address increased National Park visitation, modernize access to public lands, and recognize the importance of Downeast Maine. As part of Senator King’s efforts to help more people access public lands by utilizing new technologies, the Committee overwhelmingly supported the bipartisan Outdoor Recreation Act of 2022 (ORA), which included language from Senators King and Daines’ “Waze for Parks” bill to show real-time park visitation levels and drive traffic to lesser-visited recreation areas nearby. The ORA also included language requiring federal land managers to provide digital “America the Beautiful” park passes, as requested by Senators King and Daines. The legislation now goes to the full Senate for consideration, and comes shortly after the President Joe Biden signed into law Senator King’s legislation to modernize public land mapping.“Across our country, public lands provide Americans the opportunity to connect with incredible natural beauty and make memories that last a lifetime,” said Senator King. “As parks from Maine to Alaska experience record levels of visitation, Congress has a responsibility to use all the modern resources at our disposal to help more people experience these treasures while preserving these lands for generations to come. Creating a ‘Waze for Parks’ and digitizing federal land passes will be a huge step in our effort to make enjoying America’s natural beauty easier and more convenient. I’m glad that the Energy and Natural Resources Committee overwhelmingly saw the importance of our bipartisan legislation, and hopeful that Congress can swiftly pass these bills to support our national parks and the communities that rely on them.”The Outdoor Recreation Act of 2022 (ORA) included language from the Gateway Community and Recreation Enhancement Act that would task the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of the Interior (DOI) with creating a pilot program where the agencies would provide real-time data on visitation to 20 Federal land management units and encourage visitation to lesser known adjacent recreation sites. The ORA also included language to digitize “America the Beautiful” passes after previous requests from Senator King and Daines. These passes cover entrance fees at national parks and national wildlife refuges as well as standard amenity fees at national forests and grasslands, and at lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In total a pass gives access to over 2,000 federal sites. Currently, the passes are only available in a physical plastic form at recreation sites and to be mailed to purchasers.+++The Energy and Natural Resources Committee also gave broad bipartisan support to Senator King and Representative Jared Golden’s (D-Maine) legislation to designate Downeast Maine as a National Heritage Area. The legislation, which is cosponsored by Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Representative Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), would designate all of Hancock and Washington counties as an area with national importance, making the region eligible for additional federal investment and helping to drive economic activity to the rural Maine region. The Downeast Maine National Heritage Area designation passed out of committee as part of a larger, National Heritage Area package that will help streamline designation and authorization of these important areas.“For much of the year, Downeast Maine starts America’s day by greet the first rays on its rocky coasts, rolling mountains and lush forests,” said Senator King. “The region is a fundamental part of our state, and is at the heart of the American identity. Designating Hancock and Washington counties as a National Heritage Area will open the door for critical federal funding, spur increased tourism, and drive important economic activity to our Downeast communities. I’m grateful that my colleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee understood the importance of this effort and hope that Congress can pass this bipartisan designation without delay.”National Heritage Areas are designations from Congress where historic, cultural, and natural resources combine to form cohesive, nationally important landscapes.  Unlike national parks, National Heritage Areas are large lived-in landscapes where communities collaborate with the National Park Service to determine how to make heritage relevant to local interests and economies. These areas qualify for additional federal funding, and work through public-private partnerships to support historic preservation, natural resource conservation, recreation, heritage tourism, new and traditional industries, and educational projects. Leveraging funds and long-term support for projects, these partnerships foster pride of place and an enduring stewardship. There are currently 55 National Heritage Areas across the country.A member of the Energy and Natural Resources and Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Senator King is among the Senate’s loudest voices advocating for public lands and encouraging outdoor recreation. In the April episode of his “Inside Maine” podcast and radio show, King highlighted the importance of National Parks and outdoor recreation with National Parks Subcommittee Ranking Member Senator Steve Daines (R-Mont.); Senator King was also recently awarded the inaugural National Park Foundation (NPF) “Hero” Award. Senator King helped lead the passage the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) into law in 2020; the legislation includes the Restore Our Parks Act – a bill led by Senator King – and the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Permanent Funding Act.

https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-risch-bill-to-modernize-park-public-land-mapping-signed-into-law,"May 04, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Angus King (I-Maine), Chair of the Senate National Parks Subcommittee, and Jim Risch (R-Idaho) celebrated President Joe Biden signing into law their bipartisan Modernizing Access to our Public Land (MAPLand) Act to digitize public land mapping records. The legislation, which passed the Senate unanimously and was cosponsored by Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine), will enhance the nation’s outdoor recreational opportunities by digitizing and standardizing mapping information like access points and permissible uses on federal public lands, improving access to hunting and fishing and supporting Maine sportsmen and women.This new law builds on Senator King’s efforts to help more people access public lands by utilizing new technologies, including his recent push for the National Park Service to provide digital passes and his legislation pushing to create a “Waze for Parks” that can drive traffic to lesser-visited recreation areas.“America’s public lands are among our nation’s greatest treasures and have given people from around the world unparalleled access the natural beauty that surrounds us. As the call of the wild grows even stronger for many, we must continue to modernize access to the great outdoors,” said Senator King. “This bipartisan law will make it easier for Americans of all ages to experience our natural treasures, and for hunters, fishermen, and adventurers to recreate safely using the latest mapping technologies. I’m grateful that President Biden has signed this important bipartisan legislation into law, and look forward to seeing how these changes provide new benefits for our nation’s outdoor enthusiasts.”“Digitizing publicly available records will end the days of reaching a trailhead only to find it is already closed for the season or being unsure where an access point is located. It will also help reduce trespassing on private land by showing new public land users where they can and cannot go,” said Senator Risch. “Now that the MAPLand Act is law, I look forward to seeing my fellow Idahoans take full advantage of these modernized records and explore all that Idaho’s vast public lands have to offer.”“With vast acres of forests; miles of scenic trails; and numerous pristine lakes, ponds, and rivers, Maine is a true paradise for outdoor enthusiasts,” said Senator Collins.  “Improving the availability and accuracy of maps will help hunters, fishermen, hikers, and other recreationalists find new areas to explore and enjoy. In addition, by enhancing access to federal lands like Acadia National Park and Katahdin Woods and Waters, our bipartisan law will attract visitors to the surrounding communities, boosting local economies and helping to create jobs.”“I am thrilled the President has signed this important legislation into law to improve public knowledge of outdoor recreation opportunities and promote increased access to our country’s breathtaking public lands and natural resources. As Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and a lifelong outdoorsman, I will continue working to advance common sense, bipartisan legislation that ensures we can safely and responsibly explore and enjoy the wild and wonderful outdoor playground we’ve been blessed with,” said Senator Joe Manchin.Every year, hunters, anglers, and outdoorsmen miss out on opportunities to recreate on public lands because the only maps showing access points are stored as printed copies in local field offices. The MAPLand Act will now digitize and standardize these mapping records, like access points and permissible uses on federal public lands, to boost outdoor recreation and improve hunting and fishing access for sportsmen and women.  The MAPLand Act has received strong support from the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation (CSF), Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, and Trout Unlimited’s Angler Conservation Program.A member of the Energy and Natural Resources and Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Senator King is among the Senate’s loudest voices advocating for public lands and encouraging outdoor recreation.

https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/seismic-shift-king-responds-to-media-reports-appalling-draft-abortion-ruling,"May 03, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) issued the following statement in response to media reports of a months-old draft Supreme Court decision that would overturn Roe v. Wade:“If accurate, the draft Supreme Court ruling circulated last night would be a dangerous, seismic shift in which the Court overturns half a century of established precedent and overrides the most basic, private rights of half the nation. The decision being considered in this preliminary draft would eliminate a longstanding fundamental right supported by 64 percent of Maine people and 70 percent of Americans in one fell swoop. The result: millions of women would be robbed of the right to make vital, lifesaving healthcare decisions with the support of medical professionals. I’m also deeply worried that this draft opinion could invite challenges to other longstanding precedents, including marriage rights for same-sex or interracial couples. “A potential ruling that ends abortion protections would be appalling, but also firmly aligned with the clear long-term goals of conservative legal leaders; in fact, former President Trump explicitly stated he would only nominate justices who would ‘automatically’ overturn Roe. While we do not yet know the final ruling, Congress must be prepared to take legislative action to enshrine Roe into law.”"

The resolution encourages school districts across the country to help register eligible high school seniors to vote and stresses the fundamental importance of the right to vote. This effort builds on Senator King’s continued work to protect the right to vote, promote civic engagement, and get more young Americans engaged in politics.“There is nothing more fundamental in a democracy than the right to vote – with a vote, you have the ability to make your voice heard and to shape the future of our country,” said Senator King. “I hope every eligible high school senior will get out and register to vote this week. They are the future leaders of our country, and this is an important step to get them engaged and active as soon as they are of voting age. It’s a healthy habit for them to get into – both for themselves and our system of representative government.” “Graduation from high school is the advent of adulthood, and with this comes the responsibility to contribute to our community,” said Senator Cassidy. “This resolution encourages young Americans to engage and to fulfill their civic duty.”Senator King has been a vocal defender of the right to vote and an advocate for increasing civic engagement, especially among younger Americans. He has previously introduced the Constitution education Is Valuable In Community Schools (CIVICS) Act, bipartisan legislation designed to support the development of Constitution and civics education curriculum for students across the country. You can read the full resolution HERE."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-urges-president-biden-to-expedite-tariff-investigation-harming-american-solar-companies,"May 02, 2022WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine), a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is calling on President Joe Biden to expedite the Administration’s investigation into solar panels and cells imported from Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia. In a letter to President Biden, King and a bipartisan group of 21 Senators highlight the challenges the investigation is already creating for the American solar industry and the devastating economic impact tariffs on these solar imports would inflict on this rapidly growing sector. The Senators also request a meeting with President Biden to discuss the issue. According to a new report issued by the Solar Energy Industries Association, 70 percent of U.S. companies say at least half of their solar workforce is at risk as a result of this investigation. “Initiation of this investigation is already causing massive disruption in the solar industry, and it will severely harm American solar businesses and workers and increase costs for American families as long as it continues,” wrote the Senators. “We strongly urge your administration to swiftly review the case and make an expedited preliminary determination. Such a determination should carefully consider the significant policy ramifications and reject the petitioner’s request for retroactivity.” “Already, as a result of Commerce’s decision to initiate this investigation, industry surveys indicate that 83% of U.S. solar companies report being notified of canceled or delayed panel supply. Without a reliable and cost-effective source of panels, existing and proposed solar projects could come to a halt,” the Senators continued. “Left unaddressed, cutting off this supply of panels and cells also could cause the loss of more than 100,000 American jobs, including approximately 18,000 manufacturing jobs.”This bipartisan letter was also signed by Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Tom Carper (D-DE), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Mark Warner (D-VA), Chris Coons (D-DE), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), John W. Hickenlooper (D-CO), Christopher Murphy (D-CT), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), and Maggie Hassan (D-NH).As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources, Senator King has been a forceful advocate for climate and clean energy solutions wherever they can be found. A member of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, he previously urged the Biden Administration to adopt forward-looking proposals aimed at ramping up the electrification of the federal vehicle fleet, and worked to secure investments in EV infrastructure in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Senator King is also a cosponsor of the Clean Economy Act, which would put the United States on a path to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050, and the Renewable Electricity Standard Act which would put the U.S. on a trajectory to decarbonize the power sector by 2050. The full text of the letter can be read HERE and below.+++Dear President Biden:We write to express serious concern regarding the Department of Commerce’s (Commerce) recent decision to initiate the circumvention inquiry requested by Auxin Solar in its petition. Initiation of this investigation is already causing massive disruption in the solar industry, and it will severely harm American solar businesses and workers and increase costs for American families as long as it continues. We strongly urge your administration to swiftly review the case and make an expedited preliminary determination. Such a determination should carefully consider the significant policy ramifications and reject the petitioner’s request for retroactivity. We also request a meeting with you at your earliest convenience to discuss this urgent matter.On April 1, 2022, Commerce initiated the circumvention inquiry called for in the Auxin petition that would subject crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) solar panels and cells imported from Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia to tariffs ranging from 50 to 250 percent. Given these four countries account for more than 80% of CSPV panel imports to the U.S. and over half of total U.S. panel supply, expanded tariffs on products from these countries would severely undercut the growth of the solar industry, cost tens of thousands of American jobs, and raise energy prices for U.S. consumers. We strongly support developing a domestic solar manufacturing supply chain, but current demand for solar products far exceeds existing domestic production capacity.Already, as a result of Commerce’s decision to initiate this investigation, industry surveys indicate that 83% of U.S. solar companies report being notified of cancelled or delayed panel supply. Without a reliable and cost-effective source of panels, existing and proposed solar projects could come to a halt. According to Wood Mackenzie, a leading energy research firm, solar deployment will fall by approximately 16 GW annually if the current situation persists and tariffs are ultimately imposed. That is more than half the magnitude of total solar capacity the U.S. installed in 2021 (23.6 GW). Left unaddressed, cutting off this supply of panels and cells also risk the loss of more than 100,000 American jobs, including approximately 18,000 manufacturing jobs.These tariffs, if imposed, would adversely impact ratepayers who depend on clean, affordable energy. For example, a utility could have to move to the next least costly supply of electricity if a contracted solar project could not be built or built on time because of the Department’s investigation. In addition, some utilities could decide to take on any added costs resulting from the tariffs and then pass them onto ratepayers. That could mean massive price hikes for U.S. utility customers, given that with CSPV modules subject to 250% tariffs, a typical 100MW utility scale solar project would face $62.5 million in duty exposure. This would needlessly increase energy costs at a time when consumers are already facing rising prices and high costs of living.Initiation of the investigation is already negatively impacting the U.S. solar industry, and the longer this situation persists, the more acute the damage will be. Accordingly, we strongly urge  your administration to make an expedited preliminary determination in this matter and carefully consider the significant policy ramifications on American businesses, workers, and ratepayers. We also look forward to the opportunity to meet with you to discuss this matter further.Thank you in advance for your consideration."

Senator King was joined by Senator Steve Daines (R-Montana), Ranking Member of the National Parks Subcommittee, and Tom Gorrill, President of the Maine Appalachian Trail Club. During the conversation, Senator King and his guests highlighted the recent legislative action Congress has taken to support America’s greatest natural treasures, the challenges facing public lands from Maine to Montana, and some of the outdoor recreation opportunities available in Maine this summer.“Whether we’re talking about the rocky coasts of Acadia or the local nature preserve down the road, America’s national parks and public lands preserve some of our nation’s most beautiful landmarks so people of all backgrounds can explore the natural majesty of the United States,” said Senator King. “These public lands not only provide breathtaking beauty, they also serve as important economic drivers for communities across our country. It was a pleasure to sit down with my friend and partner Senator Daines and the Maine Appalachian Trail Club’s Tom Gorrill to discuss how we can protect America’s best idea and the communities that rely on them for generations to come. Thanks to the hard work of leaders like Senator Daines and Tom, our gorgeous lands are in good hands.”Steve Daines has served as the junior Senator from Montana since 2015 and previously served as the Montanan Representative from 2013 to 2015. In his time in the Senate, Daines has served on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and as the ranking member of the Subcommittee on National Parks where he has worked to increase access to public lands, foster locally-driven conservation projects, and support America’s outdoor recreation economy. In June of 2020 Daines championed the Great American Outdoors Act to provide funding for land and water conservation and address the maintenance backlog facing national parks and public lands across the nation. Tom Gorrill is the President of the Maine Appalachian Trail Club (ATC). A UMaine graduate, Tom retired in 2015 as the President of Gorrill Palmer Consulting Engineers, a firm he co-founded in 1998, after a 37-year career in civil engineering. His interest in hiking was sparked at a young age when his parents, who loved to hike and camp, brought him to one of their favorite areas: Gulf Hagas in northern Maine. His interest was rekindled years later when he and his wife took their children camping on the Appalachian Trail. Tom joined the Maine Appalachian Trail Club and began volunteering in various roles. Before serving in his current role as President, Tom was a district overseer in the Baldpate District in Oxford County and served as the VP and Chair of Governance for the MATC district. He is also a Board member of the Maine Appalachian Trail Land Trust.A member of the Energy and Natural Resources and Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Senator King is among the Senate’s loudest voices advocating for public land stewardship and encouraging outdoor recreation. He was recently awarded the inaugural National Park Foundation (NPF) “Hero” Award.

https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/collins-king-speak-at-maine-disabled-american-veterans-convention-in-waterville,"April 29, 2022Waterville, ME – Today, U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King spoke at the 48th Annual Department of Maine Disabled American Veterans (DAV) State Convention.The DAV State Convention began with an opening ceremony with a color guard followed by speakers and committee meetings throughout the day. On Saturday, the convention will continue with business meetings; installation of officers; and a keynote speaker, Scott Trimarchi, DAV Assistant National Service Director.“From my father, I learned that the heroes who wear the uniforms of America’s armed forces are peace-loving men and women who fight to advance the cause of freedom and justice,” said Senator Collins. “DAV helps the brave veterans who defended our freedom regain their health, rebuild their lives, and further their education and job skills. Perhaps most important, DAV helps them rejoin the civilian world with the honor and respect they have earned at such great cost. No organization serves a nobler cause. No organization serves a cause that is more deserving of the support of the American people and of the American government. Our nation is grateful to you, and I am honored to serve America’s veterans in the Senate.”“Maine’s disabled veterans have made extraordinary sacrifices for our country and our freedoms. We owe each of them a deep debt of gratitude, and have a collective responsibility to recognize, honor, and remember their service,“ said Senator King. “It was a true honor and a privilege to speak at the Maine Disabled American Veterans Convention today and to thank all our state’s veterans for their selfless sense of duty. I heard firsthand about the issues facing our Maine veterans, from benefit improvements to mental health challenges, and saw the incredible work being done to provide emergency shelters to veterans in need. I look forward to continued work with the DAV to deliver on our nation’s bedrock commitment to our servicemembers.”As a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Collins has been a longstanding advocate for our veterans and their families. Last year, she introduced a bill that would reduce the financial burden for severely disabled veterans who require special adaptive equipment to drive a motor vehicle. Also last year, President Biden signed into law legislation she co-authored to help to address the maternal mortality crisis among women veterans by helping improve care at VA facilities. In addition, the Senate recently unanimously passed legislation Senator Collins co-authored to improve veteran’s access to lifesaving breast cancer screening and care. In 2018, she led the enactment of legislation which expanded VA’s Caregiver program to veterans of all generations, not just those who served after 9/11. She has also championed the HUD-VASH program, which has contributed to the more than 50 percent decline in veterans homelessness since 2010, and she strongly advocated for the community care system for rural veterans established in the VA Mission Act.Representing one of the states with the highest rates of veterans per capita, Senator King has been a staunch advocate for America’s servicemembers and veterans. Recently, he introduced the Honoring Purple Heart Recipients Act of 2022 to recognize the sacrifices of Purple Heart medal recipients, and the Major Richard Star Act to help provide more disabled veterans with full military benefits. King has worked to honor and preserve the stories of America’s veterans with his Answering the Call interview series in partnership with the Library of Congress. He also recently introduced the Save Our Servicemembers (S.O.S.) Act, which would work to improve Department of Defense’s servicemember suicide prevention efforts, and has worked to improve the services for Maine veterans across the state, including at the Togus campus in Augusta. Senators Collins and King have also been strong advocates for preserving Maine veterans’ access to long-term care. When Maine Veterans’ Homes made public in February its plans to close its Caribou and Machias facilities, the Maine Delegation and Governor Janet Mills, as well as legislators from Aroostook and Washington counties, immediately began working to reverse this decision. Following this united effort, MVH changed course and decided to keep both the Caribou and Machias veterans homes open."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senator-king-interviews-former-navy-warrant-officer-about-his-time-in-the-armed-services-and-continued-service-with-the-va,"April 29, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Office of U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) today released the April edition of “Answering the Call: Maine’s Veteran Voices,” Senator King’s monthly series in which he shares the stories of the lives, service, and sacrifices of Maine’s veteran community. In the sixth interview of the series, conducted in partnership with the Library of Congress’ Veterans History Project, Senator King spoke with Fairfield resident Cornelius “James” Ware, who spent 23 years in the Navy and retired with the rank of Warrant Officer Two. During the interview, James shared with the Senator his story of being inspired by his family to join the military, his deployments that took him around the world, and his decision to continue serving by supporting his fellow veterans through his work with the Department of Veterans Affairs. “It was an honor to speak with James and hear his first-hand insights and memories in this episode of ‘Answering the Call: Maine’s Veteran Voices.’ Over the course of his 23 years of military service, James continuously demonstrated what it means to serve one’s nation and selflessly support his fellow servicemen and women,” said Senator King. “After serving in the Navy, Warrant Officer James has continued his service by working with the Department of Veterans Affairs to help Maine veterans receive the healthcare and benefits they have earned. His lifetime of dedication is a true inspiration, and I am grateful he could join me to share his story.”Cornelius “James” Ware grew up in a military family, moving around as his father was stationed in various places for the Army. His family has a long tradition of military service starting with both of his grandfathers serving in World War I, his uncle serving in World War II, his father serving in the Vietnam War, and now his daughter. According to Mr. Ware, it was never a question of if he would join the Armed Services, merely which branch. And so, right after graduating from high school, he went to Orlando, FL for basic training.James served 23 years in the Navy, rising through the ranks from seaman recruit to Warrant Officer. He was stationed around the world, including the Mediterranean, Caribbean, the Red Sea, and Persian Gulf. Throughout his career, he performed many jobs, starting as a radar man helping ships to navigate in and out of ports and working his way up to Electronic Warfare Officer, where he was deployed to the Persian Gulf aboard the USS Cole as part of Operation Southern Watch. James also worked as a nucleus team member where he helped to prepare ships for deployment and mentored junior officers at the Surface Warfare Officers School in Newport, RI.After leaving the Navy, James moved to Maine to raise his children and worked for a vending supply company. After nine years, he decided to utilize his G.I. Bill and began earning a college degree. At the same time, he started a new career at the Veterans’ Affairs office in Augusta, ME. Today, James is the state veteran service officer for the VFW and lives in Fairfield, ME with his wife. He’s proud to say his daughter is carrying on the family tradition, serving as a Captain in the National Guard.The Veterans History Project is an effort by the Library of Congress to collect, preserve and distribute the personal accounts of American war veterans so that future generations may hear directly from veterans and better understand the realities of war. The interviews and primary documents from the project are then used by researchers, historians, students, and filmmakers across the country. Senator King joins many other Members of Congress who’ve participated in the project. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator King has been a staunch advocate for America’s servicemembers and veterans. He recently introduced the Save Our Servicemembers (S.O.S.) Act, which would work to improve the Department of Defense’s servicemember suicide prevention efforts. Last year, the Senate unanimously passed legislation cosponsored by Senator King that will designate 9-8-8 as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Veterans Crisis line. Senator King has also worked to create a first-of-its-kind Senate fellowship program for wounded American veterans, and has worked to improve the services for Maine veterans across the state, including at the Togus campus in Augusta."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/on-150th-arbor-day-senators-king-risch-lead-bipartisan-resolution-to-commemorate-occasion,"April 29, 2022BRUNSWICK, Maine – U.S. Senators Angus King (I-Maine) and Jim Risch (R-Idaho), co-chairs of the Senate Working Forest Caucus, have led a bipartisan group of their Senate colleagues to introduce a resolution recognizing the significance of today, April 29th, 2022, as Arbor Day. The bipartisan resolution, which is also cosponsored by Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine), highlights the importance of planting trees on Arbor Day, America’s long history of environmental stewardship, and the central role the forest products industry has in communities across our country.“Maine and America’s forests are vital to the long-term economic and environmental health of our communities. Healthy trees support the air we breathe, are used to create products we use every day, and help fuel key industries that keep our country strong,” said Senator King. “Arbor Day is an essential reminder of the importance of our trees and the responsibility we all share to conserve America’s environment for future generations to come. In the face of a changing climate and shifting challenges, I hope we can use this day to rise to the needs of our forests and that together we can plant the seeds of success.”“Working forests are a source of clean air and water, wildlife habitat, recreation, and wood and paper products we use every day. Conservation and active forest management go hand in hand, and Idaho has long been a leader in demonstrating just that,” said Senator Risch “I am proud to introduce this resolution to celebrate Arbor Day and Idaho’s commitment to healthy forests.”“From our verdant western mountains to our rugged coastline, Maine’s picturesque scenery wouldn’t be complete without its beautiful forests,” said Senator Collins. “Maine is the most forested state in the nation, and our trees help to keep our environment clean, bolster our state’s economy through the forest products and tourism industries, and foster healthy and prosperous communities. National Arbor Day is an opportunity to celebrate the great outdoors and encourage future generations to preserve Maine’s forests for generations to come.”Founded in April 1872 – 150 years ago – Arbor Day recognizes the importance of trees to everyday American life. The day promotes the care and planting of trees, while encouraging environmental conservation and civic engagement. Arbor Day is now recognized by all 50 states and across the world. You can read the full resolution celebrating the day HERE. A member of the Energy and Natural Resources and Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Senator King is among the Senate’s loudest voices advocating for environmental conservation, public lands, and outdoor recreation. Senator King helped lead the passage the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) into law; the legislation includes the Restore Our Parks Act and the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Permanent Funding Act. Representing the most forested state in the nation, he has worked to strengthen and protect America’s forests. He recently introduced the ARCs Act to restore forest ecosystems and fight carbon emissions, along with legislation to create a federal forest health advisory panel. Senator King was also key in establishing the Forest Opportunity Roadmap Maine (FOR/ME) Initiative, an industry-led initiative that is helping to diversify the Maine’s wood products businesses, attract investments, support research and development, and develop greater economic prosperity for rural communities impacted by mill closures."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/after-senate-advances-bipartisan-bill-to-promote-american-technology-king-urges-emphasis-on-cybersecurity-in-final-legislation,"April 28, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine), Co-Chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC), today applauded the Senate’s 67 to 27 vote to go to conference on the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, containing two CSC recommendations to strengthen the nation’s cyberdefenses. The bipartisan legislation, which previously passed the Senate in June 2021, invests in American technological innovation, strengthens U.S. leadership in scientific research, and improves key cybersecurity defenses in the face of increased threats. The legislation will now go to a conference to resolve differences between the Senate’s legislation and the House’s companion bill, the America COMPETES Act, Senator King has emphasized the importance of securing key cyber provisions through the conference, and last month joined fellow CSC Co-Chair Representative Mike Gallagher (R-Wisc.) to send a letter to Senate leaders Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell outlining the vital cybersecurity priorities that should be included in the final bill.“American innovation has driven decades of technological progress that has supported countless good-paying jobs and created life-changing developments that have improved all our lives. But as we face growing challenges from China and Russia, it is critical that we accelerate American investment in the technologies of the future,” said Senator King. “We must act now to cement American leadership for the 21st century and check the anti-democratic powers seeking to exert their influence. This historic, bipartisan legislation will boost American innovation, create jobs in growing industries, and make critical improvements to our cyberdefenses that will help protect our critical infrastructure.“Today’s passage of this legislation is an important step in the right direction – but the work is not yet finished. As the bill proceeds to a conference to determine the final package, I continue to urge all of my colleagues to include the vital cyber provisions we need to defend America’s networks in the final legislation,” continued Senator King. “The urgency of this threat has never been higher, and each bill includes language that can make our country safer – so let’s take the best of both bills, and create a final package that will strengthen our nation’s cyber resiliency.”Among many important provisions in the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, the bipartisan legislation creates a new Directorate for Technology and Innovation at the National Science Foundation, which will receive $100 billion over five years to support research and innovation in technologies that have geostrategic implications for the United States. The legislation also includes number of provisions led and supported by Senator King, including two key Cyberspace Solarium Commission recommendations. The first would codify a “Cyber State of Distress and Cyber Response Fund” in the event of, or in preparation for, a significant cyber incident or series of incidents. The second would establish a National Risk Management Cycle, requiring a four-year cycle of risk identification and assessment to support critical infrastructure resilience, in order to make sure that our lines of defense are regularly refreshed and strengthened.The House’s companion bill, the America COMPETES Act, also included several provisions championed by Co-Chairs King and Gallagher. In their letter to House and Senate leadership last month, they called for these provisions to be included in the final package. Specifically, the House’s America COMPETES Act includes provisions to:·       Reduce American dependency on untrusted vendors beholden to foreign powers by requiring the President to develop a strategy for information and communication technology critical to the economic competitiveness of the United States.·       Strengthen America’s local, state, and federal cybersecurity workforce by expanding CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service, a proven ROTC-like program for recruiting and developing cybersecurity talent to work at all levels of government.·       Improve the security of America’s software and technology ecosystem by supporting the software security and digital privacy work of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and designating Critical Technology Security Centers to evaluate and test the security of technologies essential to national critical functions.·       Create international capacity-building programs to improve the cybersecurity of U.S. allies and partners. As Co-Chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee, Senator King is committed to advancing American competitiveness in 21st century technologies while improving national security and strengthening cyberdefenses. Senator King is the co-chair of the Senate Semiconductor Caucus, and has been one of the Senate’s strongest advocates for American energy storage technology. He is recognized as one of Congress’s leading experts on cyberdefense and advocates for a forward-thinking cyberstrategy that emphasizes layered cyberdeterrence. Since the CSC officially launched in April 2019, dozens of CSC recommendations have been enacted into law, including the creation of a National Cyber Director. "
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/collins-king-announce-2-million-to-help-conserve-kennebago-river,"April 28, 2022Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King announced that the Rangeley Lakes Heritage Trust has received a total of $2 million to help conserve the headwaters of Kennebago River and its outstanding fish and wildlife resources, including its heritage strain of Eastern Brook Trout. This funding was awarded through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services’ North American Wetlands Conservation Act. “The Kennebago River and its watershed play a key role in sustaining the health of Maine’s environment by providing high-quality habitats for fish, migratory birds, and other wildlife,” said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement. “We welcome this important investment in conservation, which will help preserve the Kennebago River’s pristine waters and provide fishing and other outdoor recreational opportunities for Mainers.”“This funding will ensure that critical habitats for threatened and endangered birds and wild, native fish will be conserved forever,” said David Miller, Executive Director, Rangeley Lakes Heritage Trust. “Our watersheds are the lifeblood of Maine’s spectacular ecosystems, and wetlands provide countless benefits to both wildlife and the people of Maine. Both we, and our partners in conservation, are so fortunate to have a congressional delegation who works with us to conserve our wild and beautiful home.”Rangeley Lakes Heritage Trust will use this funding to acquire a 1,240-acre tract and easements on a 1,385-acre tract and a 1,886-acre tract. All three tracts are contiguous. Together these acquisitions will permanently protect 998 wetland acres; 9 miles of undeveloped lake and pond frontage; and 15 miles of relatively intact, wooded riparian area on the Kennebago River and smaller tributary streams.The Maine Rivers Act recognized the Kennebago River as one of the state’s most significant resources for Eastern Brook Trout and landlocked salmon, and the river attracts thousands of anglers to fish its pristine waters. Together, the three tracts provide more than 2,100 acres of breeding habitats for American Black Duck. The Kennebago tracts border a 108,000-acre contiguous block of state and non-profit conservation holdings. As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Collins previously secured $1 million towards this project in the government funding bill that was signed into law in March."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/in-light-of-russian-aggression-king-questions-top-nuclear-official-on-status-of-global-non-proliferation-efforts,"April 28, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King, Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Strategic Forces with jurisdiction over the United States’ nuclear arsenal, expressed concern that the war in Ukraine may erode support for nuclear non-proliferation efforts worldwide, and pressed a top Biden administration official for her assessment of the situation. In a hearing to examine the state of America’s nuclear activities and posture, King asked Jill M. Hruby – Under Secretary of Energy for Nuclear Security and Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration – if Putin’s aggression will make global non-proliferation efforts more challenging by pushing nations to reconsider surrendering their nuclear weapons as Ukraine did in 1994 through the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances. Senator King also questioned Administrator Hruby on how the National Nuclear Security Administration is monitoring and addressing these shifting dynamics.“Let me change the subject for a minute to non-proliferation. One of the things that’s not discussed much with regard to the Ukraine war is that Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in exchange for territorial integrity, which was signed by Russia,” said Strategic Forces Chairman King. “What has happened to the whole theory and practice of non-proliferation? If you’re Kim in North Korea would you give up your nuclear weapons having seen what's happened in Ukraine?”""Senator King, this is an important question. The Ukraine guarantees, you know, people will look at around the world, I’m confident of that. At the same time, we will do everything we can in NNSA to uphold the non-proliferation regime that we have today,” replied Administrator Hruby. “We’ll reach out, and we are reaching out, to our allies and partners and particularly the allies that we have a guarantee with to make sure they understand how strong our commitment to that guarantee is. We will continue to support activities in the non-proliferation area, but we must step it up in our ability to convince people around the world that nuclear weapons are not the best approach. And hopefully not take the wrong lessons from Ukraine.”“Well, I hope you’re right, but I think it’s a significant concern,” concluded Chairman King.As Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Strategic Forces – which oversees the United States’ nuclear arsenal and posture – Senator King has worked to enhance the United States’ nuclear security, strengthen our nuclear deterrent, and stop the spread of these devastating weapons around the globe. His concerns over nuclear weapons has led him to refer to Vladimir Putin as “the single most dangerous man in world history”, given the Russian leader’s military ambitions and significant nuclear arsenal. Senator King has been an outspoken voice on the need to address the growing nuclear capacity of our adversaries, and a strong advocate for the importance of non-proliferation efforts. Last year, Senator King convened a hearing of top nuclear experts to talk through the strengths and weaknesses of U.S.’s current nuclear posture. During the hearing, he pressed witnesses on topics including nuclear modernization, deterrence, and the role of nuclear weapons in protecting America’s allies worldwide. "
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-continues-to-stress-economic-security-benefits-of-long-term-planning-for-biw-pnsy-to-top-pentagon-officials,"April 26, 2022Watch Senator King’s questioning HERE, and download broadcast quality video HEREWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today continued highlighting the importance of multi-year defense contracts that will provide long term stability to America’s national defense and shipyards like Bath Iron Works (BIW) and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNSY). In a hearing of the Senate Armed Services’ Subcommittee on Seapower, Senator King asked Frederick Stefany – Acting Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition – to affirm the administration’s support for long-term procurement packages, and to explain how they save taxpayer money while strengthening America’s national security. Senator King has long championed multi-year procurement contracts, and earlier today highlighted the importance of these more stable funding agreements.“At the hearing that Senator Scott mentioned this morning, former Secretary Lord was one of the witnesses, and she confirmed the importance of multi-year procurement,” said Senator King. “She said the problem is ‘lumpy procurement.’ You want procurement that can provide some continuity to the industrial base so that they can make the investments necessary. Do you share that? The importance of multi-year? I think it’s also better for the taxpayers, frankly.”“Yes, I want to completely agree that planning for investment and planning for the workforce and those other things that shipyards and suppliers need to do completely benefits from a long-term, four or five-year commitment, on multi-year type process,” replied Acting Assistant Secretary Stefany. “I totally agree with Ms. Lord in that case. And to the previous question about cost, that’s one of our main ways to reduce the costs of our programs, is to make those long-term, multi-year contracts and put them in place.”“Well, there’s no question that the learning curve, we’ve built three Zumwalts, and the learning curve just on those three - it should’ve been a dozen - but those three it was quite remarkable,” Senator King concluded. “From ship to ship to ship and you’re not going to ameliorate those learning curve costs, particularly on DDX, without a long-term, multi-year procurement.”Notably, the exchange between Senator King and Assistant Secretary Stefany was reinforced by Seapower Subcommittee Chairwoman Mazie Hirono (D-HI) and Ranking Member Kevin Cramer (R-ND), who both supported the benefits associated with long-term contracts for military work.+++Also during his questioning, Senator King asked Acting Assistant Secretary Stefany to keep shipyards like Bath Iron Works (BIW) involved in the ship development process instead of giving them a design to build without consultation. The questioning builds on Senator King’s longstanding work to support a collaborative design process between the Navy and shipyards including BIW.“The other piece that I wanted to touch upon is the industrial base itself and their involvement in the development of the new ship. So that we don’t have the Navy handing something to the yards and saying ‘here it is, build it’,” said Senator King. “I think [more involvement by shipyards] is a very productive way to avoid some of the problems that have been incurred in the other programs.”“It’s a lesson, sir, that we’ve learned in the Virginia submarine program. Bringing the two shipyards and the major suppliers, the engine makers and others, in upfront. Talk to the Navy as we’re putting together the spec and come up with the design criteria to take the best of all, right. To learn from each other and come up with a single computer model and a single design that then both shipyards can build,” replied Mr. Stefany. “That is the most efficient way we’ve seen to actually get - we call it the collaborative design process - to get to a final state that has the least errors, the least defects in it.” As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Seapower Subcommittee, Senator King has long championed multi-year procurement, and has repeatedly highlighted the necessity of these long-term contracts to Maine employers like BIW and PNSY. In the 2022 NDAA, King secured language urging long-term funding for destroyers beginning in fiscal year 2023 to support the shipbuilding industrial base and expansion of the Navy battle force to congressionally mandated levels. He also secured $3.7 billion for the procurement of 2 DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers in fiscal year 2022, which Bath Iron Works (BIW) can compete to build and $120 million to fund long lead material for a third FY23 DDG-51."

This investment will provide for the reconstruction of the Cape Porpoise commercial pier, supporting 55 fishing boats and local businesses displaced or impacted by severe storms and flooding. The EDA investment will be matched with $540,877 in local funds and is expected to retain 145 jobs.“The commercial fishing industry is a cornerstone of Maine’s coastal communities. For generations, Maine’s fisheries have powered our state’s economy, supported a robust workforce, and shared a taste of Maine with millions around the globe. Rebuilding the Cape Porpoise commercial pier in Kennebunkport will strengthen these historic and important fisheries while securing the long-term resilience of the local industry and the communities that rely on it. This is a vital investment from the Economic Development Administration, and we look forward to seeing the impact it will have in Southern Maine,” said Senator Susan Collins, Senator Angus King, and Congresswoman Chellie Pingree (ME-01) in a joint statement. “President Biden is committed to supporting communities as they develop safe and resilient infrastructure to serve local businesses and build a better America,” said Secretary of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo. “This EDA investment in Kennebunkport will help create long-term resilience to future storms and floods, and support long-term job growth and business expansion in the region.”“This funding represents a critical investment in Maine’s working waterfront,” said Governor Janet Mills. “Kennebunkport’s fishing fleet and shorefront businesses are a vital part this southern Maine community’s economy and identity. They are also vulnerable to the impact of increasingly severe weather, and will greatly benefit from this investment in improved coastal infrastructure.” About the U.S. Economic Development Administration (www.eda.gov) The mission of the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) is to lead the federal economic development agenda by promoting competitiveness and preparing the nation’s regions for growth and success in the worldwide economy.

Senator King has long championed multi-year procurement, and has repeatedly highlighted the necessity of these long-term contracts to Maine employers like BIW and PNSY. “It seems to me that with the industrial base, one of the important things is not necessarily what the government buys but how it buys it. For example, multi-year procurement. Secretary Lord, I believe that multi-year procurement is something that we can do around here that would vastly support and encourage investment and maintain the industrial base,” said Senator King. “You used the term ‘lumpy.’ I love that term. If we do things in a lumpy way, industry can’t respond because you can’t turn these large facilities off and on.”“That’s correct and in fact, if there's a multi-year contract, it drives certainty. It allows the industry partner to put their internal research and development, as well as capital investments, into the area in which the government is buying. It allows employees to say that this is a good place to work because I know that the job will be here for at least 5 years, or whatever it might be with options. It also saves the government an enormous amount of money because the cost and time to renegotiate these contracts is non-trivial,” agreed Ms. Lord. “You want to get all the terms and conditions upfront and then have options there, but there’s going to be less and less inclination to do those multi-years if inflation is running rampant and no one knows how to predict it and industry can’t recoup losses they might have.”“The industry isn’t going to make those investments that they need to make in the capital unless they have some ensured stream of income,” concluded Senator King.As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Seapower Subcommittee, Senator King has long championed multi-year procurement, and has repeatedly highlighted the necessity of these long-term contracts to Maine employers like BIW and PNSY. In the 2022 NDAA, King secured language urging long-term funding for destroyers beginning in fiscal year 2023 to support the shipbuilding industrial base and expansion of the Navy battle force to congressionally mandated levels. In the 2022 NDAA, he also secured $3.7 billion for the procurement of 2 DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers in fiscal year 2022, which Bath Iron Works (BIW) can compete to build and $125 million to fund long lead material for a third FY23 DDG-51."

NOAA’s announcement today is an acknowledgement of this reality, but falls short of honoring our reasonable request and the SBA Office of Advocacy’s recommendation to delay the implementation date. Given that the lobster gear deadline is just two weeks away, this is an urgent problem, and we will continue pushing to provide Maine’s lobster industry with as much support and flexibility as possible in complying with this unfair and onerous rule,” the Maine Delegation and Governor Mills said in a joint statement. “A better and fairer solution would be for NOAA to delay the deadline to July 1 as we have repeatedly called for.”Greater Atlantic Regional Administrator Michael Pentony’s statement can be read online here or below. On March 29, 2022, the Maine Delegation and Governor Mills wrote to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo urging a delay in the implementation of a component of the National Marine Fisheries Service’s (NMFS) new Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP) rule that requires gear modifications to lobster lines. In the letter, they highlighted the supply chain and manufacturing issues facing lobstermen and women who are trying to purchase the required gear, and stressed that the current deadline puts the lobster industry in what the Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy described as an “impossible scenario.”The Maine Delegation and Governor Mills have been steadfastly opposed to undue burdens that would threaten the lobster fishery without meaningfully protecting whales.  Following the release of the final rule in late August 2021, the Maine Delegation and Governor Mills issued a statement in opposition to the rule and highlight the Maine lobster fishery’s record of repeatedly making significant improvements to their practices and modifications to their gear to protect right whales.  In October 2021, they wrote to Secretary Raimondo to urge her to rescind the rule, and in February 2022 called for a postponement of the rule due to difficulties lobstermen and women were having obtaining the necessary gear.  The Maine Delegation also secured $14.1 million in the fiscal year 2022 government funding law to help Maine’s lobster industry comply with the rule.+++As we announced last fall in our final rule to implement new measures to protect North Atlantic right whales, the deadline for Northeast lobster and Jonah crab fishermen to make the necessary gear modifications is May 1, 2022. These regulations are critical to protecting the endangered North Atlantic right whale and keeping this valuable and important fishery open for business. Most participants in the Northeast lobster and Jonah crab fishery are nearly finished with the needed gear modifications and ready for the deadline. However, unanticipated supply chain delays are preventing some of the fleet from fully coming into compliance. I want to assure fishermen who are making good faith efforts to comply with these new measures but are not able to procure compliant gear that we understand the difficulty of their situation. We are working closely with our state and federal enforcement partners to implement a graduated enforcement effort that will focus on compliance assistance rather than civil penalties until we have determined that localized supply chain issues have been sufficiently resolved.   I would like to acknowledge the tremendous efforts of fishermen, gear experts, and manufacturers who have developed and tested numerous weak links, sleeves, and ropes that comply with the 2021 modifications to the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan. We would also like to express our great appreciation to the many fishermen who have already or are now modifying their gear to reduce the risk of entanglements. Nevertheless, the availability of compliant gear is not yet universal. NOAA Fisheries is closely monitoring the challenges that some Northeast lobster and Jonah crab trap/pot fishermen are facing in their effort to comply with weak rope measures. New England fishermen have been in the forefront of efforts to design weak rope and weak inserts. Nearly every weak rope and weak insert that has been approved for use under the new regulations was designed by, or developed in collaboration with, fishermen. They have fished with weak inserts in state waters since state regulations were implemented in the spring of 2021. Offshore fishermen, led by the Atlantic Offshore Lobstermen’s Association, have sourced larger diameter weak ropes and are now conducting field testing to ensure they retain dimensions that can be used in offshore haulers without jamming. Availability continues to be a challenge despite these persistent and collaborative efforts, many initiated in early 2019. At the Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office, we are committed to continuing to message urgency to rope and weak link producers and to monitor the supply challenges closely. We will also remain in close communication with fishermen as well as with New England state managers, the Northeast Office of Law Enforcement, and our state and federal enforcement partners. I will continue to work with state fishery managers to ensure that both North Atlantic right whales and the valuable lobster fishery have a long and healthy future.  "

The request comes in response to a recent report from the USPS IG that identified the benefits of fleet electrification, but stopped short of analyzing the social costs of fossil fuel reliance.“Thank you for your recent investigation into electrifying the postal service’s vehicle fleet. At a time when we are seeing high prices at the pump, increasing fossil energy security issues, and the tangible impacts of climate change, we need analyses and insights like those provided by your office,” wrote the lawmakers. “As you continue your investigation into USPS’s NEPA compliance, we request that you also update your analyses to include the social cost of carbon.”“In the past month, we have seen the vulnerabilities wrought by a dependence on fossil fuels and how that reliance can prop up petrostate dictators. Meanwhile, a 70 degree temperature spike in Antarctica caused an ice shelf larger than New York City to break off the continent for the first time on record,” the lawmakers continued. “These costs are real, and we ask that you update your economic analysis to incorporate the social cost of carbon, to capture at least some of these impacts, when comparing the cost of electric and fossil fuel vehicles.”As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources, Senator King has been a forceful advocate for climate and clean energy solutions wherever they can be found. A member of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, he previously urged the Biden Administration to adopt forward-looking proposals aimed at ramping up the electrification of the federal vehicle fleet, and worked to secure investments in EV infrastructure in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Senator King is also a cosponsor of the Clean Economy Act, which would put the United States on a path to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050, and the Renewable Electricity Standard Act which would put the U.S. on a trajectory to decarbonize the power sector by 2050. King has also worked to strengthen the USPS, and recently helped passthe Postal Service Reform Act, historic bipartisan legislation to protect the long-term health of the Service and help ensure deliveries are made in a reliable, timely manner.The full letter can be read HERE or below.+++Dear Ms. Whitcomb, Thank you for your recent investigation into electrifying the postal service’s vehicle fleet. At a time when we are seeing high prices at the pump, increasing fossil energy security issues, and the tangible impacts of climate change, we need analyses and insights like those provided by your office. As you continue your investigation into USPS’s NEPA compliance, we request that you also update your analyses to include the social cost of carbon.USPS manages a fleet of 217,000 vehicles - almost the number of vehicles registered in Washington, D.C. Electrifying this fleet could reduce emissions three-fold, and your analysis highlights many other benefits; electric vehicles are cheaper to fuel and maintain, they insulate from volatile fossil fuel prices, and their range is suitable for 98.5% of postal routes. The outcome of this analysis is not surprising. Electric engines have 40% higher efficiency than gasoline engines, with fewer moving parts and no oil to change. You also note uncertainty in the cost of charging infrastructure. This is a one-time investment which will still be useful when the fleet turns over again 20 years from now. Prior generations made similar investments in railroad tracks and airport runways to keep mail delivery evolving with the times – investments which we still benefit from daily. Scaling up charging infrastructure now will set the stage for additional technologies which we are only beginning to envision for the future. What is not highlighted in your analysis is also notable: the cost of reliance on fossil fuels to our national security and our climate. In the past month, we have seen the vulnerabilities wrought by a dependence on fossil fuels and how that reliance can prop up petrostate dictators. Meanwhile, a 70 degree temperature spike in Antarctica caused an ice shelf larger than New York City to break off the continent for the first time on record. These costs are real, and we ask that you update your economic analysis to incorporate the social cost of carbon, to capture at least some of these impacts, when comparing the cost of electric and fossil fuel vehicles. Despite not accounting for these factors, you still found electric vehicles had a similar cost of ownership as fossil fuel vehicles for the average USPS route. ?The establishment and oversight of the postal service are explicitly listed in the Constitution under the powers of Congress. Thank you for continuing to provide the full picture to us as we exercise this oversight, and we look forward to your additional analysis. "

The comprehensive legislation will prevent suicide, burnout, and mental and behavioral health conditions among health care professionals. “Working on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, health care professionals put themselves at increased risk, endure enormous pressure, and witness heartbreaking tragedies while keeping our communities healthy and safe,” said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement. “Our nation is grateful for the countless and often unseen sacrifices they have made during the pandemic. We are pleased that the President has signed this legislation into law, which will provide health care professionals with resources to improve their wellbeing and mental health.”Health care professionals have long experienced high levels of stress and burnout, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the problem. While helping their patients fight for their lives, many health care professionals have been coping with their own trauma of losing patients and colleagues and fear for their own health and safety. The issue captured national attention in April 2020 when Dr. Lorna Breen, a physician from Charlottesville, Virginia, working on the frontlines of the pandemic in New York, died by suicide.Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act will help promote mental and behavioral health among those working on the frontlines of the pandemic. It also will support training for health professionals to prevent suicide and burnout and increases awareness about suicide and mental health concerns among health care professionals. Specifically, the legislation:The legislation was introduced by Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA).

This grant will build on the efforts of the SEAMaine marine economy action plan, an industry-led effort funded with the support of Senators Collins and King.“Small businesses are the backbone of Maine’s economy, and helping them to reach their full potential strengthens Maine’s economy and creates new employment opportunities, particularly in our rural communities,” said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement.  “We welcome this investment from the USDA, which will allow Springtide Seaweed to develop new seaweed crops, increasing sustainability and efficiency in the industry, diversifying the aquaculture industry, and supporting jobs in coastal communities.The potential of U.S. seaweed aquaculture is immense, but the industry remains stalled at low-value brown kelp crops. Springtide Seaweed will use this funding to refine its nursery technologies and designs for efficient seed production of high-value nori and dulse red seaweed.  This cultivation system would be used by Springtide Seaweed and commercialized for aquaculture businesses globally.  New turnkey systems, adaptable to red and brown seaweed cultivation, will increase sustainability in the industry, reduce gear and crop failure, and enable high-value red seaweeds to be easily integrated into existing aquaculture industries, including shellfish, finfish, and seaweed farms worldwide. This funding was awarded through the Small Business Innovation Research Program at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture.  This program encourages the growth of domestic small businesses by offering competitively awarded grants to support high-quality research related to important scientific problems and opportunities in agriculture.  These small business ventures are recognized as having the potential for larger scale commercialization as well as benefits to the community at large."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-highlights-maine-frustrations-with-unacceptable-irs-delays,"April 13, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – In the face of consistent challenges and delays, the Office of U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) today released a letter from Senator King highlighting the unnecessary stresses Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issues are causing Maine people in the days leading up to the tax filing deadline and calling on the Service to urgently improve customer resources. In a letter to IRS commissioner Charles Rettig, King shared concrete examples of the unacceptable tax delays and difficulties Maine people have faced, emphasized the importance of an easy and reliable tax system, and urged the IRS to use increased funding to improve and expand their services. This letter comes shortly after Senator King supported an additional $400 million in funding for the Service in this year’s appropriations bill.“As the annual individual tax filing date approaches, the IRS has failed to answer my constituents’ calls, sent my constituents erroneous penalty notices based on outdated filings, and left small businessowners seeking pandemic aid in limbo. The IRS can and must do better for the people of Maine,” said Senator King.“With this letter, I share with you some of my constituents’ interactions with the IRS.  I urge you to use recently increased taxpayer services funding – funding that I have championed for years – to rapidly and substantially improve IRS service for Maine people,” continued Senator King. “As you know, it is nearly impossible to pose questions to the IRS by phone.  While my staff can attempt to provide advocacy through other means – whether through TAS or even the Pine Tree Legal Tax Assistance program – I have heard from a number of justifiably frustrated Maine taxpayers who cannot receive simple answers from the Service over the phone.  The IRS must do better in fulfilling this basic function.”“In addition to not being able to reach the IRS by phone, my constituents have received notices from the IRS that are erroneous due to their reliance on outdated paper filings,” Senator King concluded. “Many people rely on timely tax refunds and credits to meet their needs for housing, repairs, and basic necessities in what are very stressful times… Through the recent omnibus appropriations bill, my colleagues and I in Congress voted to give the IRS more resources to make customer service better for our constituents.  Now, I urge you to use the additional Taxpayer Services funding that we appropriated to ensure that Maine people never again face the confusion and jeopardy that they now encounter when dealing with the IRS.”Senator King has long been a leading voice on providing the IRS with the resources that it needs to improve services and catch tax cheaters. Last year, in TIME, he made the case for increasing IRS funding to bring down the federal budget deficit and create a fair tax collection system for Maine people. In the 2022 appropriations omnibus bill, King worked to secure an additional $400 million for the IRS – an important first step in this effort to improve America’s tax system. As part of these efforts, last month King joined a bipartisan group of his colleagues in urging the IRS to address the tax return backlog.  The full letter can be read HERE and below.+++ Dear Commissioner RettigThank you for the IRS’s recent progress in recognizing and responding to the highly distressing customer service experiences that taxpayers are reporting throughout the nation.  I understand that the IRS is facing an unprecedented paper filing backlog due to chronic underfunding and the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, as the annual individual tax filing date approaches, the IRS has failed to answer my constituents’ calls, sent my constituents erroneous penalty notices based on outdated filings, and left small businessowners seeking pandemic aid in limbo.  The IRS can and must do better for the people of Maine. Before providing you with casework examples from my office as to how the IRS is negatively impacting my constituents, I would be remiss if I also did not acknowledge the outstanding staff in Maine at the Tax Payer Advocate Service (“TAS”).  Despite their continued need for additional staff, a limit on what cases they can take, and their own backlog in cases, the Maine TAS staff continually keep open communications with my staff and work tirelessly to address taxpayer needs as professionally and expeditiously as possible. With this letter, I share with you some of my constituents’ interactions with the IRS.  I urge you to use recently increased taxpayer services funding – funding that I have championed for years – to rapidly and substantially improve IRS service for Maine people.As you know, it is nearly impossible to pose questions to the IRS by phone.  While my staff can attempt to provide advocacy through other means – whether through TAS or even the Pine Tree Legal Tax Assistance program – I have heard from a number of justifiably frustrated Maine taxpayers who cannot receive simple answers from the Service over the phone.  The IRS must do better in fulfilling this basic function.In addition to not being able to reach the IRS by phone, my constituents have received notices from the IRS that are erroneous due to their reliance on outdated paper filings.  One Maine small business owner reached out to me and shared dire consequences that they are facing due to IRS inaction.  Last tax season, they followed instructions and took an end-of-year credit for one $600 Economic Impact Payment that they had not received.  They filed by paper.  Apparently, when the filing was converted to electronic format, the handwritten deduction did not transfer.  They received a demand letter for $451.  They have responded multiple times, providing paper copies of their returns.  The IRS has not rectified the issue – instead, the Service notified my constituent by letter of its intent to seize my constituent’s property for unpaid taxes.  As my constituent’s example shows, the IRS’s paper return backlog is unacceptably putting Maine people in jeopardy.The backlog also has deprived small businesses of pandemic economic relief that they have needed for many months.  While I applaud IRS efforts to scrutinize Employee Retention Tax Credit returns for any anomalies given the potential for fraudulent payments, I am concerned by reports from Maine constituents that there seems to be no orderly process for issuance of these credits.  One Maine restaurant claimed that they did their first filing on May 14, 2021 and an amended filing in October.  They have heard nothing back from IRS.  However, the constituent has a partner who owns a restaurant in Florida and who filed 4 months after they did.  The Florida restaurant owner has already received their credit.  While I understand that filing an amended return in normal times may take up to 20 weeks to process, it is unacceptable for the IRS to leave my constituent without even a status update since May.These examples highlight the type of stories that small businesses as well as individuals are facing in Maine.  Many people rely on timely tax refunds and credits to meet their needs for housing, repairs, and basic necessities in what are very stressful times.  Adding to that stress with the inability to obtain timely and accurate tax information is unacceptable.Through the recent omnibus appropriations bill, my colleagues and I in Congress voted to give the IRS more resources to make customer service better for our constituents.  Now, I urge you to use the additional Taxpayer Services funding that we appropriated to ensure that Maine people never again face the confusion and jeopardy that they now encounter when dealing with the IRS.  Thank you for your consideration and action.Sincerely,"

The program is led by the National Science Foundation and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), with a focus on promoting new biomanufacturing jobs and education across the state. The University of New Hampshire, University of Wyoming, and Auburn University will be partnering with UMaine and UNE on the research project.“Biomanufacturing is among the fastest growing industries in Maine – and with the right investments, it has the potential to grow even more,” said Senators Collins and King. “The University of Maine and University of New England have long been national leaders in biotechnology research, and this new funding will help them build upon this foundation to support long-term success. We look forward to seeing how this program creates new opportunities for students and researchers, trains Maine’s 21st century workforce, and keeps our state at the forefront of bio-innovation.”“In the state of Maine, bioproducts is an emerging industry and having a greater understanding of the skills needed to grow this sector is critical,” said Professor Andrew Crawley, who is leading the UMaine research. “This is putting research into practice — using an academically developed method and applying it to the real economy to better understand where we’re going.”“This grant from the National Science Foundation is a testament to UNE’s commitment to high quality research and scholarship, and it is a symbol of UNE’s leadership in meeting evolving critical workforce needs on a state and national level,"" said UNE President James D. Herbert. ""I am proud of Dr. Balog and our collaborators for securing this important funding to bolster the biotechnology sector.""The EPSCoR grant will support research at UMaine and UNE to develop sensors for supporting quality control in biomanufacturing and biotechnology. UMaine’s role in the program will focus on economic research and assessment within the biomanufacturing field to examine the changing dynamics of the labor market, while researchers at UNE plan to utilize the funds to research the innovative methods of protein engineering. EPSCoR funding is provided to elite universities at the top of their fields. Senators Collins and King are longtime supporters of Maine’s universities and research opportunities. Last November, the Senators announced more than $500,000 in federal funding for the Potato Research Program at the University of Maine. They also secured funding for Maine’s universities in the 2023 appropriations package that allocated millions in funding to key Maine priorities."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-unanimously-passes-king-bill-to-modernize-public-land-mapping,"April 08, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Senate has unanimously passed bipartisan legislation led by U.S. Senators Angus King (I-Maine), Chairman of the Senate National Parks Subcommittee, and Jim Risch (R-Idaho) to digitize public land mapping records to support greater outdoor recreation access. The Modernizing Access to our Public Land (MAPLand) Act, which is also cosponsored by Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine), will enhance the nation’s outdoor recreational opportunities by digitizing and standardizing mapping information like access points and permissible uses on federal public lands, improving access to hunting and fishing and supporting Maine sportsmen and women. The bill now heads to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. This legislation builds on Senator King’s efforts to help more people access public lands through technology and 21st century solutions, he recently called on the National Park Service to provide digital passes, and introduced a bill to create a “Waze for Parks.”“America’s public lands have always enabled our citizens to get outside to explore the natural beauty that surrounds us – and in recent years, the call of the wild has grown even stronger for people across our nation,” said Senator King. “Our bipartisan legislation will make it easier for America’s hunters, fishers, and adventurers to recreate safely, using the latest mapping technologies to help more Americans access our public lands. I’m grateful that this legislation has passed through Congress with strong bipartisan support, and look forward to seeing how it supports our nation’s outdoor enthusiasts.”“I am proud to see this commonsense legislation make its way to the President,” said Senator Risch. “The MAPLand Act will not only make it easier than ever for outdoorsmen and women to explore and recreate on Idaho’s vast public lands, but for them to do so legally and responsibly.”“With vast acres of forests; miles of scenic trails; and numerous pristine lakes, ponds, and rivers, Maine is a true paradise for outdoor enthusiasts,” said Senator Collins.  “Improving the availability and accuracy of maps will help hunters, fishermen, hikers, and other recreationalists find new areas to explore and enjoy.  In addition, by enhancing access to federal lands like Acadia National Park and Katahdin Woods and Waters, our bipartisan legislation will attract visitors to the surrounding communities, boosting local economies and helping to create jobs.”Every year, hunters, anglers, and outdoorsmen miss out on opportunities to recreate on public lands because the only maps showing access points are stored as printed copies in local field offices. The MAPLand Act will digitize and standardize mapping records, like access points and permissible uses on federal public lands, to boost outdoor recreation and improve hunting and fishing access for sportsmen and women.The MAPLand Act has received strong support from the sportsmen and outdoor recreation communities:“Passage of the MAPLand Act is a huge win in ensuring that our public lands system is accessible to all Americans, and we are grateful to Senators Risch and King for their leadership on this important issue,” said Whit Fosburgh, president and CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. “Hunters and anglers as well as our partners in the outdoor industry have been vocal champions of this common-sense legislation since it was first introduced, because we know that a 21st-century digital mapping system for our public lands will empower more people to get outside and discover new recreational opportunities.”“The No. 1 reason for hunter decline in the U.S. is insufficient public access and quality hunting opportunities. The importance of reliable, comprehensive information on access to our public lands and waters cannot be overstated. The need to modernize mapping systems is also critical for improving active management of fish and wildlife habitat and developing better data and science for understanding things like migration corridors. Backcountry Hunters & Anglers thanks Senator Risch, King, and the congressional leaders in both chambers who championed this foresighted, commonsense effort,” said Land Tawney, CEO of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers.“Quality hunting and fishing requires healthy habitat and access for hunters and anglers. The #MAPLandAct makes sure that information about public land access and areas open for hunting and fishing is kept current and readily available for sportsmen and women,” said Steve Kandell, Director of Trout Unlimited's Angler Conservation Program. A member of the Energy and Natural Resources and Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Senator King is among the Senate’s loudest voices advocating for public lands and encouraging outdoor recreation. He was recently awarded the inaugural National Park Foundation (NPF) “Hero” Award. Senator King helped lead the passage the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) into law; the legislation includes the Restore Our Parks Act – a bill led by Senator King – and the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Permanent Funding Act. The historic legislative package continues Senator King’s career-long focus on conservation efforts, dating back to his work prior to running for elected office through his years as Governor and his service in the Senate. Over the course of his time in the Blaine House, Governor King was responsible for conserving more land across Maine than all Governors before him combined. "

The funds, which are distributed by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Transit Administration (FTA), will support local public transit systems across Maine including buses, rail lines, and ferries.Senator Collins, the Ranking Member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, was part of the core group of 10 Senators who negotiated the text of the bipartisan infrastructure law. Senators Collins and King both worked to negotiate and pass this historic legislation, which will deliver billions to Maine for investments in roads, bridges, broadband, and more.“Public transportation systems are critical for Americans who rely on these services to travel to and from work, school, health care appointments, grocery stores, and pharmacies,” said Senator Collins. “Whether it be via a bus, train, or ferry, this investment will help individuals reach their homes and jobs safely and more quickly. As a key negotiator of the bipartisan infrastructure package, I am delighted that this law is making significant investments that will help expand affordable, reliable, and environmentally friendly transportation options for our communities.”       “Public transit is an absolutely essential resource for Maine communities, helping people get to work, run errands, or visit their loved ones,” said Senator King. “Supporting public transit helps us to strengthen local economies, reduce emissions, and create good-paying. These funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will make much-needed upgrades to existing transit networks and support critical expansions to reach new communities in rural and underserved areas. I’m pleased to see this significant investment in Maine’s infrastructure needs and look forward to this legislation’s continued support for our state.”  The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) provides financial and technical assistance to local public transit systems, including buses, subways, light rail, commuter rail, trolleys and ferries. FTA also oversees safety measures and helps develop next-generation technology research. Since 1964, FTA has partnered with state and local governments to create and enhance public transportation systems, investing more than $12 billion annually to help modernize public transportation and extend service into small cities and rural communities that previously lacked transit options."

https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-cosponsors-bill-seeking-to-provide-full-military-benefits-for-disabled-veterans,"April 07, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is cosponsoring bipartisan legislation to help provide more disabled veterans with full military benefits. The Major Richard Star Act, which is supported by a bipartisan group of 58 Senators, would provide combat-injured veterans with less than 20 years of military service their full benefits instead of deducting their disability pay from retirement payments.“America’s disabled veterans have made extraordinary sacrifices for our country and our freedoms. They deserve our thanks, and they certainly deserve the full benefits they’ve earned,” said Senator King. “The Major Richard Star Act would ensure that these heroes who were wounded while serving receive the proper care and support, without costing them the pay they earned through a medical retirement This bipartisan legislation will bring us closer to fulfilling our nation’s bedrock commitment to our servicemembers, and I hope it passes through Congress swiftly.”Currently, 42,000 military retirees with combat-related injuries qualify for retirement pay for their service from the Department of Defense (DoD) and for disability compensation for injuries acquired in combat from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). However, for retired veterans with less than 20 years of service, their disability pay is deducted from their retirement pay. The Major Richard Star Act would repeal this unfair offset, allowing disabled veterans to receive both their retirement pay and their disability compensation. The bill is named in honor of Major Richard A. Star—a father, husband, and decorated war veteran who, as a result of his combat-related injuries, was medically retired. Major Star sadly lost his battle with cancer on February 13, 2021.“Disabled veterans who are entitled to VA compensation due to their service-connected conditions and retired military pay for their service to this country deserve to receive both, without any offsets,” said DAV Washington Headquarters Executive Director Randy Reese. “DAV supports the Major Richard Star Act to repeal the offset between VA disability compensation and DoD medical retirement pay, just as we support the Retired Pay Restoration Act, which would eliminate the remaining offsets for longevity retired pay and disability compensation.”“Retirement pay and VA disability compensation are two distinct and separate benefits that veterans earn through their service,” said National Commander of The American Legion James W. “Bill” Oxford. “However, these two benefits have been unjustly tied together to reduce costs. Current law requires that these benefits offset one another by reducing retirement pay for every dollar of disability received. The Major Richard Star Act is a vital step in the right direction but there is more to be done to solve the issue of concurrent receipt once and for all. The American Legion is proud to support this legislation and calls for this bill to be swiftly passed through Congress.” Representing one of the states with the highest rates of veterans per capita, Senator King has been a staunch advocate for America’s servicemembers and veterans. Earlier this week, he introduced the Honoring Purple Heart Recipients Act of 2022 to recognize the sacrifices of Purple Heart medal recipients. King has worked to honor and preserve the stories of America’s veterans with his Answering the Call interview series in partnership with the Library of Congress. He also recently introduced the Save Our Servicemembers (S.O.S.) Act, which would work to improve Department of Defense’s servicemember suicide prevention efforts, and has worked to improve the services for Maine veterans across the state, including at the Togus campus in Augusta."

""Enjoying Montana's great outdoors isn’t just a favorite pastime, it’s part of our way of life. This National Parks week, I encourage folks to get outside and find their park!""“America’s iconic national parks — including West Virginia’s first National Park and Preserve at the New River Gorge — truly embody our spirit and way of life,” said U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “I’m incredibly proud the Senate passed my bipartisan resolution to designate and celebrate National Park Week. With more than 80 million breathtaking acres of land, our national parks offer endless opportunities to explore the outdoors, recreate with our friends and family and improve our mental and physical well-being. I encourage every American to get outside to enjoy these national treasures.”“This is an especially significant year for Wyoming as we celebrate the 150 year anniversary of the establishment of Yellowstone National Park,” said U.S. Senator John Barrasso (R-WY), Ranking Member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “Yellowstone and all of America’s national parks are some of our greatest treasures.

In a hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator King began his questioning by asking Kate Heinzelman – the nominee for General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency – to reaffirm her commitment to supporting Congressional oversight of the intelligence community and pledge to make critical national security information “readily available on a timely basis” to the committee.“A secret agency is an anomaly in a democracy, and our government is built upon an elaborate set of checks and balances, many of which don’t necessarily apply to a secret agency. The law is one of those checks that does,” said Senator King. “To go back to the very beginning of this hearing, you answered ‘yes’ to the Chairman’s questions about making information readily available on a timely basis to this committee. I think that’s critically important, and I hope right now I’d like to give you an opportunity to renew that commitment that you made earlier today.”“I think the obligations that the CIA Director - that the general counsel - are under to ensure that this committee is fully and timely informed are critical. As I mentioned in my opening statement, I believe this is particularly critical at an agency like the CIA that necessarily has to conduct a lot of its work outside of the public view,” replied Ms. Heinzelman. “I will always do my utmost to comply with those obligations and to bring matters to this committee consistent with all obligations to protect sensitive information because I view a partnership with this committee as being absolutely essential to the success of the agency’s mission overall.”“It’s part of the checks and balance in our system that this committee has this reasonability,” Senator King continued. “This isn’t like the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Commerce that has outside commentators and newsletters and the press and all those kinds of things. We’re it, and that’s why our relationship with you is so important.”+++Continuing his questioning, Senator King, the Co-Chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, urged Ms. Heinzelman to ensure the CIA and intelligence community are prepared to deal with new, growing cyberthreats that may not fall clearly within jurisdictions.“One of the areas that it seems to me that we’re going to have to be thinking about is that we’ve had this clear distinction in our intelligence laws and in our law enforcement between U.S. and abroad. The CIA doesn’t operate in the United States, the FBI does. NSA doesn’t operate with regards to U.S. persons. Here’s the problem, we’re entering an area where that line is harder to draw. For example, in the area of cyber,” said Senator King, Co-Chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission. “There may be a cyberattack that originates in Russia or in China but goes through servers in New Jersey or California. And the question is, is that a domestic issue or a foreign issue? Give me some thoughts about how we maintain the fencing in, if you will, of our intelligence agencies with regards to Americans, and yet at the same time, effectively respond to threats that are more complex and the lines are harder to draw.”“That issue, particularly when it comes to technology, is, as you note, increasingly complex. And the CIA and the intelligence community have several tools to help them work through those issues, but fundamentally, a lot of those questions are legal questions, are questions on which lawyers give guidance, and there’s some of the types of issues that I think are the most challenging. It’s one of the reasons why I think it is a huge advantage to have lawyers who really understand technology,” replied Ms. Heinzelman. “Sometimes generalists’ knowledge is not enough to help us answer those types of questions. I think that working with the intelligence community at large, as a community, to figure out which agencies are best suited, consistent with their authorities, consistent with EO-12 Triple 3 guidelines to be the lead on given issues is one of the most important features of our community system of intelligence.” As a member of the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, and Co-Chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC), Senator King is seen as a highly-influential voice in the intelligence and national security conversation. Since it officially launched in April 2019, dozens of CSC recommendations have been enacted into law, including the creation of a National Cyber Director. As Russia has continued their unprovoked attack on Ukraine, Senator King has worked to provide Ukraine with urgent lethal and humanitarian aid and give Ukrainian leaders the intelligence they need to fight Russia’s heinous attacks. Last month, King joined a bipartisan Congressional delegation to Poland and Germany where he met with NATO leaders, Ukrainian refugees, and U.S. servicemembers for a first-hand look at the humanitarian crisis and America’s efforts to support Ukrainians. "
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-introduces-bipartisan-bill-to-honor-purple-heart-recipients,"April 06, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, introduced bipartisan legislation to honor and recognize the sacrifices of Purple Heart medal recipients. The Honoring Purple Heart Recipients Act of 2022 would require the Department of Defense (DOD) to give future Purple Heart recipients the option of being listed on the DOD military awards website, and create a lasting historical record of these American servicemembers. This bill builds on Senator King’s efforts to preserve and honor the sacrifices of Maine and America’s veterans with his Answering the Call, Maine’s Veteran Voices series.“Purple Heart recipients are true heroes who’ve put themselves in harms’ way to defend our country and their fellow servicemembers – some paying the ultimate price. As Americans, we have a collective responsibility to recognize, honor, and remember this sacrifice,” said Senator King. “The Honoring Purple Heart Recipients Act would give our Purple Heart heroes the choice of receiving additional well-deserved recognition via the DOD website, to create a lasting historical record of these greatest Americans for generations to come. For all that these Purple Heart recipients have done for our country, this is the least we can do.”The Purple Heart medal is awarded to U.S. military servicemembers who are wounded or killed while serving. 2022 marks the 240th anniversary of the establishment of the precursor to the Purple Heart—the Badge of Military Merit—by George Washington in 1782 and the 90th anniversary of the re-established Purple Heart award.Along with Senator King the legislation was introduced by Senators Pat Toomey (R-Penn.), Bob Casey (D-Penn.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.V.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Angus King (I-Maine), Rick Scott (R-Fl.), and Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.). Several organizations have voiced support for the Honoring Purple Heart Recipients Act of 2022, including the National Flag Foundation, Military Order of the Purple Heart, American Legion, Marine Corps League, Gold Star Mothers, and the Ancient Order of Hibernians. Representing one of the states with the highest rates of veterans per capita, Senator King has been a staunch advocate for America’s servicemembers and veterans. King has worked to honor and preserve the stories of America’s veterans with his Answering the Call interview series in partnership with the Library of Congress. He also recently introduced the Save Our Servicemembers (S.O.S.) Act, which would work to improve Department of Defense’s servicemember suicide prevention efforts, and has worked to improve the services for Maine veterans across the state, including at the Togus campus in Augusta."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-questions-cyber-chief-on-lack-of-cyberattacks-from-russia-thus-far-in-ukraine-war,"April 05, 2022Watch Senator King’s questioning here, and download broadcast quality video hereWASHINGTON, D.C. – As Russia continues their deadly, unprovoked attack on Ukraine, Senator Angus King (I-Maine), Co-Chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, is pushing top cyberofficials for clarity on Russia’s cyber activities in the conflict and for additional information on America’s preparedness to respond to any attempted cyberattacks against the United States. In a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator King began by asking General Paul Nakasone – Director of the National Security Agency and Commander of United States Cyber Command – why there have not been more successful cyberattacks against Ukraine during this conflict. Senator King’s questioning comes shortly after he and Congressman Mike Gallagher (R-Wisc.) sent a letter to President Joe Biden, urging his administration to keep a key Pentagon cyberdeterrent in place.“General Nakasone, if you can answer this in an open session, why no Russian serious cyber-attack in Ukraine? We all thought that was going to be the first thing they did, and it didn’t happen. And I know there were some attacks, but nothing of the scale we were expecting,” said Senator King, Co-Chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission. “Do we have an answer to that?”“Senator, I think I’d begin by saying we’re not out of Ukraine yet and so obviously our position right now is one of vigilance in terms of anything that might still be done,” replied General Nakasone. “In terms of what the Russians decided to do, I would anticipate that this was based upon a serious of assumptions that they may have made coupled with the defensive capabilities that we were able to work with a number of partners within Ukraine, and then thirdly, a realization that a lot of times these are very, very difficult attacks to be able to conduct.”“I think their assumption was the war would last two weeks, so they didn’t really have to do that,” concurred Senator King. “That seems to be one of their greatest mistakes.”+++Continuing his questioning, King urged General Nakasone to assess if our country is adequately prepared to deal with a foreign cyberattack that comes through domestic infrastructure, and if U.S. inter-agency coordination would hamper responses to any potential attacks. Senator King’s additional line of questioning focused on the ability to attribute a cyberattack to its source, as bad actors can frequently utilize networks in foreign countries to complicate the ability to root out its cause.“It makes me nervous when I hear the first part of the answer being coordination. I like it when somebody is in charge and responsible, but I understand that the coordination is important,” said Senator King. “One of the, I don’t know if I would call it a gap, but you mentioned, for example, outside of our borders that’s where NSA responsibility, CIA’s responsibility is. We’re no longer in a world of borders, and what concerns me is a cyberattack that originates in a foreign country but goes through a server in New Jersey or in California, and therefore, it’s a great question as to where that cyberattack is coming from. Do we have adequate authorities and lines of authority and definitions to deal with a foreign cyberattack that comes through U.S. infrastructure?”“So, I think that we’re making much better progress in being able to address some of those authority gaps. You’ve identified one of the areas that were certainly relevant in the solar wind’s most recent supply chain attack when our adversaries had positioned themselves within the United States, and we found that there was a blind spot there. So, again, the breached notification that has been done, the discussion in terms of upping the standards for both national security systems and government systems that the administration have done, I think have all contributed to this,” said General Nakasone. “But you point out a key piece, Senator, which is this is much more difficult than one person being in charge. There is not one agency, one department, or even one entity that has all the information, and so that’s why this coordination is so important.""+++As Co-Chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC), and a member of the Senate’s Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, Senator King is recognized as one of Congress’s leading experts on cyberdefense and is a strong advocates for a forward-thinking cyberstrategy that emphasizes layered cyberdeterrence. Since it officially launched in April 2019, dozens of CSC recommendations have been enacted into law, including the creation of a National Cyber Director. As Russia has continued their unprovoked attack on Ukraine, Senator King has forcefully condemned Russia’s actions, worked to provide Ukraine with urgent lethal and humanitarian aid, and called for maximum economic pressure on Vladimir Putin and his oligarchs.

https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/collins-king-join-bipartisan-effort-to-support-school-meal-flexibilities-extend-free-school-lunches-for-children-in-maine-and-nationwide,"April 05, 2022Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Angus King (I-ME) joined a group of 52 Senators—more than half of the Senate – in introducing the Support Kids Not Red Tape Act. The bill, which was authored by U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), would extend USDA school meal flexibilities from June 30, 2022, to September 30, 2023.  These flexibilities have been crucial to feeding children throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  With 90% of our schools still facing many challenges as they return to normal operations, these flexibilities give our schools and summer meal programs much-needed support to deal with ongoing food service issues and keep kids fed.  The bill would also help schools transition back to normal meal operations under the National School Lunch Program.“The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of school meals for tens of thousands of Maine families.  In our state and across the country, schools have done a tremendous job working to support the nutritional needs of students despite the challenges of the pandemic, helping to alleviate hunger and allowing students to focus on their studies,” said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement.  “As we emerge from this public health crisis, it is crucial that children are able to continue enjoying nutritious meals not only during the school year, but in all regions of Maine during the summer as well.  In addition to supporting students and families, many schools in Maine and across the country are short staffed and struggling to manage the added burden of supply chain disruptions. This bill would give our nation’s schools and other meal programs the flexibility they need to continue to serve all students.”Anti-hunger and nutrition advocates reiterated the importance of these flexibilities and applauded the Senators’ bill to keep critical flexibilities for school nutrition programs to feed children.“We thank Senators Collins and King for championing the Support Kids Not Red Tape Act so that all Maine children have consistent access to the healthy meals,” said Maine Education Commissioner Pender Makin.  “Extending pandemic-related child nutrition waivers through the 2022-23 school year will ensure that children are well fed wherever they are learning, eliminate complicated paperwork, and support schools working to provide nutritious food to students in the face of higher costs and shortages of menu items, supplies, and staff.  This legislation also builds on the work by Governor Mills to provide free school meals for all children in Maine. Our school staff are doing everything they can to support children’s learning and wellbeing and providing children with these meals is essential to that effort.”“We are so grateful to Senator Collins and Senator King for supporting this important bill,” said Justin Strasburger, Executive Director, Full Plates Full Potential, which is based in Brunswick.  “Without an extension of the critical child nutrition waivers that have expanded food access for kids throughout the pandemic, Maine kids could lose access to as many as 400,000 meals this summer.  While the peaks of the pandemic are hopefully behind us, child nutrition programs continue to struggle with rising food costs, staffing shortages, and supply chain disruptions.  Extending these waivers will provide these programs with a much needed bridge year of support and ensure our kids continue to have consistent access to meals.”“The end of the Covid Related School Nutrition Waivers would be a grim and catastrophic turn of events for families still struggling to recover from a global pandemic that continues to loom on the fringes, even as Americans are striving to move back to normalcy,” said Jeanne Reilly, Legislative Co-Chair, Maine School Nutrition Association.  “The Support Kids Not Red Tape Waiver Extension Bill offers direct relief for children and their families, protecting the nutritional well-being of children, while supporting school nutrition programs with transition plans as they move back to normal National School Lunch Program operations after the flexibilities end.  The Maine School Nutrition Association is incredibly grateful to both Senator Collins and Senator King for their continued efforts on behalf of our nation’s children.”A broad spectrum of groups sent in letters to Congress to extend the child nutrition waiver authority, including:In addition to Senators Collins, King, Stabenow, and Murkowski, the legislation was cosponsored by Senators Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Bob Casey (D-PA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Tina Smith (D-MN), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Ed Markey (D-MA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Jack Reed (D-RI), Pat Leahy (D-VT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Mark Warner (D-VA), Patty Murray (D-WA), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Chris Coons (D-DE), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tom Carper (D-DE), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Gary Peters (D-MI), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Chris Murphy (D-CT), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Jon Ossoff (D-GA), Jon Tester (D-MT), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Maria Cantwell (D-WA)."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cyberspace-solarium-co-chairs-urge-president-biden-to-maintain-cyberdeterrence-posture,"April 05, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) and Representative Mike Gallagher (R-Wisc.), Co-Chairs of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC), are urging President Joe Biden to keep a key cyberdeterrent in place after reports that the administration is considering changes to the policy. In a letter to President Biden, King and Gallagher lay out the critical importance of National Security Presidential Memorandum – 13 (NSPM-13), which established an agile workflow allowing the Department of Defense to plan and conduct time-sensitive offensive cyber operations. The pair of lawmakers stress that changes to the policy would undermine the United States’ national security and highlight the essential deterrent NSPM-13 provides against adversaries like Russia.“As the Co-Chairmen of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, we are very concerned by press reporting that your Administration may be considering changes to the governing policy document, National Security Presidential Memorandum – 13, with an intent to limit the Secretary of Defense’s freedom of action to plan and conduct offensive cyber operations,” said CSC Co-Chairs Senator King and Congressman Gallagher. “Any effort to alter and possibly weaken NSPM-13 signals to our adversaries a lack of credible willingness to use offensive cyber capabilities which undermines the credibility of our deterrent,” the CSC Co-Chairs concluded. “It is for these reasons we urge in the strongest possible terms that you to not alter the existing processes and policies that allow for an agile, effective planning process for the conduct of offensive cyber operations – the security of our national critical infrastructure may very well depend upon it.”As Co-Chairs of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC), Senator King and Representative Gallagher are recognized as two of Congress’ leading experts on cyberdefense and are strong advocates for a forward-thinking cyberstrategy that emphasizes layered cyberdeterrence. Since it officially launched in April 2019, dozens of CSC recommendations have been enacted into law, including the creation of a National Cyber Director.You can read the full letter HERE and below.+++Dear President Biden:One of the most important improvements in our national cyber capability over the past four years has been the development of effective, timely planning processes for the execution of offensive cyber operations.  As the Co-Chairmen of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, we are very concerned by press reporting that your Administration may be considering changes to the governing policy document, National Security Presidential Memorandum – 13, with an intent to limit the Secretary of Defense’s freedom of action to plan and conduct offensive cyber operations.These improvements in offensive cyber operations were enabled by the passage of the Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which we both drafted and supported.  The law addressed this issue in three areas: it “affirmed the authority of the Secretary of Defense to conduct military activities and operations in cyberspace”, in Section 1632; it established a policy for the use of offensive cyber operations to “deter if possible, and respond to when necessary” adversary cyber operations, in Section 1636; and it provided specific authorities to “conduct active defense” against China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, in Section 1642.  Congress’s intent was clear – the United States needed to be more agile and forward in the conduct of offensive cyber operations.After passage of the NDAA in August 2018, the Trump Administration created NSPM-13, establishing a more agile process for the government to make decisions and gain approvals for offensive and defensive cyber operations. While the process can be utilized by various departments or agencies, it principally allowed for the delegation of well-defined authorities to the Secretary of Defense to conduct time-sensitive military operations in cyberspace.These new policies were then reportedly used with great effect to limit Russian cyber-enabled information operations against the United States election infrastructure in both 2018 and 2020.  They also play an important role in signaling our willingness to use cyber capabilities, a key aspect to an effective national cyber strategy.The Cyberspace Solarium Commission has worked closely with your Administration, and your predecessors, to ensure that we are ready to respond to significant cyber-attacks against our national critical infrastructure and democratic institutions. We have long argued that this requires three lines of effort: building a more resilient and defended cyber infrastructure, establishing an effective public-private collaboration, and ensuring we have a credible, capable deterrent, including offensive cyber capabilities. Any effort to alter and possibly weaken NSPM-13 signals to our adversaries a lack of credible willingness to use offensive cyber capabilities which undermines the credibility of our deterrent. It is for these reasons we urge in the strongest possible terms that you to not alter the existing processes and policies that allow for an agile, effective planning process for the conduct of offensive cyber operations – the security of our national critical infrastructure may very well depend upon it."
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-celebrates-decision-to-keep-maine-veterans-homes-open-in-caribou-and-machias,"April 04, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) applauded a vote by the Maine Veterans’ Homes (MVH) Board of Trustees to keep its Caribou and Machias sites open. The decision comes on the heels of swift bipartisan action from both the Maine Legislature and Governor Janet Mills. Senator King had spoken out against the original decision to close the sites, and joined the full Maine Congressional Delegation in February to urge the board to engage with elected officials to explore options to keep the homes open.“I’m deeply relieved that the leadership of Maine Veterans’ Homes was able to find a solution allowing the continued operation of their Caribou and Machias facilities,” said Senator King. “Maine’s veterans have made immense sacrifices to defend our nation, and they deserve the absolute best care possible. I’m grateful for this decision, and committed to working alongside state leaders and the veterans community to ensure the long-term success of these sites.” The Maine Congressional Delegation has shown continued support for Maine veterans and Maine Veterans’ Homes. Most recently, this support has included securing emergency COVID-19 funding for MVH from the CARES Act and working to pass the bipartisan State Veterans Homes Domiciliary Care Flexibility Act, which would allow more veterans, particularly those with early onset dementia, to receive affordable residential care at veterans homes across the country, including in Maine. "
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/with-putin-continuing-attacks-on-ukraine-king-cosponsors-bill-to-curb-loopholes-with-cryptocurrency,"April 04, 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – As the unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine continues, U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) is cosponsoring legislation to limit the ability of Vladimir Putin and Russian oligarchs to evade economic sanctions by using digital assets such as cryptocurrencies. The Digital Asset Sanctions Compliance Enhancement Act would prohibit any Russian digital assets from being traded in U.S. jurisdictions, enact new cryptocurrency transparency requirements, and give the Biden administration additional powers to go after Russian digital assets. The bill comes amid widespread warnings that Russian actors may try to evade economic sanctions by using digital currencies. The legislation continues Senator King’s ongoing efforts to constrain Putin’s access to fund his brutal war; he recently introduced the bipartisan Stop Russian GOLD Act to target Russia’s large gold reserves, and helped push the Biden administration to strengthen similar sanctions.“As the united sanctions of America and our allies devastate Russia’s economy, we must ensure that Putin cannot exploit any financial loopholes to escape the consequences of his crimes,” said Senator King. “If we don’t take action, digital assets and cryptocurrencies could provide Putin and his oligarchs the exact lifeline they’re looking for – and extend this attack longer. The Digital Asset Sanctions Compliance Enhancement Act would crack down on Russia’s ability to digitally launder their assets, create much needed transparency, and ensure Russia feels the weight of their heinous attacks on a sovereign neighbor.”The Digital Asset Sanctions Compliance Enhancement Act would combat the risk of Russian actors from using digital assets to evade international sanctions by discouraging foreign crypto firms from doing business with sanctioned Russian elites, providing the Administration with authority to suspend transactions with Russia-linked crypto addresses, and increasing transparency around crypto holdings. Specifically, the Digital Asset Sanctions Compliance Enhancement Act would close potential avenues for evasion of sanctions against Russia by: As a member of the Senate’s Intelligence Committee, Armed Services Committee, and Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator King has forcefully condemned Russia’s attacks on Ukrainian sovereignty and called for maximum economic pressure on Vladimir Putin and his oligarchs. Senator King recently introduced the Stop Russian GOLD Act to target Russia’s large gold reserves, and helped push the Biden administration to strengthen similar sanctions. Last month, King joined a bipartisan Congressional delegation to Poland and Germany where he met with NATO leaders, Ukrainian refugees, and U.S. servicemembers for a first-hand look at the humanitarian crisis and America’s efforts to support Ukrainians.  Senator King recently cosponsored a resolution condemning Russia’s unprovoked invasion and calling for an investigation into war crimes, supported almost $14 billion in aid for Ukraine, has advocated for new sanctions against Putin, and called for maximum intelligence sharing with Ukrainian officials. "
https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/collins-king-announce-more-than-31-million-for-maine-weatherization-projects,"April 01, 2022Washington, D.C.—U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Angus King (I-ME) announced that Maine will receive a total of $31,245,144 to help low-income Maine families make energy-efficient improvements and lower their heating and electric bills. This funding was authorized under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and provided through the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) – the Department of Energy’s largest residential energy retrofit program.  Senator Collins was part of the core group of 10 Senators who negotiated the text of the bipartisan infrastructure law. Projects supported by WAP include installing insulation, updating heating and cooling systems, upgrading electrical appliances, and taking other common-sense actions that make homes warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer with less energy usage.  “The Weatherization Assistance Program is a proven, cost-effective way to permanently reduce energy usage and cut low-income Americans’ utility bills for the long-term.  Energy efficiency projects also protect the environment, increase energy independence, and create jobs,” said Senator Collins.  “I have long championed funding for this successful program, and the increased investments provided through the bipartisan infrastructure law will help more Americans make improvements that will allow them to affordably heat their homes.”“Weatherization is an efficient way to reduce heating costs, fight climate change, and help Maine people stay warm during the winter,” said Senator King. “For years, the Weatherization Assistance Program has helped low-income Maine homeowners make these important upgrades, and I’m glad to see the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill making significant investments in the program. This funding will help low-income Maine homeowners cut their energy bills, while also creating important jobs in communities across our state.”“This historic support for weatherization from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law comes at a critical time, as global markets increase energy prices. Every dollar invested in energy efficiency helps Maine families save money and reduces our dependence on volatile fossil fuels like oil and natural gas,” said Dan Burgess, director of the Governor’s Energy Office. “We look forward to working with the U.S. Department of Energy, our Federal delegation, and MaineHousing to help lower energy costs for Maine people.”   “We’re grateful for the opportunity to access this funding,” MaineHousing Director Daniel Brennan said.  “It comes at a critical time of rising energy costs and the resulting strain on household finances.  We will work closely with our state partners and those in the energy industry to put these funds to good use, furthering our climate goals and easing the energy burden for Mainers.” Since 1976, WAP has served over seven million households and delivered an average of $372 in annual energy savings for American families. The bipartisan infrastructure law increased funding for WAP to ten times current funding levels, which will expand weatherization services to more homes and create more jobs."
