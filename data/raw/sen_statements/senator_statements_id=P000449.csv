https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/portman-difference/pbs-newshour-portman-discusses-senate-support-respect-marriage-act,"Senator Portman joined PBS’ NewsHour today to discuss his support for the Respect for Marriage Act, the president’s failed border policies, and Ukraine’s recent successes in fighting back against Russia’s aggression. Excerpts of the interview can be found below and you can also watch the interview here. SENATOR PORTMAN ON THE RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT “There was a concern from a number of people about its impact on religious liberty. That if we were to try to codify the Supreme Court case that it would have consequences that were unintended perhaps, but that would affect people’s religious liberty. So we spent the last few weeks, as you know, working with language, we were trading language as recently as late this morning. I think we will get there, but we needed a little more time to be able to let people properly vet that language and determine how we could codify the Supreme Court which is the law of the land. But in doing so, not affect the religious liberties of say religious groups that are engaged in things like adoption or health care or education. I think we are on the way to getting to a solution.”…“Well, I think some Republicans saw this as a political ploy on behalf of the Democrats, in particular Senator Schumer, because it was being pushed on us, in terms of the voting, just before we went away for the elections. The notion there was whether it won or lost, some Democrats might see an advantage to that. I have to give credit to Tammy Baldwin, who is a Democratic Senator from Wisconsin, and Kyrsten Sinema, Democrat from Arizona, who worked with us and ensured that this would not be a political decision. That’s why I think in the end, we were able to postpone it until we have time to vet this language and for people to feel comfortable. At that point, I think people won’t see it as a political thing. I think right now, a lot of Republicans do consider it to be more political if you are sort of forcing a vote just before we go home for the elections, which would have been the case if we had not had the language prepared by today and signed off on by everyone needed, we would not have had time to do it before the end of the month. Because it takes that long to process legislation, as you know Lisa, through the world's most deliberative body. So, I think we made the right decision and I think when we come back the election will be behind us, the politics will be taken out of it, and I think we will get the votes Its the right thing to do.”SENATOR PORTMAN ON FEDERAL ABORTION LEGISLATION AND ITS POSSIBLE EFFECT AT THE POLLS“I think it will cut both ways, honestly. It depends on the state or the congressional district, but I think that most Americans when you look at the polling data, in fact the the research arm of Planned Parenthood says that 72 percent of Americans would support a 15 week bill, which had exceptions. Which apparently this legislation does, I haven’t looked at it closely. It is a 15 week bill, it has the exceptions and that’s where most people are. I think it just depends on the state and the congressional district and how individual candidates deal with it.”SENATOR PORTMAN ON BORDER SECURITY AND IMMIGRATION “I do think it's good to raise awareness about it. I don't know that this is the most effective way, but it’s one. My understanding is no migrant gets on a bus without being asked if they would like to come. It is voluntary so it’s not like people are required to do it. People come to the border, again they are seeking asylum, they are told this bus is going to Boston or New York or Chicago, as I understand it. They get on the bus and they get a free ride to that location. Apparently that is something that a lot of migrants are interested in doing. So, I think it is something that will probably raise some awareness and but it also does provide the transportation for these individuals. They want to go to places where they might have family members and or think they can get a job. It is a reflection of the broken border system that there are so many thousands of people every day crossing the border. Again, we are looking at huge numbers that we haven’t ever seen before in terms of the ultimate number over one million people just during this administration that have come in this way through the asylum process. Almost none of whom have had a hearing or are subject to any court proceedings yet because that will be several years down the pike because there are so many people in the backlog right now. The system is just not working.”SENATOR PORTMAN ON UKRAINE’S RECENT SUCCESSFUL COUNTEROFFENSE “I feel really strongly about this, as you know. I am the co-chair and co-founder of the Ukraine Caucus because I have a lot of Ukrainian Americans in Ohio and I’ve been to Ukraine a number of times, probably seven or eight times just since 2014. I was just there a couple weeks ago. This is our fight in addition to their fight. They are not asking for troops on the ground and we are not providing them. But we are providing them is the ability to defend themselves against this Russian invasion, which is brutal, illegal, and unprovoked. The results of which are terribly tragic. I’m really encouraged by what I have seen over the last few weeks, Lisa, which is the weapon systems and the ammunition that we have provided for Ukraine is now working to turn the tables and they are actually making progress, over 3,000 square miles were liberated just in the last few weeks by the Ukrainians. This is not the time for us to pull back. It’s a time for us to continue providing support, along with many other countries. You know there are 49 other countries that are providing military support to Ukraine, it’s not just us. But we are the leaders and we need to continue to lead the free world in this fight because it is a shield for freedom. Not just for Ukraine, but certainly for Eastern Europe, Europe as whole and really for the entire world. Because otherwise, our adversaries and our allies are going to look at this and say, ‘Well an authoritarian regime can simply waltz in and take over another country.’ In this case, a democracy and an ally and that will establish a precedent that will make the world much more dangerous and volatile and cost us a lot more over time.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/portman-difference/bloomberg-tv-portman-discusses-ukraine-inflation-chinas-access-us-data,"Senator Portman joined Bloomberg TV’s Balance of Power today to discuss a range of topics, including his bipartisan congressional delegation to Ukraine and Ukraine’s recent successes in fighting back against Russia’s aggression, Tik Tok’s refusal to commit to cutting off China’s ability to access American user data through their app at yesterday’s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, raging inflation and its effects on the U.S. economy, and the lack of vetting of Afghan evacuees from last year’s disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal.Excerpts of the interview can be found below and you can also watch the interview here.  PORTMAN ON HIS BIPARTISAN TRIP TO UKRAINE & CHINA’S SUPPORT FOR RUSSIA“Well the meeting doesn’t surprise me, they’ve been meeting somewhat regularly and they have exercises together which were planned, by the way, before Ukraine apparently. But this attack on Ukraine is not going well. I was in Kyiv as you know, the capitol of Ukraine, a couple of weeks ago with one of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle on a bipartisan congressional delegation to get more information and to let the Ukrainians know how strongly we support what they’re doing, which is really providing a shield of freedom for the rest of the world. But in the last three weeks we believe that the Ukrainians have liberated approximately 3,000 square miles and really routed the Russian troops that were there. They did it because they have the morale and they have the resilience and the strength, thanks to the U.S. and other countries providing them better equipment. I think it’s a very bad news story for Vladimir Putin and it’s a great news story for freedom-loving people all over the world. “It means we cannot stop the support. This is not the time to pull back. They do need more ammunition for some of the weapons they’ve already been provided. You also have to recall that there are 49 other countries providing military help to Ukraine, it’s not just us. We are taking the lead. And America, by showing leadership, I think has encouraged others to be involved. With regard to China, I agree with you. I think it’s very difficult to imagine that China would want to be associated with Russia right now. Not just because they are not winning on the battlefield, but because they have become international pariahs. If you look at what’s happening in the United Nations, if you look at what’s happening in non-aligned nations all around the world, including the Swiss, Sweden, Finland, and other countries who are helping Ukraine in various ways. I mean this is extraordinary. In fact with regard to the Swedes and the Finns of course, who are now joining NATO, which is exactly the opposite of what Vladimir Putin hoped would happen and so if I were China I would think this is not an association you would want to have.”PORTMAN ON NATIONAL SECURITY THREATS FROM CHINA“Well in my experience, and we have been looking into these issues for years now, David as you know, and I’ve done extensive investigations on a bipartisan basis through the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations here in the Congress and we have actually passed legislation to try to protect our own information here in the United States. But it is our sense that because companies like Tik Tok continue to have a presence in China, continue to provide access to Chinese nationals for information, including with regard to Tik Tok as you know, information about our kids since about half of their numbers are people who are under the age of 16. So this is an amazing, I think, situation where they won’t agree to simply cut off the data to China. Why are they providing this data? Why is that necessary, and you know, other companies have been able to do it. I would hope that all of our platforms would be cognizant of the real risks involved.”PORTMAN ON RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT“We are working on it. We will see what happens. If the votes do not materialize here in the next few days then I suspect this issue will be put off until after the election. But my hope is we will have the votes. What we are doing is two things. One is simply codifying what the Supreme Court has already done, but second, it actually adds additional religious liberty protections that are not currently in law, so this is actually a victory for those who are concerned about religious liberty, as I am, as many are. But it also does affirm that the Court has made a decision and simply again, codifies the fact that one state would have to respect another state’s valid marriage. The Obergefell decision, which is the Supreme Court precedent, goes even further than that and mandates the states to allow for gay marriage. That is not part of our legislation. So the legislation one is, actually less than the Supreme Court and therefore current law decision, and second, it adds additional religious liberty protections. So my hope is that we will be able to get this passed in the Senate and be able, as a country, not just to rely on the courts to decide these issues – these are tough issues – but to actually have the elected representatives, in this case the U.S. Congress, weigh in.”PORTMAN ON LACK OF VETTING OF AFGHAN EVACUEES“Well, we never properly vetted the Afghan evacuees who came to the United States. This is now something that the Inspector General at the Department of Homeland Security has weighed in on and said, you know, it was inadequate what was done in terms of screening people, vetting people. So it’s too bad. If you remember we had this hectic withdrawal from Afghanistan and loaded a lot of people on airplanes and took them to so-called ‘lily pads’ and then to the United States. Some of those people were translators and others who had helped the United States government. In my view those individuals ought to be a on pathway to citizenship. They stood by our troops, and in many cases risked their lives for us. But there are many others who were not connected that way, in no apparent way, people were not properly vetted. That makes no sense from a national security point of view. The FBI has told us that they think there are a few dozen people, maybe more, who could pose a national security threat who are part of that group. So let’s do the vetting, let’s be sure that these people are properly screened, to be sure they are not providing a national security threat to us and then going forward, let’s look at what the status ought to be.”PORTMAN ON INFLATION“You put your finger on it, David. Our issue is that here in the Congress, and in the administration, two things have happened. One is tremendous new spending, unprecedented amount of spending for so-called stimulus. And that stimulus spending, which really came out of the $1.9 trillion dollar bill that was passed a year ago – in March, caused a lot of the increased demand that caused this inflation we are seeing. But also, along with that, of course we had constricted supply already because of COVID and that was exacerbated by other decisions the administration made on regulations, particularly with regard to energy, which is in pretty much every product – some component of energy. So to say we are going to stifle fossil fuels and to discourage the development of fossil fuels reduced the supply side as well. So obviously what we need to do is stop the stimulus spending, stop the spending that we just did again, frankly, we just did it a few weeks ago here in Congress through the very poorly name Inflation Reduction Act, which is actually going to increase inflation short term based on the economic analysis. But second, we need to open up these supply chains, including the energy supply chains and by doing so through regulatory relief, through smart polices, we will be able to get this under control. But it hasn’t happened yet. The 8.3 percent we saw earlier this week from last month is very concerning and when you look at it since the Biden administration has come into office its 13.2 percent. The way I look at it is you had a dollar in your pocket in January of 2021, its now worth 88 cents. And that’s how people are feeling. They feel like they’ve been shortchanged. They feel like their retirement plans are being hurt. Again, the markets now down today. So we have got to turn this around and its by doing pro-growth polices, regulatory relief, smart tax reforms. Doing things that actually encourage more supply and less stimulus.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-colleagues-statement-respect-marriage-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Susan Collins (R-ME), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), and Thom Tillis (R-NC) released the following statement:

“The Respect for Marriage Act is a simple but important step which provides certainty to millions of Americans in loving marriages. Through bipartisan collaboration, we’ve crafted commonsense language that respects religious liberty and Americans’ diverse beliefs, while upholding our view that marriage embodies the highest ideals of love, devotion, and family. We’ve asked Leader Schumer for additional time and we appreciate he has agreed. We are confident that when our legislation comes to the Senate floor for a vote, we will have the bipartisan support to pass the bill.”###

I call on the Senate to pass it as soon as possible.”Senator Portman traveled to Taiwan in April as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation to meet with senior Taiwanese officials. While there, the delegation discussed the importance of Taiwan being included in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which would signal our support for Taiwan and its sovereignty.###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-applauds-inclusion-global-engagement-center-provision-state,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH), senior member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Wednesday applauded the inclusion of his legislation to reauthorize the Global Engagement Center (GEC) in the State Department Authorization Act of 2022 for another three years so that the GEC can continue to execute its vital mission of countering foreign propaganda and disinformation. Without this extension, the GEC would have been dissolved in two years. Portman’s legislation would also extend the GEC’s special hiring authority for an additional five years so that the agency can bring together the talented team it needs to accomplish its mission. “State-sponsored disinformation is a threat to democratic societies throughout the world. As we have seen mostly recently with Russian aggression in Ukraine, these tactics are inexpensive, easily deniable and can be devastatingly effective if left unchecked,” said Portman. “The importance of the Global Engagement Center cannot be understated as it coordinates the United States Government’s interagency efforts to combat disinformation abroad. Time and time again, it has demonstrated its effectiveness in assisting our allies as they push back against disinformation efforts from countries like China and Russia. This provision to not only extend the sunset clause, but also to extend the special hiring authority, is vital to enable the GEC’s work to continue to effectively combat disinformation and propaganda. I applaud the inclusion of my legislation in this year’s State Department Authorization Act of 2022, and I thank Chairman Menendez and Ranking Member Risch for working with me to include it in this bill.”Portman, along with U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) introduced the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act, which was signed into law in December 2016. The law improved the ability of the United States to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation by establishing the GEC, which is charged with leading the U.S. government’s efforts to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation. The Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act authorized the State Department to request $60 million annually for two years from the Department of Defense for the GEC to help counter foreign propaganda and disinformation being waged against the United States and our allies by state and non-state adversaries.###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/portman-difference/fox-business-portman-discusses-ukraine-counteroffensives-underscores,"Senator Portman joined FOX Business’ Cavuto: Coast to Coast this afternoon to discuss the progress Ukraine is making in its counteroffensives against Russian forces with the help of the United States military aid. Portman noted his recent bipartisan delegation to Ukraine where he saw a firsthand account of Russia’s illegal, unprovoked and brutal war on Ukraine. Portman spoke on the dangers of using energy as a weapon of war in Zaporizhzhia, home of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. He also unscored the importance of assisting Ukraine’s economy in its dire time of need. A transcript of the interview can be found below and you can also watch the interview here. PORTMAN ON HIS BIPARTISAN TRIP TO UKRAINE“Well first, you're absolutely right. I was in Kyiv, as you know two weeks ago with Senator Klobuchar, a bipartisan delegation, and we met with President Zelenskyy and his military folks and we actually toured some of these sites around Kyiv that have been destroyed. This is great news. We were there. The counteroffensive started in the south and has moved over to the northeast. And it has been incredibly successful. And the exciting thing for me is that the American taxpayers were willing to provide Ukraine, which is the kind of equipment they have been asking for, for a long time. Finally, the Biden administration provided it, is making a difference. Particularly these so-called HIMARS, which are these weapons systems that can shoot artillery a longer distance and very accurately. That has changed the battlefield dynamics significantly. Because before that remember when we talked the Russians were firing on Ukrainian positions with impunity because the Ukrainians couldn’t reach them. That has all changed now and that’s because frankly the United States of America, and our willingness to support them with equipment that they have been asking for. The U.K. and Germany has also provided some of that. But Neil, I’m really pleased to see that one, they're winning and liberating lands that the Russians unlawfully took and have brutally attacked the citizens of those areas, like around Kharkiv. But second, that what we did as a Congress and as a country, and what the American people have done is making a difference.”PORTMAN ON THE NEED TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE AID TO UKRAINE“Yeah. There are 49 other countries now that provided military assistance to Ukraine. And again some of them have provided very important equipment like the U.K. I mentioned, and Germany providing these long-range missiles. But we have done more than others and we have been in a leadership position. I don't think it is nearly 90 percent when you add up everything because others have provided various other kinds of equipment including ammunition. Particularly some of the Soviet-era stuff that we frankly don't have but the countries in eastern Europe have in terms of ammunition and even some of the anti-aircraft systems as an example. But we are taking the lead. But to me, that is America's role, you know we have traditionally been taking the lead to liberate people, going back to our history, storied history of World War I, World War II. And we have frankly kind of gotten away from that. We had put a lot of U.S. troops in harm's way in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. Here that is not what we're doing. They're not asking our troops on the ground, nor are we providing them but we are providing leadership rallying the rest of the free world behind this cause. That is what Ukraine feels. That is one reason they think they have the momentum right now.”PORTMAN ON PUTIN’S ATTACKS ON NUCLEAR PLANTS
“I would just say two things, Neil. One it’s already scary because around Zaporizhzhia, which is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe as you know they have effectively put a military base and they're using it as a shield, and they're actually imploding infrastructure right next to the plant to take electricity into Ukraine because they're trying to steal electricity to take it into Crimea and to Russia. So it was already incredibly reckless, and risking a catastrophe. But you're right. He is pushing back by firing more missiles which he has been doing. One thing that I think is really important is that we help the Ukrainian economy get back on its feet. And to do that we have to help provide them with better anti-aircraft and anti-missile technology because that will bring people back to Ukraine. Remember there are six or seven million people who  are out of the country, six or seven million internally displaced. So until we can get people back and get the economy on more sound footing, it is tough for their economy and their budget. So that’s part of why I think we need to continue what we're doing on the military side, and provide even more air cover, so that Ukraine can pull itself by its own bootstraps which it wants to do to get the economy moving again.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-cardin-introduce-resolution-approve-location-national-memorial,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Ben Cardin (D-MD) have introduced a Senate joint resolution that would authorize placement of the National Memorial to Fallen Journalists between the Voice of America building and the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian. President Trump signed into law a previous measure authorizing the establishment of the memorial, which will honor journalists, photographers, and broadcasters killed in the line of duty. The joint resolution on the specific location comes one week after the murder of Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German, who allegedly was killed by the subject of one of his investigations. “A free and open press is essential to our democracy, and I’m pleased to join Senator Cardin in introducing this permanent resolution to authorize placement of the National Memorial to Fallen Journalists,” said Senator Portman. “This memorial will serve as a fitting tribute to the men and women in journalism who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in the defense of the First Amendment.”“The National Memorial to Fallen Journalists will honor the lives of those who died reporting the news and supporting the media on behalf of the American people. Just last week, Jeff German was killed for doing his job and reporting the news wherever it led. He is the latest reporter to be a victim,” said Senator Cardin. “Transparency and unbiased journalism are essential in a democracy and this new memorial will be a steadfast symbol of the sacrifice of those who take on this responsibility. The men and women who personify the First Amendment rights granted to every citizen have made our nation stronger.”The resolution approves a location for a commemorative work honoring fallen journalists that will maintain the “commitment of the United States to a free press by honoring the journalists who sacrificed their lives in service to that cause.” The memorial will be located on federal lands in “Area I” as determined by the Secretary of the Interior. Funding for the National Park Service or General Services Administration to construct and maintain the memorial will be provided by the Fallen Journalists Memorial (FJM) Foundation.###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-floor-portman-highlights-successful-ukrainian-counteroffensive,"WASHINGTON, DC – This evening, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH), alongside Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), delivered remarks on the Senate floor in support of Ukraine for the 22nd consecutive week while the Senate has been in session. Portman and Klobuchar discussed their recent bipartisan congressional delegation trip to Ukraine and noted the progress Ukraine is making in its ongoing counteroffensives against Russian forces in Kharkiv and Kherson Oblasts. Senator Portman discussed how military aid from the United States, including High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, has turned the tide on the battlefield for Ukraine, and how it has enabled the Ukrainian counteroffensives, liberating cities and saving Ukraine’s citizens form Russian domination.As co-chair and co-founder of the Senate Ukraine Caucus and member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Portman urged his colleagues to support the administration’s new request for aid to Ukraine. Alongside dozens of other freedom-loving countries that are supporting our ally, Senator Portman will continue to push for support for Ukraine and her brave patriots fighting for freedom. A transcript of his remarks can be found below and a video can be found here. “Mr. President, thank you and I thank my colleague from Minnesota who just talked about our recent visit to Ukraine where we were able to meet with President Zelenskyy and his top officials and see first-hand what you can see on TV, but frankly, the emotion and just the incredible courage of the Ukrainian people. When you see it in person, it is much more powerful. “Including going to an airport right outside of Kyiv where a bunch of inexperienced National Guard troops were able to fight off a larger and very seasoned group of Russian and Chechen special operators who landed at that airport. This was back on February 24th.“You may remember seeing this on television. I remember watching CNN and seeing these troops landing, these Russian troops, one after another. Twenty-five helicopters came in and they were going to use that as a staging area, as you said so well, to not just take Kyiv but take the entire country and topple the government. “This small band of National Guard troops fighting for their family, fighting for their homeland and fighting for freedom, as they told us, were able to instead defeat this group of highly trained Chechen and Russian special operators and turn the tide. And within three days they had routed them and thanks to their bravery and courage, they were not able to use that staging area to then go into the city of Kyiv, which is only about 30 minutes away, and be able to topple that government. “I remember we asked the commander who we saw there, who was the commander that night when these helicopters arrived, ‘How did you do it? Like, how could this have been possible? That you could fight off these more experienced troops and the world's third biggest army?’ And his response was, ‘Because I was fighting for my family.’ Remember that? It's what we saw constantly. “And Senator Klobuchar was always good about ensuring that the people of Ukraine knew that we were standing with them and that we understood the challenge that they face and the fact that this is not just a fight for freedom in Ukraine, but a fight for freedom that affects all of us are around the world. They are the shield, really, of freedom, certainly for Europe and for so much of the rest of the world. “So, I appreciate your going again with me on the trip. We took the last congressional delegation before the invasion and now the first authorized one, I guess, after. There is so much that we were able to learn when we were there because it was a time when the U.N. inspectors were coming in to Zaporizhzhia, the biggest power plant in Europe that Senator Klobuchar just talked about. “Thank goodness they were able to get to the plant, inspect the plant and make changes from keeping the plant from leaking radioactive material that has the potential to be another Chernobyl and also make a very declarative statement that you must demilitarize that zone, which the Russians still have not done. In fact, they have done just the opposite. They used that plant as effectively a military base by having their military there and using the plant as a shield to fire on Ukrainian positions. “They’ve also destroyed infrastructure going into Ukraine from that plant which is very dangerous but used explosives to do so to try to cut off electricity going into Ukraine because they would like to take that electricity and instead direct it to Russia and Crimea. These are dangerous, dangerous games. “We've seen them play politics with food, destroying bins of grain all along the southern coast of Ukraine, stopping the ships from going out. Finally now because of the U.N. and Turkey negotiations, some ships are going out. But they’ve used food as a weapon. They have certainly used energy as a weapon. They continue to do so every day, as they’re doing in Europe as they cut off even Nord Stream I pipeline to Europe, insisting the Europeans give up on their sanctions. Which need to be tightened if anything. “And now they are actually using a nuclear power plant as a weapon of war. Not just incredibly irresponsible, but dangerously reckless and risking a catastrophe. So, again, I appreciate Senator Klobuchar coming with me. I appreciate her leadership on this issue. We’ve tried to keep this issue totally nonpartisan, not just bipartisan. “And the members of the Ukraine Caucus, including Senator Klobuchar and myself continue to meet regularly and get updates as to what's going on in Ukraine and ensure that we are doing our part here as a leader of freedom-loving countries all over the world. As she said there are many other countries participating. In fact, there were 50 countries at the recent conference on providing defensive military assistance to Ukraine. “At least 42 countries have provided serious weapons like these longer-range artillery weapons that are so essential to Ukraine's success. So this is not just America alone, but America has a unique leadership role to play here and that's what we have seen so far. And as we've come upon another vote here in the United States Senate and the House over the next couple of weeks, we've got to ensure we continue to take that leadership role. “I have come to the floor every week for the past 21 weeks, this is the 22nd week, while we've been in session, since the invasion began and the focus has been often about kind of grim news about what Russia is doing. The murders, the rapes, the fact that they are constantly bombing civilian targets, not just apartment buildings but hospitals, and schools, it's a grim story and it's a sobering experience to see this as we did in Irpin and in Bucha. To see the ditch Russians dug to be able to dump the bodies that have been tortured and murdered. “Today I'm fortunately able to talk about some much more positive news, which is that at a time of all of these tragic circumstances the Ukrainians are now making great progress in pushing back this Russian assault. So, we were here in the Kyiv area. This is where we saw some of the results of what the Russian troops had done, the atrocities and the war crimes they had committed, and Bucha, this is where the airport is we talked about. “Remember, at one point Russians all were in this area. They were pushed out and went down to this area called the Donbas and the Russians had been making progress down here frankly. In Donetsk and Luhansk and even in southern Ukraine here. Taking Kherson. This is one of the key and first cities that Russia took. Here is Odesa and here are the ports. So, that's where we were until a couple of weeks ago. But a few weeks have made a big difference and just three days before we arrived in Kyiv, there was a counteroffensive that began. And that counteroffensive was here in the south. “So, going here toward Kherson as it’s called, here and trying to liberate some of these areas that the Russians had invaded. This is what they invaded initially back in 2014 and this is what they invaded more recently. This Russian war has been going on for eight and a half years. The good news is that this counteroffensive has been making progress and that progress has been not just here in the south but also here up in the northeast. “In fact, in many respects, I think what happened is Russia moved some of its troops down to the south knowing this counteroffensive was beginning, and in a surprise move that is really astonishing, the Ukrainian troops have made progress now in this area, here in the northeastern part of Ukraine. This map will show you a little more detail about what's happening up north in Kharkiv. “I show you this in part to show progress, but specifically to show and demonstrate to my colleagues what we provided in military assistance to Ukraine is working. And particularly they have been asking for some time for these weapons called HIMARS which are rocket systems that allow for longer range and more accurate use of artillery. Prior to that the Russians were sitting back and firing on Ukrainian positions, destroying towns. Again, a lot of civilian targets, and doing so with impunity because the artillery from Ukraine could not reach them. “We now know from public sources there are at least 16 of these batteries in the area and also a few from Germany and the U.K. And they have made a tremendous difference. That is something again that is in public reporting and we also heard quite a bit about this from the Defense Secretary and their team. “So, here is where we are today. Remember, all of this was red on the larger map. Now, after only a few weeks and really just a couple of weeks after this offensive, you see the great progress that has been made. A number of these cities that have been taken back are areas where there is a tremendous advantage to the Ukrainians. Because this city, for example, is a rail hub that was being used to supply the Russian troops that are in this part of the Donbas, called Luhansk. Now, look at that amount of blue. “That's all where the Ukrainians have made progress. In fact, they pushed the Russians back to the Belarus border or to the Russian border. So, this is very positive news and again the reason for it, the reason that Kharkiv Oblast is now free is because of the work of 42 countries around the world who have supplied them the necessary equipment, the necessary ammo to be able to succeed. And because of the courage and bravery, most importantly, of the Ukrainian fighters. “Again, think back to that commander at the small airport in Kyiv who said we are fighting for our families, for our homeland, and our freedom. That gives them a distinct advantage in my view. Let there be no doubt what happened here in this northeastern part of Ukraine was a collapse of demoralized Russian forces who fled, often leaving behind Russian armored vehicles, personnel carriers, tanks. You have seen some of that, perhaps, on the news coverage and on the other side where Ukrainians show courage, tenacity, and determination. “The Ukrainians not only outsmarted the Russians, but were braver and charge into the breach to liberate, by the way, thousands, if not millions from Russian domination. People came out of their homes, by the way, to embrace these Ukrainian and thank them. People who had been hiding in their homes, people who had been living under these terrible conditions and suffering from some of these terrible atrocities from the Russian troops. There was a great photo that I saw I wanted to show you which is of a bus stop in the Kharkiv Oblast region. This was a bus stop that had been defaced by the Russian soldiers, including putting the Russian flag on it and other graffiti. “And here are some Ukrainians repainting this bus stop with, of course, the colors of Ukraine, yellow and blue. Yellow standing for the sunflower fields that were at one time were all over the country of Ukraine, and unfortunately because of the war, that production will be down about 50 percent this year. But it’s a beautiful sight to see those sunflower fields, which I have seen throughout Ukraine. And then second, of course, the blue for the beautiful blue sky. This is a photograph of people celebrating.“I think there's another one there too. And people celebrating not just the fact that they can reclaim their homes, but celebrating the fact that their country is being liberated, that they can once again call themselves proud Ukrainians and stand tall. This is what is happening. Sometimes the events of the day make it difficult to follow what is going on in Ukraine. “Remember, it was on the front pages and top of the news for weeks, and then more recently we have gotten distracted with other issues, but it's time for us to refocus on Ukraine and ensure that we are helping them to continue to make progress. Ukraine has the will, the bravery, and the military competence to win. We've now seen that. What they need are the weapons to be able to defend themselves and the equipment that we and other nations of the world can provide for them. “The economic aid package that passed here in the Senate back in May included this funding they needed, again funding for the HIMARS as an example. It took longer than many of us wanted for the administration to provide those weapons, but they did provide them and again we’ve seen was is happening. Recently the administration, just this week, is making another request, a supplemental request for additional funding. This time it is $13.7 billion in Ukraine related funding, $7.2 billion in military assistance, of two different kinds, and $4.5 billion in budget support. “This is a country whose economy has been reduced to shambles thanks to the Russian invasion. Their economy is down about 40 percent to 50 percent. Until they can have more peace in that country and people can come back, they need budget support, as well as military support just to be able to pay salaries, for instance, for first responders and teachers. “I was pleased that Secretary of State Blinken also made a recent surprise visit to Kyiv right after our visit to let Ukraine know that the Biden administration and this country stands with them. He told the leaders, the administration will continue to provide long-term support to Ukraine and to 18 other countries who are at risk of an invasion in the eastern European area. That funding that he promised was from existing appropriations. The new money, the $13.5 billion is a new package. “This is a lot of money. It is important that Congress continue to strongly support Ukraine, particularly during this incredibly critical period for the country's future. This is a fight, again, not just about Ukraine, but it’s a fight about global freedom. If we are not there to help Ukraine and if Ukraine were to lose this fight and Russia were to take Ukraine, the cost we would all pay would be far, far more. We've got to learn the lessons of the past.“Last month, we marked one year since the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan when the Biden administration was rightly criticized for abandoning our allies there. It was a stain on American credibility and it shook the trust of many allies around the world. I can say that having talked to many of them in the aftermath. If we were to abandon Ukraine, especially right after they have demonstrated such spectacular military success, we would be making that mistake all over again. “Many wondered if America could be trusted to watch their backs. Remember Ukraine is a free and democratic country that looks to us, to the United States, as a role model. In 2014, they made a deliberate decision which was to get rid of a Russian-backed corrupt government and instead turn to the West, to Europe, to the United States. To adopt our free market approaches, but also our democratic approaches of free speech, free and fair elections, ensuring that they had transparency and were fighting corruption. “That's the country that we want to hold up as a role model and certainly continue to support them. In 1994, we made a commitment after the Cold War ended, along with, by the way, the U.K. and Russia, that in exchange for them getting rid of their nuclear weapons in Ukraine, that we would stand with them and protect their territorial integrity. Of course, Russia is not making good on that pledge, but the United States of America, another reason for us to stand with our allies who have chosen to stand with us. “To underscore the point that the assistance is appreciated, every time Senator Klobuchar and I were in a meeting, we heard the same thing, whether it was with President Zelenskyy, whether it was with people who were in these small towns like Irpin or Bucha which was thank you, thank you, thank you. A deep appreciation for what we're are doing and thankfulness to the American people. “I will remind everyone that Ukraine has never asked for us to put American boots on the ground. This is not Iraq. This is not Afghanistan. What they have offered for us is an opportunity to protect freedom by providing them with the ability to protect themselves. We can't let Vladimir Putin even begin to think the West is beginning to falter in this mission, especially as this counter-offensive makes more and more progress as the war crosses the 200-day mark.“It is important to note we're not the only ones, again, providing it. Nations around the world have banded together and that's important. They know that if aggression can succeed in Ukraine, it can spread elsewhere, including further Russian encroachments in Europe that Russia has openly talked about. Reclaiming the Russian empire as they say. Increased Chinese aggression throughout Asia, including in the Pacific Ocean and the Solomon Islands is an example of that today. Increased Chinese aggression with regard to Taiwan. “Aggressive moves by Iran exporting terrorism and instability across the Middle East. So, this is about Ukraine, but it's really about a broader issue, and all countries are watching. Our allies and our adversaries. I know there are some out there who say we can't provide indefinite funding to Ukraine with no end in sight. Well, I totally agree. That's not what anybody wants to do or no one expects to do. Everyone agrees that our aid to Ukraine will end at the right point as Ukraine reclaims its rightful territory. The question is just when. We cannot let an arbitrate timeline determine that. We tried that in Afghanistan. It doesn't work. “We have to be guided by the reality on the ground. It's clear that ending our support now would be premature, ill-advised. We've got to step up and this is money well spent in defense of freedom. A Russian victory would be disastrous for U.S. national security, the stability, and volatility of the world. The security of our NATO allies and certainly the security of eastern Europe. We know that Russia would not stop there. Vladimir Putin himself has said, ‘the borders of Russia never end.’ He talked about recreating the Soviet Union, recreating the Russian empire. I would say that the borders of Russia end where freedom begins. Meanwhile, China would see the West surrender in Ukraine as proof of the West’s weakness. It would further embolden them. “A Ukrainian victory would have the opposite effect. It would not only cripple Russia's war machine that President Putin has used to invade Georgia, Ukraine in 2014, Transnistria, Syria, and parts of Africa where they continue to meddle. It would also make Russian military aggression less likely for a long period of time. With President Putin expected to meet with President Xi this week, both men know that the U.S. and their allies stand together against rogue aggression, against sovereign countries. That's very important as a message to send. “Of course with our assistance, we're going to be voting on once again here in this body, there have to be safeguards in place. There have to be guard rails. We have to ensure that military assistance is subject to careful accountability. “When Senator Klobuchar and I were there, we talked to the 101st Airborne in Poland who are handling a lot of the equipment coming in from around the world, from all these dozens of other countries and the United States. They talked to us a lot about what's called, ‘end use monitoring’, knowing where these weapons are going precisely to ensure they go to the right hands and ensure there is not an issue with regard to how these weapons are being used. “It's been more difficult to do that in Ukraine given the security concerns but during our trip, we heard about real progress being made to increase that U.S. and global oversight of our military aid to Ukraine with real end use monitoring. And as our embassy in Kyiv begins to bring people back, we have more American eyes on the ground to ensure that oversight. Ukraine itself, by the way, wants this transparency and strongly supports it. “The price that we paid to stop Russia now is small compared to what we would pay if they succeed and the deeper price, of course, is being paid by Ukraine. As NATO General Secretary Stoltenberg said recently, ‘the price we pay is measured in currency. The price they pay in Ukraine is measured in lives lost every day.’ We are on the side of freedom. Ukrainians want their freedom back. They fought for it in 2014 in the Euromaidan. They fought for it several times in their history. “The United States and dozens of our allies have stepped up to help them achieve this goal and win this brutal war and they have this big advantage. They're fighting with heart. They're fighting for their freedom, their homeland, their families. The Russians are fighting against an enemy that never truly existed in the first place. They're fighting against a neighbor that never wanted anything but peace with all their neighbors, including Russia, but now has to take up arms to protect itself. “Recent polling from the International Republican Institute, IRI, shows 98 percent of Ukrainians believe Ukraine will win this war. Their morale is strong. Their spirit is amazing. It was certainly the feeling I got from President Zelenskyy, his team and everyone Senator Klobuchar and I met with on our trip. They are united together for victory. We met with parliamentarians from four different parties in their Rada, the equivalent of their U.S. Congress, their parliament. They were all together, all working together toward common cause. And a common enemy. “This morale isn't just in Ukraine. I see the spirit every time I go back to Ohio where tens of thousands of Ukrainians call Ohio their home. These Ukrainian Americans and others from the eastern European area, others of the community of nations that have been affected by Soviet Union and Russia over the years, they're sticking together and their morale is high, too. On Sunday President Zelenskyy brought this spirit to his people in a powerful address to the Ukrainian people. This was a 200th-day speech, it marked 200 days of brave troops fighting. He said that he was certain that Ukrainians will get through this difficult path to victory. “This was an inspirational speech at a time when the Ukrainian people are making progress toward victory on the battlefield and therefore peace by getting Vladimir Putin to the bargaining table. This must be the result. And with our help and the help of all freedom-loving countries, victory can be achieved. That is what is so important right now as we look at this new appropriations bill, this legislation that the administration has sent us to help Ukraine continue its battle for freedom. My hope is that this week and next, as we take up this legislation, that Congress passes it showing the same spirit and the commitment to victory as we saw in Ukraine. I yield back my time.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-statement-persistently-high-inflation,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, released the following statement today after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI) for August was 8.3 percent, which is higher than expected:“American families are hurting as inflation remains close to its highest level in nearly 40 years, the economy contracts, and wages lag,” said Portman. “Skyrocketing price increases for groceries, rent, electricity, and medical care are hurting the pocketbooks of working families. Unfortunately, the Democrats’ reckless spending over the past two years is one of the main reasons. I urge Democrats and the Biden administration to change course and work with Republicans to put in common-sense economic policies that produced low unemployment, significant job gains, and record wage growth before the pandemic – all with low inflation.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/robs-rundown/robs-rundown-week-september-5-september-9-2022,"Today, Senator Portman attended and spoke at Intel’s historic ground breaking ceremony for its $20 billion semiconductor factory complex in New Albany, Ohio. The project is expected to employ 3,000 people as well as create an additional 7,000 construction jobs and 10,000 indirect jobs. Senator Portman was a key negotiator in the Senate passed CHIPS Act and is a staunch advocate for reshoring our nation’s semiconductor industry and its potential to bring significant economic development to Ohio.Portman was back in Washington earlier this week where he spoke on the Senate floor for the 21st consecutive session week regarding the situation in Ukraine. Portman talked about his recent bipartisan trip to Ukraine with Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) where he met with President Zelenskyy, Defense Minister Reznikov, and Head of the Presidential Administration Andriy Yermak. Senator Portman also met with senior leadership of the 101st Airborne Division in Poland, as well as members of that elite unit from the Buckeye State, and saw firsthand their bravery and perseverance. Throughout the trip, Portman learned from both American and Ukrainian officials the positive impact that U.S.-provided HIMARS rocket systems have had on Ukraine’s progress on the battlefield and how they have made Ukraine’s current counteroffensive possible. A long-time advocate for arming Ukraine, Senator Portman has been pushing for months to give Ukraine the weapons it needs to successfully counter Russian attacks. On Monday, Portman released a statement congratulating Liz Truss on being elected Conservative Party leader and thus the next Prime Minister of the U.K. Also on Monday, Portman applauded the decision by Kenya’s Supreme Court to confirm the result of last month’s presidential election and congratulated President-elect Ruto. On Wednesday, Portman, as Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, released a statement expressing alarm in light of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) report detailing the lack of vetting procedures for Afghan evacuee arrivals into the United States. This report follows a report by the Department of Defense (DoD) Inspector General that found that Afghan evacuees were not vetted using all available DoD data, resulting in significant security concerns. Portman highlighted that as we approach the 21st anniversary of 9/11, the United States faces an increased threat due to this administration’s catastrophic evacuation of Afghans without rigorous vetting or an in-person interview. On Thursday, Portman joined Senator Klobuchar on Fox News’ Special Report with Bret Baier to discuss their recent trip to Ukraine. The visit is Senator Portman’s eighth visit to Ukraine since the Euromaidan and the third one the two senators have taken to the region this year. The senators also discussed the Respect for Marriage Act and the need for more bipartisanship in the Senate.Finally, Senator Portman released a statement on the death of Queen Elizabeth II. Monday, September 5, 2022Portman Congratulates Liz Truss on Election as Conservative Party Leader and Next Prime MinisterU.S. Senator Rob Portman, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and co-founder and co-chair of the Senate U.K. Trade Caucus, issued the following statement today congratulating Liz Truss on being elected Conservative Party leader and thus next Prime Minister of the U.K. Portman recently traveled to the U.K. to discuss implementing a free trade agreement.“I congratulate Liz Truss on being elected Conservative Party Leader and thus the next Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. I have enjoyed working with her in her previous roles as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Secretary of State for International Trade. She has been an advocate for deepening our trade relationship and completing the U.S.-U.K. trade negotiations that began several years ago. Such an agreement would strengthen our relationship and economic competitiveness, and I look forward to working with her on that important initiative.“Both of our countries face economic and foreign policy challenges but I am confident that if we leverage the effectiveness of the longstanding special relationship we have always enjoyed that we can help each other meet those challenges. To that end, the threat to democratic governance around the world has perhaps never been greater than it is today. Our allies Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel continue to find themselves under severe threat from malign regimes. I look forward to working together to strengthen our working relationship to support these and other allies throughout the world. The world needs to know that free countries stand up for their own in order to deter threats.”NOTE: Senator Portman is co-founder and co-chair of the Senate U.K. Trade Caucus, aimed at promoting close and long-lasting economic ties between the U.S. and the U.K. by building congressional support for a bilateral trade agreement between the two countries.Portman Applauds Kenyan Supreme Court’s Decision on Presidential ElectionU.S. Senator Rob Portman, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued the following statement today regarding the decision by Kenya’s Supreme Court to confirm the result of last month’s presidential election. Portman traveled to Kenya last month on a bipartisan congressional delegation just a few days after the presidential election, where he met with President-elect Ruto, his opponent former Prime Minister Odinga, and President Kenyatta. “I applaud the Kenyan Supreme Court’s decision today confirming the results of last month’s presidential election. This is an important step forward for democracy and the rule of law in Kenya,” said Portman. “After traveling to Kenya last month and visiting with President-elect Ruto, I believe he is a strong leader who will work to bring all parties together in order to bring greater prosperity to his country.”Wednesday, September 7, 2022On Senate Floor, Portman Discusses Bipartisan Trip to Ukraine, Meeting with President Zelenskyy,Urges Further Aid to Defeat Russian AggressionU.S. Senator Rob Portman delivered remarks on the Senate floor in support of Ukraine for the 21th consecutive week while the Senate has been in session.

Since before the Russian invasion began Senator Portman has stood in staunch support of Ukraine and served as Grand Marshal in a parade to mark Ukraine’s Independence in Parma, Ohio, just prior to departing for Ukraine.  As co-chair and co-founder of the Senate Ukraine Caucus and member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Portman urges his Republican colleagues to continue to support Ukraine in their efforts to defend their homeland.  A video can be found here. Thursday, September 8, 2022On Fox News’ Special Report, Portman Discusses Bipartisan Trip to Ukraine, DHS OIG Report on Lack of Vetting of Afghan Refugees, Respect for Marriage Act, and the Need for BipartisanshipLast night, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH), co-chair and co-founder of the Senate Ukraine Caucus and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, joined Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) on Fox News’ Special Report with Bret Baier to discuss their recent trip to Ukraine. While there, they met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to receive a firsthand account of Russia’s illegal, unprovoked and brutal war on Ukraine and reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to Ukraine. Portman highlighted the positive impact that U.S.-provided HIMARS, or High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, are having on Ukraine’s war effort, including its ongoing counteroffensive in the south and counterattacks near Kharkiv. As Co-Chair and co-founder of the Senate Ukraine Caucus and member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Portman has long been a staunch defender of Ukraine and has spoken consistently on the Senate floor since the Russian invasion began. This visit is Senator Portman’s eighth visit to Ukraine and the third one the two senators have taken to the region this year.The senators also discussed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) report that details the lack of vetting procedures for Afghan evacuee arrivals into the United States. This report follows a report by the Department of Defense (DoD) Inspector General that found that Afghan evacuees were not vetted using all available DoD data, resulting in significant security concerns. In a statement released earlier today, Portman, as Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, highlighted that as we approach the 21st anniversary of 9/11, the United States faces an increased threat due to this administration’s catastrophic evacuation of Afghans without rigorous vetting or an in-person interviewIn addition, the senators discussed the Respect for Marriage Act and the need for more bipartisanship in the Senate.

Portman Expresses Condolences to the People of the United Kingdom on the Death of Queen Elizabeth IIToday, U.S. Senator Rob Portman released the following statement on the death of Queen Elizabeth II:“Jane and I send our thoughts and prayers to the Royal Family and the people of the United Kingdom. Queen Elizabeth conducted herself with dignity and grace while providing wise counsel to 15 prime ministers during her tenure,” said Portman. “She represented the best of the UK to the world and was always a trusted ally of the United States. She will be missed but her legacy will live on.”Portman, Grassley Op-Ed in Washington Examiner: “Biden’s Student Loan Debt Transfer is an Abuse of Executive Power”In a new Washington Examiner opinion piece, Senator Portman (R-OH), and Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), members of the Senate Finance Committee, detail concerns after President Biden announced that he would unilaterally cancel up to $20,000 for certain borrowers who hold federal student loan debt. The senators discuss the far-reaching consequences of the one-time debt forgiveness, which saddles future generations with even more debt to pay off in the form of higher taxes at a time when wages are already struggling to keep up with inflation.Read the full op-ed here.Friday, September 9, 2022 In Columbus, Portman Delivers Remarks at Intel’s Groundbreaking of New Semiconductor Facility Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman delivered remarks at the historic groundbreaking ceremony for Intel’s semiconductor plant in New Albany, Ohio – which will be the largest economic development investment in state history. Portman has advocated for Ohio as a prime location for semiconductor manufacturing, given Ohio’s well-trained workforce, energy infrastructure, and available land. Portman also helped spearhead Senate enactment of the CHIPS Act, which invests $52 billion in semiconductor technology and provides thousands of good-paying jobs to communities across the country. In Ohio, this legislation will increase Intel’s $20 billion investment in New Albany to build two semiconductor foundries to potentially $100 billion and eight total foundries.Portman Announces $127 Million Grant for the City of Cincinnati to Help Replace Western Hills ViaductU.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation is awarding the City of Cincinnati a $127 million federal grant through the Nationally Significant Multimodal Freight & Highway Projects (INFRA) competitive grant program. This project will replace the structurally deficient Western Hills Viaduct over the Mill Creek Valley with a new structure immediately south of the existing viaduct, which will connect to a redesigned interchange with I-75. The grant was made possible by the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that Senator Portman served as lead Republican negotiator for last year. “This is great news for Cincinnati, and one more example of how the bipartisan infrastructure law is paying dividends for Cincinnati. I was proud to spearhead passage of this new infrastructure investment and I applaud the Department of Transportation for supporting Cincinnati and other towns around Ohio with the resources needed to advance infrastructure throughout the state,” said Portman. “This project will increase community safety and access, while also creating good-paying jobs here in Cincinnati.”NOTE: In June, Portman sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg in support of the City of Cincinnati’s Western Hills Viaduct Replacement Project’s federal funding application. Thanks to Portman’s bipartisan infrastructure law, the INFRA program received a 60 percent increase in annual funding over the next five years.

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/columbus-portman-delivers-remarks-intels-groundbreaking-new-semiconductor,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) delivered remarks at the historic groundbreaking ceremony for Intel’s semiconductor plant in New Albany, Ohio – which will be the largest economic development investment in state history. Portman has advocated for Ohio as a prime location for semiconductor manufacturing, given Ohio’s well-trained workforce, energy infrastructure, and available land.  Portman also helped spearhead Senate enactment of the CHIPS Act, which invests $52 billion in semiconductor technology and provides thousands of good-paying jobs to communities across the country. In Ohio, this legislation will increase Intel’s $20 billion investment in New Albany to build two semiconductor foundries to potentially $100 billion and eight total foundries.A transcript of his remarks can be found below. “It is awesome to be here this morning with everyone to celebrate a huge victory for Ohio jobs, and for Ohio’s future. And our country’s future. As we break ground on our country’s most advanced semiconductor fabs in the world – unbelievable – creating this ecosystem that will be a silicon heartland. There are many to thank and congratulate. President Biden, who has made his way to the Buckeye state today, I can’t wait to hear what your walk on song is going to be; Governor DeWine, who just spoke; Lt. Governor Husted; Senator Brown; Representatives Balderson, Beatty, and other House colleagues who are here; members of the Ohio House and Senate providing important legislation for the incentive package; local officials; Doctor Johnson; economic development officials, those professional like J.P. and Kenny who worked their heart out. But most importantly, today, congratulations to the people of the great state of Ohio. It is your victory. Today, as we acknowledge all of the hard work that went into bringing Intel to Ohio, we also acknowledge the hard work before us that now begins. As we begin to close America’s competitiveness gap, that has grown dangerously wide with regard to semiconductor manufacturing, I’m really proud that Ohioans will play an important role in closing this gap. “Special thanks to CEO Pat Gelsinger and his Intel team, for the confidence they have shown in the people of Ohio. Pat and I have had a lot of conversations in the last couple of years, about what Ohio brings to the table. I will tell you, as a Midwestern farm kid, he got it instinctively. He understood that our Midwestern values – hard work, resourcefulness, a legacy of manufacturing, and a willingness to embrace technology – fit exactly what Intel needed. Incentives from the governor, state legislature, and the local community didn’t hurt. But honestly, every state had an incentive package. Ohio’s pro-jobs, pro-business environment that Governor DeWine and state legislature have nurtured helped. And the new federal infrastructure law is timely. But folks, none of this works without the skilled Ohio workforce that they need. Now it’s up to all of us to earn the confidence they have shown in Ohio. And we will. “As will be said later today when we hear from Pat and the president, the passage of the federal CHIPS-plus Act was also critical in making today a reality. I was honored to help lead that effort in the Senate. Each of my Senate and House colleagues here today played an important role. In this case, at least, Congress put partisanship aside and focused on how to close the growing gap in semiconductors and other technologies that will ultimately determine the fate of nations. Our dwindling U.S. semiconductor manufacturing is both an economic and national security concern. Not only has our share of global chip manufacturing capacity over the past 30 years fallen from nearly 40 percent to 12 percent, but semiconductors are more important than ever for everything, from F-150s to F-35s. And 90 percent of high-end chips being made in Taiwan and China dramatically growing its capacity, the supply chain has become more vulnerable, putting at risk the American economy and our military advantage. If it works as intended, the CHIPS Science Act will be the catalyst to spur all kinds of record-breaking technological investments and innovations. Not just CHIPS, and not just here in New Albany, as important as it is, but around the country and across the state. Intel’s announcement to build here has already caused suppliers to look at Ohio because of the semiconductors. “So let’s get to work. Like we did with the CHIPS plus legislation, let’s link arms across the aisle and at every level of government and the private sector, to meet the need. Let’s help the building trades, and ensure those 7,000 skilled construction workers are there. Let’s help Intel ensure the 3,000 skilled employees they need, and thousands of additional workers that suppliers across this state and region are there, with the skills they need. Let’s pass the bipartisan JOBS Act in the United States Congress to redirect federal resources to skills training. If we all continue to work shoulder-to-shoulder as we have, this investment has the potential to be transformational for Ohio and help America continue to be at the forefront of technological innovation and thus continue to be that beacon of hope and opportunity for the rest of the world. Thank you and Godspeed.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/portman-difference/portman-grassley-op-ed-washington-examiner-bidens-student-loan-debt,"WASHINGTON, DC – In a new Washington Examiner opinion piece, Senator Portman (R-OH), and Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), members of the Senate Finance Committee, detail concerns after President Biden announced that he would unilaterally cancel up to $20,000 for certain borrowers who hold federal student loan debt. The senators discuss the far-reaching consequences of the one-time debt forgiveness, which saddles future generations with even more debt to pay off in the form of higher taxes at a time when wages are already struggling to keep up with inflation.Read the full op-ed here. Excerpts below:Biden’s student loan debt transfer is an abuse of executive power
By U.S. Senator Rob Portman and U.S Senator Chuck Grassley
Washington ExaminerLast week, President Joe Biden, without authorization from Congress, announced he plans to transfer roughly $500 billion worth of student loan debt from the borrowers who took out the loans to hardworking taxpayers across the country. Other presidents, Republicans and Democrats, have attempted to overstep their authority, and we have never been shy about criticizing them. But in our time in the Senate, we have never seen a president attempt to spend up to a trillion dollars with the stroke of a pen.To be clear, Biden does not have the authority to cancel billions in student loan debts without congressional authorization. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) agreed that the authority is not there when she explained that “people think that the president of the United States has the power for debt forgiveness. He does not. He can postpone. He can delay but he does not have that power. That would have to be an act of Congress.” The Department of Education issued a memo in January 2021 agreeing with the speaker that the president does not have the authority to cancel student loan debt.…In our system of checks and balances, this major decision regarding loan forgiveness must be made through the legislative process, not the stroke of a pen at the White House. It’s often said that Congress doesn’t hide elephants in mouse holes. Estimates of the cost of this program range from $500 billion to $1 trillion. For days, the White House refused to release an estimate, claiming they didn’t even know how much this would cost taxpayers. Numbers that large can be hard to put in context, but that is the equivalent of six to 13 times the entire discretionary budget Congress appropriated for the Department of Education earlier this year.The bulk of that Education Department budget is aimed at those who need help most: low-income families. This debt transfer does the opposite. A college education is an investment, and students who took out loans to pay for their educations typically make their investment back manyfold. For an average loan of $30,000, a bachelor’s degree is worth about $2.8 million over the course of a lifetime.For the same amount it will cost taxpayers in borrowed money to pay off the debts of those who already got a college education, including well-off graduate degree holders, Congress could have doubled the Pell Grant for a decade to help those most in need access a college education. To be sure, there are some borrowers who have difficulty making payments. That’s why Congress has already created a number of programs to help, such as income-driven repayment plans. These are especially beneficial for borrowers with low incomes, as some borrowers see no monthly payment at all.…Prominent liberal economists agree that this uptick in spending will contribute to higher inflation. Jason Furman, a former economic adviser to President Barack Obama, has warned that everyone will pay for this debt transfer, either in the form of higher inflation, higher taxes, or lower benefits in the future. Former Clinton administration Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who was one of the first to argue that Biden’s big 2020 spending bill would lead to today’s high inflation, is again saying that “student loan debt relief is spending that raises demand and increases inflation.” It seems the White House is willingly repeating mistakes of the past. ###

A transcript of his remarks can be found below and a video can be found here. PORTMAN ON BIPARTISAN TRIP TO UKRAINE“Actually, right now it's a pretty optimistic time in Ukraine. And it's because they are on the offensive. So they have been on defense for most of the past six months. Russia invaded not just the southern and eastern part where they are now but, remember, they invaded the whole country. They tried to take over Kyiv, were not successful, and retreated back to the east and south. But what's happened, even in the last week, Bret, is you see a counteroffensive in the south going toward Kherson, but also a counter offensive in the east or the northeast going into the Kharkiv area. and the Ukrainians are making progress. Since that report we just heard from the tables have turned and the main reason is they now have the weapons they need to be able to make progress. For so long the Russians were sitting back behind the frontlines and firing on the Ukrainians with impunity because the Ukrainian artillery could not reach them. now because of what Amy talked about a moment ago, the so-called HIMARS, a household word in Ukraine apparently, these are missile launching systems and able Ukrainians to reach these Russian positions and able to reach their ammo depots, their command control centers and they are taking them out one after another. so the momentum has shifted and that's great because we all want Ukraine to be successful here in pushing Russia out of a sovereign democratic country. But it's also great because the stuff that we have given them is working… The leverage on President Putin is to start to win on the battlefield and to tighten the sanctions. And that will get him to the bargaining table and then we will know what the end game looks like, and that's why we need to stick with what we are doing now because it's working.”PORTMAN ON STAKES IN UKRAINE AND DHS OIG REPORT ON AFGHAN EVACUEES“In terms of the Afghan refugees, all of us want to take care of the Afghans who helped Americans who stood shoulder to shoulder with us, the interpreters, and so on. But remember that chaotic withdrawal. a lot of people got on those airplanes who had nothing to do with the U.S. presence there and we brought them to the United States without properly vetting them. That's what the inspector general has now said. It was pretty obvious. We all knew this was going to be a problem. We don't know how many Afghans are in this country who pose a national security threat but we know that there are a few dozen based on what the FBI has told us. And we just hope that they are being monitored. We don't have an issue with that. So that's why the IG report today was so important and really will be surprising to a lot of people having followed this.”PORTMAN ON THE RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT“You know, Bret, I think at the end of the day we will. All we are talking about is the status quo. And frankly, it’s a legislative function. In my view, it is the appropriate role of Congress to speak here and to be sure that one, we are ensuring that people who are in relationships already aren't at risk of losing the ability to move from state to state which is what this is about. Two, we have got to be sure that we are not keeping on the books legislation that says that states don't have to honor other states which is currently the law on the books. Now the Supreme Court decision came out counter to that. So all this legislation does is it says let's just go with the status quo.”“There is a risk out there and there are about a million families who are in these relationships that are very worried about it. they adopted kids, they’ve got financial arrangements, and so on. I think it’s good to clarify the status quo. By the way, those of us who are for clarifying this also believe in religious liberty and we think there ought to be some additional protections put in the legislation that passed the House regarding religious liberty and we are working with our colleagues on that. But in effect, it will actually raise the bar for religious liberty which would be good in my view along with saying states have to recognize valid marriages in other states which is what the Supreme Court has said.”PORTMAN ON THE NEED FOR BIPARTISANSHIP  IN THE SENATE“I think with the exception of your great show, Bret, often we emphasize the conflict and controversy that sells, I guess, on the air. The same is true online. In fact, I think even more so. And I think that's a problem because most Americans see Washington as something broken. They are not getting anything done. And we were hired, you know, to get things done. We are supposed to be about policy solutions. It's easy to, you know, go on the air and throw out the red meat. As you say it’s easy to vote no, it's harder to figure out how can you find that common ground and solve problems that people care about. And right now people are hurting. Inflation is a huge problem. What's going on at the border needs to be fixed. We have a big problem with energy right now in trying to ensure we have enough energy to keep our prices down but also to help Europe and others.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-floor-portman-discusses-bipartisan-trip-ukraine-meeting-president,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) delivered remarks on the Senate floor in support of Ukraine for the 21th consecutive week while the Senate has been in session. Portman talked about his recent bipartisan trip to Ukraine with Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) where he met with President Zelenskyy, Defense Minister Reznikov, and Head of the Presidential Administration Andriy Yermak. Senator Portman also met with senior leadership of the 101st Airborne Division in Poland, as well as members of that elite unit from the Buckeye State, and saw firsthand their bravery and perseverance. Throughout the trip, Portman learned from both American and Ukrainian officials the positive impact that U.S.-provided HIMARS rocket systems have had on Ukraine’s progress on the battlefield and how they have made Ukraine’s current counteroffensive possible. Since before the Russian invasion began Senator Portman has stood in staunch support of Ukraine and served as Grand Marshal in a parade to mark Ukraine’s Independence in Parma, Ohio, just prior to departing for Ukraine.  As co-chair and co-founder of the Senate Ukraine Caucus and member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Portman urges his Republican colleagues to continue to support Ukraine in their efforts to defend their homeland.  A transcript of his remarks can be found below and a video can be found here. “I've come to the Senate floor again today to talk about Ukraine. This is the 21st week in the row since we've been in session that I have done so and to talk about how Ukraine is responding to Russia's brutal and unprovoked attack on that sovereign country, an ally of ours, a Democracy. This is a map of Ukraine. We can see here where the Russian invasion came back in 2014 and where they are now. You can also see some progress being made in the blue as Ukrainian military pushes back on this latest invasion. “Last week I was able to visit Ukraine and to go to Kyiv, the capitol, along with a colleague of mine across the aisle, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Senator Klobuchar and I believed it was important to demonstrate bipartisan support for Ukraine at a very critical time. She and I will be back here on the Senate floor together later this week to talk further about this trip. “But the trip came on the six-month anniversary of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine. It also came on the same week that Ukraine began a counteroffensive against the Russian invasion here in the Kherson area. It also came at a time when there's increased concern about the nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia, here. The power plant is actually right here near this red line. “Inspectors from the U.N., United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency visited this Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant last week which is Europe's single largest nuclear power plant. We began our trip in Poland where we met with the leadership of the elite 101st Airborne Division, which is  stationed in the south of Poland. “The 101st is a unit with a long, proud history including participating in daring airborne assaults on D-day, striking deep within enemy lines in Operation Desert Storm, serving with distinction in the global war on terror. Its motto attest, the 101st has a rendezvous with destiny during pivotal moments of our country's history. Now they have another rendezvous with destiny. In Poland they're not only bolstering allied defenses in Eastern Europe, here in Poland, but really all around Eastern Europe but also conducting a very important mission. “They're facilitating the delivery of vital military assistance from Ukraine from 42 other countries other than the United States all around the world. These soldiers are really at the tip of the spear of America's historic effort to arm the soldiers with the tools they need to protect themselves and to protect their Democracy. I also got to meet soldiers from the 101st from my home state of Ohio. They told me of the Polish people's welcoming to them. They said that people are so grateful for what the American soldiers are doing there in Poland. “They feel so much better knowing that the American presence is there. One guy told me about walking down a street in Poland and someone coming up and hugging him just to say thank you. He was a little surprised by that. The senior leaders of the 101st briefed Senator Klobuchar and myself on how the military assistance is going and what's actually happening on the battlefield against the Russians. “In Ukraine, Senator Klobuchar and I traveled to Kyiv to meet with senior Ukrainian officials, including President Zelenskyy, Defense Minister Reznikov, Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak and others as well as members of the parliament, which is called the Rada. We traveled north of Kyiv to see firsthand where there have been unspeakable atrocities against innocent civilians during the initial stages of this war. “We also saw where Russian forces were stopped dead in their tracks in the earlier assault on their capitol by brave Ukrainian defenders. During our meeting with President Zelenskyy, the very first thing that he wanted to say was thank you. Thank you to the American people for being such great partners, strong allies, helping Ukraine defend itself. “He and his leadership team know well the vital role that America's assistance has played in helping Ukraine not just defend itself against Russian's illegal unprovoked and cold-blooded invasion but now to actually push Russian forces back and to begin deliberate territory in some places like the southern part of Ukraine. It was a common theme of our trip that we heard from all Ukrainians regarding their thankfulness to America. “They are immensely appreciative of what the American people have done. The fact that we have stepped up and led in helping Ukraine in this fight for freedom. By the way, because of that, because of America's assistance and America's leadership, they're very optimistic about their future. “We spoke about many topics with President Zelenskyy, including the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which has grown increasingly dangerous over the past few weeks. The Russians have captured this plant and now have taken the Ukrainian employees of this nuclear power plant, the biggest in Europe, taken them captive and intimidated them in various ways. “We were told about them being harassed, even reports of torture, working at gun point and now Russia is reportedly using explosives to destroy electrical infrastructure from the plant taking electricity into Ukraine. They want to cut off the infrastructure that goes into Ukraine and steal the energy for themselves. Remember, this is not just the biggest plant in Europe. “It provides 20 percent of the electricity for Ukraine and allows Ukraine actually right now to sell some of its electricity to other countries, which is helping with regard to Ukraine's serious budget problems. The Russians are also using this nuclear power plant as a military base essentially, as a nuclear shield. This is playing with fire. They are firing artillery positioned at the plant on Ukrainian forces nearby knowing the Ukrainians cannot fire back. Russia has already irresponsibly used oil and gas, energy as a weapon of war. We've seen what they've done with Europe. “They said to Europe, ‘if you don't stop all these sanctions we are going to cut off your energy.’ Nord Stream I has been cut off causing great harm and pain in Europe. So they're using energy as a weapon already. We've seen them use food as a weapon of war. Totally irresponsible, including actually bombing Ukrainian grain bins with grain that is absolutely essential right now in places like sub-Saharan Africa to be able to survive because they depend so much on Ukrainian wheat, corn, sunflower oil. “Now they're taking it to the next step. Now they are actually using nuclear power and this military base as a weapon of war. Using nuclear power and these reactors as a tool in this war is a reckless escalation risking a catastrophe. We could have on our hands the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. I encourage president Putin to do the right thing and demilitarize this area around the plant. This is dangerous to the entire continent, including Russia and the rest of Europe. “Allow these workers to do their job without this kind of pressure and ensure there is no leakage from the plant. President Zelenskyy agreed with us in our meeting that that's the way this should be handled. It should be demilitarized. I noted that today the United Nations IAEA inspectors at the plant have also said there should be a demilitarized zone around the plant. I also heard today that two members of this inspection team that visited last week when we were there will now be staying at the plant for an uncertain period and that is good news. That there actually will be some inspectors there from the United Nations. It's a step in the right direction at least. “But what Russia needs to do is back off this plant and demilitarize the area. We know that Russia's ultimate plan is to disconnect this plant nuclear power plant from the Ukraine’s grid and as I said, connect it to the Russian grid. This is the theft of power, plain and simple. This plant, the largest in Europe, produces, again, 20 percent of Ukraine's electricity. We also talked to President Zelenskyy about the various weapon needs they continue to have. “He talked specifically about how effective the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, have been. These are weapons that the United States has provided to Ukraine, about 16 of them, but also the U.K. and Germany has provided comparable systems to the Ukraine. And they have been extremely effective. They've used these missile systems to target Russian ammo depots, logistics lines that are within Ukraine but far from the front lines. “They are destroying these ammo depots, these command posts, these pieces of critical infrastructure. This is causing disarray in Russia's ability to supply, control, and maneuver its forces. We heard repeatedly that the Ukrainian morale has been lifted by these HIMARS because of their ability finally to reach these Russian positions, and Russian artillery that previously was out of reach of the Ukrainian artillery and instead they were sitting back with impunity and destroying Ukrainian cities, killing civilians and soldiers without having any consequences. Now they're feeling some consequences. “They also said that not only is the Ukrainian morale increasing but the Russian morale is decreasing. It is deteriorating, as the Ukrainian make progress. HIMARS have been in use by the U.S. armed forces for over a decade yet even the soldiers I talked to at the 101st told us how surprised they were at how resourceful and creative the Ukrainians were maintaining and using these systems. “The Ukrainian soldiers clearly have the ingenuity, as well as the will and the determination to fight. If we continue to provide them these tools that they need to be able to successful, Ukraine will persevere over time and preserve its freedom and Independence from Russian domination. The point I'd like to make really is that what we did here in this chamber by voting for this aid that resulted in these HIMARS is making a huge difference in Ukraine. After meeting with President Zelenskyy, we visited some of the suburbs outside Kyiv, collectively these places tell the story of Russia's failed attempt to capture Kyiv. “We first visited Irpin, a small town about 30 minutes outside of Kyiv. Before the war, Irpin was a quiet town where people lived and worked in peace. But Russia's invasion in February brought horrific violence there. As these pictures show of us walking through Kyiv, Senator Klobuchar and myself, you can see the destruction to the civilian targets, these apartment buildings. The Russian forces assaulted Irpin, with no regard for civilian property or civilian life. Everywhere we looked we saw destroyed business buildings, destroyed apartment buildings, cars. We saw bullet holes every with massive holes in the sides of buildings where you can see where tank rounds were fired through buildings. “We also saw small craters in parking lots from mortars. Thankfully, a lot of the civilians were able to flee just before the Russians reached the city. Not all had the opportunity to flee. The mayor estimated that up to 300 civilians were killed in Russia's assault on the town. We also visited the nearby town of Bucha, a name that has unfortunately become synonymous with war crimes and Russia's atrocities during this war. During the few weeks that the Russian soldiers controlled this small town in March and April, unspeakable crimes were committed there, including rape and torture and executions of hundreds of civilians. “Senator Klobuchar and I went to the church of St. Andrew, a beautiful church but sadly also the site of a mass grave dug by Russian soldiers. There the Russians buried dozens of innocent Ukrainians, civilians who were tortured and murdered at the hands a of the Russians. Our visits to Irpin and Bucha were sobering. It is one thing to see the destruction of apartments and other civilian targets on television. It’s another to see it first hand, and to talk to the people, the locals, the residents, about what happened. It is hard to believe that such things can happen in the 21st century. Senator Klobuchar and I also visited Hostomel airport outside of Kyiv. “This photograph is of the airport and some of the destruction there. This is the Deputy Minister of Interior of Ukraine, who joined us there. This airport was meant to be Russia's forward operating base for its assault on Kyiv. It was assaulted by elite Russian airborne forces and experienced Chechen fighters on the very first day of the war, February 24, with a plan to secure the airport and use it for ferrying in troops and equipment, flying in Russian forces to take over Kyiv and to take over the country. However, these troops had landed deep into Ukrainian territory and brave Ukrainian soldiers, mostly inexperienced but highly motivated National Guard troops, counterattacked the Russian invaders at the airport. “They fought ferociously. Remember, these were elite Russian airborne troopers who had come in to this airport. Yet they were defeated by Ukraine's national guardsmen, most of whom had never seen combat before. We had the opportunity to talk to some of the soldiers there at the Hostomel airport during Russia’s initial assault. The National Guard commander that was there that day told us about his units heroic efforts to defend the airport, that day, and the next day and the next day. And about the men he’d lost, including several captured soldiers still prisoners of Russia six months later. I asked him how they could have been successful, beating the odds. “He said simply, ‘we were fighting to defend our families, our freedom, our homeland, and that's why we won.’ Hostomel airport is where the Ukrainian forces won their first major victory against the Russian invaders and where they stopped Russia's northern advance dead in its tracks. If you look at this map, you can see what the Russians intended to do and what actually happened. They intended to come into the airport here, north and east of town, take over Kyiv, topple the government, and eventually take over all of Ukraine. Eventually because of the fighting and the Ukrainian troops that pushed back, they ended up going through bell Belarus, back into Russia and now are in this area. “So if this war had not been successfully prosecuted at Hostomel airport, it would have been a very different outcome. You would have seen Kyiv fall. You would have seen the president's government fall, the duly elected government of Ukraine, President Zelenskyy, the Rada – the parliament – fall. This war could have been over very soon if that had happened. Thankfully it did not. Because of the bravery and courage of the Ukrainian National Guard. Hostomel airport to me is a symbol of Ukrainian resistance, of Ukrainian victory in the face of overwhelming odds. I was very honored to meet some of the heroes that were there that day and liberated that airport. “We also met with members of Ukraine’s parliament, called the Rada, from various political parties, including David Arakhamia. David is the majority leader in the parliament and one of Ukraine's chief negotiators with the Russians. We spoke about the current state of the war and the future conflict, including possible paths of victory for Ukraine. The consensus was that the only way to Russia would come to the bargaining table would be if the sanctions could be further tightened. And if the Ukrainians continue to make progress on the battlefield. Victories in the east and the south give Ukraine more leverage at the bargaining table when negotiations begin. That's why it's so important, you see here in it the light blue, some of the success that the Ukrainian soldiers have had recently, even in the last week or so, as well as up here around Kharkiv. “In each of our meetings – with the 101st airborne, the president, his top advisors, Secretary of Defense – we spoke extensively about ensuring proper oversight and accountability for U.S.-provided assistance. Including military assistance. The 101st airborne told us they had a sophisticated end-use monitoring program for weapons with the ability to track all of the military equipment being transferred to Ukraine. I'm happy to report that much progress is being made on that front. The U.S. has spent billions of dollars to support Ukrainians in the defense of their nation, and it was appropriate. But Ukrainian officials understand that it's important that we provide transparency to this funding. They do not take it for granted. They know this funding is ultimately accountable to the U.S. taxpayer. “They are eager to demonstrate to their allies in the West that they are using these weapons and this equipment properly, and to great effect on the battlefield. We have good partners here who want to be sure we have this transparency. They have been providing significant visibility on the the weapons and equipment we have learned as it has been received from the United States and they will continue to do so. The goal is to build a tracked delivery of every single every weapon down to the serial number all the way to the front lines. We left this trip with several takeaways. First, the genuine gratitude of the Ukrainian people and the government of Ukraine. The feeling of common cause with the people of America. 40 countries plus have provided military equipment and other support. “The Ukrainians recognize if it weren't for these weapons and training that the United States and our allies have provided, their country might very well be part of Russia today. And they know that America has led the efforts. Some officers from Embassy Kyiv told us a few weeks ago that they ordered takeover from a restaurant. They got some cheeseburgers and in the bag that was delivered to the embassy, the local restaurant personnel had written, thank you for the HIMARS. Remember, HIMARS are these rocket-assault systems. HIMARS has now become a household name in Ukraine. And they are so appreciative that they have the ability to defend themselves. “Second, it was remarkable to Senator Klobuchar and me to learn just how much of appear impact our military assistance is having on the battlefield. In the opening stages of the war, that was the javelins, the anti-tank missiles that were a decisive weapon that halted the slow advance of the Russian armored columns towards Kyiv. Now in this stage of the war it's the HIMARS. And the anti-aircraft weaponry. Every day Ukrainian forces are pounding Russian positions all across the front line, particularly in the south. In fact, the day before we arrived in Kyiv, they launched their long-awaited counteroffensive in southern Ukraine. From what I hear in Ukraine, from both U.S. and Ukrainian officials, it is clear this counteroffensive would not have been possible without our help. HIMAR strikes have softened up Russia's position in the south and made it possible for the counteroffensive that's going on right here tonight as we speak. “As you may recall, the Russian artillery was out of reach before and was just pounding Ukrainian forces and civilians with impunity. HIMARS have also struck command posts which are very important because that has crippled Russia's ability to effectively command and control its forces.  They've also struck some very important bridges across the country, including this one here that's incredibly important for Russia to be able to provide its troops. This has isolated some of these Russian forces and prevented them from being able to maneuver to support one another. Our assistance in Ukraine is having a significant and positive impact on the battlefield and we not stop now and squander the progress we have made. The money is being well spent in the defense of freedom. “The weapons we are providing are giving the Ukrainians a real chance at leveling this battlefield and giving them an opportunity to win back their lost territory. My third takeaway from this trip is that we need to do more for Ukraine, both in the short-term and the long-term. President Zelenskyy made an appeal to Senator Klobuchar and me for the U.S. to provide the Ukraine with ATACMS, which are Army Tactical Mission Systems. These can be fired from the HIMAR missiles currently in Ukriane and have longer reach than the missiles we're currently providing. It seems these missiles would be an important part of their arsenal from what we learned from both American and Ukrainian briefings. President Zelenskyy also requested more air defense systems. Short, medium, and long range. “His rationale was simple – he wants the seven million Americans who have left his country to be able to return and they want to return. Having met with refugees in two previous trips this year, to the border of Poland and Moldova, and talked to these refugees, all of them want to go back. But when it is safe, they will be able to go back. So having more air defense systems at every range – short, medium and long-range – would enable people to come back. This is crucial because this is one of the issues now is that Ukraine's economy has been reduced by about 40 percent because of the terrible war that's being raged. “If these people can come back to Ukraine, get back to work as normal, pay taxes, begin to become part of the economy again, this will be the most helpful thing to Ukraine's budget problems and economic woes. With a layered air defense, they could close its skies to the Russian missiles and get its people and life across much of Ukraine back to normal. I'm glad the Biden administration has already acted on some of the requests to provide more protection for the skies by pledging eight national advanced surface to air missile systems, or NASAMS, in conjunction with our German allies.“I urge the Biden administration and other partners to do more to respond to this request. Ukraine is where we are engaging in the fight for freedom in this generation. It is not just about Ukraine. For years Russia and China have been saying that the West is in decline, that the United States and our allies are weak-willed and untrustworthy. That's certainly what President Putin thought when he invaded Ukraine. He thought he would divide NATO, divide the West, and we would not request respond. That Ukraine and our allies would fold. That we'd stand aside and let it happen. We proved him wrong so far. Not only by aiding Ukraine, but by protecting the region. “The recent announcement that we're sending 250 of the best tanks in the world, the Abrams battle tanks, which were made in my home state of Ohio, to Poland, is a commitment to the region, a commitment to eastern Europe. This will send a critical message to Russia that the United States stands for freedom, not only in Ukraine, but all throughout Europe and the world. I thank our European allies for all they're doing as well, and urge them to continue to step up their support for Ukraine. Their own ability to remain free may very well rest on Ukraine remaining free. As one Ukrainian told me on this trip, Ukraine is the shield for democracy for Europe. “We must show Vladimir Putin's cynicism about the West that he is wrong. America has always stood by its values, freedom, democracy, and the rights of nations to chart their own futures and live in peace with their neighbors. We cannot stop now. Most of us who serve in this chamber understand that, and so do the vast majority of the American people. Ten days ago, before I headed overseas, I marched in the Ukrainian Independence Day parade in Parma, Ohio, just outside of Cleveland. I was with two national leaders in the Ukrainian community, Marta Liscynensky and Andy Futey. I proudly marched with them. “There were over 60 entrants in this parade. It went on and on and on. The large turnout, both in terms of participants and spectators, was a demonstration of the support for Ukraine. Ohio is home to tens of thousands of Ukrainian Americans who do not want to see Ukraine become part of some renewed Russian empire. They want Ukraine, their homeland, to remain free and sovereign. The so-called nationalities community, from Slovenes to Pols, from Georgians to Lithuanians, all have the same understanding of the direct threat that Russia poses. They know Ukraine is on the front line of a larger battle for freedom. So many Ohioans have rallied together to support Ukraine, from all backgrounds. “In closing, I want to thank everyone who helped make our important trip possible, including the State Department and our allies in Ukraine, including our military colleagues in Poland. It's important that Congress continue to show our strong support for Ukraine, particularly during this critical period for the country's future. The stakes are so high. This a fight about global freedom, self-determination, democracy, and respect for territorial integrity. All of us, the United States and our allies, need to stand up, because the alternative is a far more dangerous and volatile world, and that affects all of us. 42 freedom-loving allies of the United States have stood together in support of Ukraine, militarily. “Dozens of others have helped in other ways. All nations around the world are carefully paying attention to what happens in Ukraine. Not just our allies, but also our adversaries. We have shown the world that America and allies didn't back down. After six weeks, not even after six months, we haven't faltered. We must commit to continuing to help Ukraine defend itself. Until Vladimir Putin understands that Russia's borders end where freedom begins. Slava Ukraini and Godspeed to the brave soldiers of Ukraine. Heroiam Slava. Thank you and I yield the floor.” ###

I have enjoyed working with her in her previous roles as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs  and Secretary of State for International Trade. She has been an advocate for deepening our trade relationship and completing the U.S.-U.K. trade negotiations that began several years ago. Such an agreement would strengthen our relationship and economic competitiveness, and I look forward to working with her on that important initiative.“Both of our countries face economic and foreign policy challenges but I am confident that if we leverage the effectiveness of the longstanding special relationship we have always enjoyed that we can help each other meet those challenges. To that end, the threat to democratic governance around the world has perhaps never been greater than it is today. Our allies Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel continue to find themselves under severe threat from malign regimes. I look forward to working together to strengthen our working relationship to support these and other allies throughout the world. The world needs to know that free countries stand up for their own in order to deter threats.”NOTE: Senator Portman is co-founder and co-chair of the Senate U.K. Trade Caucus, aimed at promoting close and long-lasting economic ties between the U.S. and the U.K. by building congressional support for a bilateral trade agreement between the two countries. ###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/portman-difference/msnbcs-morning-joe-portman-discusses-bipartisan-trip-ukraine,"This morning, U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), co-chair and co-founder of the Senate Ukraine Caucus and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) joined MSNBC’s Morning Joe to discuss their recent trip to Ukraine where they met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and traveled to Bucha, Irpin, and Hostomel Airport to receive a firsthand account of Russia’s illegal, unprovoked and brutal war on Ukraine, and to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to Ukraine. Portman commented on the significant positive impact that U.S.-provided HIMARS, or High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, are having on Ukraine’s war effort, including in Ukraine’s ongoing counteroffensive in the south. During the interview, Portman underscored the importance of demilitarizing Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, and also praised recent progress on the International Atomic Energy Agency’s technical review of the power plant. As Co-Chair and co-founder of the Senate Ukraine Caucus and member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Portman has long been a staunch defender of Ukraine and has spoken consistently on the Senate floor since the Russian invasion began. This visit is Senator Portman’s eighth visit to Ukraine and the third one the two senators have taken to the region this year.A transcript of his remarks can be found below and a video can be found here. SENATOR PORTMAN ON THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING MILITARY SUPPORT TO UKRAINE “Well first, this is an incredibly important fight. It's in our generation, this is where we're engaging in the fight for freedom, and it's not just about Ukraine, as Senator Klobuchar said. It's about global freedom. And so all of us need to stand up. By the way, 42 allies in the United States have stood together on this. So, the freedom-loving world has been unified. I will also make the point that it was Donald Trump who began to provide lethal weaponry to Ukraine to defend itself. The Obama administration did not agree to do that, but President Trump did. So, it was Republicans who took the lead in providing Ukraine with what they were asking for at the time. This was prior to this latest invasion, of course. Now we have to be sure, that two things happen, one, that the funding we're providing is accountable. Whether it's humanitarian aid or whether it’s state budget support or whether it’s defense spending, one thing Senator Klobuchar and I did when we were over there is we insisted that there be accountability and end-use monitoring for these weapons as it’s called, so we know where these weapons are going, and that we ensure that any funding that's being provided is going to the essentials, like providing salaries for the law enforcement officials who are needed right now to protect Ukraine and to win this war. And then second, we need to be sure that the American people and our colleagues understand what we are providing is making a difference, a huge difference.”“We discussed the HIMARS, which are long-range rockets the Ukrainians have been asking for. Many of us had hoped that the administration would move even more quickly on these. But now we are moving on them, we have 16 units in place. That's public information. These enable the Ukrainians finally to be able to reach the Russian artillery that's been firing on them inessentially for the past serval months, particularly in the east and the south, and destroying civilian targets, hospitals, schools, churches, apartment buildings. We saw some of these apartment buildings that were destroyed in Bucha when we were over there yesterday. So, these weapons are working. What the American people are helping provide to the Ukrainian armed forces, as well as by the way the UK, Germany, and others, are actually making a difference and enabling them to have this counteroffensive that is going on as we talked, they're making progress in the south, moving towards Kherson. This would be a huge victory militarily. But also in terms of the morale, the Russian troops have incredibly poor morale, but the Ukrainian troops are fired up, they are protecting their homeland, they are protecting their freedom, they are protecting their families. So, it was a good visit in the sense that we were able to deliver those messages, and also ensure what we have provided is making a difference.”“I didn't bring him up. I said that a Republican administration provided lethal aid, and so the question was, ‘are Republicans not willing to support lethal aid to Ukraine, is that a problem?’ My point is, that this has been something that Republicans and Democrats alike have supported. In fact, it was a Republican administration, after years of you and me and others encouraging a Democratic administration to do it, finally, a Republican administration did provide that lethal aid. That was my point. I think that’s very important to understand right now, we need to keep this up. Six months is a long time. On the other hand, progress is being made. Think about it, the Russians intended to roll into Ukraine and take over this country, a democracy, a strong ally of ours, that had chosen to turn to us in 2014. We were at the airfield right outside of Kyiv, and just yesterday, we got to see where a brave unit of the National Guard kept the Russian special forces, these were highly trained Chechens and Russians taking over this airport and therefore beginning the assault on Kyiv. These are National Guard that had rarely seen combat if any, and we got the meet the commander of that unit. They were fighting, as you said, for their homeland and that's why they won.”SENATOR PORTMAN ON DEATH OF GORBACHEV AND RUSSIAN WAR CRIMES“Well, first of all, Joe, as you know, Gorbachev was very close to George H.W. Bush. So, through that, I got to meet him several times. He took a lot of risks in ensuring that the Soviet Union, you know, could move forward in a way that would be good for the people. That has all changed now. You see what's happening in Ukraine as one example of that. We talked earlier about Zaporizhzhia, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe is currently under attack effectively. You know, the Russians came in and assaulted the neighboring region and took over the plant and took the employees there captive. They took the employees captive and then began to intimidate them. We were told they were harassed. There are some reports they were tortured. They were captured inside this nuclear power plant, that alone makes it very unsafe. And then to use it as a human shield, effectively, saying they were going to fire on Ukrainian positions from this military base essentially, which is now this power plant, making it each riskier. And then finally, they have actually destroyed parts of the infrastructure, including power lines, going into Ukraine from this plant, because they would like to divert this energy because 20 percent of the electricity in Ukraine is generated by this one plant. They would like to divert it to Russia. All these add up to war crimes, which are incredibly irresponsible and risking a catastrophe for Europe, for Russia, by the way, from the fallout. This would be the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl if we don't demilitarize the area. So I’m glad the U.N. is there. I’m glad they are going to do a technical review. What they really need to do with the international community is get Russia to do the right thing, which is to demilitarize this area around the plant, allow these workers to do their job without this kind of pressure, and ensure there is no leakage and ensure that this plant is safe.”SENATOR PORTMAN ON MAR-A-LAGO RAID“Well, Joe first, I think it's really important that the FBI and DOJ do come up and provide us with a classified briefing. I would say to go beyond the Intelligence Committee. I’m on the Homeland Security Committee as an example. We have jurisdiction over the National Archives. I would hope that we would have the ability to ask questions, get the real answers. It's unprecedented to have a raid like this on a former president's residence, and that's why I think the transparency should be unprecedented also. Obviously, we need to be careful that sources and methods are not being revealed through classified documents. They should never be taken from the White House in the first place, but we just don't know the details yet. So yeah, I think it's important we have that briefing. In terms of whether or not this is going to take place or not, my understanding is the decision for a briefing has not been made yet, but I would hope that next week when Congress is back we could have that kind of a briefing.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senators-portman-and-klobuchar-conclude-bipartisan-trip-ukraine,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), co-chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) released the following statements as they concluded a trip to Ukraine where they met with senior Ukrainian leaders, including an hour-long meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov, to receive a firsthand account of Russia’s illegal, unprovoked and brutal war on Ukraine and to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to Ukraine, NATO, and other allies in the region. The senators also visited Bucha and Irpin, the sites of horrific Russian atrocities earlier this spring. They also visited Hostomel Airport, where the Ukrainian people claimed an early and key victory against the Russian army.The visit is Senator Portman’s eighth visit to Ukraine and the third one the two senators have taken to the region this year. Senators Portman and Klobuchar visited Ukraine with a broader Senate delegation in January and in March they went to Poland and met with diplomatic leaders, aid workers, and refugees fleeing the fighting in Ukraine.“The courage and bravery of the Ukraine people in the face of unjust Russian aggression is always encouraging from afar but even more inspiring to see it firsthand,” said Senator Portman.  “Our trip to Kyiv not only offered the opportunity to witness the steadfast resolve of the people but also the leadership of President Zelenskyy and his team. Now more than ever the United States must stand with our ally Ukraine to send the message to Russia and the world that we will not stand by while sovereign countries are invaded. Ukraine deserves to be free and we will not stop until Russian troops are out of Ukraine.“In the face of Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked barbarism, we must continue to support the Ukrainian people in their fight for democracy. Senator Portman and I went to Ukraine and met with President Zelenskyy and Defense Minister Reznikov to discuss the status of the war and America's ongoing economic, humanitarian, and military assistance. One of the most pressing issues we discussed is the Russian capture of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency must be allowed to access the plant and Russia should agree to a demilitarized zone around it in order to prevent a catastrophe. While in Ukraine we also went to Bucha and Irpin, as well as the Antonov Airport in Hostomel, the site where the Ukrainians pushed back Russian advances and ultimately saved Kyiv from Russian control. I saw firsthand the carnage that was inflicted by the Russian army. In Poland, we met with American members of the 101st Airborne Division to get updates on our troops’ coordinated efforts with our NATO Allies. It is clear - the Ukrainian people are committed to protecting their homeland. They will not be beaten down by Putin’s evil, and the U.S. and our allies must continue to support Ukraine as it stands up to Russia,” said Senator Klobuchar.###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/parma-portman-serves-grand-marshal-ukrainian-independence-day-parade,"PARMA, OH – U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) was in Parma, Ohio, to serve as the Grand Marshal for the 11th annual Ukrainian Independence Day Parade, celebrating the 31st anniversary of Ukraine’s Independence. Portman also provided remarks at the post-parade program and Naturalization Ceremony. “I am honored to have served as the Grand Marshal of the Ukrainian Independence Day parade, celebrating 31 years of independence. It was great to see my friends from the Ukrainian American community in Parma and to see all those celebrating the important day,” said Portman. “Unfortunately, Ukraine’s independence has never been more threatened than it is right now. Russia’s ongoing brutal and unprovoked assault continues to cause destruction and devastation throughout Ukraine. It is more important than ever to do everything in our power to help our ally Ukraine – I continue to work closely with other members of Congress, the administration, our allies and partners in Ukraine and in the region, to ensure the speedy delivery of military, economic and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine so that they may finally defeat their Russian aggressors.”As co-founder and co-chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus and a senior member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Senator Portman has met numerous times with Ukrainian officials, gone to Ukraine seven times, and has been a staunch ally in their defense of their homeland and democracy. A consistent voice for Ukraine, including speaking consistently on the Senate floor since before the Russian invasion began, the administration has heeded bipartisan calls led by Portman for sanctions on trade, banking, energy, and tax, in addition to more lethal weaponry. Senator Portman continues his support for Ukraine as media coverage has fallen, and has commended allies for their continued support.  Earlier this year, Senator Portman attended a prayer service and rally for Ukraine in Parma, where he commended Ohio’s Ukrainian community for leading efforts to support the people of Ukraine during the invasion, while also coordinating humanitarian aid for those fleeing the violence. He also attended a rally in Washington, D.C., where he spoke in support of Ukraine, calling on Congress and the Biden administration to do more to help Ukraine defend itself by sending more weapons; cutting off President Putin’s funding for his war effort by not buying Russian oil; and, removing all Russian banks from their access to the international banking system.Photos of today’s parade can be found below:###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/canton-portman-visits-marathon-refinery-receives-energy-education-champion,"CANTON, OH – U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) visited the Marathon Refinery – located 60 miles southeast of Cleveland, Ohio, Marathon Refinery has a crude oil refining capacity of 100,000 barrels per calendar day (bpcd). The Canton refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into gasoline, distillates, asphalt, roofing flux, propane, refinery-grade propylene and slurry. Product distribution occurs through pipeline, transport truck and rail.While at the refinery, Senator Portman received the Energy Education Champion Award from Ohio Oil and Gas Energy Education Program Executive Director George Brown. The Ohio Oil and Gas Energy Education Program (OOGEEP) is a non-profit energy education and public outreach organization and is considered a creditable resource by the educational, emergency response, regulatory and general public communities. “It was great to visit with the folks from Marathon’s Canton Refinery, which has a capacity of refining 100,000 barrels per day of crude oil and supports more than 320 jobs in the community,” said Portman. “I also want to thank the Ohio Oil and Gas Energy Education Program for awarding me with the 2022 Energy Education Champion Award. Ohio’s energy production and refining resources play a critical role in supporting our nation’s economic and energy security.”While in office, Portman has pushed for an all-of-the-above approach to energy that reduces America’s dependence on foreign oil and ensures we have access to reliable, affordable and cleaner domestic energy. Ohio has an abundance of natural resources - including natural gas, coal, solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, oil, and bio-mass - as well as a skilled workforce, advanced technologies, and strong research and manufacturing capabilities.

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cleveland-portman-leads-roundtable-discussion-great-lakes-conservation-and,"CLEVELAND, OH – U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) led a roundtable discussion with Cleveland Metroparks and The Port of Cleveland to discuss relevant updates to conservation and operations in the area. The Port of Cleveland leadership and private sector partners provided updates on the Cleveland Harbor, shipping, and Port operations. Cleveland Metroparks leadership and partners provided an update on the Cleveland Harbor Eastern Embayment Resilience Study (CHEERS) initiative and related efforts relating to lake conservation, protection, and enhancing public access.  “Thanks to the Port of Cleveland, Cleveland Metroparks, and all other partners for participating in our informative and collaborative roundtable discussion,” said Portman. “It was great to hear more about current Port operations, especially given our country’s ongoing supply chain issues, and to hear about the Metroparks’ important conservation efforts – allowing visitors to enjoy all that the parks have to offer for years to come.” The Port of Cleveland is one of the largest ports on the Great Lakes. Over 20,000 jobs and $3.5 billion in annual economic activity are tied to the roughly 13 million tons of cargo that move through Cleveland Harbor each year. The Port of Cleveland is the only local government agency whose sole mission is to spur job creation and economic vitality in Cuyahoga County. It also serves as an economic engine for the local community, a key to Northeast Ohio’s global competitiveness, and a crucial partner in building Cuyahoga County’s future.Established in 1917, Cleveland Metroparks spans more than 24,000 acres across Northeast Ohio including 18 reservations, more than 300 miles of trails, eight golf courses, eight lakefront parks, dining and retail venues, and nationally acclaimed Cleveland Metroparks Zoo. The Park District offers thousands of education and recreation programs and events each year across the 49 communities it serves, helping to create connections to nature and promote conservation and sustainability. Cleveland Metroparks is the recipient of the 2021 National Gold Medal “Best in Nation” Award for Excellence in Parks and Recreation Management.Senator Portman has led efforts to reauthorize and secure funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI), a results-driven program that is addressing the most serious issues that threaten the ecological and economic wellbeing of the Great Lakes basin. The FY 2022 spending bill includes $348 million for the GLRI, which is $18 million above the FY 2021 spending level of $330 million. This funding for FY 2022 is in addition to the $200 million for the GLRI in FY2022 that Portman worked to secure as part of his bipartisan Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act, which will provide the GLRI a total of $1 billion over the next five years.In addition, earlier this year, Portman applauded the Army Corps FY 2022 spend plan – which will benefit ports like the Port of Cleveland – for its first round of IIJA funding. It included critical investments for the State of Ohio, totaling more than $20 million. In total, the IIJA provides the Army Corps $17.1 billion in additional funding.

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-lauds-announcement-poland-will-receive-abrams-tanks-made-ohio,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) applauded the announcement that the U.S. Army will provide Poland with 250 M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams main battle tanks – worth up to $1.148 billion.“The delivery of these world-class Ohio-made tanks to Poland will promote stability in Eastern Europe and deter Russia’s aggression in the region. Outfitting our Polish allies with these tanks signals to Russia that we remain committed to standing with our allies in the face on ongoing Russian aggression,” said Portman. “I am proud that the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center in Lima produces the world’s best tanks, supporting both our troops home and our most critical allies.”The Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), signed into law last December, provided $1.35 billion in funding for Abrams tanks and continue the production of the M1A2 SEPv3 upgraded Abrams tanks at the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center (JSMC) in Lima, Ohio, in order to ensure that our forward-deployed soldiers have tanks with the most cutting-edge capabilities. Portman has been a staunch supporter of the JSMC and visited the JSMC in 2019, where he met the new Installation Commander, received a briefing on how funding he helped secure is leading to increased employment, and saw the latest work on the Abrams Tank. While the Obama administration proposed shuttering the plant in 2011, Portman has made a commitment to safeguarding the long-term viability of the JSMC, ensuring this vital facility can continue its critical work on the military’s Abrams tank.###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-applauds-plan-ohio-plug-least-170-orphaned-wells,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) applauded the announcement that the U.S. Department of the Interior will award Ohio an initial grant of $25 million to begin work to plug, cap, and reclaim orphaned oil and gas wells throughout the state. The money being awarded today was made available through Portman’s bipartisan infrastructure law.  “I am pleased that the Department of the Interior has provided Ohio with the much-needed resources to plug more than 170 orphaned oil and gas wells across the state,” said Portman. “Cleaning up these wells is an important way keep our communities and recreations areas safe, while also spurring economic growth. This is yet another example of how the bipartisan Infrastructure law is making a difference in Ohio.” “The safety and protection of Ohioans and our landscape is a priority under the DeWine-Husted Administration,” said Ohio Governor Mike DeWine. “Our Ohio Department of Natural Resources has worked hard for the past two years to expand their orphan well program and steadily increase the number of wells plugged each year. We look forward to the opportunity to make even more progress in plugging Ohio’s orphaned oil and gas wells.”The State of Ohio has indicated that it will utilize this funding to plug between 170 and 320 documented wells, including many located in the Appalachian region. Funds will also be used to research how to track and measure methane. Ohio plans to sample private and public water supplies that are within 500 feet of an orphaned well before and after plugging.  The bipartisan IIJA provided a total of $21 billion to address legacy pollution, including funding to clean up brownfield and superfund sites, reclaim abandoned mine lands, and plug orphan oil and gas wells. Specifically, IIJA provided $4.7 billion to plug orphan wells. ###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sandusky-portman-highlights-raise-grant-during-press-conference,"SANDUSKY, OH – Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) joined a press conference with U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to highlight the recent $24 million Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability & Equity (RAISE) grant awarded to the Ohio Department of Transportation. This award will be used in Erie County to fund improvements of the US Route 6 Connectivity Corridor, which will replace approximately five existing intersections with roundabouts along Route 6 and Rye Beach Road. The money will also be used to install part of the Sandusky Bay Pathway and a multi-use path along US6 and Rye Beach Road.“I’m pleased that through the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act we are able to provide more than $24 million in grant money to Erie County. This grant will go a long way in improving roadways and bicycle and pedestrian amenities in the area, increasing safety and efficiency, while also creating needed jobs,” said Portman. “Seeing the real-life impact of the bipartisan infrastructure law is why I worked so hard in Senate to get it signed into law.” The RAISE grant program provides funding for surface transportation projects of local and regional significance. Previously, this program has been funded at $1 billion per year. Thanks to the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which Portman spearheaded and was signed into law last November, annual funding levels have been increased to $1.5 billion. Between the IIJA and the FY 2022 Consolidated Appropriations Act, the RAISE grant program has been funded at $2.25 billion for this year.Photos of the event can be found below: ###

This will also add to record inflation and is not the way to grow our economy in the long-term. Finally, there is also considerable uncertainty about the legality of this unprecedented administrative action.” ###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-commemorates-ukrainian-independence-day-praises-3-billion,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) issued the following statement after President Biden announced the largest security package to Ukraine to date, valued at $3 billion. As Co-Chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus and member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Portman has long been a staunch defender of Ukraine and has spoken consistently on the Senate floor since the Russian invasion began. The funding for the announced assistance package comes from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, a program which Portman wrote into law as part of the Fiscal Year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act.“As we pause with our ally Ukraine in order to commemorate the 31st anniversary of its independence, we also must mark the six-month anniversary of Russia’s brutal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. Unfortunately, Ukraine is no stranger to Russian aggression, dating all the way back to repeated oppression from Russian czars, the Bolsheviks and Stalin’s Holodomor atrocity.“However, from generation to generation the Ukrainian people have always exhibited courage, bravery and undying hope as they fight for their freedom. These are the traits they exhibit today as they fight against the odds to be free from Russian aggression and it is the reason Russia has not been able to conquer their country.“This war is not just a fight for Ukraine but for the future of freedom in eastern Europe. For this reason, I am pleased to see the administration commit to a $3 billion military aid package to this effort today. This is being carried out through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which I created and wrote into law at the outset of Russia’s military aggression seven years ago. “This tranche of military assistance – the largest that the U.S. has ever provided to Ukraine – will send an important message to Russia and the world that the United States is committed in the long-term to the cause of a free and independent Ukraine.” ###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-announces-18-million-new-funding-ohio-airport-under-bipartisan,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) applauded the announcement that Licking County Regional Airport Authority is set to receive a grant made available through the Airport Terminal Program. This grant program provides funding for terminal, on-airport rail access, and airport-owned airport traffic control tower projects. Thanks to the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which Portman spearheaded and was signed into law last November, the Airport Terminal Program will provide a total of $5 billion in funding over five years. It is one of three new aviation programs created by the bipartisan infrastructure law.“This announcement is great news for Licking County and all those who use the Newark-Heath Airport. Thanks to the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and this new airport funding, our aging airport facilities can finally be upgraded, leading to better functionality and efficiency for Ohio travelers,” said Portman.The Licking County Regional Airport Authority will receive almost $1.85 million so that they may construct a new terminal building at the Newark-Heath Airport in Newark, Ohio, locating the new terminal outside of the taxiway object free area.The bipartisan infrastructure law provides $1 billion per year for this program over the next five years. It also ensures the FAA awards projects at large, medium, and small hub airports as well as non-hub and non-primary airports each award cycle.###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cincinnati-portman-leads-roundtable-discussion-addressing-ongoing-addiction,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) led a roundtable discussion with Hamilton County Addiction Response Coalition (HC ARC), law enforcement, and other stakeholders to discuss opiate addiction, the rise in fentanyl overdoses in Ohio and across the U.S., and efforts to address those issues – both on a local and national level. Senator Portman received an update from HC ARC on their Quick Response Teams Expansion & Deflection efforts through Federal CARA Comprehensive Opioid, Stimulant, and Substance Abuse Program (COSSAP) dollars, including from the African American Engagement Workgroup (funded through the SSI/SSDI Outreach, Access, and Recovery, or SOAR, program), which served as a technical advisor to the African American Male Outreach Program.“I want to thank all those who participated in today’s constructive roundtable discussion. I also appreciated the update from Hamilton County Addiction Response Coalition on their important work to treat those with addiction. Drug abuse and overdoses continue to plague not only our community, but communities all across our country, and have been made worse by the pandemic. I’m proud our community is working together to tackle this issue,” said Portman. “With drug overdoses reaching an all-time high, it is more urgent than ever that Congress do everything in its power to help address this problem. My CARA 3.0 legislation would do just that by providing adequate and sustained resources that appropriately reflect the magnitude of the drug crisis. Given the critical nature of this crisis, it is urgent that Congress move quickly to consider and pass this legislation.”As part of his efforts to help Ohio, Portman has worked to help stop the influx of synthetic drugs like fentanyl, expand access to treatment programs that are critical to an effective recovery, and secure additional funding for evidenced-based Comprehensive Addiction & Recovery Act (CARA) programs focused on prevention, treatment, recovery, and first responders. During today’s roundtable, Senator Portman highlighted his Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) 3.0, legislation, which would increase the funding authorization levels for the CARA programs and put in place additional policy reforms and new programs to help combat the opioid epidemic that has worsened during the coronavirus pandemic.

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-announces-over-32-million-modernize-ohios-bus-fleets-and-facilities,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) applauded the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Transit Administration (FTA) announcement that $32.3 million in grants have been made available to help modernize Ohio’s bus fleets and facilities by helping transit agencies purchase or lease low- or no- emission vehicles.“This is great news for Ohio. Thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law, these additional funds will help transit authorities all around Ohio improve their bus fleets – leading to not only lower carbon emissions nationwide, but also good-paying jobs and better transportation,” said Portman.The FTA investments announced today include:The Low or No Emission (Low-No) Grant Program provides funding to state and local governments to purchase or lease of zero-emission and low-emission transit buses, including acquisition, construction, and leasing of required supporting facilities such as recharging, refueling, and maintenance facilities. A minimum 25 percent of the awards must go toward low emission projects other than zero emission/electric vehicles and related facilities. The bipartisan infrastructure law provides $5.5 billion over five years for the Low-No Program — more than 10 times greater than the previous five years of funding. For FY 2022, approximately $1.1 billion will be available for grants under this program.NOTE: In May, Portman sent letters to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg in support of PARTA and COTA’s application for the Low or No Emission grant.###

The SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act bill is named in honor of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson, a central Ohio veteran who was deployed to Kosovo and Iraq with the Ohio National Guard and passed away in 2020 as a result of his exposure to burn pits while deployed. The legislation overwhelmingly passed the Senate with a vote of 84-14 with Portman’s support. “We owe our veterans a debt of gratitude for the safety and freedom we enjoy every day. It is our duty to stand by them and ensure transparency in the tracking of illnesses connected to their service, specifically burn pit exposure,” said Portman. “I am pleased that this legislation has finally been signed into law to ensure that thousands of veterans who have been exposed to toxic chemicals while serving our country get the medical care and disability benefits they deserve.”The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022 will:###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-applauds-chips-act-becoming-law-creating-thousands-jobs-central,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) attended the White House signing ceremony where President Biden signed into law the CHIPS Act, bipartisan legislation to incentivize semiconductor manufacturing in the United States, make our supply chains more resilient, enhance our national security, and strengthen our economy. He issued the following statement: “Today, our national security and manufacturing capabilities are getting the competitive edge they need with the bipartisan CHIPS Act now law. I was proud to help lead efforts in the Senate to pass this legislation and ensure that thousands of good-paying jobs came to Ohio with Intel’s planned semiconductor plant. Intel’s announced investment is already the largest in Ohio’s history and the company has indicated that with this CHIPS legislation its record investment will grow even larger over time. Now, with the CHIPS Act becoming law, we can help bring back semiconductor manufacturing to the United States, create thousands of high-paying jobs, and strengthen our national security.” NOTE: This bipartisan legislation includes two Portman priorities. First is the Investing in Domestic Semiconductor Manufacturing Act, which ensures that the CHIPS Act financial assistance grant program includes upstream semiconductor equipment and materials manufacturers. This language will ensure that the $52 billion in CHIPS Act investments help onshore the entire semiconductor supply chain and will support current and future semiconductor suppliers in Ohio, as they look to support Intel’s fabrication site in Central Ohio. Secondly, the bill also includes a key provision from Portman’s Secure Research Data Network Act, establishing a National Secure Data Service demonstration project within the National Science Foundation to help ensure and encourage data linkage between federal agencies for the purposes of statistical research. In order to ensure the data being shared between government agencies is secure and encrypted, the bill includes the privacy requirements established in Section 3 of Portman’s Secure Research Data Network Act. ###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-announces-over-7-million-raise-grant-mansfield,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation is awarding the City of Mansfield a $7 million federal grant through the FY 2022 Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability & Equity (RAISE) discretionary grant program. The RAISE grant program provides funding for surface transportation projects of local and regional significance. Previously, this program has been funded at $1 billion per year. Thanks to the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which Portman spearheaded and was signed into law last November, annual funding levels have been increased to $1.5 billion. Between the IIJA and the FY 2022 Consolidated Appropriations Act, the RAISE grant program has been funded at $2.25 billion for this year. The $7.38 million grant will help fund the city’s Main Street Revitalization project, as known as Mansfield Rising. This project will reconstruct the downtown Mansfield Streetscape from First Street to Fifth Street, including updated LED street lighting, new curbs and ADA compliant curb ramps, concrete sidewalks, brick pavers, delineated crosswalks, lighted plazas with seating. It will also rejoin Central Park via a mid-block crossing, reestablish two-way traffic to support local business, and provide on-street parking. In addition, aging water and sewer infrastructure will be replaced.“This is great news for the city of Mansfield. I applaud the Department of Transportation for providing Ohio with the resources needed to revitalize communities,” said Portman. “By updating and improving aging infrastructure, this project will strengthen the region’s economy and improve quality of life for all residents.”NOTE: In April, Portman sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg in support of the City of Mansfield’s application for the RAISE grant.###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/portman-difference/fox-business-kudlow-portman-discusses-democrats-reckless-tax-spending,"Senator Portman joined FOX Business’ Kudlow this afternoon to discuss the consequences of the Democrats’ “Inflation Reduction Act” that recently passed the Senate. Portman noted the new tax hikes that will hurt Americans in every tax bracket, kill jobs, and make inflation worse, contrary to the name of the bill. Portman criticized the Democrats’ proposed tax on book income, noting that attempting to tax companies based on their financial statements instead of their taxable income is the wrong approach that will hurt industries like manufacturing the most by discouraging investments in the equipment manufacturers need to succeed. Portman, before casting his vote in opposition to this partisan legislation, spoke on the Senate floor against this proposal. A transcript of the interview can be found below and you can also watch the interview here.  SENATOR PORTMAN ON RECONCILIATION AND INFLATION “Well Larry, we had some wins and a lot of losses, unfortunately, in the last 48 hours on this. One of the small wins is that we finally convinced them that you ought not to subject manufacturers who are taking advantage of the ability to write off investments in equipment, you ought not to include them under the book tax. So that was carved out but that is little solace because unfortunately, what they did was they then turned around, and not only didn't carve out other things they should have including oil and gas industry, coal industry, including for ESOPs, employee stock ownership plans but also, they added a new tax to make up for the tax revenue lost that was going to occur relative to their initial proposal because of the manufacturing carveout. So, it's unfortunately not much better but to your point, the last thing we want to do is discourage investment in America. This bill does that but it doesn't do quite as badly as was initially calculated to do. …“Larry, one thing they did was pull out Spectrum at the last minute, and that was one of the small wins we got in the last 48 hours, but there has been no process here. This is called reconciliation. That means the Democrats can do it without a single Republican vote. It has to be related to the budget, but it also means it doesn't go through the committees. In other words, the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee never looked at any of this or knows what the consequences are. So, the new excise tax, whether you pull Spectrum out or you don't, what happens with manufacturers, all this was done at the last minute in the dark of the night. That is not how we ought to be legislating. America's economy is the envy of the world, and there are a lot of reasons for that. One is that we have relatively low taxes, relatively low regulations- well in most areas, and we encourage people to take that risk and to create something of value for themselves in their workforce This is picking at it, just piece by piece. It is an unforced error. It’s going to make us less competitive. It’s going to hurt lower and middle-income workers, and it’s going to hurt consumers. “When you tax these companies, who, by the way, are following the tax laws, these Byzantine tax laws, you're actually hurting the workers in the companies and the consumers. That’s what all the economic studies show. We also know that this bill is not going to reduce inflation because we have studies, including from this organization that Democrats have used in the past to look at these tax bills, that is saying that it is going to add to inflation over the next two years. So, that's true as well. We don't have a bill here that helps with regard to the tax code. It makes it more complicated. It makes the economy less efficient. But it also is not going to help in terms of the biggest issue we face right now which is spiraling inflation.“Well, you're right, and I mentioned this study earlier, the Penn Wharton study, that said it actually adds to inflation. They also look at the economic growth here, and they come up with zero.”SENATOR PORTMAN ON TAXING INVESTMENT “Now what they did was, to make up for that difference, in part, they put an excise tax on stock buybacks. What does that mean? Well it's one percent, so they say it is not going to affect it much, but by the way, you can dial up one percent pretty easily. It's a new tax in essence. So, just as the new book tax is a new tax system for larger companies, they now have to calculate their taxes, adding a lot of complexity both in terms of the IRS income definition but now also the book tax, the new book tax income definition. But also, they're now is a new excise tax for the first time on stock buybacks. The effect of that, in my view, is to discourage companies from helping to improve the price of the stock, which helps retirement plans and a lot of other investors at a time when they have excess cash available. It’s a relatively good place for them to invest in my view. So, there is a lot of stuff in here that discourages me, Larry, but the worst thing to me, the health care stuff, the energy stuff, what they're doing in terms of these various tax provisions, the worst thing is they added a plot of complexity to the tax code. Not just tax credits, and other preferences on the energy side, but also this new book tax. This new book tax that just affects certain businesses and not others and then this excise tax that is new as well. So, I think it is really sad what's happened. My hope is that with a Republican Congress and a Republican president, we can reverse all of this and get back to a simpler tax system that encourages economic growth.”SENATOR PORTMAN ON THE NEED FOR PRO-GROWTH POLICIES“In other words, they think there is no growth potential in this. I would argue that it actually, again, is going to hurt in terms of complexity. The other thing that is interesting is when you set up a new tax system, like the book tax, managers and companies are now going to manage towards that. In other words, taxes matter. So, it is inefficient to be managing a company, making decisions as to the allocation of capital based on a new tax system, and that is one of the things actually raised by the CPAs, the AICPA organization, American Association of CPAs, came out against all this, even though it adds to complexity which, in the end, helps them and helps the accounting firms in general because there will be more companies coming down and saying, ‘What do I do here?’ But, they said, you know, this is not smart in terms of what you're talking about which is, making smart decisions on behalf of, you know, the Adam Smith past of our country which every little decision we make out there in the market should be towards efficiency and creating more economic opportunity for everyone. “By the way, we were doing pretty well on that before the pandemic hit. We had 19 straight months of over wage growth. We had the lowest poverty rate in the history of the country. Things were going well. We had the lowest unemployment rate ever for Blacks and Hispanics. So, we were doing some of those right things with regard to taxes and regulations which ended up helping everybody, an opportunity economy.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-floor-portman-opposes-democrats-reckless-tax-spending-bill,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Tonight on the Senate floor, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) spoke in opposition to the Democrats’ “Inflation Reduction Act” and highlighted the fact that it will actually make inflation worse and increase taxes on small businesses and working Americans. Senator Portman has long said adding more stimulus to the economy is a bad idea during record inflation, and will only increase costs for businesses and customers while killing over 200,000 jobs. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, and Republican leader on the Senate Committee for Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Senator Portman also discussed several amendments to the legislation he may offer that would let Americans keep more of their hard-earned money in their retirement accounts, provide $500 million to the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol to help combat drug cartels and traffickers at our southern border, and ensure new Postal Service electric vehicles are made in America.A transcript of Senator Portman’s remarks can be found below and a video can be found here. “Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to talk about the partisan reconciliation legislation that is before us tonight. It's named the Inflation Reduction Act, but that's misnamed because, unfortunately, it does not reduce inflation, it actually makes things worse. So, when you're at the gas pump or grocery store or buying something anywhere today, you're feeling the sticker shock, and yet, this legislation is going to make it even worse. It adds $700 billion more in spending and over $300 billion more in new taxes at the worst possible time, increasing costs to consumers and actually making inflation worse. “The nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model that a lot of us have used over the years to look at various legislation, predicts it will increase inflation over the next two years. While over time it says it may even out, it won't decrease inflation as the name suggests and the bill sponsors claim. Why? Well, primarily because when you put $300 billion plus of new taxes on the economy it actually hurts workers and hurts consumers. Yes, they're saying it's going to go to companies, but what happens then? Companies pass it along, and at a time when we have the worst inflation in over 40 years that's bad for the economy. “The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation that we have to rely on here in Congress, not a partisan group, nonpartisan, says this will hurt Americans in nearly every tax bracket. They say more than half of the burden of the over $300 billion in new taxes will fall on folks making less than $400,000 a year. Well, that directly contradicts promises made not to increase taxes on Americans at that level. I'm glad the blow of manufacturers has been somewhat softened in the last 24 hours with the latest version of the bill. What the Democrats did was essentially exchange one bad tax, the book tax on manufacturers, for another bad tax, a tax that will actually tax stock buybacks. That's going to hurt particularly Americans who are trying to save for retirement. Let me start with the with book tax. This is a proposed tax that is very different from the existing cooperate income tax, which is based on income that businesses report to the IRS when they file their taxes. That IRS income, by the way, is defined by the U.S. Congress. “Here in the Senate, we debate that all the time. Is it good to have a particular incentive or another tax incentive? That is not in the book tax. The book tax instead looks at a company's financial statement and that’s what this new bill does. In fact, it comes up with a whole other definition of tax called the adjustment financial statement income. This is broader than the IRS income. It's not fair. It’s way too complicated and it's going to hurt employees and consumers. Taxable income owed to the IRS is meant to raise revenue and again includes these incentives or disincentives for certain activities like being able to immediately deduct the cost of new equipment if you're a manufacturer. “We want to encourage that, particularly in periods of high inflation, so we allow them to do that. The financial statement income is not determined by us, not determined by elected representatives at all. In fact, Congress does not have anything to do with it. It's actually determined by something called the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which is a private nonprofit recognized by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as the accounting standard setting for private companies. That may work fine for determining accounting standards, but this change effectively puts these people in control of what the corporate tax base is even though they're not elected to anything. That doesn't make sense. “Let's not set up a whole new tax system for some companies. Let's learn from the past. Back in 1986, when we passed a big tax reform bill, they put a book tax in place. And it was repealed less than three years later. Why? Because it was viewed as unfair, way too complicated and actually they thought that you shouldn't have nonelected officials deciding what the taxes ought to be. They said it was bad for the economy too because companies were managing to the book tax rather than the IRS tax. So let's learn from the past. Why would we want to do that again? Set up a whole another tax system, tax the American economy, tax consumers, tax workers and do so through something that in 1986 we looked at and decided this is not working. “So Democrats will say tonight, ‘Well this new complicated tax system is just going to affect big companies.’ That’s true, but you know what big companies employ a lot of people and a lot of people are going to be hurt. They sell is to a lot of consumers, all of us will be hurt. Last year there were over 200 companies listed on the Fortune 500 as meeting criteria that is set out in this legislation. They employ over 18 million Americans. It's those employees and those who are customers who will bear the brunt of tax increases as it's passed to them in the form of lower wages, lower benefits and higher prices for goods and services. The Joint Committee on Taxation, nonpartisan group, just last year said they expect that 25 percent of these corporate taxes to fall on workers. “Again, this means lower wages. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that employees and workers bear more like 70 percent of the burden of income taxes. So, there’s a long list of analyses in between. Twenty five percent and 70 percent of these taxes are going to fall on workers in the form of lower pay and lower benefits. At a time when wages are not keeping up with inflation, it's getting higher and higher. 
“By the way, it's not just wages we're talking about. Families will now face even higher prices as the cost of corporate taxes get passed along to them. In a study last year performed by the business schools at the University of Chicago and Northwestern, they found 31 percent of cooperate taxes fall on consumers through higher retail taxes. Aren't prices high enough? Democrats added another new tax in the past 24 hours. Democrats now say we're going to have this complicated tax called an excise tax on stock buybacks. This is instead of some of the tax they had in the other new tax they put forward called the book tax. Now, Democrats, tonight will talk about how taxing buybacks is good because it somehow hurts Wall Street fat cats. “Here's the truth. It increases the price of stocks to allow buybacks and by taking away that incentive by putting a tax on it, there will be less of it. So, the reality is this is a tax on working families including those trying to save for retirement when they are already dealing with the struggling portfolios due to the recent economic contraction and record inflation we're experiencing. Fifty eight percent of Americans own stock and 60 million investors invest in an individual retirement accounts or a 401(k). “We want people to save for retirement. It's a good thing. We want them to have healthy retirements. So, when Democrats say they worry about tax prices going up, I have to ask why are they worried about people having a healthy retirement account? Again, when companies buy back stocks it generally causes that stocks to go up which means it makes Americans’ retirement accounts that much larger. Why is that a problem? The Tax Foundation says retirement accounts own 37 percent of all corporate stock. That's about $8.5 trillion in retirement funds. $8.5 trillion of retirement funds earn corporate stock. Americans lost about $2 trillion of I.R.As in the COVID crisis, let’s not encourage them to lose anymore. “Some will say, ‘Gosh, this is just one percent.’ Well, we know that once a tax is initiated it tends to increase. This is the camel's nose under the tent. The first income tax in 1913, by the way, was one percent and just on top earners. I think a lot of middle-income earners right now would be happy to have a tax rate that low. This type of proposal will impact families and their retirement. For that reason we should not even go down this path. Democrats will also tax employee stock ownership programs, or ESOPs, in this package. “I think some of my colleagues maybe surprised to hear that. ESPOs are plans that give employees ownership of their own companies with tax incentives for the dividends to go to retirement savings. They’re really popular. ESOPs work, they're great. They enjoy bipartisan support in the Congress. Employers have this ownership stake and because of that companies tend to do better. Employees are happier, they’re more profitable, they’re more productive, the companies benefit from it. I don’t understand why Democrats want to punish this ownership structure. Doing so will once again discourage investment and hard work and it could not come at a worse time. That's why I'll introduce an amendment that will exempt ESOPs from the minimum book tax. “This is a common sense amendment. Nothing complicated about it. It will encourage savings in investment. It’s good for the country and I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who support ESOPs to support the amendment. I also plan to offer an amendment that will increase funding for Customs and Border Patrol by $500 million that will be used for new technology to detect fentanyl and other dangerous drugs that are unfortunately flooding across our southern border. Over 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses last year. The worst year on record. “Unfortunately, more and more people are dying of overdoses and they’re dying from this synthetic opioid called fentanyl. About two thirds of those overdose deaths were due to fentanyl. At a time when deadly fentanyl is flooding across the border, only two percent of cars and 16 percent of commercial vehicles are being screened. Now, these drugs come across the ports of entry where only two percent of cars and 16 percent of trucks are being screened. They also come between the ports of entry. At a minimum we should be able to do screening of these vehicles and trucks. “It's a gaping hole in border security and got to be fixed. This amendment will simply ensure the new funds in this bill for the Department of Homeland Security bureaucracy for an office called Readiness, $500 million will be assigned to a higher priority to have customs and border protection be able to detect and stop deadly fentanyl that is being smuggled into this country at record levels. So, this money would stay at the Department of Homeland Security. “It will instead be used for more urgent priority. Let's be serious about our national security and this drug crisis we face and let's give the Border Patrol what they need to counter the drug cartels and traffickers. Tonight I also plan to offer an amendment to ensure that the new postal electric vehicles are actually made in the United States of America. In this bill there is a $3 billion appropriation to the Postal Service. We just went through postal reform as some of you know. We provided them additional funding they needed. This is an additional three billion dollar appropriation to buy electric vehicles and charging infrastructure. “However, there is no requirement that these vehicles be made in America. With U.S. batteries and other components. In other words, the bill uses taxpayer funds to buy electric vehicles that can be made with Chinese batteries and Chinese critical minerals. We know that this is counter to everything we're trying to do around here. We just passed legislation to make us more competitive with China. Again, we just passed legislation to provide the Post Office with funds for new vehicles including electric vehicles. “The Postmaster General made a decision to go from 10 percent electric to 20 percent to 50 percent. That's already happening. But in that case there are requirements. In this case there are not. We know that Democrats believe that when we're expanding electric vehicles that we ought to ensure that these vehicles are being made in America. How do we know that? Because in another part of the bill, which is the expansion of the electric vehicle tax credit, Democrats included new requirements that the tax credit reward EVs made in the United States with American components. “My amendment would simply imply that these identical requirements to these new electric postal delivery vehicles. Both involve taxpayer subsidies. What's good for the American driver should be good for the Postal Service. My hope is that this misnamed Inflation Reduction Act can be stopped before it makes things worse but at least I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to look at these commonsense amendments and accept some of these amendments. Some I've laid out, some others have talked about tonight to improve a flawed bill. With that hope, I yield the floor.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/robs-rundown/robs-rundown-week-august-1-august-5-2022,"Senator Portman was back in Washington this week where he spoke on the Senate floor for the 20th consecutive session week regarding the situation in Ukraine. Senator Portman discussed the progress made over the last five months since Russia has waged its war against innocent Ukrainians. Portman laid out how Russia has a long history of oppressing Ukrainian identity, language, and culture going back hundreds of years, and how that oppression continues today in its brutal war against Ukraine. Heeding bipartisan calls from Congress, the United States has sent Ukraine over a dozen High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems or HIMARS to strike Russian forces from long distances. These weapons have been crucial to Ukraine’s attempts to slow Russia’s advance in the Donbas and to liberate territory in the south. On Tuesday, Senator Portman joined FOX Business’ Cavuto: Coast to Coast to discuss the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan. Senator Portman, who visited Taiwan in April as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation, voiced his support for the visit. Portman also touched on the Democrats’ new tax and spending bill, which includes $326 billion in new taxes and is pro-inflationary. Portman explained that this is exactly the opposite of what Congress should be doing right now, with the country being in a recession.On Tuesday evening, Senator Portman spoke on the Senate floor where he delivered remarks outlining the harmful consequences of the tax on manufacturing, or “book tax,” in the Democrats’ new reckless tax and spending proposal. Portman discussed his concerns with the new tax hike, including the fact that it undermines business investment and job creation and raises prices for working families already facing skyrocketing inflation. On Wednesday afternoon, Senator Portman joined his fellow Senate Finance Committee Republicans at a press conference to discuss the Democrats’ new reckless tax and spend proposal, the Inflation Reduction Act – which will raise taxes for millions of lower and middle-income Americans amid high inflation and economic stagnation. Portman discussed his concerns with the new book tax proposed in this bill, which will place a massive burden on manufacturers all around the country – leading to a decrease in domestic business investment and job creation and an increase in prices for working families already facing skyrocketing inflation.On Thursday, Senator Portman joined Senator Brown to ask unanimous consent for the Senate to pass their bipartisan, bicameral Susan Muffley Act, to restore retirement benefits to over 20,000 Delphi Salaried Retirees. Their request was blocked.Also on Thursday, Portman along with Senators Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), James Lankford (R-OK), and Mark Kelly (D-AZ) introduced the bipartisan Border Patrol Enhancement Act to establish the Border Patrol Reserve and provide a much-needed pay raise to our Border Patrol agents during this current border crisis. This bill would create a 2,500 agent reserve force, increase the number of total Border Patrol agents to 20,500, and raise Border Patrol pay by 14 percent.Senator Portman detailed his concerns with a new tax on manufacturing, or “book tax” in the Democrats’ latest reckless tax and spending bill in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. Portman discussed the far-reaching consequences of the tax on manufacturing in his op-ed, notably that about 200 American companies that employ nearly 20 million Americans will be affected by the book tax should it become law, which translates into lower wages at a time when wages are already struggling to keep up with inflation. For a more detailed look at Senator Portman’s week, please see the following:Tuesday, August 2, 2022Portman, Senate Colleagues Support Visit to Taiwan by Speaker PelosiToday, U.S. Senator Rob Portman and 23 of his colleagues issued the following joint statement in support of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stopping in Taiwan during her diplomatic trip to Asia.“We support Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan. For decades, members of the United States Congress, including a previous Speaker of the House, have traveled to Taiwan. This travel is consistent with the United States’ One China policy to which we are committed. We are also committed now, more than ever, to all elements of the Taiwan Relations Act.”Joining Portman were Senators Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Mitch McConnell (R-KY), John Thune (R-SD), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Jim Risch (R-ID), Roy Blunt (R-MO), John Cornyn (R-TX), John Barrasso (R-WY), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Steve Daines (R-MT), Susan Collins (R-ME), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Todd Young (R-IN), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Richard Burr (R-NC), John Boozman (R-AR), and Tim Scott (R-SC).Portman, Brown Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Study Feasibility of Ohio’s Buckeye Trail Becoming a National Scenic TrailU.S. Senators Rob Portman and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) introduced legislation to authorize a feasibility study to determine if the Buckeye Trail – a more than 1,400 mile trail that circles the state of Ohio – is eligible to be designated as part of the National Scenic Trails System.“The Buckeye Trail provides Ohioans from all across the state access to world-class outdoor recreation, whether it is in Cuyahoga Valley National Park, the Hocking Hills region, my home in Cincinnati, or in Northwestern Ohio,” said Senator Portman. “I am proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation to see if the Buckeye Trail is eligible to become a National Scenic Trail, so that we may encourage Ohioans and Americans across the country to experience the beauty Ohio has to offer.”“The Buckeye Trail is one of Ohio’s great treasures – extending across Ohio from Lake Erie to the Ohio River, from the farmland of northwest Ohio to the hills of Appalachia and the Bluegrass region of southwest Ohio,” said Senator Brown. “Establishing it as a National Scenic Trail and giving it national recognition will support our tourism economy and help maintain the trail for families across our state.”“The Buckeye Trail Association enthusiastically supports The Buckeye National Scenic Trail Feasibility Act of 2022. Ohio’s Buckeye Trail maximizes outdoor recreation potential and conservation and enjoyment of the nationally significant scenic, historic, natural, and cultural qualities by physically connecting, highlighting, and stewarding sites around the Buckeye State in one unified trail experience. The Buckeye Trail is inspiring and deserving of national consideration. We are pleased that Senators Portman and Brown have been inspired by the trail in their backyards that connects their constituents to the rest of the Buckeye State, and the National Trail System, to elevate Ohio’s treasure for consideration,” said Andrew Bashaw, Executive Director, Buckeye Trail Association.The Buckeye Trail is located entirely within Ohio. The first 20 miles of the trail were dedicated in 1959 in Hocking County, and the trail was completed in 1980. The trail touches 42 of Ohio’s 88 counties, looping around the entire state, and is Ohio’s longest hiking trail. Each year, the Buckeye Trail welcomes more than four million visitors in the Hocking Hills region and an additional million visitors in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. On FOX Business, Portman Discusses Speaker Pelosi’s Visit to Taiwan, Democrats’ Tax & Spending SpreeSenator Portman joined FOX Business’ Cavuto: Coast to Coast this afternoon to discuss Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan. Senator Portman, who visited Taiwan in April as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation, voiced his support of the visit, saying it is important to show leadership in the region and not back down in the face of China’s increasing aggression.Senator Portman also touched on the Democrats’ new tax and spending bill, which includes $326 billion in new taxes and is pro-inflationary. Portman explained that this is exactly the opposite of what Congress should be doing right now, with the country being in a recession. This bill will inevitably burden American workers and consumers, who are already struggling due to record-high inflation, and does not address the inflationary mismatch between the demand and supply of our economy.You can watch the interview here. Wednesday, August 3, 2022Portman: Biden Administration’s New NEPA Rule is Wrong Approach in Face of Soaring InflationAt a press conference yesterday, Senator Portman discussed his support for S.J. Res. 55, a joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), to nullify the Biden administration’s new regulation, “National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Implementing Regulations Revisions”. These regulations, authored by the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), undermine important provisions in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act intended to streamline key elements of our broken federal permitting process. Senator Portman served as the chief Republican negotiator for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which invested hundreds of billions of dollars in repairing, upgrading and modernizing our nation’s roads, bridges, ports, and included Portman’s Federal Permitting Reform and Jobs Act to make FAST-41 permanent, improve the federal permitting process for some of the largest infrastructure projects, and build on efforts to update this process created in 2015. A video of Senator Portman’s remarks can be found here.On Senate Floor, Portman Discusses Tax on Manufacturing in Democrats’ “Inflation Reduction Act”   Last night, U.S. Senator Rob Portman delivered remarks on the Senate floor outlining the harmful consequences of the tax on manufacturing, or “book tax,” in the Democrats’ new reckless tax and spending proposal. Portman discussed his concerns with the new tax hike, including the fact that it undermines business investment and job creation and raises prices for working families already facing skyrocketing inflation.Senator Portman delivered remarks on the Senate floor last year when the Democrats were considering their original Build Back Better proposal, and will continue to discuss the harmful effects of the Democrats’ inflationary tax and spend policies that will only hurt Ohio families. A video of Senator Portman’s remarks can be found here. Portman Op-Ed for Wall Street Journal: “Schumer-Manchin Throws the Book Tax at U.S. Companies”In a new Wall Street Journal opinion piece, Senator Portman, senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, details concerns with a new tax on manufacturing, or “book tax” in the Democrats’ latest reckless tax and spending bill. Portman discussed his concerns with the new tax hike, including the fact that it undermines business investment and job creation and raises prices for working families already facing skyrocketing inflation. Portman notes that the Democrats’ spending bill will negatively impact Americans in every tax bracket, with more than half the new taxes being levied on people making less than $400,000 a year, the threshold under which Democrats promised they would not raise taxes. Portman discusses the far-reaching consequences of the tax on manufacturing in his op-ed, notably that about 200 American companies that employ nearly 20 million Americans will be affected by the book tax should it become law, which translates into lower wages at a time when wages are already struggling to keep up with inflation. Read the full op-ed here.At Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, Portman Presses Nominee on Role in U.S. Cyber DefenseToday during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) questioned Nathaniel Fink, nominee for Ambassador at Large for Cyberspace and Digital Policy, about what his role would be in U.S. cyber defense organizational structure. In addition, Senator Portman highlighted the need for accountability for cybersecurity in the federal government to ensure a more effective national defense against cyberattacks. He has continuously called on the federal government to provide a single point of accountability for federal cybersecurity.Earlier this year the Senate passed a landmark legislative package, the Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act, authored by Senators Portman and Gary Peters (D-MI), as Ranking Member and Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, to significantly enhance our nation’s ability to combat ongoing cybersecurity threats against our critical infrastructure and the federal government. The legislation combines language from three bills Portman and Peters authored and advanced out of their Committee – the Cyber Incident Reporting Act, the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2021, and the Federal Secure Cloud Improvement and Jobs Act. The combined bill will update current federal government cybersecurity laws to improve coordination between federal agencies, require the government to take a risk-based approach to cybersecurity, as well as require all civilian agencies to report all cyberattacks to CISA, and update the threshold for agencies to report cyber incidents to Congress.A video can be found here.Portman, Casey Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Invest in Children’s Mental HealthU.S. Senators Rob Portman and Bob Casey (D-PA) have introduced their bipartisan legislation – Investing in Kids’ Mental Health Now Act (S.4747) – to address growing concerns surrounding children’s mental health in the United States.To help address the severe toll that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on children’s mental health, the bill provides pediatric mental health care providers with additional resources – a one-year Medicaid funding increase through an enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentages (FMAP). Pediatric mental, emotional, and behavioral health care providers serving Medicaid patients in participating states will have access to this funding.“We have a duty to ensure that our nation’s children have the necessary resources to address any mental, emotional, or behavior issues they may experience,” said Senator Portman. “I am pleased to introduce this bipartisan legislation with Senator Casey, to address this gap in pediatric mental health funding, and hope my colleagues in the Senate will join us in this effort.”“For many young people navigating mental health or substance use disorders, the pandemic exacerbated the everyday challenges they face. We owe it to our children to ensure they’re getting the mental health care they need as they navigate childhood and adolescence. This bill will break down barriers to mental health for children around the country,” said Senator Casey.“We are in the midst of a behavioral health crisis among our youth and simply do not have the workforce or resources to meet demand. Investing in Kids' Mental Health is critical to the success of our children's future. We applaud Senators Portman and Casey for taking bipartisan action to support families in desperate need our help,” said Nick Lashutka, President & CEO, Ohio Children’s Hospital Association.“Ohio's children are suffering from a mental health crisis; our emergency room overflows daily with kids that need help. For more than two decades, Senator Portman has been a champion in supporting pediatric mental health. On behalf of the team and patients at Cincinnati Children's, we are grateful that in his final months in office, he continues to put the children and families of Ohio first. Short term relief in the Medicaid program will have an immediate impact on patients, families and staff. Thank you, Senator Portman, for your action today and for your ongoing support,” said Steve Davis, MD, President & CEO, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.          In addition, within one year of enactment, the legislation directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to: Text of the bill can be found here.

On Senate Floor, Portman Highlights Russia’s Long History of Oppression of Ukraine, Ukrainian Artillery Strikes on Russian Forces, NATO Vote, & Urges Continued Support of Ukrainian PeopleThis afternoon, U.S. Senator Rob Portman delivered remarks on the Senate floor in support of Ukraine for the 20th consecutive week before the Senate breaks for the August district work period, joining Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH). Portman discussed the progress made over these last five months that Russia has waged its war against innocent Ukrainians. Portman laid out how Russia has a long history of oppressing Ukrainian identity, language, and culture going back hundreds of years, and how that oppression continues today in its brutal war against Ukraine.Heeding bipartisan calls from Congress, the United States has sent Ukraine over a dozen High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems or HIMARS to strike Russian forces from long distances. These weapons have been crucial to Ukraine’s attempts to slow Russia’s advance in the Donbas and to liberate territory in the south. Senator Portman also highlighted his intent to vote to bring Finland and Sweden into NATO in defiance of Russia’s threats. As Co-Chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus and member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Portman has been a staunch defender of Ukraine and has spoken consistently on the Senate floor since before the Russian invasion began. A transcript of his remarks can be found below and a video can be found here. Thursday, August 4, 2022On the Senate Floor, Portman Fights to Restore Retirement Benefits for Delphi Salaried RetireesToday on the Senate floor, U.S. Senators Rob Portman and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) asked unanimous consent for the Senate to pass their bipartisan, bicameral Susan Muffley Act. This legislation would restore retirement benefits to over 20,000 Delphi Salaried Retirees. Their request was blocked.When General Motors (GM) filed for bankruptcy in 2009, the Obama administration terminated the pension plan for 20,000 Delphi salaried employees, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) then cut their retirement benefits by as much as 70 percent. This includes more than 5,000 retirees in Ohio. The PBGC assumed responsibility for the terminated benefits but could not pay an individual more than a statutory maximum benefit. Therefore, salaried retirees suffered significant losses to their benefits, with devastating impacts on many lives. This bipartisan legislation would restore the terminated pensions, making these hardworking retirees whole. The bill would make up the difference between the pension benefits earned by Delphi Salaried Retirees and what they received following the GM bankruptcy in 2009. This means beneficiaries who have already begun receiving benefits will receive a lump sum payment of the difference between what was actually paid by PBGC and would have been paid without the limitations, plus six percent interest. Retirees may pay income taxes on this lump sum over three years to ease the tax burden. All beneficiaries will receive their full earned benefit amount moving forward.A video can be found here.

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-floor-portman-fights-restore-retirement-benefits-delphi-salaried,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today on the Senate floor, U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) asked unanimous consent for the Senate to pass their bipartisan, bicameral Susan Muffley Act. This legislation would restore retirement benefits to over 20,000 Delphi Salaried Retirees. Their request was blocked.When General Motors (GM) filed for bankruptcy in 2009, the Obama administration terminated the pension plan for 20,000 Delphi salaried employees and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) then cut their retirement benefits by as much as 70 percent. This includes more than 5,000 retirees in Ohio. The PBGC assumed responsibility for the terminated benefits but could not pay an individual more than a statutory maximum benefit. Therefore, salaried retirees suffered significant losses to their benefits, with devastating impacts on many lives. This bipartisan legislation would restore the terminated pensions, making these hardworking retirees whole. The bill would make up the difference between the pension benefits earned by Delphi Salaried Retirees and what they received following the GM bankruptcy in 2009. This means beneficiaries who have already begun receiving benefits will receive a lump sum payment of the difference between what was actually paid by PBGC and would have been paid without the limitations, plus six percent interest. Retirees may pay income taxes on this lump sum over three years to ease the tax burden. All beneficiaries will receive their full earned benefit amount moving forward.A transcript of Senator Portman’s remarks can be found below and a video can be found here.  “I thank my colleague from Ohio, Senator Brown. And I thank him for working with us on this bipartisan legislation that impacts thousands of retirees in our home state of Ohio. In the summer of 2009, as the federal government took General Motors into bankruptcy, the Obama administration terminated the pension plans covering thousands of Delphi workers. While union employees were protected, these 20,000 salaried retirees ranging from shop floor supervisors and salespeople to engineers, office managers were left out. “They spent many years working at Delphi, a major employer and economic engine in Dayton, Ohio, Youngstown, Ohio, Sandusky, Ohio. These people had followed the rules. They had earned their pensions the American way, through hard work, dedication and contribution. But instead of honoring the promises that had been made to these salaried, middle-incomed employees after 30, 40 years of service, the Administration terminated their pensions. People who had worked hard their entire lives and played by the rules saw benefits cut by as much as 70 percent. It's just not fair, no fault of their own. “And it's devastated some of them, particularly those who have health care issues in their later years who have not been able to lead the standard of living they assumed they would based on the pensions they had. It's about fairness, and it's very simple. It ensures that these Delphi retirees receive the retirement benefits they were promised. It would reinstate their pension plan and restore their benefits that were unnecessarily reduced and unfairly reduced. “Some of my colleagues may characterize this as a bailout, but I respectfully must correct the record. The Delphi pension was over 80 percent funded when the federal government terminated the pensions in 2009 and took over these assets. By the way, it would have been fully funded by the next year based on all the data we now have showing what would have happened with market conditions. It was 80 percent funded when the government stepped in and said that it was massively underfunded, and a year later it would have been fully funded. Despite this, the government, again, treated the pensions as though they were underfunded and slashed the benefits. “It's simply about keeping our promises to these workers. There were 20,000 participants. Some say it's not a lot of people. Well, to them, it's really important, and it's really important to Ohio, and about a quarter of those 20,000 live in our home state of Ohio. That's why I'm proud to stand with them, my colleague from Ohio, with others here in this body and over in the House to ensure that fairness is what they get at the end of the day. This should not be controversial legislation, in my view. I'm pleased to say that it has bipartisan support. We just saw 36 Republicans support this on the House side. I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to also support these workers, to make them whole with this legislation so that we can make good on the federal government's promise to them. I yield back my time to my colleague from Ohio.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-floor-portman-highlights-russias-long-history-oppression-ukraine,"WASHINGTON, DC – This afternoon, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) delivered remarks on the Senate floor in support of Ukraine for the 20th consecutive week before the Senate breaks for the August district work period, joining Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH). Portman discussed the progress made over these last five months that Russia has waged its war against innocent Ukrainians. Portman laid out how Russia has a long history of oppressing Ukrainian identity, language, and culture going back hundreds of years, and how that oppression continues today in its brutal war against Ukraine.Heeding bipartisan calls from Congress, the United States has sent Ukraine over a dozen High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems or HIMARS to strike Russian forces from long distances. These weapons have been crucial to Ukraine’s attempts to slow Russia’s advance in the Donbas and to liberate territory in the south. Senator Portman also highlighted his intent to vote to bring Finland and Sweden into NATO in defiance of Russia’s threats. As Co-Chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus and member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Portman has been a staunch defender of Ukraine and has spoken consistently on the Senate floor since before the Russian invasion began. A transcript of his remarks can be found below and a video can be found here.   “Madam President, I'm on the floor today with Senator Jeanne Shaheen from New Hampshire to join in a colloquy regarding what is happening in Ukraine. This is the 20th time in so many weeks that I have come to the floor to talk about the illegal, unprovoked, and brutal invasion of Ukraine by Russia. Today, I look forward to being with my colleague, Senator Shaheen, a member of the Ukraine Caucus, someone with whom I traveled to Ukraine and also to the border of Ukraine and Poland to meet with the refugees. Senator Shaheen is going to talk a little about how we got to where we are and what we do going forward. “I also was recently made aware of the fact that we are going to take up the NATO ratification vote today and this is to have the United States approve the addition of Sweden and Finland to the NATO alliance. This is great for the alliance. It's great for the United States. I believe it's also, otherwise, they wouldn't be interested, very good for the people of Finland and Sweden. They add a lot to the NATO alliance. They are militarily and economically in a position to be valuable contributors. They also, in the case of Finland, share the largest land border with Russia of any country. They have understandable concerns with what they see happening in Ukraine. I just believe it's very much in our national security interest and the interest of people I represent to have, in addition, even further strengthening of the NATO alliance through the addition of these two partners. Vladimir Putin thought he was going to split NATO apart when he began his invasion of Ukraine, I believe, and today he's finding just the opposite has happened. NATO has come together in ways we have never seen and we now have, again, the addition of two very strong members of NATO who are longtime allies of the United States and will add significantly to the NATO alliance. “With regard to Ukraine, let's start with a little history. Ukrainians have faced adversity from Russia for hundreds of years. This is not new to them. Russia's impression of Ukraine is not a 21st century issue. For 300 years, under the brutal rule of the Russian czars, Ukrainians were subject to repeated efforts to stamp out their language, their, culture, and their identity. In January of 1918, Ukrainians got their first taste of national freedom. While Russia was dealing with the chaos of the Bolshevik Revolution, Ukraine declared its independence from the Russian empire. Unfortunately, this freedom was short-lived. Just a few years later, the Bolsheviks conquered Ukraine and subsumed it into the Soviet Union. As an unwilling member of the Soviet Empire, Ukrainians suffered horrific atrocities at the hands of their Soviet overlords. “In 1932 and again in 1933, the Stalinist regime confiscated grain harvests across Ukraine and imposed a premeditated, man-made famine against the people of Ukraine. This horrific atrocity is known as the Holodomor. Millions of men, women, and children were starved to death in a deliberate effort to break the Ukrainian nation’s resistance to communist occupation. Stalin even ordered the borders of the country to be sealed to prevent anyone from escaping this man-made starvation and to prevent the delivery of any international food aid. In 2018, Senator Durbin and I introduced a resolution to commemorate the 85th anniversary of the Holodomor and to recognize the Commission on the Ukraine Famine's finding that it was a genocide. No question. I’m grateful to Senator Shaheen, Senator Tillis, and others who are in the chamber today for cosponsoring that resolution. It passed in October of 2018 unanimously here in the United States Senate. “The Holodomor failed to extinguish the Ukrainian people's identity, as hard as they tried. But it was not the end of the Soviet oppression. In the 1970’s, the Soviet leadership imposed a crackdown on Ukrainian intellectuals and those with any sort of leanings toward Independence or toward the West. The prisons and gulags became filled with Ukrainian political prisoners as the Soviet Union, once again, tried to assault Ukrainian identity. “But then in 1991, after years of repression, Ukraine finally broke away from its Russian rulers for good. Ukraine declared its independence on August 24 of that year, and in December, the declaration was confirmed by a referendum in which over 90 percent of the Ukrainian people voted in favor of independence. This chart shows the amazing response of the people of Ukraine to that. Ninety-five percent of the people in the Kyiv area, as you can see, supported Independence. By the way, Russians often say that Crimea really was not part of Ukraine. Well, more than half of the people in Crimea were for Independence as well. “But Russia's crimes against the people of Ukraine continue to this day. Last week a video was circulated online of a Russian soldier torturing and mutilating a Ukrainian prisoner, unfortunately not an isolated incident. After this, the Ukrainian soldier was shot dead and dragged with a rope into a shallow grave by his Russian captors. We've all seen the pictures from Bucha, people assassinated, people with their hands tied behind their back. Elsewhere in Ukraine, a Russian missile attack struck a prison in Donetsk that was housing Ukrainian prisoners of war. This chart shows that prison and the fact that it was attacked by missiles. “Many of these soldiers were involved in the heroic defense of the Azovstal Steel Factory in Mariupol. They held out for weeks against Russian assaults on the plant. At least 40 Ukrainian POWs, maybe more, were killed in this assault. These were POWs, these were soldiers who were lawful prisoners of war, supposedly protected by the Geneva Convention. Russia’s murder of these POWs is a war crime, and Russia must be held accountable for this and all its countless crimes in Ukraine. “But, following its usual playbook, Russia is spreading massive amounts of disinformation regarding this incident and so many others. They claim that the Ukrainian forces killed these prisoners as a way to discourage other soldiers from surrendering. This, of course, is nonsense. Among other things, Ukraine needs the manpower. Why would they kill their own soldiers instead of getting them back in a prisoner swap that everybody assumed was going to happen? It makes little sense, but it has never stopped Russia from propagating lies to deflect blame from its own crimes. Unsurprisingly the Red Cross still has not been granted access to this site by Russia who clearly need more time to cover up the evidence of its involvement before they allow any kind of inspection. Let the Red Cross in. “Those responsible for these atrocities must be held to account. This is one reason why Senator Shaheen and I last week cosponsored a resolution to recognize what is happening in Ukraine as genocide. Across the country, Ukrainian women and children have been subjected to indiscriminate Russian missile strikes and air strikes. It has killed thousands of innocents -- not combatants, noncombatants -- children. A few weeks ago, I spoke about little Liza, a 4-year-old girl with autism who was killed by a Russian missile strike in Vinnitsa. When Ukrainian First Lady Zelenska was in town a couple of weeks ago, she spoke about a three-year-old boy who just learned how to use prosthetics. Imagine that: An innocent three-year-old boy who has been forced to learn how to use a prosthetic limb because of a Russian air strike on civilian targets. “These stories are hard to hear and hard to tell, but the world must know about them. This is the reality that all Ukrainians are facing. Unsurprisingly, the people of Ukraine are responding to these atrocities. A possible Ukrainian counteroffensive may be unfolding in the south in the direction of Kherson. We’ve also heard about this in the popular media. Kherson is here, it’s near the Black Sea Port of Odessa. This southern part of Ukraine is incredibly important for Ukraine's economy, and Russia knows that. “Remember Kherson was the first major Ukrainian city to fall to the Russian forces after Russia's full-scale invasion began in February of this year, but now Ukrainian soldiers are conducting missile strikes against Russian military infrastructure in the area to weaken Russia's defenses. They are also conducting limited ground attacks and liberating parts of this territory that Russia has illegally taken. You can see that in the light blue. The significance of recapturing Kherson cannot be overestimated. It would undo one of Russia's earliest successes in the war. It's also important that Ukraine regain control of much of its Black Sea coast as possible. This is the Ukrainian economy’s primary connection to the rest of the world. Russia of course has sought to capture this coastline in order to economically strangle Ukraine. “We talked last week about what they are doing in Odessa. They finally decided they were going to let ships come out of Odessa, and they made an agreement that they would not continue to bomb Odessa and certainly not bomb any port facilities. Within 12 hours, they bombed port facilities in Odessa. That's how much the Russian commitment meant. But a ship has finally sailed from Odessa, and we hope many more will go. If Ukraine is successful in its efforts here in the south, it will undermine President Putin and his attempts to make a Russian victory in Ukraine. Something that the Russians say is inevitable.“While Ukraine is making progress in the south, Russia is laying the groundwork to try to annex occupied land, particularly in the east in this area near Donetsk. Occupation means that the Russians themselves are distributing Russian passports, paying salaries in Russian rubles, and expediting Russian citizens for Ukrainian citizens. There are reports that Russia will stage a “sham” referendum in this area to try to legitimatize their illegal annexation. Senior Kremlin officials have warned Russia will never leave areas of Kherson, in the south here, where Russian forces have been occupying the territory. “Before the invasion, these cities were home to more than 2.5 million Ukrainians in this area. 2.5 million Ukrainians. One prominent Kremlin propagandist has said, ‘Ukraine, as it was, cannot continue to exist.’ This person continued, ‘There will not be the Ukraine as we have known for many years. It won't be Ukraine any longer.’ Clearly, that's the Russian intent. Vladimir Putin said his ambition is even more. “It's to fully restore the borders of the old Soviet Union. We must make sure he knows that the Ukraine of 2022 is not the Ukraine of 1921 which Russian Bolsheviks conquered and forced into the Soviet Empire. “We know how to help Ukraine to keep this from happening. It's to provide them what they need to defend themselves. We recently provided Ukraine with what we call High Mobility Artillery Systems, or HIMARs. Many of us have been advocating for that; we're glad to see there are some HIMARs now in the theater. These have been critical to the recent Ukrainian military successes. So, this Congress has made a difference. We provided funding. We've gotten some equipment into the area that the Ukrainians need to be able to defend themselves and to have some sort of a level playing field with Russia's much bigger army. Officials have said with the help of these HIMARs, Ukraine has taken out Russian high-value targets and destroyed them, and saved countless Ukrainian lives. These include ammunition depots and targets from long distances. HIMARs have also conducted many of these strikes in southern Ukraine, as I talked about earlier to make progress in the Kherson area. “Russians have similar long-range artillery that previously allowed them to fire on Ukrainian forces with impunity. They could sit back and fire and level cities and kill civilians and kill Ukrainian military personnel, but they couldn't be reached by the Ukrainians. Now the Ukrainians have taken themselves out of that danger zone because these HIMARs can balance the playing field and have that longer range and the accuracy they need. I think there are about 15 in theater now. There are also a few from Germany and a few from the U.K. But they need more. They say they need 40 to 50 and the munitions to be able to make them effective. “That's something that we should be focused on. We should be focused on providing them again what they need to actually win this conflict. I believe we also got to continue providing Ukrainians with other weapons, as well, including the Army Tactical Missile System or the ATACMS. This missile, which can be launched from the same HIMARs launchers that we've already been giving to Ukraine, has a longer range of 300 kilometers. In a war like this one, that is increasingly becoming an artillery duel, range is a decisive factor. These missiles would allow Ukraine to turn the tables on the Russians. Whereas Ukraine used to be out-ranged by the Russian artillery, with the ATACMS missiles, we would be able to help Ukraine to be able to strike important Russian targets with impunity themselves. This is important. Because Ukraine is now using these weapons in this counteroffensive in Kherson. The Institute for the Study of War, a think-tank here in Washington, D.C., has said recently this offensive to take out Russia is in the works, and Ukrainians are using HIMARs to strike targets effectively 50 miles away. It's helping. “We made a difference. Former security adviser to the Ukrainian government, Alexander Kera, told Newsweek the state of Russian morale in the south means a counteroffensive has ‘an excellent chance of success.’ He continued, ‘The Russians suffer from poor morale, logistical troubles, and the horrors of HIMARs.’ So, the evidence is clear as to why we should continue to send them weapons they need to be able to not just survive but to win this conflict. By the way, we have hundreds of HIMARs in our stocks that are currently not with active units, so we have the ability to help more.“This war has now crossed over the five-month mark. Since before the invasion began, I've come to this floor a number of times to talk about what needs to be done, as has Senator Shaheen and as have others. I have mentioned the fact that we sent billions in military aid and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and that it is working. Particularly, as we see with some of these new weapons, it's making a difference. It will help these brave warriors in their most vulnerable noncombatants, the kids and the children, be able to survive and be able, in the case of the military, to be able to start making progress to push out the Russian invaders. “Democrats and Republicans alike have sounded the alarm with bipartisan pushes and legislation to help Ukraine. We have urged with success, by the way, that the U.S. cut off our own Russian oil and gas. We are now urging the Europeans to do the same. We have talked about the need for more weapons, for more sanctions to remove all of Russia's bank’s access to the global financial system or the SWIFT system, to suspend our tax treaty with Moscow, to explore options to remove other tax benefits, and to remove access to the U.S. market. All of this is necessary. Both on the military side, the humanitarian side, the economic side, and the sanction side in order to have a victory. “I fear sometimes with regard to the military assistance, that we've been doing too little too late. We can't continue to do too little too late. This is a struggle. It's a struggle between freedom and democracy and the right of self-determination on the one hand and, on the other hand, Russian aggression unprovoked, a brutal conquest, authoritarianism, and tyranny. President Putin's ambitions lie well beyond Ukraine. We must show him that the West continues to stand united. We need to show Ukraine that the world stands with them. This is why it is so important that Sweden and Finland have chosen to join NATO, and we must support them in that. “All of this, by the way, transcends the political spectrum, and I have certainly seen that. Senator Shaheen and I have shown that in our work to aid Ukraine, it’s not a political issue. It’s not a Republican or Democrat issue. We are stepping up in support of our democratic ally, together.“As the fight rages on, the perseverance and self-determination of Ukrainians seems to grow even stronger. We have seen their resilience in the face of daily bombardments. We’ve seen their resilience in the face of Russia's broken promises. When counter to their commitments, Russia has attacked ports, as I said, and humanitarian corridors. The Ukrainian people are fighting for their homeland, for their families, for their freedom. And it is impressive and inspiring to see what they are doing. “The Senate is going to break for an August recess here in the next few days, and even though we won't be on the floor every week to continue to fight for the Ukrainian people, we will do so with our work back home, with getting more people engaged and involved in America to help on the humanitarian side. We will continue to promote the fact that the United States’ national security interest is served by helping freedom and democracy. “I want to note something President Zelenskyy said recently in an address to the people of Ukraine. He said, ‘Strategically, Russia has no chance of winning this war, and it is necessary to hold on so that even at the tactical levels, the terrorist state feels its defeat. No matter what happens and what the occupier’s plans are, we must do our job, protect our state, and take care of each other.’“Let's help Ukraine finish this mission, protect their state, their democracy, and take care of each other. Let's give Ukraine the tools it needs to be able to do that. After these months of fighting and giving aid, the West must not falter during Ukraine's dire time of need. We must be there through victory for the Ukrainian people. Victory for self-determination, victory for freedom. With that, I'd like to yield to my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Shaheen, and my partner in this effort.” ###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/portman-difference/press-conference-portman-criticizes-democrats-latest-reckless-tax,"At a press conference earlier today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) joined his fellow Senate Finance Committee Republicans in discussing the Democrats’ new reckless tax and spend proposal – dubbed the “Inflation Reduction Act” – which will raise taxes for millions of lower and middle-income Americans amid high inflation and economic stagnation. Portman discussed his concerns with the new book tax proposed in this bill, which will place a massive burden on manufacturers all around the country – leading to a decrease in domestic business investment and job creation and an increase in prices for working families already facing skyrocketing inflation.A transcript of his remarks can be found below and a video can be found here. “So, the legislation we apparently are going to be asked to vote on this week is called the Inflation Reduction Act. And, in fact, it is the 'Inflation Increase Act' and we've seen here today why that is true. When you put taxes on the economy that fall to workers and fall to consumers and fall to shareholders, it increases inflationary pressures. I'll give you an easy example of this, the tax that we're talking about, and remember this is $326 billion of new taxes, about 30 percent of it is going to fall on consumers. That's based on what the University of Chicago and other analyses have shown. So, 30 percent of this is going to flow right down to consumers. Now, when consumers I represent go to the store right now, it's eye-popping. “Whether it's food or whether it's clothing or whether it's buying an electronic, everything, costs have gone up dramatically. We're looking at the worst inflation in 40 years, so it's clearly inflationary. But, it's even more than that because the burden of this taxation, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, but also other analyses that are out there, falls on workers as well. So, the very people whose wages are not keeping up with inflation, with inflation at 9 percent and wage growth well below that, people are feeling like they can't get ahead. “And, if you're on fixed income, it's even worse, but for these folks that work in these companies, and remember half of this is going to fall on manufacturers, they're going to see their wages and benefits be reduced because of this taxation, at a time when they're having a really hard time keeping up with current inflation. So, it doesn't help with regard to inflation. I don't know where that name came from, but it's obviously the opposite.“Now, there is a group called Penn Wharton Economic Studies and they are often cited by the Democrats when they think that their work helps them. But they've looked at this thing, on an objective basis, and said, 'Actually, in the first couple years, it increases inflation' despite everything that's being said. So, this is something that we Republicans are obviously going to block, but I hope you'll ask some tough questions too. How can you call it the 'Inflation Reduction Act?'“We just spent a few hundred billion dollars on research and development. To help who? Manufacturers. To help ensure that America could be competitive in the global economy. This is the CHIPS Plus legislation that was just passed. So, on the one hand, we're saying to manufacturers, 'We want to help you to become more competitive.' On the other hand, we're saying to manufacturers, 'We're going to take away one of the benefits that encourages investment and economic growth.' And, by the way, we're not alone in this in this country. “All of the other developed countries in the world also offer some kind of bonus depreciation. In fact, of the OECD countries, the top developed countries in the world, we're below the average already. We offer less than they do. So, this puts us at a competitive disadvantage with countries around the world as well. It's just the wrong thing to do at the wrong time. Here's an alternative, we all recognize inflation is a problem. Let's work together. Let's work together to do what we did at the end of 2019, 2020 when we had unemployment low, when we had inflation incredibly low, when we had 3 percent wage growth for 19 straight months, all of which was well above inflation. We know how to do that, it's pro-growth policies. It's regulatory relief. It's not increasing taxes, it's having more sensible taxes. It's ensuring that we do increase the supply in this country. We know what we have to do. This, unfortunately, goes in the wrong direction.“I just can't help myself. I won't address directly your question about Senator Manchin. But, I will say, this is not a loophole. I mean, I mentioned earlier that every developed country in the world helps to encourage their manufacturers to make more investments. And, we just passed legislation to do that in ways we have never done before. And, here we are, less than a week later, saying 'Well, you know what, we've changed our minds.' We're going to say to manufacturers, a number of them who are, you know, larger companies. “They employ millions of Americans, by the way, and provide millions of products, have millions of consumers, and provide products to all of us. We're going to say to these folks, 'you know, you, somehow, are the kind of manufacturers we don't want to help.' Bonus depreciation is not a loophole. It's a considered policy of the United States Congress, the House, and the Senate, to try to encourage us to have more investment in America, therefore, more economic growth and more jobs. And, again, we're not even at the halfway point in terms of what other countries do. You know, the UK does a lot more than we do. And when manufacturers are trying to decide they're going to put their next plant, they look at this.“And, I really believe when you look back at what happened in 2017, perhaps the most effective thing that was done, and remember it lowered the rates for businesses. It said to businesses, ‘if you come here and invest, you can get an immediate write-off.’ So, expensive equipment that might go into a fab to make expensive semiconductors, isn’t that something that we want to encourage? So, it’s not a loophole; it’s a tax policy.“If we were responsible, what we would do is not set up a whole other system of taxation, this so-called ‘book tax’ which is a new calculation that no one has ever seen before because it’s even a change from the traditional book tax, we would instead go into the tax code and say, “well, this tax preference isn’t good, but this one is” and actually do the hard work of legislating. But, not to say that we’re just going to decide that we’re going to establish a new book tax that says you can’t take loaner’s depreciation as an example.“By the way, there are other parts of our tax code that are also affected. You guys know what ESOP is; it’s an employee-owned plan. It’s an employee owned company: employee stock ownership plan. You know that people use what are called ESOPs to encourage more participation from workers in the company. They’re affected by this as well because they lose a lot of their tax preferences under this book tax. So, they’re telling us that they’re very worried that it’s going to discourage new ESOPs and cause some existing ESOPs no longer to be effective. “So, you know, we should like ESOPs which are good things. Democrats typically do too. Stock options, a lot of tech companies use stock options. They’re also affected by this. But the manufacturing piece is the biggest piece because so many manufacturers use this bonus depreciation. But it’s not just limited to them. It’s energy companies as well.“So, in 1986, Congress in its wisdom decided to do this, to set up a new book tax. It was part of the ’86 Tax Act. It lasted about two and a half years, and it was repealed. Why? Because it’s incredibly complicated. Because it’s unfair. Because as the AICPA told us in their letter last week, this is the CPAs who would benefit from complexity, it doesn’t make sense to have two different tax systems and punish some businesses, therefore some workers, therefore some consumers, and not others. “So, we actually can learn from history here. We tried this before. It didn’t work. It was ended; it was repealed because it makes no sense. That’s what is going on here. I know it’s complicated, and you get into all these tax issues. But basically, what it says is we’re going to set a new system of taxation that takes away the benefits that Congress traditionally wants to provide. Why does that make sense? It’s always bad policy, but it’s terrible policy when we’re looking at 40-year high inflation and the second quarter of negative economic growth.“On the IRS chart, put that up again for a minute, this one, as you may know, that I have worked on a lot back in the 90’s as the co-chair of the IRS Commission. I’m actually someone who believes we should put more funding into the IRS. You know where we should put it? Into technology because they’re way behind. My constituents are affected by that because they can’t get answers, because they can’t get someone to answer the phone, because they can’t deal with our tax administration system because we are so antiquated. We work in silos, and we don’t have the latest technology. “All of this money going to the IRS, you would think it would go towards technology first and taxpayer service second, which are related. 6.5 percent of it goes towards technology. 6.5 percent of it. Four percent goes to taxpayer service. What it’s doing is doubling the size of the IRS in terms of people who will it be auditing, the people I represent. And we talked earlier about how that’s going to affect small businesses, farmers, ranchers, and so on. Even in this area, where I would normally say helping the IRS to be more effective, that’s not a bad thing because small businesses in Ohio are negatively impacted right now by the IRS’s lack of ability to be effective in dealing with them and giving them answers to their questions. But that’s not even part of this. So, there are plenty of targets of opportunity for us to try to stop or improve this legislation. And in response to your questions earlier, we have a responsibility to do that.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-toomey-warner-lummis-sinema-introduce-legislation-address-digital,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Mark Warner (D-VA), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) today introduced legislation to clarify the digital asset reporting requirements signed into law as part of last year’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.Last August, the senators announced an agreement with the Department of the Treasury on an amendment to the infrastructure package that would have clarified the definition of “broker” with respect to who must report to the government information about a digital asset transaction. The amendment specifically excluded from reporting requirements services like mining and wallet providers who do not take custody of other individuals’ cryptocurrency, nor are able to comply with the reporting requirements of a broker. While the amendment had strong bipartisan support, including from the Biden administration, the Senate was never afforded the opportunity to vote on and pass this amendment last August due to a procedural hurdle. The legislation introduced today is the exact same text introduced as a bipartisan amendment nearly one year ago.“This legislation is designed to ensure that the digital asset reporting requirements signed into law as part of last year’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act are implemented as intended,” said Senator Portman. “I am pleased to see the Senate come together in bipartisan fashion to ensure that we provide clarity in the law and guidance around cryptocurrencies to maintain our edge in financial innovation.”“While there’s no question that digital asset exchanges behaving as brokers should be required to comply with existing reporting requirements, the bill signed into law last year would impose these requirements on many people who don’t even have the information needed to comply with them,” said Senator Toomey. “By clarifying the definition of a broker, our legislation will protect innovation by exempting miners, network validators, and other service providers from onerous and unworkable requirements. This amendment had strong bipartisan support last August, and there’s no reason it shouldn’t be signed into law.”“There’s been a lot of confusion about the reporting requirements included in the bipartisan infrastructure law,” said Senator Warner. “As a former venture capitalist and someone who’s enthusiastic about innovation, I want to maintain America’s lead in financial innovation, including distributed ledger technologies. This bipartisan bill will underscore that the reporting requirements in the IIJA do not apply to crypto validators and other actors not providing broker-like functions while maintaining sensible guidelines to ensure that financial networks aren’t enabling illicit activity.” “The Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act placed unnecessary burdens on digital asset mining and wallet providers, and we must fix these reporting requirements,” said Senator Lummis. “I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing this important legislation which will ensure our tax system reflects the realities of the digital asset industry.”“As more Arizonans utilize digital assets, our commonsense, bipartisan legislation ensures that everyday users of crypto – miners, stakers, and software developers – won't be subjected to reporting requirements that are intended for brokers of digital assets,” said Senator Sinema.In addition to maintaining strong bipartisan support in the Senate, this legislation is widely supported by the digital asset industry.“Coin Center supports any effort to improve the status quo created by the ill-advised crypto tax provisions in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,” said Jerry Brito, Executive Director of Coin Center. “We applaud Sen. Toomey for leading a bipartisan effort to address some of these issues and appreciate the support of Senators Warner, Sinema, Lummis and Portman.”“We thank Senators Toomey, Sinema, Portman, Lummis, and Warner for their bipartisan leadership in this nuanced space,” said Sheila Warren, Chief Executive Officer of the Crypto Council for Innovation. “Clarifying how people can use and report on digital assets is important for the industry. We look forward to supporting the continued growth of innovation in the U.S. and working with policymakers on this issue.”“The Chamber of Digital Commerce commends Senator Toomey and co-sponsors for listening to the concerns of the digital asset community and continuing to advocate for regulatory clarity,” said Cody Carbone, Director of Policy, Chamber of Digital Commerce. “The infrastructure bill included burdensome reporting requirements for nearly every participant within the ecosystem and this bipartisan bill will ensure digital asset reporting requirements match the technology’s operation. We urge that this legislation is swiftly passed into law and look forward to working with all interested parties on policy that provides additional certainty for the digital asset space.” “ADAM applauds Senators Toomey, Sinema, Portman, Lummis, and Warner for their continued bipartisan leadership to provide clarification on the definition of a broker as it relates to the 2021 Infrastructure Bill,” said Robert Baldwin, Head of Policy, Association for Digital Asset Markets. “Definitions matter and an overly broad interpretation of the broker definition as passed has the potential to dampen innovation and lead to the offshoring of various digital assets projects in the rapidly growing sector. This bill fixes the tax definitional issue. ADAM looks forward to continued bipartisan cooperation on this bill and other policy topics so that the U.S. can ensure a long-term position of leadership in digital assets.”“Global DCA applauds the tireless efforts to clarify the definition of a broker with respect to the digital asset markets,” said Gabriella Kusz, CEO, Global Digital Asset and Cryptocurrency Association. “This common-sense solution will protect innovation while ensuring that those who are buying and selling cryptocurrency pay legitimate taxes that are owed. We look forward to continuing to work with Senator Toomey, Senator Sinema, Senator Portman, Senator Lummis, and Senator Warner to ensure there is responsible regulation without excessive federal overreach.”“The proposed revisions to Internal Revenue Code regarding Information Reporting for Brokers and Digital Assets marks a key legislative opportunity that we believe will begin to unlock the best benefits of digital assets and blockchain,” said Ron Quaranta, Chairman of the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance. “By clarifying what it means to be a broker in light of this important innovation, the bi-partisan legislation paves the way for further innovations that can evolve markets and ultimately improve the overall financial lives of Americans. We are thankful for the continued effort and thought leadership of Senators Lummis, Portman, Sinema, and Warner, and on behalf of our members look forward to continued dialogue and collaboration with policymakers in the future.”“Americans need common sense and fair guidance for engaging with blockchain protocols,” said Alison Mangiero, the Executive Director of The Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA). “POSA appreciates Sen. Toomey, Sen. Sinema, Sen. Warner, Sen. Lummis, and Sen. Portman’s, leadership and efforts to make clear that validators, those who do important work to secure blockchain protocols, are recognized appropriately for tax reporting purposes.  We urge the Senate to take up and pass this simple but important bill to provide much-needed clarity and help America grow its web3 economy.”To read the full text of the bill, click here.###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/portman-difference/portman-op-ed-wall-street-journal-schumer-manchin-throws-book-tax-us,"WASHINGTON, DC – In a new Wall Street Journal opinion piece, Senator Portman, senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, details concerns with a new tax on manufacturing, or “book tax” in the Democrats’ latest reckless tax and spending bill. Portman discussed his concerns with the new tax hike, including the fact that it undermines business investment and job creation and raises prices for working families already facing skyrocketing inflation. Portman notes that the Democrats’ spending bill will negatively impact Americans in every tax bracket, with more than half the new taxes being levied on people making less than $400,000 a year, the threshold under which Democrats promised they would not raise taxes. Portman discusses the far-reaching consequences of the tax on manufacturing in his op-ed, notably that about 200 American companies that employ nearly 20 million Americans will be affected by the book tax should it become law, which translates into lower wages at a time when wages are already struggling to keep up with inflation. Read the full op-ed here. Excerpts below:Schumer-Manchin Throws the Book Tax at U.S. Companies
By U.S. Senator Rob Portman
The Wall Street Journal ...The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that nearly 50% of this new book tax would fall on manufacturers—the effects of which could prove devastating. China currently has more than a quarter of the world’s manufacturing. Along with a majority of America’s competitors, China has no book minimum tax. Imposing this new tax on U.S. companies, and restricting certain U.S. manufacturers from writing off investments costs immediately, would make America less competitive and drive investment and jobs overseas.This new tax would discourage investment just as policy makers have learned that our negative economic growth is in large part the result of lower investment. The latest report from the Bureau of Economic Analysis shows gross domestic private investment down 13.5%, which helped lower economic growth to minus 0.9% in the second quarter.Higher taxes also mean lower wages for workers at a time when paychecks are lagging behind high inflation. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that 25% of corporate taxes fall on workers in the form of lower wages, and this is a conservative estimate. A 2017 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development paper found the best studies estimated that between 30% and 70% of corporate taxes fall on workers.Americans would also feel the effect of this tax hike in the checkout line. Economists at the University of Chicago and Northwestern found in a 2020 study that about 31% of corporate taxes fall on consumers. Companies with profits over $1 billion, which would be subject to this new tax, make a substantial portion of the products Americans buy and use every day.An estimate from the National Association of Manufacturers suggests that this new tax would result in a real reduction in gross domestic product of $68.45 billion, with 218,108 jobs lost and a more than $17 billion dollar hit to wages in 2023 alone....###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-casey-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-invest-childrens-mental,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Bob Casey (D-PA) have introduced their bipartisan legislation – Investing in Kids’ Mental Health Now Act (S.4747) – to address growing concerns surrounding children’s mental health in the United States.To help address the severe toll that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on children’s mental health, the bill provides pediatric mental health care providers with additional resources – a one-year Medicaid funding increase through an enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentages (FMAP). Pediatric mental, emotional, and behavioral health care providers serving Medicaid patients in participating states will have access to this funding.“We have a duty to ensure that our nation’s children have the necessary resources to address any mental, emotional, or behavior issues they may experience,” said Senator Portman. “I am pleased to introduce this bipartisan legislation with Senator Casey, to address this gap in pediatric mental health funding, and hope my colleagues in the Senate will join us in this effort.”“For many young people navigating mental health or substance use disorders, the pandemic exacerbated the everyday challenges they face. We owe it to our children to ensure they’re getting the mental health care they need as they navigate childhood and adolescence. This bill will break down barriers to mental health for children around the country,” said Senator Casey.“We are in the midst of a behavioral health crisis among our youth and simply do not have the workforce or resources to meet demand. Investing in Kids' Mental Health is critical to the success of our children's future. We applaud Senators Portman and Casey for taking bipartisan action to support families in desperate need our help,” said Nick Lashutka, President & CEO, Ohio Children’s Hospital Association.“Ohio's children are suffering from a mental health crisis; our emergency room overflows daily with kids that need help. For more than two decades, Senator Portman has been a champion in supporting pediatric mental health. On behalf of the team and patients at Cincinnati Children's, we are grateful that in his final months in office, he continues to put the children and families of Ohio first. Short term relief in the Medicaid program will have an immediate impact on patients, families and staff. Thank you, Senator Portman, for your action today and for your ongoing support,” said Steve Davis, MD, President & CEO, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.   “Senators Portman and Casey's leadership on the bipartisan bill provides a significant step toward the critical investments needed for pediatric mental health and for the specially trained caregivers who support their health and well-being,” said Amy Wimpey Knight, President of Children’s Hospital Association. “The magnitude of the youth mental health crisis requires renewed attention, and we must make purposeful investments in resources to provide life-changing and life-saving care to children and their families. We urge Congress to follow the senators' leadership and take meaningful action for our children and youth.”    In addition, within one year of enactment, the legislation directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to: Text of the bill can be found here.

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-floor-portman-discusses-tax-manufacturing-democrats-inflation,"WASHINGTON, DC – Last night, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) delivered remarks on the Senate floor outlining the harmful consequences of the tax on manufacturing, or “book tax,” in the Democrats’ new reckless tax and spending proposal. Portman discussed his concerns with the new tax hike, including the fact that it undermine business investment and job creation and raise prices for working families already facing skyrocketing inflation.Senator Portman delivered remarks on the Senate floor last year when the Democrats’ were considering their original Build Back Better proposal, and will continue to discuss the harmful effects of the Democrats’ inflationary tax and spend policies that will only hurt Ohio families. A transcript of his remarks can be found below and a video can be found here. “I come to the floor this evening to talk about the Democrats' latest reconciliation proposal. This is the tax-and-spend legislation you've probably heard about. It's called the Inflation Reduction Act, but don't be fooled by the name. It doesn't actually decrease the inflationary pressure we all feel at the gas pump, at the grocery store, clothes shopping. It actually makes it worse. Sad that we've been down this road before. Early last year the Democrats passed a massive $1.9 trillion package of supposedly focused on COVID, but most of it had nothing to do with COVID, but provided a lot of stimulus. It was the largest spending package ever in the history of Congress, and at the time it passed a lot of us said, ‘Wow the economy coming out of that first stage of COVID is already picking up steam.’“In fact, the nonpartisan congressional budget office was telling us that by mid-year last year we'd be back to where we were pre-pandemic, pretty strong economic growth. Yet, the Democrats are insisting on another $1.9 trillion, almost $2 trillion of spending. Remember, we had just passed a $900 billion spending bill to help with COVID, which was bipartisan, by the way. I was part of putting that together. So when it came to this new one, we said ‘Whoa, don't do this.’ It's going to overheat the economy, overstimulate the economy, particularly because inflation is about demand mismatching supply, and this is exactly what was happening, is you had demand growing and supply constricted, partly because of COVID, partly because of policy decisions being made. So we warned that this much stimulus in the economy was going to lead to inflation, and very sadly we were right. “It wasn't just Republicans who said that. Some prominent Democrat officials said that, including some who had been senior economic advisers in the Obama administration in the Clinton administration, including Larry Summers, who was quite prescient when he said, ‘Gosh we shouldn't do this because it will heat up the economy and cause a lot of inflation.’ Democrats didn't pay any attention to those concerns then. They went ahead and passed that legislation. Remember today, we're looking at inflation that is the highest it's been in 40 years. Here we are today, about to do some of the same exact things, more spending and more taxes. It's $700 billion more in spending and about $326 billion taxes, new taxes on the economy. It will not reduce inflation.“In fact, the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model predicts it will increase inflation over the next two years, and over time it will be about even, but it won't decrease inflation. In fact, over the first couple years they say it will increase it. The burden of the $326 billion in the tax increases is not just going to companies. It never does. It gets passed along. In this case, it falls, of course, to workers and to consumers. According to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation that we have to rely on up here, it's a nonpartisan group that it's us the analysis of these tax bills, it will hurt Americans in nearly every income bracket. “In fact, they say more than half of the $300 billion in new taxes will fall on folks making less than $400,000 a year. Why? Because again, you're taxing a company, but the company passes that along to its workers and to its customers. And they're saying that more than half of that burden will fall on taxpayers who make less than $400,000 a year. “Why do I say that? Because that's the cutoff president Biden has always put in place, saying no tax increases will affect anybody who makes less than $400,000 a year. This one does. Again, based on the Joint Committee on Taxation. As part of these tax hikes, manufacturing is hit particularly hard. The Joint Committee says that about had 50 percent of the impact of the tax increase is going to be on manufacturing businesses. Now, this is interesting to me because we just passed a big bill, some call it the CHIPS bill, some call it the China bill, some call it the competition bill, but it’s a bill to focus on making our American companies more competitive, particularly our manufacturing companies and we're spending a lot of money, hundreds of billions of dollars to do that and here we're saying, ‘No we're going to increase taxes on those manufacturing businesses.’ “This proposed tax is very different from the existing corporate income tax which is based on income that these businesses actually report to the Internal Revenue Service when they file their taxes. That income has been defined by Congress over the years. It doesn't use that as the measure of income. Instead it looks at a company's financial statements and comes up with a new definition of income called the adjusted financial statement income. This type of financial reporting is far broader, because these statements were designed for very different reasons. Taxable incomes that the IRS. Is in charge of as opposed to financial statement income is meant to raise revenue and provides in our tax code all kinds of tax preferences, incentives, disincentives for certain activity like being able to deduct the cost of new equipment. That's something we want to encourage, so we allow companies to do that. Like being able to take a tax credit, let’s say for energy efficiency. “We want to encourage companies to do that. So, that's in the tax part as opposed to the book income part. The financial statement income is not determined by elected representatives. In another words, Congress doesn't determine how you calculate that tax. The financial statement income is actually determined by something called the Financial Accounting Standards Board which is a private nonprofit recognized by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as the accounting standard setter for public companies. “Now, that works fine for determining accounting standards, but this change effectively puts these people in control of what the corporate tax base is even though they're not elected representatives, they're not even working for the government. They're nonprofit. Because the corporate income taxes and this book minimum tax are calculated using these very different types of information. The 15 percent minimum tax which is a book tax minimum tax can actually end up being larger for companies than the 21 percent income tax. Again, because it calculates it differently. “It's an example of Congress avoiding its responsibilities, frankly. If we think that we should charge companies more taxation, let's look at the tax code and let's get rid of some of the tax preferences if people think they don't work. Let's change the tax code. Let's not come up with another way to calculate what the tax ought to be. Determined again by standards that are done by this nonprofit group called the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Instead of examining the tax code we created and the deductions and credits that exist, it simply hands the reigns over to the board. Most accountants recognize this is a dangerous path. “This is why when it was proposed last year, 264 accounting academics wrote to Congress to warn us not to do it. They warned of the dangers of politicizing this accounting board, how that would lower the quality of financial accounting. They warned this would change company decision making it to make companies less efficient because companies are now going to manage toward the financial statement not toward the income tax. They also warned that it would add needless and significant complexity to the tax code. “Well, of course, you've got to calculate now income on two bases very, very different measurement and factors considered. To their credit, actually, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants who actually stand to benefit from the complexity wrote us recently a letter saying, ‘Please don't do this.’ This is the CPA Organization in the whole country, again, people who benefit from complexity, but they're saying this is just bad policy. Why would you determine a company's taxation based on the book income. That's not what that is for. “We should listen to these warnings and we should also learn from history. We tried this type of tax in the form of the 1986 tax reform. We actually tried this as a country. And you know what? It lasted two or three years and then it was repealed. Why? Because it didn't work. The exact warnings that we just talked about ended up being true. The Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Tax Policy told the House Ways and Means Committee when it was repealed that the book tax they had then was, ‘having a detrimental effect on the quality of financial reporting.’ “The complexity was complained about. The fact that this was not fair, not an appropriate way to measure a company's income. Now more than 30 years later Democrats seem to have forgotten history and are about to repeat the same mistake. The line you will likely hear from colleagues on this side of the aisle is that this tax is just designed to make big companies pay their fair share of taxes because it only applies to companies that have more than a billion dollars in net income. “Well that's fine. But guess who pays the tax. It's not corporations who bear the brunt. In reality, the taxes on cooperate income such as this new book minimum tax, falls on workers and it falls on consumers. There are lots of workers and consumers who are connected with these companies. Last year there were over 200 companies listed on the Fortune 500 as having over a billion dollars or more and by the way, they employ over 18 million Americans, you're talking about 18 million people who will be affected by this and these big companies also have a lot of consumers well beyond those 18 million. So it is the millions of people who are employees and who are customers-these businesses who bear the brunt of these tax increases as it is passed down to them in the form of lower wages, lower benefits and higher prices for goods and services, exactly the wrong thing in this inflationary spiral we are living in now where everything costs more.“Why would we want to add additional costs by saying we’re going to tax these companies that are going to pass it along to their workers and to the consumers with higher prices. It doesn't matter whether you are taxing income or income on financial statements, corporate income tax falls on these workers. Don't take my word for it. Again, the Joint Committee on Taxation just last year said that they expect about 25 percent of corporate taxes to fall on workers. This means lower wages again as this recession looms and as inflation hits the highest level since 1981, 40 years plus. By the way, we just went through our second quarter of negative economic growth. Traditionally that means a recession. That's how we define one. “The administration refuses to call it a recession. I will just tell you, for people who live in my home state of Ohio, particularly people on fixed income, lower-middle-income workers, they’re feeling it. For them, it’s a recession. In addition to the Joint Committee saying that the corporate taxes fall on workers, the Congressional Budget Office, again, nonpartisan group up here in Congress, have said that employees and workers bear more like 70 percent of the burden of corporate income taxes. There's a long list of analyses in between. “In 2017, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, reviewed many of the available economic studies around the world that have been done and found that the best studies fall within the range of 30 to 70 percent. Let me say that again – overwhelmingly, economic studies support the idea that workers bear between 30 and 70 percent of the corporate tax hikes. Going after workers' wages is one heck of a strategy to bring down inflation. People are already hurting because wages are here, inflation is here, so wages have not kept up with inflation. This will make it worse. “Germany, by the way, did an analysis of corporate taxes recently and found that the burden fell hardest on low-skilled, young, and female employees, not the highest earners. The most important of these tax law changes is limiting what's called bonus depreciation. That is something that you would get as a company if you were in the regular income tax system but not under this new book tax calculation. What is bonus depreciation? It allows companies to deduct the cost of investments of new equipment in the year they are made. Under the book tax, they spread that deduction over the lifetime of the investment. In both cases they are deducting the cost of it, but whether they can do it immediately under bonus depreciation, whether they have to do it over the course of many years, matters a lot for investment decisions. “Being able to deduct the costs of these investments immediately provides a big incentive for people to invest and that's what happened. This is not a loophole. I've heard this word, it's a loophole. We're just closing loopholes. This is not a loophole. This is a deliberate tax policy that we have put in place to help encourage companies to invest more in equipment and plants, and therefore help the workers, therefore make America more competitive. And actually over time increase the tax revenue that comes into our coffers. It is really important to encourage investment and economic growth, but particularly important for manufacturers. That's why the Joint Committee on Taxation found that half of the burden of this new tax will fall on manufacturers because bonus depreciation is so important to them. “This isn't unique to us. Every single developed country in the world offers a policy like bonus depreciation. Why? Because it works. And because if they don't and other countries do, they can't compete. The United Kingdom’s is far more generous than ours, for example, for the purchase of equipment. Across the assets that use this sort of what’s called ‘cost recovery,’ we're actually well below the average in the OECD, which is a group of about 40 highly developed countries, like ours. We rank 21st now out of 38 for these types of incentives. This will make us even less competitive, meaning it's going to be even better for manufacturers to invest in other countries that have better incentives rather than here in the United States of America. We want them to invest here. “Again, we just passed legislation to provide more incentives to invest here and now we're doing the opposite through this book tax increase. Bonus depreciation has traditionally had bipartisan support and this sudden shift to call bonus depreciation a loophole is a misrepresentation of what bonus depreciation does, why we have it, and how important it is for our manufacturers to compete. We expanded bonus depreciation the in 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act and then in 2018, the next year, in 2019, the next year after that, we had two of the best years ever for manufacturing investment, growing by 4.5 percent and then 5.7 percent respectively. A lot of that growth going on prior to that time was going on overseas, particularly in China. And we brought investment back in the United States. “This is why, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the manufacturing industry is so hard hit by this. According to the National Association of Manufacturers, in 2023, this tax increase would shrink GDP, that's our economic growth, by about $68 billion, would result in 218,000 fewer jobs and would have a labor-income decrease of about $17 billion. This is the National Association of Manufacturers telling us this week, please don't do this. This is going to result in a job loss of over 200,000 jobs. We want to have more manufacturing jobs, not less. The workers hit hardest are those who work in manufacturing because this tax hike on physical assets will disproportionately hit manufacturing jobs. My home state of Ohio has got a lot of manufacturing jobs, we’re a big manufacturer, we’re proud of that. We’ve got a lot of factories, we like to make things so it particularly hits states like mine. “But remember, it's not just wages we are talking about. No, workers get hit at both ends. As workers, wages and benefits but also as consumers, when they get paid and when they try to spend their money. Families facing record inflation today will now face even higher prices as the cost of corporate taxes get passed down to the consumer. Again, I'm not just going on some gut feeling, although it makes sense, doesn't it? If you tax an entity, it gets passed along in terms of the cost of the goods. I'm talking about though what economists are saying is going to happen when we increase taxes on American businesses. In a key study last year performed by economists at the business schools at the University of Chicago and Northwestern, found that about 31 percent of corporate taxes fall on consumers, through higher retail prices, and they warn that policymakers have been underestimating significantly how much of these taxes fall on consumers, on the people that buy these products that these companies make. Democrats are ignoring this evidence. “Pushing ahead with partisan legislation without any Republican support that will make inflation worse, that will hurt workers, that will raise prices. And, again, it doesn't stop there. I can talk about how corporate taxes discourage investment, both domestic and foreign in the United States, according to economists from the World Bank and from Harvard. I can talk about how contrary to everything Democrats claim, corporate taxes make income inequality actually worse, increasing the income of the top earners and lowering the income of low and middle-income workers. This is based on a 2020 study by the economists at the University of Michigan. I can talk about the opposite side of the equation how lowering taxes for businesses of all sizes, as we did in 2017, supports economic growth. “Going into the pandemic, we had 19 straight months of wage gains of 3 percent or more, most of that wage gain was going to lower and middle-income workers. We had the lowest poverty rate in the history of the country. We had good things going on because you had this economic growth, you had companies paying higher wages. In the years in-between the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the coronavirus pandemic, again, we not only saw just an end to these corporate inversions where companies were going overseas, we saw jobs and investments coming back to the United States and we kept inflation very low. That’s a far cry from the estimate we got last week from the National Association of Manufacturers which, again, predicts this book tax will result in a $68 billion hit to our economy with over 200,000 fewer jobs. “Prior to the pandemic, pro-growth policies led to a really strong economy, with steady growth, low inflation, and real wage increases of 3 percent or higher. Instead of spending and tax hikes that are only going to add to this inflation, let's have a true Inflation Reduction Act that lowers costs to consumers by increasing supply through regulatory relief, through other pro-growth policies that were working so well before the pandemic. Let's do what we know we have to do to get inflation down. It's a mismatch between demand and supply. We can, through positive pro-growth policies, increase that supply and get inflation down and ensure that American families have a better shot at their American dream. Instead, here we go again with the Inflation Reduction Act that will actually be the Inflation Increase Act. Thank you, Madam President.” ###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/portman-difference/portman-biden-administrations-new-nepa-rule-wrong-approach-face-soaring,"At a press conference yesterday, Senator Portman (R-OH) discussed his support for S.J. Res. 55, a joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), to nullify the Biden administration’s new regulation, “National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Implementing Regulations Revisions”. These regulations, authored by the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), undermine important provisions in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act intended to streamline key elements of our broken federal permitting process. Senator Portman served as the chief Republican negotiator for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which invested hundreds of billions of dollars in repairing, upgrading, and modernizing our nation’s roads, bridges, ports, and included Portman’s Federal Permitting Reform and Jobs Act to make FAST-41 permanent, improve the federal permitting process for some of the largest infrastructure projects, and build on efforts to update this process created in 2015. A transcript of his remarks can be found below and a video can be found here.“Well said, Shelley. So, I want to start by thanking Senator Sullivan for his leadership on this and in permitting, generally, because he has understood that America needs to be able to be competitive globally and that the ability to greenlight a project in this country is harder than it is in almost all of our competitors. And, we’ve fallen behind, continually. About 11 years ago, I first got involved in this from a legislative perspective and I’ve got the scars to show it. It’s always been bipartisan, but it’s always been tough. We were able to get the FAST-41 so-called, which was a provision in the last highway bill, which helped in terms of permitting. We were able to get the permitting council up and going. The permitting council looks at projects and speeds up the time frame. And, as Senator Capito said so well, it’s not about not having environmental reviews, it’s being sure the environmental reviews are done in a responsible way.“And, by the way, that’s something the Trump administration added to with their NEPA rule which said that you need to have ‘reasonably foreseen’ environmental issues, which, you know, that’s certainly reasonable. And then, the Biden administration came in and pulled the rug out from under these projects all around the country. So, clearly, this is a huge problem for our country. And, again, we have made some progress here in Congress, but this NEPA rule that the Biden administration has put out is going exactly in the opposite direction. So, finally, we were getting these projects greenlighted. We were helping in terms of the construction workers, who are on that list of 50, who have been always supportive. The AFL-CIO Building Trades Council has been our friend on this forever. Also, we worked with some environmental groups to come up, again, with this balanced approach, but now that balance has been shifted.“It’s interesting because I first got involved in this because of a hydropower project, a green project, a hydropower plant on the Ohio River that was taking forever to get permitted. The metropolitan utility group came to me and said, ‘Gosh, can’t you help us on our permitting?’ But this is true generally all around the country. This is affecting green energy projects as well as affecting highway projects. It’s affecting wind farms. It’s affecting solar farms. It’s affecting the energy business generally. It’s affecting what we just did in terms of providing all this funding for high-tech manufacturing in America. These same chip plants, the so-called fabs that make semiconductors are going to be affected by this. So, on the one hand, we’re saying we want to encourage more projects in this country, we want to get ourselves in a situation where we’re not losing ground to other countries around the world that have much better permitting rules. On the other hand, the Biden administration does this, which runs counter to everything that we’ve been promoting, again, on a bipartisan basis, not with many Democrats, but with enough to get it done.“The final thing that I want to say is we are living in a time of really high inflation. For those of you in this room, you’ve never seen inflation like this. For those of us who have a few more grey hairs, we’ve seen it, but it’s been forty years. And, people back home are just dying under the pressure of inflation. It’s not just the price at the pump. It’s food. It’s their ability to buy clothes. It’s their ability to pay their rent. I mean, everything is going up. This is going to add to inflation. Why? It’s very simple. Inflation is about demand and supply being mismatched, right? And, the supply is about things like projects, like a pipeline for natural gas to move it from the Marcellus and Utica fields in Ohio to the coast so that we can have liquefied natural gas. That’s part of the supply side is to, as an example, to be able to have energy in this country to be able to get the costs down. “This actually runs counter to that. So, it’s wrong for so many reasons, but one is, specifically, right now while we’re trying so hard to figure out how do we get out of this inflationary spiral, we’ve got to do something, which the FED is doing something on the demand side, much better to do it on the supply side, and for us, instead, to be going the other way with this NEPA rule and to make it even harder. Instead of taking four years, taking six years to permit some simple projects, including environmentally important projects to those on the other side, it just makes no sense whatsoever. So, I appreciate the fact that we’re going to have the opportunity to speak on this, to vote on it. And, I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle look at this carefully, and let’s do end up with reasonable permitting reforms. If we do that, we’ll be able to move this country forward and be able to reduce the inflationary pressures we’re feeling now.“Quickly, because Dan mentioned infrastructure, he’s absolutely right. As you know, I helped negotiate that, as did others here, including Senator Capito in a big way, and we insisted on having permitting reform be part of it. And, what this will do is it will reverse the progress we had hoped to make on a number of things that actually helps in terms of the environment. Think of traffic congestion. So, everyone will tell you there are more CO2 emissions when you have a traffic jam than when the traffic is running smoothly, and that’s one reason, in the infrastructure bill, we’re trying to encourage more development of our travel infrastructure, transit infrastructure, including mass transit, including other things. That all takes longer now.“Think about reforestation. You know, one thing the infrastructure bill has is 1.2 billion new trees on the National Forest, as an example. That’s going to take longer. Some of the reforestation projects have to do with erosion and other things that require this NEPA review.“Think about the environmental projects we had talked about earlier, not just solar and win, but think about the infrastructure for electric cars. That’s in that legislation, some $7.5 billion. That’s going to take longer. So, it actually runs counter to the infrastructure legislation that we just passed. And, this is one thing that I feel is, in a way, pulling the rug out from under us after we had worked with the White House, worked with Democrats on both sides of the Capitol to come up with something that would help us move forward on infrastructure.“Finally, I will say, it’s not just the indirect costs, it’s not just the cumulative costs, it’s the upstream and downstream costs. And, I think that’s very difficult to analyze and I think it gives regulators a huge opportunity to take their discretion and determine what, as an example, downstream costs might be. So, if you have a natural gas pipeline running through my state of Ohio, or any of these pipelines these guys have talked about, by the way, it’s relatively clean fossil fuel, it’s needed right now, and everybody acknowledges that, and it goes across the stream. Under the old NEPA rules, you would look at the impact of that stream, and you should. And that was, you know, reasonably foreseen was the way the Trump administration talked about it, as an example. Now, it’s not just about that stream or it’s not just about that project in effect. It’s about where is that pipeline going to go and will it result in more fossil fuels being used, and, therefore, will it have an impact on the climate, and, therefore, should a regulator not approve that project? I think that’s the issue, in a nutshell, as I can see it.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/portman-difference/fox-business-portman-discusses-speaker-pelosis-visit-taiwan-democrats,"Senator Portman joined FOX Business’ Cavuto: Coast to Coast this afternoon to discuss Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan and the Democrats’ latest reckless tax and spending spree. Senator Portman, who visited Taiwan in April as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation, voiced his support of the visit, saying it is important to show leadership in the region and not back down in the face of China’s increasing aggression. Portman also touched on the Democrats’ new tax and spending bill, which includes $326 billion in new taxes on investment, particularly manufacturers, and will make inflation worse. Portman explained that this is exactly the opposite of what Congress should be doing right now, since the country is in a recession. This bill will inevitably burden American workers and consumers, who are already struggling due to record-high inflation, and does not address the inflationary mismatch between the demand and supply of our economy.A transcript of the interview can be found below and you can also watch the interview here. SENATOR PORTMAN ON SPEAKER PELOSI’S VISIT TO TAIWAN“Jackie, I couldn’t agree more. I don’t agree with Speaker Pelosi on much, but on this one, I think she’s absolutely right. I was there just a few months ago in Taiwan. It was a very productive meeting. We talked about the military issue, obviously, and what Taiwan needs to better defend itself, and that was important. But also, we talked about the economic situation. As you know, 90 percent of the high-end semiconductors in the world are made in Taiwan. These are the chips that we depend on for our military, for our automobiles, for so many of our electronics, so it’s a very important country in many respects. But one is, as we’ve seen recently in the debate over semiconductors, Taiwan produces the high-end versions of this, and it’s very important that we protect that source of our supply chain. So, it’s really important she’s there. I think doing otherwise and backing down would have been a sign of weakness at a time when China is increasingly aggressive in the whole Indo-China area. Other countries in the region are looking to us to provide leadership and certainly not to back down. And the Speaker has every right to go to Taiwan just as we had the right to go there in April. “Well, they’ve been punishing Taiwan as best as they can in various ways: commercially, certainly in terms of disinformation which is flooding the island. We saw some of the propaganda footage earlier of them flexing their military muscles, so they’ve already been doing military exercises in the Taiwan Straits. When we were there they flew six fighter jets over the line of demarcation and the straits, so they’re continuing to do that. And by the way, it’s not just about Taiwan. It’s so many other things in the region that are concerning to people. What they are doing with regard to the South China Sea and on a coral reef, developing a military base. The Philippines will tell you that one of those islands is theirs, and they’re in a dispute over that. But also, people are concerned what is happening in Tibet, what’s happening certainly in Hong Kong, what’s happening to the Uighurs in Xinjiang province. So, there are a number of issues that are concerning at a time when it’s an increasingly dangerous and volatile part of the world because of the China aggression in the area. It’s not a time for us to be backing down. Instead, it’s a time for us to talk to China to ensure they know we’re not escalating, but also to talk to our neighbors and our friends, China’s neighbors and our friends, our allies in the region. You know, they are increasingly looking to us for leadership. “Well, it’s true if you saw the early responses from the administration, including from the President as you saw, saying that they did not recommend it. I think instead they should not have been opposite of what Speaker Pelosi was saying; they should have been working together so that we can have a consistent foreign policy. And I do think in this case that Speaker Pelosi made the right call. And I think the trip will be quite productive.” SENATOR PORTMAN ON DEMOCRACTS’ $700B SPENDING BILL“No, it won’t. It’s inflationary, and clearly, by adding $326 billion in new tax hikes, we have a substantial tax increase on the American people, and there’s no way to get around that. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has said that half of that tax comes out of manufacturers. They also said that tax gets passed along to workers and to customers, and how much of it gets passed along depends on what analysis you look at. But it’s anywhere from 30 percent to 70 percent gets passed along to employees. This is why they say that a number of Americans, who didn’t expect to get taxed, and in fact are going to be told, “Hey, your salary is going down, your benefits are going down” because of this new tax. Fifty percent of those people, by the way, or more make less than $400,000 a year, so it’s a tax that distributes to employees. It obviously will hurt consumers. And at a time of high inflation, why would we want that, either a tax increase or a higher price for the goods that we buy? So, it’s a tax increase, and that to me is exactly the opposite thing to do right now. The Democrats have consistently put out policy, whether it was the $1.9 trillion bill that had so much stimulus in it that it increased demand dramatically at a time when it wasn’t needed that helped cause the inflationary mismatch between demand and supply. Now, this is going to, once again, hurt in terms of the supply side and make it harder for us to see investment in America, harder for us to build things, harder for us to have the ability to get out from under this inflationary spiral.” ###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-brown-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-study-feasibility-ohios,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) introduced legislation to authorize a feasibility study to determine if the Buckeye Trail – a more than 1,400 mile trail that circles the state of Ohio – is eligible to be designated as part of the National Scenic Trails System.“The Buckeye Trail provides Ohioans from all across the state access to world-class outdoor recreation, whether it is in Cuyahoga Valley National Park, the Hocking Hills region, my home in Cincinnati, or in Northwestern Ohio,” said Senator Portman. “I am proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation to see if the Buckeye Trail is eligible to become a National Scenic Trail, so that we may encourage Ohioans and Americans across the country to experience the beauty Ohio has to offer.”“The Buckeye Trail is one of Ohio’s great treasures – extending across Ohio from Lake Erie to the Ohio River, from the farmland of northwest Ohio, to the hills of Appalachia and the Bluegrass region of southwest Ohio,” said Senator Brown. “Establishing it as a National Scenic Trail and giving it national recognition will support our tourism economy and help maintain the trail for families across our state.”“The Buckeye Trail Association enthusiastically supports The Buckeye National Scenic Trail Feasibility Act of 2022. Ohio’s Buckeye Trail maximizes outdoor recreation potential and conservation and enjoyment of the nationally significant scenic, historic, natural, and cultural qualities by physically connecting, highlighting, and stewarding sites around the Buckeye State in one unified trail experience. The Buckeye Trail is inspiring and deserving of national consideration. We are pleased that Senators Portman and Brown have been inspired by the trail in their backyards that connects their constituents to the rest of the Buckeye State, and the National Trail System, to elevate Ohio’s treasure for consideration,” said Andrew Bashaw, Executive Director, Buckeye Trail Association.The Buckeye Trail is located entirely within Ohio. The first 20 miles of the trail were dedicated in 1959 in Hocking County, and the trail was completed in 1980. The trail touches 42 of Ohio’s 88 counties, looping around the entire state and is Ohio’s longest hiking trail. Each year, the Buckeye Trail welcomes more than four million visitors in the Hocking Hills region and an additional million visitors in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. ###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/robs-rundown/robs-rundown-week-july-25-july-29-2022,"Senator Portman was back in Washington this week where he spoke on the Senate floor for the 19th consecutive session week regarding the situation in Ukraine. Senator Portman discussed Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian ports and Russia’s missile strikes against Odessa, a Ukrainian port city, just hours after agreeing to a humanitarian deal with the U.N. to allow it to operate. Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian ports caused massive food shortages across the globe. Portman also noted the four additional High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems that the U.S. is sending to Ukraine, and the possibility for the U.S. and our allies to send advanced Western fighter jets to Ukraine. A long-time advocate for arming Ukraine, Senator Portman has been pushing for months to give Ukraine the weapons it needs to successfully counter Russian attacks. On Tuesday, Senator Portman joined Bloomberg’s Balance of Power with David Westin to discuss whether certain trade policies could help lower the high level of inflation the country is experiencing. Senator Portman suggested policies that could be helpful, such as keeping Trump-era tariffs in place for countries like China, that are not playing by the rules and completing important trade agreements that are very closed to being done. Senator Portman was also asked about the role of regulatory agencies in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in West Virginia v. EPA, restricting the ability of the Executive Branch to exceed direction from Congress. He said the decision was important because it limits overreach by administrative agencies, but also stated that Congress needs to be more comprehensive and precise in legislation to make Congressional intent clear. Also on Tuesday, Portman released a new report and expressed hope that it will serve as a wake-up call to the Federal Reserve and other agencies to China’s malign efforts to target, influence, and undermine the U.S. Federal Reserve. Based on a Federal Reserve counterintelligence analysis and unheeded FBI recommendations to change the Federal Reserve’s policies and procedures, this report finds the Federal Reserve has been the target of an extended and effective Chinese malign influence and information theft campaign.On Wednesday, Senator Portman praised Senate passage of the CHIPS Act, which would boost semiconductor manufacturing, and strengthen supply chains across the United States. In Ohio, this legislation will help Intel increase their $20 billion investment in New Albany to build two semiconductor foundries to potentially $100 billion and eight total foundries. On Thursday afternoon, Senator Portman joined Fox News’ Kudlow to discuss the consequences of the Democrats’ plan to raise taxes on workers’ wages, consumers, and producers. Portman said the Democrats’ tax hikes will hurt lower and middle-income Americans the most and will make soaring inflation and rising costs even worse. Portman also noted that this was the wrong policy at the wrong time, with the U.S. now in a recession.On Friday morning, Senator Portman attended the Greater Akron Chamber of Commerce and Akron Friends Thank You Breakfast in Akron, Ohio. During the breakfast, Senator Portman spoke to the Chamber about current legislative priorities in Congress, including the CHIPS Act, which would reshore our nation’s semiconductor industry and its potential to bring significant economic development to Ohio.Friday afternoon, Senator Portman the Stark County Campus of the Akron Canton Regional Food Bank and met with the organization’s leadership to receive updates on the food bank’s operations. Portman also received a tour of their new campus that covers the southern part of their service region, which was built with support from the New Markets Tax Credit Extension Act (S.456).For a more detailed look at Senator Portman’s week, please see the following:Monday, July 25, 2022Members of Ohio Delegation Applaud Senate and House Committee Approval of Kol Israel Holocaust Memorial Bipartisan Bill  U.S. Senators Rob Portman and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Representatives Shontel Brown (D-OH), Troy Balderson (R-OH), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Dave Joyce (R-OH), Tim Ryan (D-OH), Anthony Gonzalez (R-OH), Joyce Beatty (D-OH), and Mike Carey (R-OH) applauded Committee passage of their bipartisan, bicameral bill to designate the Kol Israel Foundation Holocaust Memorial — located in Bedford Heights, Ohio — as a national memorial. Passing favorably out of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee, the bills now advance to the Senate and House floors, respectively. “We must never forget the horrors of the Holocaust and the enormous suffering endured by the Jewish people. The Kol Israel Holocaust Memorial was erected six decades ago in Northeast Ohio to honor the victims of the Holocaust and to serve as a lasting reminder of the evil that occurred,” said Senator Portman. “I am pleased our bipartisan, bicameral legislation to designate Kol Israel a National Memorial has been voted favorably out of committee and look forward to it coming to the Senate floor for a vote.”“The Kol Israel Memorial Foundation educates Ohioans about the horrors of the Holocaust and preserves the memories of its victims,” said Senator Brown. “When we pass that knowledge on to future generations, we recommit ourselves to ensuring it never happens again, and to fighting for a more just and peaceful world. I am proud that Kol Israel is one step closer to becoming a national memorial.”Erected in 1961 by survivors of the Holocaust residing in Northeast Ohio, the Kol Israel Holocaust Memorial is likely the first and oldest Holocaust memorial in the U.S. For more than 60 years, the Kol Israel Foundation has looked after the memorial, which has the ashes of Jewish victims and other tokens of remembrance buried at its base. To commemorate the day, both the House and Senate bills were introduced on Israel’s Holocaust Remembrance Day in April.Tuesday, July 26, 2022On Senate Floor, Portman Urges NATO Expansion to Counter Russian Aggression, Commends Additional Weaponry to Ukraine, Highlights Bipartisan Genocide Resolution  U.S. Senator Rob Portman delivered remarks on the Senate floor in support of Ukraine for the 19th consecutive week while the Senate has been in session. Portman discussed Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian ports and Russia’s missile strikes against Odessa, a Ukrainian port city, just hours after agreeing to a humanitarian deal with the U.N. to allow it to operate. Russia’s blockade on Ukrainian ports has caused massive food shortages across the globe. Portman also noted the four additional HIMARS, or High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, the U.S. is sending to Ukraine, and the possibility for the U.S. and our allies to send advanced Western fighter jets to Ukraine. A long-time advocate for arming Ukraine, Senator Portman has been pushing for months to give Ukraine the weapons it needs to successfully counter Russian attacks. Senator Portman closed with the effect the war is having on the children of Ukraine, and talked about the thousands of broken families and now orphans who will have war-torn memories instead of childhoods. To recognize the devastation of this war, and as a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Portman joined his colleagues to introduce a bipartisan resolution recognizing Russia’s atrocities in Ukraine as a genocide. A transcript of his remarks can be found below and a video can be found here. On Bloomberg TV, Portman Discusses U.S. Trade Policies, CHIPS Act, West Virginia v. EPA DecisionSenator Portman joined Bloomberg TV today to discuss whether certain trade policies could help lower the high level of inflation the country is experiencing. Portman suggested policies that could be helpful, such as keeping Trump-era tariffs in place for countries, like China, that are not playing by the rules and completing important trade agreements that are very closed to being done, including with the United Kingdom. In regard to almost-completed trade agreements, Senator Portman pointed out the fact that the Biden administration has not allowed for the Trade Promotion Authority to take place and has refused to consider new trade agreements, causing current trade agreements to be stalled and hamstringing this country from one way to better fight back against China. Senator Portman also addressed the CHIPS Act, which is currently being voted on in the Senate. He spoke about the importance of the legislation, to bring chip manufacturing back to America. Portman also discussed his amendment to include provisions from his bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act, or SAIA, which passed the Senate last year on a bipartisan basis as a part of the CHIPS Plus package currently under consideration. The SAIA provisions in Portman’s amendment will ensure the federal government is taking decisive action to safeguard the $250 billion American taxpayer-funded investment in research and innovation included it in the CHIPS Plus package. Senator Portman was also asked about the role of regulatory agencies in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in West Virginia v. EPA, restricting the ability of the Executive Branch to exceed direction from Congress. He said the decision was important because it limits overreach by administrative agencies, but also stated that Congress needs to be more comprehensive and precise in legislation to make Congressional intent clear.

Wednesday, July 27, 2022Portman Praises Senate Passage of Legislation to Boost Semiconductor Manufacturing, Strengthen Supply Chains and Enhance National SecurityCHIPS Act Will Help Create Thousands of Jobs in OhioToday, U.S. Senator Rob Portman issued the following statement on Senate passage of the CHIPS Act, bipartisan legislation to incentivize semiconductor manufacturing in the United States, make our supply chains more resilient, enhance our national security, and strengthen our economy: “Today’s passage of the CHIPS Act is critical in the effort to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States, protect our national security and create thousands of high-paying jobs in Ohio. I was proud to help lead efforts in the Senate to pass this legislation and ensure that Intel’s planned semiconductor plant in central Ohio remains on track and reaches its full potential. Intel’s announced investment is already the largest in Ohio’s history and the company has indicated that with this CHIPS legislation its record investment will grow even larger over time. It is also expected that other major Ohio investments from suppliers will follow. I urge the House to act quickly on this bipartisan legislation so the president can sign it into law, and I look forward to attending the groundbreaking for this transformational project in the coming months.”Ohio’s business community has praised Senator Portman’s work to secure passage of the CHIPS Act:“Fully funding the CHIPS Act is vital for America’s economic competitiveness and national security. The CHIPS Act will accelerate the pace and impact Ohio will have at the center of the Silicon Heartland, while driving investments in America. In true Ohio spirit, Senator Portman and Ohio’s bipartisan Congressional Delegation have aggressively supported the CHIPS Act - we are thrilled with today’s progress and urge speedy passage in the US House,” said J.P. Nauseef, President and CEO of JobsOhio.“Senator Portman’s leadership from the beginning of this process has been instrumental. This is extremely impactful legislation for our national security, the semiconductor industry and the communities, families, and individuals it supports across America and here in Ohio,” said Kenny McDonald, President and CEO of the Columbus Partnership.“Today’s passage of the CHIPS Act by the U.S. Senate is a monumental win for Ohio and our country. Intel Corporation is laying the groundwork for the United States to return as a manufacturing superpower for semiconductors, and the CHIPS Act is a pivotal component for making that happen.  Producing computer chips domestically is critical for so many sectors of our economy — military readiness, electrical grid infrastructure and much more — but it is also imperative for our national security as it will decrease our dependence on trade with China. Senator Portman has been a leader from day one on sounding the alarm on the importance of bringing this industry back to America, which will protect our nation from foreign interests. I urge the House to take swift action to get the legislation to the President’s desk as soon as possible,” said Pat Tiberi, President and CEO of the Ohio Business Roundtable.“Ohio’s economy stands to benefit even more from the transformational nature of Intel’s investment in semiconductor manufacturing in our state thanks to the CHIPS Act, which will bolster American manufacturing and national security. We want to thank the members of Ohio’s Congressional delegation who have been working hard to see this through, especially Senators Portman and Brown, for their leadership on this important issue,” said Steve Stivers, President and CEO of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce.Portman, Klobuchar, Calvert, McCollum Introduce Bipartisan, Bicameral Resolution Recognizing July as Disability Pride MonthResolution Highlights Need to Actively Prevent Exclusion and Discrimination Against Americans with Disabilities  U.S. Senators Rob Portman and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and U.S. Representatives Ken Calvert (R-CA) and Betty McCollum (D-MN) introduced a bipartisan, bicameral resolution recognizing July as Disability Pride Month. The resolution also celebrates the contributions of Americans with disabilities and highlights the need to prevent exclusion and discrimination on the basis of disability.“I am pleased to introduce this resolution with Senator Klobuchar designating July as Disability Pride Month,” said Portman. “Tens of millions of Americans live with disabilities, often facing loneliness and discrimination due to their disability. It is important that we support and uplift those with disabilities because, in spite of the challenges they face, they bring tremendous value to our country. I can think of no better way to celebrate the 32nd anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act – signed into law by my mentor President George H. W. Bush – than by introducing this resolution.”The resolution is supported by: Allina Health; the American Association on Health and Disability; the Amputee Coalition of America; the Autism Society of Minnesota; the Autistic Self Advocacy Network; the Brain Injury Association of America; the Courage Kenny Rehabilitation Institute; Cure SMA; Down Syndrome Association of Minnesota; Family Voices; Family Voices of Minnesota; Gillette Children’s; Minnesota Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities; Minnesota Council on Disability; Minnesota First Community Solutions; Multicultural Autism Action Network; National Disability Institute; National Disability Rights Network; National Down Syndrome Congress; ONE Community; RespectAbility; Special Olympics; The Arc Minnesota; and United Cerebral Palsy.The full text of the resolution is available here.Portman, Coons Praise Passage of Resolution Recognizing 25th Anniversary of Radio Free Asia Today, U.S. Senators Rob Portman and Chris Coons (D-DE), both members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, announced that the Senate has passed their bipartisan resolution recognizing the 25th anniversary of Radio Free Asia’s (RFA) inaugural broadcast into China and its mission to provide an independent source of news to closed societies in Asia. The resolution was adopted by unanimous consent, after being reported favorably out the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in June. “I am pleased that my bipartisan resolution with Senator Coons to commend Radio Free Asia on its continued work in providing a free flow of information in South and East Asia has now passed the Senate,” said Senator Portman. “For the past 25 years, Radio Free Asia has delivered balanced and objective reporting to countries where freedom of the press is only an idea. Their work is critical to combating the deception and falsehoods spread by authoritarian regimes and violent non-state actors, and I appreciate their continued efforts to combat anti-democratic influences in the region.”The resolution:The full text of the resolution is available here. Portman, Brown Introduce Legislation to Improve Care For Those Eligible For Both Medicaid and MedicareLegislation Proposes a New Model to Better Integrate Services for the More Than 12 Million Americans Eligible for Both Programs  Today, U.S. Senators Rob Portman and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) introduced the bipartisan Comprehensive Care for Dual Eligible Individuals Act. The legislation would support states that offer integrated, coordinated care options for those who are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare, ensuring they receive the full benefits and quality care they deserve. More than 12 million Americans are dually eligible for both programs.“I am pleased to introduce this bipartisan legislation with Senator Brown to provide states with the ability to offer full-benefit dual eligible beneficiaries the option to have their needs met through one program,” said Portman. “This legislation will set a higher quality of care for millions of Americans while promoting integration of these siloed programs. I encourage all of my colleagues in the Senate to support this important legislation.”“Currently, people eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare have to deal with a fragmented, confusing system, and too many can fall through the cracks,” said Brown. “This bipartisan legislation would help integrate care, make government work better, and improve the health of older Americans and people with disabilities.”Right now, nearly half of all Americans eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid receive long-term care services and more than half of these beneficiaries have multiple chronic conditions, including mental health diagnoses. In order to receive the care and support they need, they have to deal with two sets of administrative rules and policies, which can lead to duplicated or fragmented care and poor health outcomes. The Comprehensive Care for Dual Eligible Individuals Act of 2022 would create a new program that states can choose to take up, to integrate the two programs and allow dual-eligible Americans to select the type of coordinated care that works best for them.  “We thank Senators Brown and Portman for their new federal legislation which would give individuals eligible for Medicare and Medicaid the option to receive all their care in a more coordinated way that is easier to navigate. It holds promise as a vehicle to help states like Ohio in their work to improve the quality of health care for low-income older adults and people with disabilities and give them the supports they need to live in their communities,” said Kevin Prindiville, Executive Director, Justice in Aging.“Far too many people who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid experience fragmented care and disjointed systems. The bipartisan Comprehensive Care for Dual Eligible Individuals Act would allow states to better integrate these critical programs while ensuring key beneficiary protections, like appeal and enrollment rights. In so doing, this important bill could meaningfully improve care for older adults and people with disabilities — in Ohio and across the country. We applaud Senators Brown and Portman for their leadership,” said Frederic Riccardi, President, Medicare Rights Center.Specifically, the Comprehensive Care for Dual Eligible Individuals Act would provide states with the opportunity to establish programs to integrate care for dual eligible individuals, allowing beneficiaries to choose a single program that can provide for their medical, long-term care, social, and behavioral needs. The legislation is supported by a variety of stakeholder organizations, including the Commonwealth Care Alliance, Community Catalyst, Health Plan of San Mateo, Independent Living Systems, Justice in Aging, L.A. Care Health Plan, Medicare Rights Center, Molina, National Alliance on Mental Illness, and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.For the full text of the bill, click here.At Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, Portman Presses State Department Officials on Work to Open Ukraine’s Ports, Efforts to Supply U.S. Energy to EuropeToday during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Rob Portman questioned Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Jose W. Fernandez on the State Department’s work to stop Russian attacks on Ukrainian ports, so that grain can be shipped to countries around the world. An additional 70 million people around the world that have fallen into poverty since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Russia’s continued blockage of ports have caused starvation rates to rise in some of the poorest parts of the world.Senator Portman also pressed the witnesses on whether the Biden administration has placed restrictions on agencies that hinders their efforts to work on all energy sectors, including liquefied natural gas and nuclear energy. Senator Portman asked how that would make sense when we are asking European countries to stop buying Russian energy and promising to replace it with energy from the United States.A video can be found here.Thursday, July 28, 2022At Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, Portman Presses Nominee for U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of El Salvador on Title 42 and Increased Illicit Drug Traffic in the CountryToday, during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) pressed William Duncan, Nominee for U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of El Salvador, on the record levels of immigrants and drugs crossing the United States-Mexico border. Portman highlighted the need for El Salvador to implement a strategic plan and increase international collaboration to counter the narcotics that flow through Central America. Portman also questioned the nominee on the effects of Title 42 being revoked and the impact it would have on the United States, as the Mexico-U.S. border is experiencing an unprecedented surge of migrants. Senator Portman noted that many of the United States’ current policies encourage illegal immigration, which stems from Central and South America. A video can be found here.Portman Praises Senate Passage of Legislation to Combat Invasive Species, Address Coastal Erosion, Protect Water Quality in Great Lakes, Ohio Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman, Co-Chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, applauded the Senate passage of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), bipartisan legislation that authorizes a host of investments in U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects and programs, including a number of Portman priorities and provisions that support the Great Lakes and the state of Ohio. Specifically, the WRDA bill includes measures that will protect and improve the water quality of the Great Lakes and waterways across Ohio by delivering more resources to combat invasive species, improve water infrastructure, support shoreline stabilization, and address the threat of coastal erosion.  “This bipartisan legislation includes a number of my key priorities that support the Great Lakes and waterways across Ohio,” said Portman. “From addressing coastal erosion along the shores of Lake Erie to combating invasive species in Ohio’s lakes and other inland waterways, this bipartisan legislation is a major win for the Great Lakes and the people of Ohio.”    NOTE: More specifically, the bipartisan Water Resources Development Act: Increases the funding authorization for the Sec. 594 Ohio and North Dakota Environmental Infrastructure Program to $100 million. This program allows the Army Corps to provide assistance to non-Federal interests in Ohio for projects including the design and construction of water and wastewater treatment facilities, combined sewer overflows, water supply/storage/treatment, environmental restoration, and surface water protection. On FOX Business, Portman Discusses Surging Inflation, Democrats’ Latest Tax & Spending SpreeSenator Portman joined FOX Business’ Kudlow this afternoon to discuss the consequences of the Democrats’ plan to raise taxes on workers’ wages, consumers, and producers. Portman said the Democrats’ tax hikes will hurt lower and middle-income Americans the most and will make soaring inflation and rising costs even worse. Portman noted that this was the wrong policy at the wrong time, with the U.S. now in recession, with taxes on businesses getting passed onto workers and consumers through lower wages and higher prices. Portman especially criticized the Democrat’s proposed tax on book income, noting that attempting to tax companies based on their financial statements instead of their taxable income is the wrong approach that will hurt industries like manufacturing the most, discouraging investments in the equipment manufacturers need to succeed.You can watch the interview here. Friday, July 29, 2022In Akron, Portman Speaks at Greater Akron Chamber of Commerce & Akron Friends Thank You Breakfast Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman attended the Greater Akron Chamber of Commerce and Akron Friends Thank You Breakfast. During the breakfast, Portman spoke about current legislative priorities in Congress, including the CHIPS Act to reshore our nation’s semiconductor industry and its potential to bring significant economic development to Ohio. The CHIPS Act passed the Senate on Wednesday and the House on Thursday. It will now be sent to the president’s desk for signature. Portman also talked about the need for Congress to pass the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) and the FY 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). “It was great to be with the Greater Akron Chamber of Commerce this morning to provide them an update on my work in Senate. During the last few months of my tenure, I am focused on a few different priorities that will greatly impact Ohioans, such as keeping America competitive through the CHIPS Act, which just passed the Senate this past Wednesday,” said Senator Portman. “I also want to thank the Chamber for being supportive of my bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which became law last November. Over the next few years, we’ll get to see the positive effects of the bipartisan infrastructure law in Akron and around the country.” Senator Portman briefly touched on his bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which was signed into law last November. He thanked the Akron Chamber for their support of the legislation and spoke of the benefits the bill will bring to the Akron area. Portman also touched on grants Akron received – such as the TIGER, now RAISE, grants – which have made improvements to the Downtown Promenade and along Main Street. During his time in the Senate, Portman was supportive of Akron receiving said grants. Today’s breakfast was held at the Bowery Project, a $40 million development project aimed at continuing the revitalization of downtown Akron. This project was funded in part by $16 million in New Markets Tax Credits (NMTC) and more than $6.4 million in Historic Tax Credits (HTC), two key tax incentives Senator Portman fought to preserve during the tax reform debate in 2017.In Akron, Portman Visits the Akron Canton Regional Food Bank, Sees Firsthand How New Market Tax Credits Extension Act Funding Have Helped Expand Its Services With New Stark County Campus Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman visited the new Stark County Campus of the Akron Canton Regional Food Bank and met with the organization’s leadership to receive updates on the food bank’s operations – especially in light of hardships brought on by COVID-19. Senator Portman worked closely with Ohio’s food banks throughout the pandemic to ensure they were able to continue to provide food to Ohioans in need. He also received a tour of their new campus that covers the southern part of their service region. “I had a great visit at the new Stark County campus of the Akron Canton Regional Food Bank today. They have worked tirelessly to provide food to those in need throughout Northeast Ohio during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Portman. “I was pleased to see firsthand how New Markets Tax Credits have helped the Akron Canton Food Bank expand its services with a second facility in Stark County so it now has a permanent campus to better serve the Greater Akron region. We must ensure that all of our food banks have all the resources necessary to carry out their mission and I appreciated the opportunity to learn more about the needs of the Akron Canton Regional Food Bank so I can help ensure that they can continue to meet the increased demand due to this pandemic.”The new Stark County campus that Senator Portman toured today was built with support from the New Market Tax Credits. Portman supports making the NTMC permanent, leading efforts with a bipartisan group of lawmakers to introduce legislation New Markets Tax Credit Extension Act (S.456) – to accomplish that goal. This bill would permanently authorize a federal tax credit for businesses or economic development projects in areas with poverty rates of at least 20 percent, or median incomes at or below 80 percent of the area median. After seeing significant benefits for Ohio cities, Portman led efforts to preserve the credit during the 2017 tax reform debate and helped secure the five-year extension in the end-of-year spending package that passed Congress in December 2020.

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/portman-difference/fox-business-portman-discusses-surging-inflation-democrats-latest-tax,"Senator Portman joined FOX Business’ Kudlow this afternoon to discuss the consequences of the Democrats’ plan to raise taxes on workers’ wages, consumers, and producers. Portman said the Democrats’ tax hikes will hurt lower and middle-income Americans the most and will make soaring inflation and rising costs even worse. Portman noted that this was the wrong policy at the wrong time, with the U.S. now in recession, with taxes on businesses getting passed onto workers and consumers through lower wages and higher prices.

And, very specifically, what it’ll do is it will hurt workers’ wages, it will hurt consumers by raising prices, both of which are exactly what we shouldn’t be doing at a time of high inflation and low economic growth. Why? Because wages aren’t keeping up with inflation already. That’s the big issue out there. And, second, with regard to products, we don’t want things to cost more at a time when inflation is already driving their costs up way too high. So, it makes no economic sense. On top of that, the way in which the Democrats want to raise these taxes is using an alternative tax calculation system using essentially what they call book income, meaning GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) income. And you understand this better than anybody, Larry, but that’s terrible for the economy because it will have businesses actually managing toward that to avoid taxation which is bad for the economy, bad for economic growth, and precisely what we should not be doing right now at a time of stagflation: low economic growth, below zero, and high inflation…“Well, it couldn’t be worse, in part, because if you look at these numbers that just came out today, it indicated that investment is down. And, that includes inventory investment, it includes investment in the kinds of things that you’re talking about which would be new plant equipment, expanding facilities, all the things that we want to see. That investment actually was relatively low in this last quarter, even as compared to the economic growth numbers. So, that’s what drove our low economic growth, in part. So, it’s exactly the wrong time to do that. On this show, you’ll be able to explain to people, I know, because you understand this so well. How this is negative for workers, it’s negative for consumers, but it’s also bad for our overall economy and our interests in trying to climb out of this recession.”SENATOR PORTMAN ON TAX HIKES“Yeah and by the way, with regard to the tax issue, we’re going to get an analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation, which is a nonpartisan group, that will be very similar to what they gave us last year which says that these tax increases that supposedly fall on corporations, because under their book income they don’t show income, those will be paid by who? Not the corporation. It gets passed along and will be distributed to the shareholders, to the employees with lower wages, lower benefits, and, of course, to the consumer. So, that’s the, you know, nonpartisan analysis that we will see both within the Congress and from outside experts. So, this is not just a Republican saying this because I don’t like Democrat tax increases, this is the analysis that we’re going to get from the nonpartisan group, and I think people need to hear that.”SENATOR PORTMAN ON RECONCILIATION AND INFLATION “Yeah, to me, that process argument that we shouldn’t have done CHIPS because of the Reconciliation is actually less compelling than the actual substance of what’s in Reconciliation. I always knew the Democrats were going to try to do a reconciliation bill. Of course, they’ve been saying that and of course, they want to do that, because they can do it without a single Republican vote. I think it’s wrong that they’re doing it. “But, mostly, I’m concerned about what they’re doing because it’s terrible policy for the people I represent. And, in terms of whether we’re in a recession or not, traditionally, as you know better than anybody, what the definition is, is two quarters of negative economic growth, we have that now. But let’s forget that. Let’s talk to people who are actually suffering through this inflationary time and through this relatively low economic growth time. It certainly feels like a recession to them. They’re getting squeezed and, to me, that’s why this policy is so wrong headed and my hope is we can turn it around, in part by letting the American people know that this is going to make things worse, not better.” “Well, the kind of companies that’ll be hurt the worst, Larry, as you know, are ones that do take that depreciation and do take that median expensing and that includes extracted industries. So, it would include coal, mining, it would include manufacturing. It also includes financial services because they tend to take a lot of credits that would not be available under this. Bottom line is, just to try to simplify it, the tax code is written to provide certain tax preferences to incentivize certain kinds of behavior. You can argue whether that’s good or not. “But, if you want to change that, go into the tax code and get rid of these things that you think you don’t like. Maybe Republicans would get rid of green energy tax credits. Maybe Democrats would get rid of depreciation if it’s more accelerated. But, don’t do it by setting up a whole other tax system and, sort of, avoiding the issue here. So, if a company takes a legitimate tax preference, a credit, or a deduction, they should certainly be able to keep it. The alternative is it’s going to hurt some industries a lot worse than others. And, by the way, extractive industries like coal is one of them, as I understand it, because they’re capital intensive.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-praises-senate-passage-legislation-combat-invasive-species-address,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH), Co-Chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, applauded the Senate passage of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), bipartisan legislation that authorizes a host of investments in U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects and programs, including a number of Portman priorities and provisions that support the Great Lakes and the state of Ohio. Specifically, the WRDA bill includes measures that will protect and improve the water quality of the Great Lakes and waterways across Ohio by delivering more resources to combat invasive species, improve water infrastructure, support shoreline stabilization, and address the threat of coastal erosion.  “This bipartisan legislation includes a number of my key priorities that support the Great Lakes and waterways across Ohio,” said Portman. “From addressing coastal erosion along the shores of Lake Erie to combating invasive species in Ohio’s lakes and other inland waterways, this bipartisan legislation is a major win for the Great Lakes and the people of Ohio.”    NOTE: More specifically, the bipartisan Water Resources Development Act: ###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-foreign-relations-committee-hearing-portman-presses-nominee-us,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) pressed William Duncan, Nominee for U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of El Salvador, on the record levels of immigrants and drugs crossing the United States-Mexico border. Portman highlighted the need for El Salvador to implement a strategic plan and increase international collaboration to counter the narcotics that flow through Central America. Portman also questioned the nominee on the effects of Title 42 being revoked and the impact it would have on the United States, as the Mexico-U.S. border is experiencing an unprecedented surge of migrants. Senator Portman noted that many of the United States’ current policies encourage illegal immigration, which stems from Central and South America.  A transcript of Senator Portman’s questioning can be found below and the video can be found here.  Senator Portman: “Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Look, it’s a complicated political environment and I really appreciate all of you being willing to step up and serve your country for all of you, but one you have been serving your country through foreign service and have accomplished a great deal to get to the level that you are as ambassadors. But we need your help, I mean this is discouraging what’s going on. Uruguay being the exception and to, you know, the comments by Senator Rubio I think we do not take advantage of these relatively pro-democracy, pro-U.S. center and center-right governments enough and don’t show them enough love and support and that’s one reason we end up you know with the more difficult situations as we see in pretty much every country represented, even with regard to Suriname with regard to their opening to China which concerns me greatly and the Belt and Road Initiative, so that would be, I would echo those concerns and I think we need to double our efforts to demonstrate our support for those countries that are standing up for democracy, human rights, and are allied with us. With regard to El Salvador, I’m going to come at this a little differently, on the U.S. border we are experiencing something unparalleled, we’ve never seen it before. We have record levels of people, and drugs coming across the border. We got three months left in the fiscal year until we know what the final numbers are, already were at record levels of any year of the history of our country, and this is based on so called encounters, but it’s true that Salvador has been sending people to the United States for a long time, legally and illegally. “In fact, I’m told that the $7 billion dollars in remittances went to El Salvador last year that’s the World Bank figure, that’s a quarter of the GDP of El Salvador. And yet, you have Bukele, you know, treating the United States relationship in a way that would indicate that he doesn’t want to cooperate or work with us, and yet there’s this strong connection, I don’t know quite how to use that leverage but $7 billion dollars in remittances. One question I’d have for you Mr. Duncan because you’ve been at this a while, you got a lot of experience in Latin America. Title 42 is about to be revoked if the administration has its way and roughly half of the people who are stopped at the border and turned back are turned back because of Title 42 and yet we have record levels of illegal migration. So, without 42 being in place it would be a flood and that’s because of our silent policy, in my view primarily, but it’s also other changes that the administration made. What do you think about that? Do you think human smugglers and drug cartels will come from Salvador in increased numbers if Title 42 is revoked at the border”Nominee for U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of El Salvador William Duncan: “Thank you for the question, Senator. I’m afraid I can’t speak to what the effect of revocation of Title 42 would be.”Senator Portman: “I think you can.”Nominee for U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of El Salvador William Duncan: “Nor can I tell you because I am not involved in the conversations about Title 42. What I can say is that as you correctly point out, we’ve been seeing irregular migration from Central America, Salvador is a part of that. I think that in the last year or so they’ve been in fourth place about six percent of the total behind Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala. I think if I were confirmed I would be very focused on implementing the administration’s strategy with regard to the root causes of migration. I think democracy needs to be strengthened in El Salvador because I think that’s critical to prosperity. I think we need to keep working with the Salvadorians to strengthen the rule of law and try and reduce crime and violence.”Senator Portman: “I’m going to interrupt you if I could. I mean that’s fine we’ve spent I don’t know $3.6 billion in the last five years in Central America with regard to the root causes and the migration has increased, not decreased, so I’m not against dealing with the root causes but that’s not the issue. The issue is the pull factor. We went to Latin America, some of us here, including the Chairman recently and the presidents of the countries we visited, four of them, in Latin America, and Central America all said the same thing basically which is you guys are pulling our people north with your policies. So, you have a role to play there, you say you can’t speak to it, I hope you will speak to it because I think our own policies are largely the reason that you see this pull for the region and the illicit drugs are not produced in El Salvador but, boy it’s a major transit country for cocaine and heroin in particular. So, I hope if you are confirmed you will get involved in these issues and not just the root causes as important as they are. The Salvadorian Cooperation on Counter Drug and Anti-Gang Efforts, I assume you’re aware that we do not get the cooperation that we would like to have. Do you commit that you will work on increasing our level of cooperation in that area?”Nominee for U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of El Salvador William Duncan: “Thank you, Senator. Yes, absolutely, counter narcotics has been one of the areas where we have had some success in our collaboration with the Salvadorians and if confirmed I would seek to do everything in my power to increase that collaboration we have also worked with them and are working with them I should say, on border intelligence, on alien smuggling, and I think those are areas that can even be expanded and that’s what I would seek to do if I was confirmed.”Senator Portman: “I’ll have other questions in writing for your other colleagues, but again thank you for your willingness to serve. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman.” ###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-foreign-relations-committee-hearing-portman-presses-state-0,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) questioned Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Jose W. Fernandez on the State Department’s work to stop Russian attacks on Ukrainian ports, so that grain can be shipped to countries around the world. An additional 70 million people around the world that have fallen into poverty since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Russia’s continued blockage of ports have caused starvation rates to rise in some of the poorest parts of the world.Senator Portman also pressed the witnesses on whether the Biden administration has placed restrictions on agencies that hinders their efforts to work on all energy sectors, including liquefied natural gas and nuclear energy. Senator Portman aske how that would make sense when we are asking European countries to stop buying Russian energy and promising to replace it with energy from the United States.A transcript of Senator Portman’s questioning can be found below and the video can be found here.Senator Portman: “Thank you, Mr. Chairman and I was interested in Senator Shaheen’s question with regard to Global Engagement Center. I continue to have a deep concern that we don’t have somebody there on a permanent basis, leading that organization at a time when its mission is so important. So, I hope that you will take that message back, Mr. Secretary. You know, Leah Bray is the acting, but Senator Shaheen, can you think of a more important time for us to actually coordinate our efforts in terms of fighting back on this disinformation and the fact that the State Department can’t do the simple step of appointing somebody permanently to that and giving it a higher status at a time when we are trying to get more funding into that agency is a mystery to me. It’s not a confirmed position. So, Secretary Fernandez, Senator Shaheen and I were just at your alma mater for a reunion and she spoke eloquently about the issues in Ukraine and I tried to keep up. But, there is a lot of interest, everybody showed up because, you know, this is the crisis of our time in terms of the ability to defend democracy and freedom against tyranny and authoritarianism and in this case, you know, a brutal conquest. So, it is a time where the economic statecraft is mixed with the diplomacy that we are normally more engaged in. “Specifically, you know, right now the U.N. has worked out this arrangement with Turkey, and Russia, and Ukraine apparently to be able to allow some of this grain to be able to go – including to places like Africa where people are literally starving with this global food crisis and yet within 12 hours of that agreement being penned, which said that Russia would not attack any export facilities at any of the Ukrainian ports that were under discussion. They bombed Odessa with four missiles, two of which got through and night before last, I was on the floor of the Senate with a photograph showing the bombing and the impact of it. So, obviously, not to be trusted and that is the kind of message we need to get out to ensure that people do not believe the Russian disinformation in places like Africa. Do you have any update on that, Secretary Fernandez? Where we are with regard to stopping the Russian attacks on the ports, certainly, but then more importantly getting this grain out to the rest of the world?”Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Jose W. Fernandez: “Thank you, Senator. I’m glad you mentioned our alma mater. Look, Russia is using food as a weapon. We know that. And it’s blaming the U.S. for the consequences. Just the U.N intel since the invasion of Ukraine we have got an additional 70 million people around the world that have fallen into poverty. We welcome the agreement, but at the same time, we just don’t trust Putin. I think that the events that you described show that we have to be careful. What we have done on food security is, we have provided almost $5 billion worth of food aid around the world, we’ve convened the food security minister which attracted over 100 countries to talk about what we are going to do to try and deal with this crisis. We are every day. I tell people that, ‘I wake up thinking about Ukraine. I go to sleep thinking about Ukraine and in between we try to help Ukraine.’ The food security issue goes beyond Ukraine and it shows, and this goes to the misinformation point, that this is not just a European problem. The effects of Putin’s invasion and brutality in Ukraine affects the entire world and we see that in Africa as well.” Senator Portman: “I agree, my time is limited here so let me get into another result of what Russia chose to do. It was a war of choice, this brutal invasion, and that’s on the energy front. And, you’re right, it’s affecting the entire globe in terms of energy prices, but specifically our European allies. Those in the region, I was in Moldova and Romania recently, their biggest issue they raised with me apart from the Russian invasion generally is energy. My understanding is that despite some good work USTDA has done, Director Ebong, that the Development Finance Cooperation, as an example, has self-imposed restrictions that hinders their efforts to work on all energy sectors, including liquefied natural gas. Is that possible? I mean we are telling Europeans, ‘stop depending on Russia for your liquefied natural gas. Instead, we’ll provide you some.’ And some of our agencies are being told that they can’t work on liquefied natural gas because it’s a fossil fuel, even though its cleaner than the alternative? And even though we are begging the Europeans to do the right thing and stop feeding the war machine with sending $870 million a day, which is roughly what they send for oil and gas. Is that true? Can I hear from either one of you about that?”Under Sectary Fernandez: “Look, let me be clear. The DFC is not prohibited, not prohibited from energy, from these kinds of projects. What we have done is instituted an additional review for any carbon intensive projects. So, the answer to your question Senator is no, there is no prohibition. I will tell you this, this is something I said earlier. We are now the largest exporter of LNG to Europe. We have tripled our exports this year. Seventy-five percent of our exports—”Senator Portman: “Let me ask you this. Are they allowed to work on nuclear power? Or is that also subject to restrictions and further review? I mean, I’m in Romania and they are begging for us to help them with nuclear reactors. They want the Import-Export Bank, which is not represented here today, as DFC is not unfortunately because I’d like to talk to both of them. But we have got to help Romania with this. It’s absolutely essential to Moldova also which is obviously in a very vulnerable position. So, anyway, I appreciate the testimony today and echo the comments that some of my colleagues. In terms of us having a more aggressive and more realistic economic aspect to our diplomacy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-brown-introduce-legislation-improve-care-those-eligible-both,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) introduced the bipartisan Comprehensive Care for Dual Eligible Individuals Act. The legislation would support states that offer integrated, coordinated care options for those who are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare, ensuring they receive the full benefits and quality care they deserve. More than 12 million Americans are dually eligible for both programs.“I am pleased to introduce this bipartisan legislation with Senator Brown to provide states with the ability to offer full-benefit dual eligible beneficiaries the option to have their needs met through one program,” said Portman. “This legislation will set a higher quality of care for millions of Americans, while promoting integration of these siloed programs. I encourage all of my colleagues in the Senate to support this important legislation.”“Currently, people eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare have to deal with a fragmented, confusing system, and too many can fall through the cracks,” said Brown. “This bipartisan legislation would help integrate care, make government work better, and improve the health of older Americans and people with disabilities.”Right now, nearly half of all Americans eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid receive long-term care services and more than half of these beneficiaries have multiple chronic conditions, including mental health diagnoses. In order to receive the care and support they need, they have to deal with two sets of administrative rules and policies, which can lead to duplicated or fragmented care and poor health outcomes. The Comprehensive Care for Dual Eligible Individuals Act of 2022 would create a new program that states can choose to take up, to integrate the two programs and allow dual-eligible Americans to select the type of coordinated care that works best for them.  “We thank Senators Brown and Portman for their new federal legislation which would give individuals eligible for Medicare and Medicaid the option to receive all their care in a more coordinated way that is easier to navigate. It holds promise as a vehicle to help states like Ohio in their work to improve the quality of health care for low-income older adults and people with disabilities and give them the supports they need to live in their communities,” said Kevin Prindiville, Executive Director, Justice in Aging.“Far too many people who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid experience fragmented care and disjointed systems. The bipartisan Comprehensive Care for Dual Eligible Individuals Act would allow states to better integrate these critical programs while ensuring key beneficiary protections, like appeal and enrollment rights. In so doing, this important bill could meaningfully improve care for older adults and people with disabilities — in Ohio and across the country. We applaud Senators Brown and Portman for their leadership,” said Frederic Riccardi, President, Medicare Rights Center.Specifically, the Comprehensive Care for Dual Eligible Individuals Act would provide states with the opportunity to establish programs to integrate care for dual eligible individuals, allowing beneficiaries to choose a single program that can provide for their medical, long-term care, social, and behavioral needs. The legislation is supported by a variety of stakeholder organizations, including the Commonwealth Care Alliance, Community Catalyst, Health Plan of San Mateo, Independent Living Systems, Justice in Aging, L.A. Care Health Plan, Medicare Rights Center, Molina, National Alliance on Mental Illness, and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.For full text of the bill, click here. ###

The resolution was adopted by unanimous consent, after being reported favorably out the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in June. “I am pleased that my bipartisan resolution with Senator Coons to commend Radio Free Asia on its continued work in providing a free flow of information in South and East Asia has now passed the Senate,” said Senator Portman. “For the past 25 years, Radio Free Asia has delivered balanced and objective reporting to countries where freedom of the press is only an idea. Their work is critical to combating the deception and falsehoods spread by authoritarian regimes and violent non-state actors, and I appreciate their continued efforts to combat anti-democratic influences in the region.”“For the last 25 years, Radio Free Asia has served as a free speech platform for audiences living under authoritarian rule and in some of the world’s most challenging media environments,” said Senator Coons. “It has also played a vital role in documenting human rights and civil rights abuses in these countries, an important and impressive achievement considering the heightened pressure on press around the world. I am glad that Congress has reaffirmed its commitment to supporting press freedom, and I look forward to seeing Radio Free Asia continue to pursue journalistic excellence and maintain its international reputation for reliable news across the continent.”The resolution:The full text of the resolution is available here. ###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-klobuchar-calvert-mccollum-introduce-bipartisan-bicameral,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and U.S. Representatives Ken Calvert (R-CA) and Betty McCollum (D-MN) introduced a bipartisan, bicameral resolution recognizing July as Disability Pride Month. The resolution also celebrates the contributions of Americans with disabilities and highlights the need to prevent exclusion and discrimination on the basis of disability.“I am pleased to introduce this resolution with Senator Klobuchar designating July as Disability Pride Month,” said Portman. “Tens of millions of Americans live with disabilities, often facing loneliness and discrimination due to their disability. It is important that we support and uplift those with disabilities because in spite of the challenges they face, they bring tremendous value to our country. I can think of no better way to celebrate the 32nd anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act – signed into law by my mentor President George H. W. Bush – than by introducing this resolution.”“Thirty-two years ago, the Americans with Disabilities Act passed, helping protect millions of Americans from discrimination and exclusion,” said Klobuchar. “By designating July as Disability Pride Month, this bipartisan resolution honors the many contributions Americans with disabilities have made to our country and acknowledges the need to continue the fight to address the barriers that Americans with disabilities face.”“With more than an estimated 61 million Americans living with a disability, I am proud to work on a bipartisan basis to recognize July as Disability Pride Month,” said Calvert. “The landmark Americans With Disabilities Act put in place a number of safeguards to protect disabled people from discrimination. This resolution will provide an opportunity for increased participation, education, and awareness of challenges facing the disability community. I appreciate the work of Rep. Betty McCollum and Senators Klobuchar and Portman in helping to establish July as Disability Pride Month.”“The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) transformed everyday life for millions of people across the United States 32 years ago,” said McCollum. “Though Disability Pride has long been celebrated each July within the disability community, is not yet recognized on the federal level. That’s why I am introducing a resolution with Congressman Calvert in the House, alongside Senators Klobuchar and Portman in the Senate, to mark this commemorative month and affirm that people with disabilities are valued and equal members of our communities and our society. Much more work remains to advance the rights of the disability community, stop stigma, and increase accessibility. Establishing Disability Pride Month will not only serve to raise awareness about this movement, but will also shine a light on the community’s many positive contributions to our nation’s rich diversity.” The resolution is supported by: Allina Health; the American Association on Health and Disability; the Amputee Coalition of America; the Autism Society of Minnesota; the Autistic Self Advocacy Network; the Brain Injury Association of America; the Courage Kenny Rehabilitation Institute; Cure SMA; Down Syndrome Association of Minnesota; Family Voices; Family Voices of Minnesota; Gillette Children’s; Minnesota Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities; Minnesota Council on Disability; Minnesota First Community Solutions; Multicultural Autism Action Network; National Disability Institute; National Disability Rights Network; National Down Syndrome Congress; ONE Community; RespectAbility; Special Olympics; The Arc Minnesota; and United Cerebral Palsy.The full text of the resolution is available here and below:Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 61,000,000 adults in the United States have disabilities;Whereas the United States Census Bureau reports that more than 3,000,000 children in the United States have disabilities;Whereas the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) was signed into law on July 26, 1990;Whereas individuals with a disability remain at an increased risk of experiencing discrimination, isolation, and inequities;Whereas individuals with disabilities are vital and make meaningful contributions to the arts, science, health care, technology, sports, education, law, and many more sectors; andWhereas ‘‘Disability Pride Month’’ is celebrated in July by people across the United States: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate—1) expresses support for the designation of July 2022 as ‘‘Disability Pride Month’’; and(2) calls on the people of the United States, interest groups, and affected people to—(a) observe ‘‘Disability Pride Month’’ with appropriate celebrations and activities; and(b) take an active role in preventing the exclusion of, and discrimination against, individuals with disabilities.###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-praises-senate-passage-legislation-boost-semiconductor,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) issued the following statement on Senate passage of the CHIPS Act, bipartisan legislation to incentivize semiconductor manufacturing in the United States, make our supply chains more resilient, enhance our national security, and strengthen our economy: “Today’s passage of the CHIPS Act is critical in the effort to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States, protect our national security and create thousands of high-paying jobs in Ohio. I was proud to help lead efforts in the Senate to pass this legislation and ensure that Intel’s planned semiconductor plant in central Ohio remains on track and reaches its full potential. Intel’s announced investment is already the largest in Ohio’s history and the company has indicated that with this CHIPS legislation its record investment will grow even larger over time. It is also expected that other major Ohio investments from suppliers will follow. I urge the House to act quickly on this bipartisan legislation so the president can sign it into law, and I look forward to attending the groundbreaking for this transformational project in the coming months.”Ohio’s business community has praised Senator Portman’s work to secure passage of the CHIPS Act:“Fully funding the CHIPS Act is vital for America’s economic competitiveness and national security. The CHIPS Act will accelerate the pace and impact Ohio will have at the center of the Silicon Heartland, while driving investments in America. In true Ohio spirit, Senator Portman and Ohio’s bipartisan Congressional Delegation have aggressively supported the CHIPS Act - we are thrilled with today’s progress and urge speedy passage in the US House,” said J.P. Nauseef, President and CEO of JobsOhio.“Senator Portman’s leadership from the beginning of this process has been instrumental. This is extremely impactful legislation for our national security, the semiconductor industry and the communities, families, and individuals it supports across America and here in Ohio,” said Kenny McDonald, President and CEO of the Columbus Partnership.“Today’s passage of the CHIPS Act by the U.S. Senate is a monumental win for Ohio and our country. Intel Corporation is laying the groundwork for the United States to return as a manufacturing superpower for semiconductors, and the CHIPS Act is a pivotal component for making that happen.  Producing computer chips domestically is critical for so many sectors of our economy — military readiness, electrical grid infrastructure and much more — but it is also imperative for our national security as it will decrease our dependence on trade with China. Senator Portman has been a leader from day one on sounding the alarm on the importance of bringing this industry back to America, which will protect our nation from foreign interests. I urge the House to take swift action to get the legislation to the President’s desk as soon as possible,” said Pat Tiberi, President and CEO of the Ohio Business Roundtable.“Ohio’s economy stands to benefit even more from the transformational nature of Intel’s investment in semiconductor manufacturing in our state thanks to the CHIPS Act, which will bolster American manufacturing and national security. We want to thank the members of Ohio’s Congressional delegation who have been working hard to see this through, especially Senators Portman and Brown, for their leadership on this important issue,” said Steve Stivers, President and CEO of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce.“Investment in the domestic semiconductor industry is critical to keeping our nation strong and competitive,” said Ohio State President Kristina M. Johnson. “This bill recognizes the importance of realizing that goal by making strategic investments in research and development, overcoming supply chain challenges, and cultivating the workforce of the future. Ohio State is deeply committed to playing a key role in economic growth both locally – particularly related to the Silicon Heartland initiative – and across the U.S., and we are grateful to Senator Portman for his support,” said Ohio State President Kristina M. Johnson, PhD.###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/portman-difference/bloomberg-tv-portman-discusses-us-trade-policies-chips-act-west,"Senator Portman joined Bloomberg TV today to discuss whether certain trade policies could help lower the high level of inflation the country is experiencing. Portman suggested policies that could be helpful, such as keeping Trump-era tariffs in place for countries, like China, that are not playing by the rules and completing important trade agreements that are very closed to being done, including with the United Kingdom. In regard to almost-completed trade agreements, Senator Portman pointed out the fact that the Biden administration has not allowed for the Trade Promotion Authority to take place and has refused to consider new trade agreements, causing current trade agreements to be stalled and hamstringing this country from one way to better fight back against China. Senator Portman also addressed the CHIPS Act, which is currently being voted on in the Senate. He spoke about the importance of the legislation, to bring chip manufacturing back to America. Portman also discussed his amendment to include provisions from his bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act, or SAIA, which passed the Senate last year on a bipartisan basis as a part of the CHIPS Plus package currently under consideration. The SAIA provisions in Portman’s amendment will ensure the federal government is taking decisive action to safeguard the $250 billion American taxpayer-funded investment in research and innovation included it in the CHIPS Plus package. Senator Portman was also asked about the role of regulatory agencies in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in West Virginia v. EPA, restricting the ability of the Executive Branch to exceed direction from Congress. He said the decision was important because it limits overreach by administrative agencies, but also stated that Congress needs to be more comprehensive and precise in legislation to make Congressional intent clear. Excerpts of the interview can be found below and you can also watch the interview here. PORTMAN ON HOW TRADE POLICY COULD LOWER INFLATION“I heard Austan Goolsbee’s analysis, which I thought was interesting, and he talked about the supply-side as well as the demand-side and talked about a consensus of economists, maybe on the issue of supply. I think there is also a consensus on the issue of demand, which is that we stimulated demand, with an unprecedented amount of stimulus spending a year and a couple of months ago. On the supply-side though, with regard to trade, there are two ideas that I think would be quite helpful. One is to try to reduce the cost to consumers by taking a position where there are at least exclusions in the current tariffs that are being applied in the China context. Those exclusions were in place back in the Trump years and could be done again. That does not mean getting rid of the tariffs which were put in for good reason and there is a Section 301 report detailing why, which is that China is not playing by the rules. But then second, and I think most importantly, is to get America back in the game, which means more trade and that means one, finishing up the U.K. trade agreement, which is right on the cusp of being completed, but also entering into what we call plurilateral, meaning multilateral agreements with people through the World Trade Organization that do not have to include everybody, which is the current rule, and allow those to be passed by Congress. As an example, there's a number of discussions right now underway about environmental goods or services. We could come up with agreements on these topics by not saying it has to be an absolute consensus. Countries that want to be a part of it could be. That would be a breakthrough and would be extremely important for our long-term economy, for us to have the ability to do that with like-minded countries. I think there are things in trade we should be doing and I’m not quite sure why we are not doing, that make a lot of sense. My hope is that we will move forward on that.”PORTMAN ON WHETHER THERE ARE ANY TRADE NEGOITIONS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW“No, unfortunately, the administration has taken the position that they are not interested in what’s called Trade Promotion Authority, which gives Congress the ability not just to help negotiate these agreements but then to take them up on an up or down basis. Because countries won’t negotiate with you if they think it could be amended to death in U.S. Congress. This is why trade agreements typically have to have Trade Promotion Authority. They have allowed that to expire and they are not seeking to extend it. That is too bad because we always want that. Every administration should want it and Congress should want it. Second, they said that they are not interested in new trade agreements. Which to me really handicaps us, that is an extraordinary statement given the fact every administration, Republican and Democrat alike, has negotiated trade agreements and we should get back in the business of doing that. I mentioned the U.K. because we were so close, we were probably four-fifths of the way there, with a good agreement with them that could then be a template then for the rest of the EU. But also finishing up a trade agreement with Japan would be incredibly helpful right now. Japan is by far the largest economy in the Transpacific Partnership group. We have trade agreements with most members of that group. Having Japan would be incredibly important from an economic point of view and also a geopolitical point of view, vis-a-vis China. And then there are countries in Africa who have been looking to us to say, ‘Can we do a trade agreement with you.’ Kenya, in particular, I’ll be there next month. My hope is that we get back in the game here and it seems to me to be really shooting themselves in the foot for the administration to say they do not want to move forward on trade agreements. This is something that more exports is a good thing for us and creates jobs and helps our economy.”PORTMAN ON THE CHIPS ACT AS IT RELATES TO CHINA“We did insert some language that I supported on the so-called guardrails to avoid just what you had talked about. I think that’s important. China is very interested, as you know, in investing a lot of money in chips and providing huge incentives, far more than what we are talking about in the CHIPS legislation here, and so are other countries, by the way, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan of course. Now the European Union and particularly Germany has put on the table some very generous incentives for companies to go to Germany rather than come to the United States. So, our goal here is to bring this back to America. We are less than 12 percent of the chip production in the world. We started this industry and we still do a lot of the design but the production has gone overseas. And of that 12 percent, by the way, almost none of it is high-end chips. From a national security point of view, and an economic security point of view, we want to reshore some of this chip production, particularly the higher-end chips to be able to ensure we have reliable access to the supply chain. My hope is that we will pass it today. I think we will. We just had a very strong vote on the first step in the process, so called cloture vote, and I think a second vote will be tomorrow now. I also hope we put additional protections for the research, particularly from adversaries like China who want access to our research that taxpayers are paying for. We got to be sure we are tightening that up and my hope is that we will do that this afternoon as well.”PORTMAN ON THE WEST VIRGINIA V. EPA DECISION“I can tell your University of Michigan Law School degree is serving you well, David. It's a complicated area and as you know, there are lots of Supreme Court cases about this issue. You know, where does the Legislative Branch end and the Administrative Branch begin? The Executive Branch has been more and more aggressive at taking what Congress passes and then putting their own details into it. That is what the Supreme Court was essentially saying, ‘wait a minute, we've got to be sure the Congress, which is representative of the people, and under our Constitution has the authority here to actually change the way we mandate or regulate, you know, has the final say.’ One of the problems in my view, the broad issue here is that Congress has provided legislation that does give an opening to the Executive Branch to do more and more. Congress needs to be, in my view, more comprehensive, more precise in their legislation, and let people see what the actual Congressional intent is. That is part of the issue. The other issue is the overreaching by the administrative agencies. And that is what the Supreme Court was commenting on. I will say right now, in terms of this inflationary spiral that we are seeing, which is already feeling like a recession to low and moderate income people in Ohio and people on a fixed income because wages are not keeping up with inflation by any stretch, and it is not just gas prices which have gone down a little, which is great but they are still way too high. But it is food, its clothing, its everything they are buying. So, getting back to that pre-pandemic environment, economic environment, where wages were going far more than inflation does require looking at the regulatory side. And smart deregulation, smart permitting reform as an example, would really help right now. Certainly, don't raise taxes. Certainly don’t put more stimulus into the economy and get the supply side in better shape. The Fed can do some things with raising rates, not just on the supply side but also, I would say per Austan Goolsbee's comments, it’s not just about supply. When they raise rates what they are doing is trying to reduce demand as well. A much better way is put in place the pro-growth policies we had before the pandemic that were working for Americans, particularly working families in Ohio who were getting ahead and now see that they are getting behind.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-floor-portman-urges-nato-expansion-counter-russian-aggression,"WASHINGTON, DC – Tonight, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) delivered remarks on the Senate floor in support of Ukraine for the 19th consecutive week while the Senate has been in session. Portman discussed Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian ports and Russia’s missile strikes against Odessa, a Ukrainian port city, just hours after agreeing to a humanitarian deal with the U.N. to allow it to operate. Russia’s blockade on Ukrainian ports has caused massive food shortages across the globe. Portman also noted the four additional HIMARS, or High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, the U.S. is sending to Ukraine, and the possibility for the U.S. and our allies to send advanced Western fighter jets to Ukraine. A long-time advocate for arming Ukraine, Senator Portman has been pushing for months to give Ukraine the weapons it needs to successfully counter Russian attacks. Senator Portman closed with the effect the war is having on the children of Ukraine, and talked about the thousands of broken families and now orphans who will have war-torn memories instead of childhoods. To recognize the devastation of this war, and as a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Portman joined his colleagues to introduce a bipartisan resolution recognizing Russia’s atrocities in Ukraine as a genocide. A transcript of his remarks can be found below and a video can be found here. “I come to the Senate floor once again this evening to talk about the brutal and illegal unjustified invasion of Ukraine by Russia and what we can do, what more we can do here in this chamber and in this Congress to be able to help the people of Ukraine. This is the updated map that tells the story of what's going on on the battlefield. “You can see this light blue color here indicates that the Ukrainian forces are on the move and making progress, but in the meantime, Russia back in 2014 took Crimea, part of the Donbas. Now they've taken more of that territory. “So, the fighting that we'll talk about tonight that is most fierce is taking place here in the east and now increasingly here in the south. This is where the battlefield is, but that's not the only place that things are happening. Remember this is a country, Ukraine, that just wants to live in peace with its neighbors. It has no interest in war. And this is Russia's assault on that country starting in 2014 and now this larger assault. “But it's not just here in this battlefield. Russia is actually sending missiles into the heart of Ukraine. You see this town here, Vinnytsya. This is where recently a missile exploded killing civilians, and children. Last week I talked about Liza, a young girl who was killed in that bombing. So, every place in Ukraine is subject to this kind of bombing. We've heard it in Kharkiv, we've seen it in Kyiv and other towns all throughout Ukraine. “Another part of this brutal assault on Ukraine has to do with blocking the ports. So, here's Odessa. This is the largest port, but there are several ports along here that have been blocked by the Russians. So, the Russian navy is not allowing exports from Ukraine to be sent to the rest of the world. “This, of course, is hurting Ukraine's economy which is the whole idea, but it's also preventing the export of millions of tons of grain which is creating a global food crisis, threatening the lives of millions of people around the world, particularly in Africa where they rely heavily on Ukrainian grains coming out of these ports. After weeks of discussions, really the last couple of months, finally on Friday Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, and the United Nations agreed to facilitate the export of Ukrainian grain. “According to the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres who has been working on this for months, this provides, ‘a glimmer of hope in alleviating the global food security crisis.’ One part of the agreement that was reached in Turkey was that Russia would not attack facilities in these Ukrainian cities, specifically the agreement prohibited any attacks against merchant vehicles and other civilian vessels and port facilities engaged in the export of Ukrainian agricultural products. “So, there was an agreement to allow the grain to go, but also a specific agreement not to attack merchant vessels, civilian vessels, port facilities that were involved in export. The ink was quite literally barely dry when Russia violated the terms of that agreement. Within 24 hours the Russians fired four missiles at Ukraine's largest port Odessa, which again is critical to exporting grain from Ukraine. By striking the port infrastructure, they violated the agreement right after signing it. “Here's the port. You can see the damage that was caused. There were actually four missiles fired from warships into Odessa. Two were intercepted by antiaircraft weaponry, thank God, but two destroyed part of Odessa's port infrastructure, therefore, violating the agreement. I guess we all learned that Russia can't be trusted so we shouldn't be surprised, but violating its international obligations less than 24 hours after agreeing to them may be a new low. Oksana Makarova who is Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States put it well this weekend when she said, ‘We would do everything in order to perform and fulfill our part of our deal. When Russia is violating it, they are clearly showing who they are and that needs to be stopped.’ “She went further and said, ‘everything Russia is doing in Ukraine is a violation of pretty much every international law, attacking a sovereign country, it's a war crime.’ She's right. Ambassador Bridge Brink, our Ambassador to Ukraine also criticized Russia for this brazen attack. She said, ‘the Kremlin continues to weaponize food. Russia must be held accountable.’“I've talked before on this floor about the specific Russian attacks on the grain bins in Odessa and other port cities where they literally have targeted food that is supposed to go to starving people. President Putin apparently believes that this global food and energy security crisis, the two crises, are to his advantage.“He's seeking to pressure energy-dependent Europeans and pressure countries which rely on Ukrainian grain to join him in forcing Ukraine to surrender. Fortunately, it's not working. Countries in the region in fact are rallying around Ukraine more than ever. Why? Because they know they could be next. Vladimir Putin has said his ambition is to fully restore the borders of the old Soviet Union or the Russian empire and in recent years he has learned the lesson that the West may not stand in his way. “Few global leaders, as an example, stood up to President Putin when he invaded Georgia, a country that continues to be, in part, occupied by the Russians. That was in 2008. And not enough stood up to him in Ukraine in 2014 when, as we saw in this previous map, Russia brazenly invaded and took over Crimea and parts of the Donbas. When it comes to 2022, it's been different so far. And we should commend all those countries that have stood up and stood with us. “We now have a chance to actually stop this assault, to stop what Russia has been doing, and to teach them a different lesson, to protect Ukraine and other countries in the region that Russia may have set its sights on. The free world has rallied. Freedom-loving countries, almost 50 from around the world, have come to Ukraine's aid. “Specifically, over 42 of them have provided military assistance. Others have provided humanitarian aid by way of food and nutrition and economic help. The weapons that have been provided have made it easier for Ukraine to defend itself, to take out some of the Russian artillery that was sitting back and firing on Ukrainian positions with immunity because it was so far back the Ukrainian artillery couldn't reach it. The new weapons have been helpful in dealing with that. “The U.S. has provided Ukraine with a specific weapon to help in that regard called the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, and they have been critical to the Ukrainian military as they hold off the Russian invaders and allow the Ukrainian military to, once again, be on the offensive in some of these areas. A step in the right direction came last week. I commend the administration for sending Ukraine four more HIMAR systems. “They now have 12 in operation and four more units on the way to the front lines. That's good. But they need more. What the analysts suggest is they need 40 or 50 just to be able to push the Russians back. Officials in Ukraine have made the need for these systems clear, by the way, for a long time, since early March. I have echoed that need since that time. Why? Because I was hearing it directly from the Ukrainians, from their military experts. So, it took us a while, but it turns out the Ukrainians were right. These systems are effective. “General Mark Milley, who is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said that HIMARS strikes are, ‘steadily degrading the Russian ability to supply their troops, command and control their forces, and carry out their illegal war of aggression.’ That's from General Milley. The Ukrainians are an effective force when they were armed with the right weapons. Officials have said with the help of HIMARS, Ukraine has taken out Russian command posts, ammunition depots, air defense sights, radar and communications nodes, and long-range artillery positions. “These are all high-value targets and destroying them has saved Ukrainian lives and saved some of the shelling of Ukrainian cities. There also seems to be some progress in sending Ukraine other tools to help them fight, particularly in the air. The U.S. Air Force’s top general hinted last week that Ukraine might get fourth-generation fighter jets from the United States or other allies and he left open the option to train Ukrainians on how to use them. These fourth-generation fighter jets could include U.S. F-16s, the Gripen from Sweden, the Rafale from France, and the Eurofighter from the European Union. Some of Russia’s most devastating strikes, of course, have come from the air. Either from aircraft or from missile strikes. “Earlier in the war, you remember, there were many who talked about creating a no-fly zone in Ukraine. That never happened. NATO was not willing to move forward with a no-fly zone, but by providing Ukraine with advanced aircraft, we could empower Ukrainian fighter pilots to impose their own no-fly zone over critical areas of the country. Two weeks ago, I sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and to General Milley urging them to expedite more military assistance to Ukraine, including fourth-generation fighter aircraft and necessary flight training.“The reason we included that in our bipartisan letter is because we had heard from Ukrainian fighter pilots who came over here several weeks ago and met with us. I'm the co-founder, co-chair of the Ukrainian Caucus. We put together a meeting. It was very powerful to hear their words. But they said they know how to fly these planes and with regard to the details, they could learn them quickly and it would make a huge difference. “It has made a huge difference with what they have, which are aging Soviet aircraft, MiGs, and not enough of them. But we've got to move quickly if we do this because we've got to keep Russia from gaining more ground and we've got to save more lives. Training Ukrainian pilots on modern Western aircraft will take some time. As we've seen, even a day delay can mean the difference between life and death. So, let's get started. “There's also the battle being waged on energy, and that is in a sense just as important as what's happening on the battlefront. Why? Because Russia gets its funds from energy receipts. That's what's funding the war machine. And they continue to leverage Europe's dependency on their oil and gas as a political and economic weapon. “This is plainly seen as President Putin continues to play games with Europe’s gas supply. Europe depends on Russia now for 20 percent of its natural gas imports. That's down from around 40 present last year. So, a significant reduction, reducing by half their dependency. But with regard to that 20 percent, President Putin is tightening his grip and retaining his leverage on Europe by decreasing supplies, by driving prices upward, and by lining his war chest even further. By the way, his attempts to divide NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, have not worked. Over Russian objections, NATO will soon be expanding rather than dividing or contracting. “Instead of splintering, last Tuesday I was proud to vote to advance the ratification of Finland and Sweden’s NATO applications. As Republican Leader, Mitch McConnell said recently, ‘adding these nations into the fold will only strengthen us.’ I agree. Finland, by the way, has the European Union's longest border with Russia and has a very capable air force and other parts of its military. “In response to Russia’s aggression, they have increased their defense spending by 70 percent and Sweden is targeting military spending at the NATO commitment level of 2 percent of GDP, as soon as possible. And already possesses an innovative and effective defense industry. In fact, the Swedish weapons that are in the market today are some of the most advanced in the world. Adding Sweden and Finland to NATO will strengthen the alliance’s security in the north, particularly the arctic region and the Baltic Sea. “I just learned a little while ago that we're going to vote on their applications to join NATO here on the Senate floor this week or next week. That's great news. I hope my colleagues will join me in a prompt and strong showing of support. This is going to be one of the things that brings this Congress together because this is in all of our interests, in NATO's interest, America's interest, and certainly in Ukraine's interest. It’s a clear demonstration to Ukraine that NATO’s open door policy is alive and well that the alliance will continue to welcome applicant countries that meet the criteria for membership. “I believe NATO should begin that process with Ukraine, allowing them to enter the next step to membership by entering into what is called the Membership Action Plan, the MAP process. This plan provides a formal road map for NATO membership that is long overdue in my view. We need to show Ukraine the world stands with them and NATO is a defensive alliance. NATO is about protecting countries in the region. Last week congress had the privilege to hear from someone who knows how critically important it is that we stand with Ukraine right now. “We heard from Olena Zelenska, President Zelenskyy’s wife. She gave a very powerful speech to the Congress about the horrors of the war and about the desperate need for more advanced weapons from the United States and allies. She painted a vivid picture of life in Ukraine right now. Her moving words about her own family and about the effects this traumatizing war has etched in the memory of Ukraine's children I thought was particularly poignant. She said Ukraine needs, ‘weapons to wage a war not on somebody else's land but to protect one’s home and the right to wake up alive in that home.’ “To protect one's home and the right to wake up alive in that home. That's what this is about. In a TV interview during her visit here, Ms. Zelenska talked about the trauma children have faced and said that she hopes their childhood can be given back to them at some point. She said, ‘before the war my 9-year-old son used to go to folk dance ensemble. He played piano, he learned English, he of course attended sports club. Now, she said, the only thing he wants to do is martial arts and learn how to use a rifle.’ That's a 9-year-old boy. “At the Polish border and the Moldovan border, I have had the opportunity to visit with refugees as they've come across from Ukraine. It's all women and children, grandmothers, mothers, aunts, the men staying behind to fight. This war is taking away these kids' childhoods and replacing them with war-torn memories. Those children who fled Ukraine in the early stages of the war are now growing up making friends and going to school in foreign countries. Seven or 8 million Ukrainians left Ukraine. They are far from home and they want to go home. “And those who stayed in Ukraine are in constant fear that the next Russian missile may hit their home, their town, their city. Many will never have the opportunity to get their childhood back. First Lady Olena Zelenska has even started her own initiative to address the serious mental health impacts of Russia’s war against her country. Although underreported in most media outlets, Russia has forcibly deported millions of Ukrainians to Russia or Russian-controlled territory in the Donbas, including hundreds of thousands of children. “Once outside Ukrainian territory, these children are taught to be Russian, not Ukrainian, in a deliberate attempt by Russia to wipe out the national and cultural identity of Ukrainians. Combined with Russia's consistent denial of the existence of Ukrainian nationhood and identity, these acts must be acknowledged for what they are – genocide, and it is important that the United States and the rest of the world recognize these acts as such. “That's one reason why the world must call out Russia for what is happening in Ukraine. Last Thursday five Senate colleagues and I joined Senator Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relation Committee on which I serve, in introducing a bipartisan resolution condemning Russia's actions in Ukraine as genocide. I know genocide is a really powerful word. It's got a long history and serious implications. Many people are understandably hesitant to use it, but the facts and Russia's atrocities are clearly genocide. Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crime of Genocide defines genocide as any of several acts, ‘committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnic, religious, or racial group.’ “Two of the acts in the definition are killing members of the group and causing bodily or mental harm to members of the group. Only one of those criteria is necessary for genocide. Russia all too clearly fits all of these parts of the definition of genocide. Its forces have killed and wounded innocent civilians all across Ukraine. Last week I spoke about little Liza who was killed in Vinnystya. This is the aftermath of the bombing in Vinnytsya. I've also heard about the target practice that Russian soldiers have bragged about that they did in Syeverodonetsk, shooting at innocent civilians like it was some kind of a game. “And we cannot forget the horrors of Buca where Russian forces massacred over 1,300 innocent civilians, some with hands tied behind their backs. This included 31 children and the mental toll of this war has, of course, also been extreme. Our Senate resolution also includes a clause about my resolution form 2018 commemorating the 85th anniversary of Holodomor, the Soviet Union's famine genocide against Ukraine from 1932 to 1933. “Unfortunately, Russia has a history of committing genocide against the people of Ukraine and that continues to this day. The world needs to let the Russian commanders and Kremlin officials know we see the war crimes being committed and they are being recorded. Perhaps that would have some sort of effect on what actions they take. The trickle-down effect of this war is heartwrenching. We've all seen the images, the videos on social media of innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. But not only that, it's what this war has created, the countless children who are now orphans. “I've talked about this in the past, but according to Under Secretary of State Victoria Newland, ‘Russia makes orphans and then steals those orphans – up to 1,000 Ukrainian kids are being stolen and taken and given to Russian families to potentially never be found by their families.’ That's very concerning. Let me say that again. She is saying that Russia takes these orphans and steals them, gives them to Russian families, but potentially never be found by their Ukrainian families. So, there are all these young boys and young girls who watch their fathers and brothers and uncles, and sometimes their moms, go to war. “Many to never to come back home. There are young boys like Ms. Zelenska's son, a 9-year-old who wants to be a soldier. And there are the children who will never be with their family in Ukraine again. That's where we are today, a merciless authoritarian who needs to flex his power against a nation that just wants to live peacefully. Nothing more than to live in peace with their neighbors. This is a struggle between freedom and democracy and self-determination, on the one hand, and aggression and conquest and tyranny, authoritarianism, on the other. Our choice is clear. “At this critical juncture, let's continue to work with our allies to provide Ukraine with what they need to protect that homeland, to defend that democracy. We need to help Ukraine, and we need to do more, and we need to do it now. We need to move quickly. We need to live up to these important words from Ukraine's first lady last week, when she was here in the Congress talking to us. She said, ‘while Russia kills, America saves.’ Let's continue to save. Let's continue to save lives every day, and let's save our democratic ally, Ukraine, a proud nation that is simply fighting for its survival. Thank you, and I yield the floor.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/members-ohio-delegation-applaud-senate-and-house-committee-approval-kol,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Representatives Shontel Brown (D-OH), Troy Balderson (R-OH), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Dave Joyce (R-OH), Tim Ryan (D-OH), Anthony Gonzalez (R-OH), Joyce Beatty (D-OH), and Mike Carey (R-OH) applauded Committee passage of their bipartisan, bicameral bill to designate the Kol Israel Foundation Holocaust Memorial — located in Bedford Heights, Ohio — as a national memorial. Passing favorably out of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee, the bills now advance to the Senate and House floors, respectively. “We must never forget the horrors of the Holocaust and the enormous suffering endured by the Jewish people. The Kol Israel Holocaust Memorial was erected six decades ago in Northeast Ohio to honor the victims of the Holocaust and to serve as a lasting reminder of the evil that occurred,” said Senator Portman. “I am pleased our bipartisan, bicameral legislation to designate Kol Israel a National Memorial has been voted favorably out of committee and look forward to it coming to the Senate floor for a vote.”“The Kol Israel Memorial Foundation educates Ohioans about the horrors of the Holocaust and preserves the memories of its victims,” said Senator Brown. “When we pass that knowledge on to future generations, we recommit ourselves to ensuring it never happens again, and to fighting for a more just and peaceful world. I am proud that Kol Israel is one step closer to becoming a national memorial.”Erected in 1961 by survivors of the Holocaust residing in Northeast Ohio, the Kol Israel Holocaust Memorial is likely the first and oldest Holocaust memorial in the U.S. For more than 60 years, the Kol Israel Foundation has looked after the memorial, which has the ashes of Jewish victims and other tokens of remembrance buried at its base. To commemorate the day, both the House and Senate bills were introduced on Israel’s Holocaust Remembrance Day in April.“The stories of millions of Holocaust victims and survivors are sadly fading treasures. These accounts ensure that we do not forget the horrors that befell world Jewry before and during World War II and remind us to remain ever vigilant in the face of rising antisemitism today,” said Rep. Brown. “I am pleased that House and Senate Committee panels are quickly moving to advance national designation of the historic Kol Israel Holocaust Memorial in honor of the six million Jews who were murdered by the Nazi regime. We must continue to honor their bravery, heroism, and lasting legacy.”“This legislation is about so much more than elevating the designation for Ohio's own Kol Holocaust Memorial — it’s about elevating the memory of the 6 million people who perished and elevating our commitment to ensuring such atrocities will never be repeated, by educating future generations. I'm pleased to see this effort advance through the legislative process,” said Rep. Balderson.“The Kol Israel Foundation Holocaust Memorial has stood as an enduring testament to the memories of the 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis. Now one step closer to its rightful designation as a national memorial, I look forward to working with the House and Senate to finally see this through,” said Rep. Kaptur.“I’m very pleased by the progress our bill has made in both the House and the Senate,” said Rep. Joyce. “By honoring the memory of the innocent men, women and children murdered during the Holocaust, our bill will ensure the next generation can continue to prevent anti-Semitism from taking root in our society. I urge all of our colleagues to support this important, bipartisan legislation when it is scheduled for a vote so that we can designate the Kol Israel Holocaust Memorial as a National Memorial and follow through on the promise of ‘Never Again.’” “I’m proud to stand in solidarity with our Jewish community by supporting this legislation to designate the Kol Israel Foundation Holocaust Memorial as a national memorial,” said Rep. Ryan. “This designation will support the Foundation’s crucial and enduring work of preserving the memory of the six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust and serve as a solemn reminder of our obligation to speak out and act against hate and injustice. We must pass this important legislation now.”“I applaud swift action by the U.S. House and Senate approving legislation to designate the Kol Israel Foundation Holocaust Memorial as a national memorial in Northeast Ohio,” said Rep. Gonzalez. “For over 60 years this monument has stood as a remembrance to the 6,000,000 Jews murdered during the holocaust, and I am pleased to see bipartisan action to ensure that it continues to for generations to come.”“It is exciting to see our effort to designate the Kol Israel Memorial in Bedford Heights, Ohio, advance so quickly through the House and Senate,” said Rep. Beatty. “As we witness continued violence and unfettered destruction on the global political stage, the need to honor and remember victims of genocide is all the more pressing. National Holocaust education is vital if we hope to live up to the promise of ‘Never Again.’”“It is great to see the momentum grow behind our effort to designate the Kol Israel Foundation Memorial as a national memorial,” said Rep. Carey. “This memorial will not only honor the memory of the Jewish victims of the Holocaust, but educate future generations about the horrors carried out by the Nazi regime. I encourage all of my House colleagues to stand with our Jewish community and support this legislation.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-brown-wenstrup-beatty-applaud-committee-passage-their-legislation,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and U.S. Representatives Brad Wenstrup (R-OH) and Joyce Beatty (D-OH) applauded the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources for advancing their legislation which will begin the process of incorporating the John P. Parker House and museum, an important stop on the Underground Railroad, into the National Park System. The Parker House is located in Ripley, Ohio. This legislation now goes to a vote in the full House and the Senate.“John P. Parker was an inventor, entrepreneur, abolitionist, and a former slave who risked his life to help hundreds of others gain freedom. As an Underground Railroad Conductor, he crossed the Ohio River to bring those seeking freedom out of Kentucky. He is an American hero – one who is worth honoring and whose legacy we should strive to preserve,” said Senator Portman. “I am pleased that my bipartisan legislation to authorize a special resource study of his home in Ripley, Ohio, the next step in making it a unit of the National Park System, has passed favorably out of committee in the House and Senate and hope that Congress will move to pass it quickly.”“John P. Parker was not only a successful businessman, but a champion in the abolitionist movement,” said Senator Brown. “As a former enslaved African American, he risked his life to help others secure their freedom. Adding this home into the National Park System is an appropriate honor for this heroic, selfless, and trailblazing American. John. P. Parker is an example of the best of Ohio and I look forward to this legislation passing in both the House and the Senate.”“John P. Parker played an instrumental role in America’s abolitionist movement, shepherding enslaved people on their journey to freedom along the Underground Railroad,” said Rep. Wenstrup. “I am glad to see this legislation moving in the right direction in both the House and the Senate, and urge my colleagues to pass this legislation to preserve and honor the legacy of John P. Parker.”“Like many other conductors on the Underground Railroad, John P. Parker risked his life by helping guide fugitive slaves from the South to the North,” said Rep. Beatty. “I am excited to see the progress being made on legislation to preserve his legacy. By preserving his station on the Underground Railroad, we can ensure that generations to come will learn his story.”“The Board of the John P. Parker House is excited to have both the House Bill and the Senate Bill moving forward. We are thankful for the work that Senators Portman and Brown and Representatives Wenstrup and Beatty have put into these bills. John P. Parker was an amazing man and an American Hero. We believe that everyone should know about Parker's contributions to American History. We feel that becoming a unit of the National Park Service would let the whole country know about Parker's life and times. The Bills call for a Resource Study as the next step in becoming a unit of the National Park Service,” said Carol Stivers, President of the John P. Parker Historical Society, Inc. DBA The John P. Parker House & Museum in Ripley, Ohio.“We believe the John P. Parker house in Ripley deserves consideration for unit status in the national park system. And we are thankful and elated that legislation introduced by Senators Brown and Portman and Representatives Beatty and Wenstrup authorizing the National Park Service to conduct a study to determine whether the landmark meets criteria for this designation has passed committees in both the House and Senate this week,” said Charles Nuckolls, Trustee of the John P. Parker Historical Society, Inc.John P. Parker was born into slavery in 1827. Initially living in Norfolk, Virginia, Parker was bought and sold multiple times before securing his freedom in 1845. Following his liberation, Parker moved to Cincinnati and ultimately settled in the Village of Ripley, Ohio, located in Brown County. Parker went on to own and operate a successful metal foundry, becoming one of the first African Americans to receive patents for his inventions.In addition to his successful business, Parker became an active member of the Underground Railroad. Historical records attribute Parker with helping secure the freedom of hundreds of enslaved African Americans through the Underground Railroad. Parker worked with abolitionist John Rankin, and together they supported a robust abolitionist movement on the Ohio River. The John P. Parker home is located on North Front Street in Ripley and has operated under the John P. Parker Historical Society since 1996. The legislation would require the National Park Service to conduct a special resource study to help determine the feasibility of the Parker house being added to the National Park System.###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/robs-rundown/robs-rundown-week-july-18-july-22-2022,"Senator Portman was back in Washington this week where he spoke on the Senate floor about the need for Congress to pass the bipartisan CHIPS Act and the broader United States Innovation and Competition Act, or USICA, in order to strengthen semiconductor manufacturing in America. Portman has been an advocate for this legislation since it passed the Senate over a year ago. Since then, Portman has worked across the aisle with Republicans and Democrats alike to get this bill to the president’s desk before the August recess. The CHIPS Act will invest $52 billion in this technology and provide thousands of good-paying jobs to communities across the country. In Ohio, this legislation will help Intel increase their $20 billion investment in New Albany to build two semiconductor foundries to potentially $100 billion and eight total foundries.In addition, Portman urged his colleagues to support his amendment to include his bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act, or SAIA, which passed the Senate last year on a bipartisan basis as a part of the CHIPS Plus package. Portman’s legislation will ensure the federal government is taking decisive action to safeguard the $250 billion American taxpayer-funded investment in innovation in the CHIPS Act package currently under consideration.Portman also spoke on the Senate floor for the 18th consecutive session week regarding the situation in Ukraine. He urged the Biden administration to send Ukraine more High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) so they can effectively target Russian forces and noted the success they are having currently with just a handful. Senator Portman called for the Senate to approve Finland and Sweden’s NATO application before the August district work period begins. Senator Portman also discussed one of the war’s youngest casualties, Liza Dmytrieva, a four-year-old girl who was on her way to a speech therapist when murdered by Russian bombardments. As a consistent and strong voice for the people of Ukraine, Portman has highlighted the need for critical aid that goes to not only their soldiers but humanitarian aid for noncombatants, such as women and children like Liza. As the effects of Russia’s aggression reach beyond the borders of Ukraine, Senator Portman continues to lead his Senate colleagues in pushing the administration to provide more support for the Ukrainian people, their government, and President Zelenskyy.On Monday, Portman expressed alarm after U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) released operational statistics showing that with three months left in the fiscal year, 2022 has already broken the record for the highest number of border encounters, making it clear that this administration’s border crisis will soon be a catastrophe. On Tuesday, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Portman voted to advance the ratification of Finland and Sweden’s NATO applications.On Wednesday, Portman joined a bipartisan group of senators to introduce two bipartisan proposals which include legislation to reform and modernize the outdated Electoral Count Act of 1887 to ensure that the electoral votes tallied by Congress accurately reflect each state’s vote for President.  At a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on Thursday, Portman pressed David Pekoske, the nominee to serve as the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), on the measures he is taking to ensure the safety of air travel in the United States after he admitted that TSA knowingly allows individuals on the terrorist watch list to fly commercially.  This week, Senator Portman cosponsored the bipartisan Respect for Marriage Act (S. 4556), a measure to strengthen same-sex and interracial marriage. Finally, Senator Portman introduced a resolution recognizing Russia’s actions in Ukraine, which include forced deportations to Russia and the purposeful killing of Ukrainian civilians in mass atrocities, as constituting a genocide against the people of Ukraine. For a more detailed look at Senator Portman’s week, please see the following:Monday, July 18, 2022In Greater Cincinnati, Portman Meets with Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport Officials  Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman met with officials from the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport to discuss how the airport and the region will benefit from the funding in Portman’s bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). The bipartisan infrastructure law, which was signed into law last November, provides $25 billion in new spending for airports. Ohio’s airports have received more than $163 million for airport improvement projects within the COVID airport improvement program, and this new funding builds on that momentum to further improve Ohio’s terminals and runways. During the visit, Senator Portman also was given a tour of the airport, where he saw the West Apron Reconstruction which will support additional growth and development, as well as some of the refresh projects, including apron and taxi lane improvements around Concourse B. “I had a very constructive visit and tour with leaders from the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport about how the airport is using funding from the new infrastructure law to upgrade its facilities and improve the experience for customers,” said Senator Portman. “The bipartisan infrastructure law, which I helped spearhead last year, has historic new funding for airports to improve their capacity and functionality and I’m excited about the opportunities for growth and expansion here in Cincinnati. I encourage airports across Ohio to take advantage of this great opportunity.”In December, Senator Portman announced that nearly 100 airports across the state of Ohio will receive nearly $319 million in federal funding over the next five years thanks to the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Regional Airport will receive $65 million over the next five years in formula funding. These dedicated funds, on top of the new competitive Airport Terminal Improvement program and the FAA NextGen program funding, will allow Ohio’s airports to compete for overdue upgrades and allow them to continue recovery from the economic impact of COVID-19, and continue their position as catalysts for economic growth.In February, Senator Portman announced that the Federal Aviation Administration opened up applications for airports in Ohio and around the United States for their Airport Terminal Program. This grant program, which will provide a total of $5 billion in funding over five years, provides funding for terminal, on-airport rail access, and airport-owned airport traffic control tower projects. As of earlier this month, two airports in Ohio have already received grants through the program.Tuesday, July 19, 2022Portman, Bennet, King, Manchin Applaud FCC’s Proposed Broadband StandardThe New Proposed 100 Mbps Definition of Broadband Comes After a Letter From the Senators to FCC Chair RosenworcelU.S. Senators Rob Portman, Michael Bennet (D-CO), Angus King (I-ME), and Joe Manchin (D-WV) today applauded the FCC’s proposal to redefine broadband connections as 100 megabits (Mbps) per second download or faster, enabling American families to access connections that meet the needs of modern internet users. The senators had previously called on the FCC and the Biden administration to make this change, replacing the current outdated 25 megabits per second download speed definition. “As rural communities across the country begin to see the massive impacts of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s historic investment in affordable broadband technology, we must make sure everyone has the high-speed connections needed to fully engage in 21st century life,” said the senators. “To avoid lagging behind in our increasingly connected world, rural residents need the ability to work remotely, video conference with their loved ones, and access vital services like distance learning or telehealth. The current federal broadband standard of 25 megabits per second download speed has proven to be insufficient for these needs, and must be significantly updated to ensure reliable service. We’re glad Chair Rosenworcel has heard our calls to modernize this definition, and urge the FCC to finalize their decision on the standard as soon as possible.”In March of last year, the senators wrote a letter urging the 100 Mbps standard to then-Acting Chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Jessica Rosenworcel, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, and Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese. In their letter, the senators highlighted the modern demands of the internet and how the current definition does not come close to meeting them.Portman, Colleagues Ask Defense Department to Expedite Critical Military Aid to Ukraine U.S. Senators Rob Portman, Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) sent a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley, asking them to immediately expedite shipments of military equipment to Ukraine as appropriated by Congress under the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act. Passed on May 19, the act provided nearly $20 billion for military aid to the Ukrainian military. Equipment recommended for immediate delivery includes medium- and long-range air defense systems, 155 mm howitzers, High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), armored personnel carriers, larger and more capable unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), and Mi-17 helicopters.  The senators also urged the defense leaders to consider recommending the inclusion of fourth-generation fighter aircraft, along with funding for the necessary flight training, in future military aid packages.“While the medium- and long-range air defense capabilities and HIMARS included in the June 27, 2022, and July 8, 2022 aid packages are a good start, these systems must be delivered at a pace and in quantity sufficient to impact the outcome of the fighting in the Donbas, Kherson and other regions,” the senators wrote. “We urge you to act expeditiously, while coordinating with NATO allies and partners, to get this equipment to the Ukrainian military immediately,” said the senators. The full letter can be viewed here.On Senate Floor, Portman Calls for Swift Passage of Bipartisan Competitiveness LegislationThis afternoon, U.S. Senator Rob Portman, spoke on the Senate floor to discuss the need for the United States to stay competitive in the global economy. Portman highlighted the bipartisan CHIPS Act and the broader United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021, or USICA, which will shore up semiconductor manufacturing in America. Senator Portman has been an advocate for this legislation since it passed the Senate over a year ago. Since then, Portman has worked across the aisle with Republicans and Democrats alike to get this bill to the president’s desk before the August recess. Semiconductor chips are essential to everything from automobiles, cell phones, household appliances, and military weaponry. The CHIPS Act will invest $52 billion in this technology and provide thousands of good-paying jobs to communities across the country. In Ohio, this legislation will help Intel increase their $20 billion investment in New Albany to build two semiconductor foundries to potentially $100 billion and eight total foundries. Portman also discussed his bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act, which passed the Senate last year on a bipartisan basis as a part of the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act. Portman and Senator Tom Carper (D-DE), as Chairman and Ranking Member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), led a year-long investigation that revealed how American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China’s military and economy over the last two decades while federal agencies have done little to stop it. Starting in the late 1990s through its “talent recruitment programs,” China began recruiting U.S.-based scientists and researchers to transfer U.S. taxpayer-funded IP for China’s military and economic gain. This legislation will ensure the federal government is taking decisive action to safeguard American innovation and Portman insisted that the legislation be included in the competitiveness bill that will come before the Senate. A video can be found here. Wednesday, July 20, 2022On Senate Floor, Portman Calls for the Senate to Act Quickly on Finland & Sweden’s NATO Applications,Highlights Need for More Weaponry to Ukraine & Global Food Shortages Caused by Russian Aggression Last night, U.S. Senator Rob Portman delivered remarks on the Senate floor in support of Ukraine for the 18th consecutive week while the Senate has been in session. Portman called for the Senate to approve Finland and Sweden’s NATO application before the August district work period begins, urged the administration to send more High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems or HIMARS to Ukraine to target Russian artillery from long distances and noted the humanitarian effects of Russia’s war. Senator Portman talked about one of the war’s youngest casualties, Liza Dmytrieva, a four-year-old girl who was on her way to a speech therapist when murdered by Russian bombardments. As a consistent and strong voice for the people of Ukraine, Portman has highlighted the need for critical aid that goes to not only their soldiers, but humanitarian aid for noncombatants, such as women and children like Liza. As the effects of Russia’s aggression reach beyond the borders of Ukraine, Senator Portman continues to lead his Senate colleagues in pushing the administration for more support to the Ukrainian people, their government, and President Zelenskyy.

The senators introduced the resolution shortly after Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska, delivered an impassioned plea directly to Congress.“Since the beginning of Russia’s brutal assault on Ukraine, Russian forces have demonstrated a clear pattern of targeting and killing Ukrainian civilians en masse, while also deliberately shelling schools, maternity wards, hospitals, homes, apartment buildings, and other civilian infrastructure. They are also committing heinous acts of sexual violence and forcibly deporting hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia,” said Portman. “Combined with Russia’s consistent denial of the existence of Ukrainian nationhood and identity, these acts must be acknowledged for what they are – genocide – and it is important that the United States and the rest of the world recognize them as such.”“There is no question that what Russia is doing in Ukraine is a genocide,” said Risch. “If you could walk the streets of Kyiv, Irpin, and Hostomel like I did last month, and listen to the stories of what the Russian soldiers have done, this is a genocide. The international community is documenting the many Russian abuses that constitute war crimes across Ukraine. It’s time the United States and the world recognize it as such.”“For five months, the world has seen the brutal, unjustified, and utterly senseless war Russia’s dictator has unleashed on Ukraine,” said Cardin. “Russia is trying to eviscerate not just the people and the buildings of Ukraine, but also they are trying to eliminate the Ukrainian language, Ukrainian history and Ukrainian culture. This is genocide. The world must recognize this fact and those responsible must be held accountable.”“Russia’s war on Ukraine and its wider aggression in the region are illegal and genocidal, and it is important that the U.S. declare that fact to the world,” said Wicker. “Ukraine must be successful in this war. Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked aggression against a neighbor cannot stand.” “This resolution rightly condemns Putin’s systematic torture and murder of Ukrainian people as a genocide,” said Blumenthal. “During my trip to Kyiv and Bucha, I saw the fields where hundreds of Ukrainian women and children were massacred, their hands tied behind their backs, simply because they were Ukrainian. These inhumane practices are genocide, ongoing in real-time. As Russian atrocities continue, the United States must stand up to these crimes against humanity and designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. The rule of law must prevail.”“Vladimir Putin is waging a campaign of violence and terror in Ukraine that specifically targets civilians and seeks to wipe out the Ukrainian culture and its people. The United States needs to call it what it is and the global community must respond accordingly. These are acts of genocide and must be stopped now,” said Shaheen. “Our resolution sends a powerful message from the U.S. Senate that we will not take our eyes off of Ukraine and we will keep working together to help our democratic partners defend their rights and to see Putin punished for his atrocities.”“I appreciate Senator Risch and Senator Cardin leading this resolution that speaks to the truth of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” said Graham. “This resolution designates Putin’s actions in Ukraine as genocide – there is no other conclusion to reach. It is time for Congress not only to speak but to act, and it is long past due for the Biden Administration to designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism.”This resolution:Text of the resolution can be found here.###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-floor-portman-calls-senate-act-quickly-finland-swedens-nato,"WASHINGTON, DC – Last night, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) delivered remarks on the Senate floor in support of Ukraine for the 18th consecutive week while the Senate has been in session. Portman called for the Senate to approve Finland and Sweden’s NATO application before the August district work period begins, urged the administration to send more High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems or HIMARS to Ukraine to target Russian artillery from long distances, and noted the humanitarian effects of Russia’s war. Senator Portman talked about one of the war’s youngest casualties, Liza Dmytrieva, a four-year-old girl who was on her way to a speech therapist when murdered by Russian bombardments. As a consistent and strong voice for the people of Ukraine, Portman has highlighted the need for critical aid that goes to not only their soldiers, but humanitarian aid for noncombatants, such as women and children like Liza. As the effects of Russia’s aggression reach beyond the borders of Ukraine, Senator Portman continues to lead his Senate colleagues in pushing the administration for more support to the Ukrainian people, their government, and President Zelenskyy. A transcript of his remarks can be found below and a video can be found here. “Madam Chair, I come to the floor today to once again talk about Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine. Before I do though, I want to pause for a minute and honor the lives lost in the downing of Malaysian airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine, knocked down by Russian and Russian-backed separatists. This week marks the eighth anniversary of that tragedy, all 238 passengers and 15 crew were killed. This eighth anniversary is a reminder that Russia's war of aggression on Ukraine didn't just start this spring. “Eight years ago, the people of Ukraine made a courageous choice. They said that they were going to stand up to a corrupt Russian-backed regime, and when they did that Russia responded by invading their country, taking Ukraine's Crimea peninsula, but also territory here in what's called the Donbas. So this is not new. For almost nine years the people of Ukraine have been fighting this war with Russia. More recently, of course, the invasion was even more devastating. So I join Bridget Brink, who is our new U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, who said, ‘we honor the memories of those killed eight years ago, even as missiles continue to fall on Mykolaiv, Dnipro, and other Ukrainian cities killing civilians and demonstrating the Kremlin’s disregard for international law and human life.’ She's right. “Ambassador Brink said it right. The civilian toll in this war is devastating. Ukraine's prosecutor general recently said that since late February of this year, 353 children have died in this war, and more than 1,000 have been wounded. The Associated Press painted a vivid picture of this with a story of the killing of the 4-year-old girl named Liza. Liza Dmitrieva. Liza had Down syndrome, and was on her way to see a speech therapist last Thursday when her mother and she were attacked by Russian missiles. She was in a town called Vinnytsia. At least 24 people were killed that day, including Liza, and two boys, who were seven and eight years old, almost 200 were wounded. Liza's mother is still in intensive care. It's important to know that when the war started, Liza's family fled Kyiv, but stayed in Ukraine, fleeing to this town, Vinnytsia, about 167 miles southwest of Kyiv. “They thought they could be safe there. It's well behind enemy lines. It's well behind the front lines of the battle. And yet, this is the reality of President Putin's war on Ukraine. It is targeting civilians. But it won't just stop in Ukraine. This is why Finland and Sweden, in a move that just a few years ago would have seemed impossible, left a history of neutrality behind and joined NATO. Their application is currently in place. They see Putin's brutal war and they know that they could be next. Last week, I mentioned on the floor that as recently as 2016, President Putin said, ‘the borders of Russia never end.’ It bears repeating because he and other Kremlin leaders seem intent on restoring the Russian empire, even if it means rolling over other free and independent countries. “The Senate Foreign Relations Committee took a momentous step today by voting to ratify the NATO applications for these two allies of the United States, Sweden and Finland. I was proud to vote to ratify and speak in Committee about why this expansion is so good for our national security, to have these two countries with strong militaries and strong economies, join our NATO alliance. I hope that the leadership of the Senate will put this legislation on the floor as soon as possible so that we can show the world we are enthusiastically supporting the joining of these two countries to the NATO alliance. We need to continue to demonstrate global solidarity in this war. “President Putin, of course, had hoped to divide NATO, and divide Europe and divide the West, but he underestimated what would happen. He underestimated the foresight and wisdom of the people of Sweden and Finland, just as he underestimated the courage and resiliency of the people of Ukraine. On the energy front, a significant development that isn't getting nearly enough attention happened last week. Back in June, Russia cut gas to Europe via Nord Stream 1 pipeline by 60 percent because of, ‘maintenance problems.’ They claimed they needed gas turbines that had gone to Canada to be repaired, to be able to continue the flow of the pipeline. “Those turbines were prohibited from being returned to Russia because of the sanctions that are in place with regard to Russian energy infrastructure. Of course, what President Putin's government claims to be true is often not. The reality is Russia was punishing Europe and trying to poke holes in the western sanctions regime. Unfortunately, the Russians succeeded. What happened next was discouraging. Canada gave in to Russia's demands last week and returned the gas turbines. And then the State Department applauded this move, saying that somehow it was standing up to Russia's energy blackmail. I understand the administration's desire to preserve allied unity in the face of Russian aggression, that's important, especially in our effort to stand up against Russia over the long-term. But if we're unified behind a bad policy, then that unity doesn't do us much good. “We saw this with Nord Stream 2, remember? When the Biden administration sided with Germany to remove sanctions on the pipeline, even though that decision undermined the security of our allies, including Ukraine, and I think it sent the wrong message to Russia and is one reason they felt empowered to invade Ukraine more recently. Now we're seeing the same thing here. In the name of preserving unity with certain allies, we're giving in to Russia's demands. As I said, unity with our allies is important, I get that. But instead of settling for weak policy, we should be pushing our allies to adopt stronger policies against Russia, including with regard to energy. Unfortunately, Russia knows that by manufacturing a ‘maintenance problem’ with their pipelines, our allies tend to back down on our sanctions. I wonder when will the next maintenance problem appear. “President Zelenskyy has called the return of these gas turbines to Russia, ‘absolutely unacceptable.’ But the Biden administration characterized it as a counter to Russia's attempt to weaponize energy. This just isn't the case. ""It's worth noting that another crisis is looming as a result of this war and is the direct result of Russia's blockade of Ukraine's ports, especially the port at Odessa. Here's the Odessa port. There are other ports along this area into the Black Sea that are absolutely essential for Ukraine's exports and yet, Russia is blocking them. Here I cannot overstate the importance of this issue as Ukraine supplies so much of the world's food and without ports to export, that food is not making it to the people who need it badly. It is causing food shortages around the world. “Let me be clear: food should never be used as a weapon of war but that's exactly what President Putin is doing. The effects are far-reaching. According to the World Food Program, increases in the cost of food and fuel since March have caused 47 million people to experience food insecurity. Of those, some 50 million are living close to famine. That number grows every single day. To be specific, according to The Wall Street Journal, ‘in Somalia, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Yemen and Afghanistan, nearly 900,000 people already face starvation and death. “That is more than tenfold the increase from 2019. And by some estimates could result in more people dying from hunger in 2022 and 2023 than in any year since the 1960's and China’s disastrous Great Leap Forward agricultural policies.’ Wow. The World Food Program provides aid for these countries, but there are shortages because of Russia's war of choice, and the cost of that aid has risen tremendously. They report that their costs have jumped 46 percent, compared with 2019. That's about 50 percent over the last few years and any organization, let alone one that provides humanitarian aid, would have immense problems keeping up. Their increases in everyday items like vegetable oils and special nutritional paste given to children who are in famine or malnourished. While these problems persist, it's the most vulnerable among us that truly feel the cost of malnourishment. “It’s the kids and children who are most at risk from the effects of hunger. Their bodies from a lack of nutrients from food are too weak to fight off diseases such as measles or cholera. Even those who survive these terrible illnesses will often face long-term health problems that could impact them forever. So, we're not only facing a brutal invasion of Ukraine. We've talked about that. War crimes are being committed there every day. But there's also a humanitarian crisis that is taking its toll around the world as we speak as a result of this war on Ukraine and the blockade of these ports. This is a battle on some many fronts and we have to face the realities head-on. In a war thought to be over within weeks, the fighting continued well beyond that, and may continue for much longer. 
“It has already gone on longer than most people expected and while the Ukrainians continue to show their fortitude and strength, the world feels the effects of this through the global fallout. Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska will speak to Congress tomorrow about the damaging effects of this war, just as her husband, President Zelenskyy, addressed these chambers in March. I look forward to hearing what she has to say. She's been a passionate advocate for the rights of innocent Ukrainian citizens who have been killed and wounded by these Russian attacks. She even started her own initiative to address the mental health impacts of Russia's terrible war and the trauma that the people of Ukraine have experienced. That's the kind of leadership Ukraine needs frankly. It is the kind of leadership the world needs. She and her husband should be commended for their bravery in the face of tyranny and their steadfastness through the destruction that Vladimir Putin has caused her beloved homeland. In Ukraine the stakes remain high. The casualties, both civilian and professional solider alike, go into the thousands. Thousands. The damage to Ukraine's infrastructure, their beautiful cities, ports, schools, hospitals, day cares, and apartment buildings go into the billions. “This is a photograph of an apartment building that was recently bombed in the eastern part of Ukraine, killing, of course, innocent civilians. According to the Kyiv School of Economics, Ukraine will need at least $165 billion for post-war reconstruction. Per their latest update, almost half of those losses is attributable to housing losses like this one. Civilian targets of Russia's unrelenting bombing campaign, neighborhoods, residential areas, homes, apartments have been hit by these Russian air strikes. These are acts of terror. I'm a sponsor of Senator Graham's resolution to urge the Biden administration to name Russia a state sponsor of terror. I urge leadership to bring this to a vote. We voted it out of committee already. It's on the floor. Let's take it up. “So what happens next? We know that making any territorial concessions to Russia would only embolden President Putin and other future would-be conquerors. The lesson they would learn is that with enough patience they can wear down the West and get what they want. We must not let that happen and the people of Ukraine and the brave president certainly know this. We must do more quickly to arm Ukraine and help them to be able to protect themselves and to be able to win this war. It is clear that President Putin underestimated the courage, the effectiveness, and the resiliency of the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian military. And now President Putin knows what the Ukrainians are capable of. By the way, the Russian forces also understand this. On Monday, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told Russian troops to hit Ukraine's High-Mobility Rocket Systems or HIMARS. He asked them to do so because of the success the Ukrainians have had with just eight of these HIMARS units. “These are systems from the United States. Many of us have pushed very hard to get these to Ukraine. They went too late. Many lives were lost and cities were flattened because they did not have them early on. These rocket systems are absolutely essential because before that, the Russians could sit back and indiscriminately bomb Ukrainian cities and Ukrainian soldiers and civilians and the Ukrainian artillery could not reach them. These HIMAR systems have a longer range and are more accurate and they’ve been quite effective. Only eight systems are there now. Also three from the U.K., a few from Germany. They need a lot more. But just this week, because of these systems, Ukrainian forces killed a Russian commander after HIMARS hit a Russian control and command center here in the south of Ukraine. “Last week HIMARS took out a Russian ammunition warehouse in this same region. They have now taken out a couple dozen of these ammo depots, especially here in the south and in the east. That’s incredibly important because by reducing the Russian ammunition stores, it will be much more likely that the Russians will realize that this war is damaging them, their equipment, their soldiers and be more willing to come to the bargaining table. If this is what the Ukrainians can do with just eight HIMARS, imagine what they can do with what they've been asking for and it what they really need, which is around 40 or 50 of these units. These weapons are crucial to the brave Ukrainian fighters as Ukraine continues its effort to defend itself from these Russian air strikes and missile strikes. “Finally, Ukrainian forces have missiles with adequate range to reach these Russian missiles, to reach these ammo depots, to reach these command posts. Russia will still have the advantage, of course, of more missiles, more men, more rockets, and their attacks are relentless. President Zelenskyy highlighted this when he said on Monday that Russia has fired thousands of cruise missiles and rockets during this war. Thousands. These often come in the middle of the night and hit residential areas and city infrastructure in places like Nikopol, a city that’s located here right near Kherson. Rockets have also hit apartment complexes as we saw, and shopping malls. Here is a shopping mall that Russians attacked a few weeks ago. This is a shopping mall much as you would see in the United States of America. It was full of people who were out shopping on a summer day, maybe buying clothes, maybe buying some food. Over 20 shoppers were killed at this shopping center and over 56 people were wounded. “This shopping center, by the way, was in the central part of Ukraine. If you look at the map, this is not anywhere near the war zone. More up in this area, in the middle part of Ukraine. So bombings of shopping centers, apartments, schools, hospitals. It's really hard to imagine, but it's happening. We can help Ukraine fight back. Again, the best way is to provide them with more weapons, like the HIMARS that they need. We have hundreds in our stocks, by the way. It is more critical than ever that the United States and allies support Ukraine to try to turn the tide. Only that will get Russia to the bargaining table. Meanwhile, we must continue to expose the brutality. Much of the media attention has gone away while lives continue to be lost and cities continue to be bombarded. We need to keep letting people know about these atrocities. “That's why I'm here on the floor of the Senate for the 18th consecutive week to talk about what's happening to the people of Ukraine, what's happening in the past week, and why they deserve and need our help. Ukrainians are fighting because they know what it's like to live under the thumb of authoritarianism. They've been subject to that through their history. And more recently they broke away from that and towards democracy in 1991, and again in 2014. It is important to note that Ukraine is not asking us to fight this war for them. They just want us to help them, along with our allies, to be able to have the tools they need to protect themselves. They're asking us for increased lethal military assistance to help defend themselves. And they are asking all of us to abide by the commitments that we have made. “In 1994, after the Berlin wall came down, Ukraine signed what's called the Budapest Memorandum. It was a treaty where Ukraine agreed to give up all of its nuclear weapons, and they had a lot of them, in exchange for security guarantees from Russia, the United States of America, and the United Kingdom. Guarantees that we would all respect the independence and sovereignty of Ukraine and refrain from the threat or use of force against Ukraine. That was in 1994. So much for Russia's commitment. I've seen the spirit and perseverance of Ukrainians firsthand when I have visited the country. I have been there seven, eight, nine times. I was there right after the Revolution of Dignity, as it’s called, in 2014, where Ukrainians decided to turn away from a Russian-backed and corrupt government and stand with us and Europe to pursue a hopeful future of freedom and democracy. “Now it's time for us and our allies to stand with them. The world must know that freedom-loving countries around the globe have Ukraine's back and we will be there until the bitter end. President Putin must know that we will not back down, as he orders the ruthless slaughter of more innocents. At the beginning of my speech, I talked about this 4-year-old girl. Liza's death occurred because of these rocket attacks. At her funeral, Orthodox priest Vitalii Holoskevych said this, ‘we know that evil cannot win.’ We know that evil cannot win. And maybe that's the bottom line here today. This is a struggle between freedom and democracy and the right of self-determination on the one hand and evil on the other hand. Evil of conquest, the evil of authoritarianism, the evil of tyranny. Now is not the time to be tentative or equivocal. At this critical juncture, we need to work with our allies to provide Ukraine what they need to defeat evil. To protect their homeland and to defend democracy. “Thank you, and I yield the floor.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-floor-portman-calls-swift-passage-bipartisan-competitiveness,"WASHINGTON, DC – This afternoon, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH), spoke on the Senate floor to discuss the need for the United States to stay competitive in the global economy. Portman highlighted the bipartisan CHIPS Act and the broader United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021, or USICA, which will shore up semiconductor manufacturing in America. Senator Portman has been an advocate for this legislation since it passed the Senate over a year ago. Since then, Portman has worked across the aisle with Republicans and Democrats alike to get this bill to the president’s desk before the August recess. Semiconductor chips are essential to everything from automobiles, cell phones, household appliances, and military weaponry. The CHIPS Act will invest $52 billion in this technology and provide thousands of good-paying jobs to communities across the country. In Ohio, this legislation will help Intel increase their $20 billion investment in New Albany to build two semiconductor foundries to potentially $100 billion and eight total foundries. Portman also discussed his bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act, which passed the Senate last year on a bipartisan basis as a part of the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act. Portman and Senator Tom Carper (D-DE), as Chairman and Ranking Member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), led a year-long investigation that revealed how American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China’s military and economy over the last two decades while federal agencies have done little to stop it. Starting in the late 1990s through its “talent recruitment programs,” China began recruiting U.S.-based scientists and researchers to transfer U.S. taxpayer-funded IP for China’s military and economic gain. This legislation will ensure the federal government is taking decisive action to safeguard American innovation and Portman insisted that the legislation be included in the competitiveness bill that will come before the Senate. A transcript of his remarks can be found below and a video can be found here. “Madam President, I come to the floor of the Senate today because we're poised to begin consideration of a really important piece of legislation. It's a plan to make America more competitive with China and a plan to bring good jobs back to America. I’m talking about the bipartisan CHIPS Act, which includes reshoring semiconductor manufacturing to America and giving American workers and American companies the tools they need to compete and win. Let me give some background on why this is so badly needed. U.S. dominance in what’s called ‘semiconductor manufacturing’ has dwindled for decades and it’s an economic and a national security concern. The U.S. has always led the world in chip design. We came up with this technology, but our share of the global chip manufacturing capacity over the past 30 years has gone from about 37 percent down to less than 12 percent today. As a result, we rely more and more on foreign countries for these essential chips. In the past few years the supply chain has not been reliable. You know that if you tried to buy a car recently, maybe even a washing machine, that you had to wait forever. Why? Because of the lack of semiconductors. These chips, they just are not available. “We’ve all come to learn in recent years that semiconductors are the building blocks of everything — automobiles, cell phones, computers, household appliances, medical equipment, but also military systems and weaponry, like the F-35. And in a more digital economy by the way, that demand for these semiconductors, these chips, will only continue to grow. Last year this lack of semiconductors caused an estimated loss of $240 billion to the U.S. Gross Domestic Product. So, $250 billion hit to our economy, according to the Department of Commerce last year, just because of these supply chain issues with semiconductors. This is more complicated by the key role that our adversaries play in the production of these semiconductors and the fact that we rely on some very vulnerable nations for critical components of the supply chain. Neon gas, which is critical for the laser and printing of the chips, comes largely from Ukraine. Taiwan is the number one semiconductor fabricator in the world. By the way, 90 percent of the high-end chips are made in Taiwan. None are made here in America anymore. Ninety percent. Of course, Taiwan's proximity to China and the constant threat of invasion by China adds to the urgency of diversifying the semiconductor supply chain. By incentivizing companies to make these critical components here in America, we can make our supply chains more resilient, we can protect our national security, and we can boost economies all across the country. “That's why CHIPS is so important and why we've been working in a bipartisan fashion in Congress through legislation like this and the broader USICA legislation. This legislation would work to improve our nation's competitiveness, generally, in technology, foreign relations and national security, domestic manufacturing, education, trade, and other matters. The CHIPS Act specifically would bring $52 billion in federal investments for domestic semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing. The broader bill, so-called USICA bill, last June passed this Senate with an overwhelming bipartisan vote. We had hoped that the House would simply pass the Senate-approved bill because it was already bipartisan. It had been worked out with Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. Nineteen Republicans supported it. All 50 Democrat senators supported it. The White House supported it. But instead, the House sat on it. Took them almost a year to pass their bill, but when they passed it, it was filled with all sorts of unrelated items that no Republican could support. That's why this has gone so slowly. So earlier this summer we began conferencing, the House and Senate-passed bills, trying to find that common ground between the two bills. We made some progress, but both chambers have yet to agree on a final product. “Meanwhile, there's an urgency to get this done because it's critical to the decisions that employers are making right now to create and bring semiconductor manufacturing, factories, and jobs to America or to some other country. In January, Intel announced its plan to build a $20 billion site consisting of two semiconductor fabs in the United States and in my home state of Ohio. This is the largest investment in Ohio's history, by far. It comes with, again, a grand total of again $20 billion, two fabs. We hope that's just a start. Intel has said time and time again that if the CHIPS Act funding is enacted this will move forward and move forward quickly. They've also said that if it moves forward, the CHIPS Act, it could be extended – the $20 billion –up to a $100 billion investment in Ohio. Remember, the $20 billion is already historic. That's because they would continue to build fabs, not just two, but up to 10. This 3,000-acre site in Ohio could be home to up to eight additional fabs and make central Ohio the silicon heartland. This would be great for my state, great for our region, and great for our country. This initial investment, by the way, would create about 10,000 good-paying jobs, 3,000 on site, eventually all good paying, high-paying jobs, good benefits, but also 7,000 good paying construction jobs in putting it together. Tens of thousands of additional electrical, engineering, supplier, restaurant, housing, health care, and entertainment jobs to support the region as it expands thanks to this investment. The suppliers alone will be tens of thousands of new jobs. “Ohio has already projected that this investment will add $2.8 billion to the state's GDP and that's just a start. Investments like what's in front of us in Ohio, by the way, as well as similar efforts in Arizona, where the presiding officer is from, Texas where my colleague Senator Cornyn is from here on the floor with us today, are all perfect demonstrations of what this investment in semiconductor incentives can mean to American workers and American companies. China has committed a lot more than we're talking about. As have, by the way, a lot of other countries. This is not a free-market situation. One of my colleagues today asked me today about, ‘shouldn't we let the market decide?’ If the market decides and China is offering $150 billion, which they are over the next 10 years, when Europe has its own equivalent legislation to ours and is offering tens of billions of dollars, tens of billions of euros or when South Korea or Japan or when Taiwan are offering the huge incentives, it's very difficult to see us being able to bring these chips back to America where costs are a little higher and be able to be competitive. We need that to happen for our domestic economy, but also our national security. If we fail to act, we're going to miss a key opportunity here to boost our competitive edge as a nation because these fabs will go elsewhere. I'd also like to see us include some of the other key pieces of the broader Senate-passed USICA bill that was passed on a bipartisan basis. Again, 19 of us supported that here on the Republican side. That includes critical new investments in research, but also key protections to be sure that that research is not stolen by foreign governments, such as China. “We've got to remember the overall goal of this effort is to improve our country's competitiveness, especially with regard to China. To do that we must not only invest in research and innovation, which I strongly support, but we must protect that taxpayer-funded research and intellectual property from being taken by competitors like China and used against us. I believe given current realities, without such protections, any bill with significant increased levels of federal funding for research would be a huge giveaway to Beijing. Why do I say that? Because I've worked on this issue for the past four years. We've investigated it. We’ve held hearings. We've passed legislation. Recently FBI Director Wray said it well, the biggest threat we face, he said, as a country from a counterintelligence perspective, is from the People's Republic of China, particularly the Chinese Communist Party. ‘They are targeting our innovation, our trade secrets, our intellectual property on a scale that is unprecedented in history.’ That's the Director of the FBI. Senator Carper on the other side of the aisle and I introduced what's called the Safeguarding American Innovation Act and insisted that it be included in the USICA legislation in order for us to support it. That was my condition for supporting the broader USICA bill. This came after we did a year-long study with the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that found, shockingly, how China had used what are called talent programs for two decades, two decades, to target the most promising taxpayer-paid research and researchers and to take that technology, that intellectual property, back to China. “We found that the American taxpayers had been unwittingly funding the rise of China's military and economy over the past two decades while the federal government had done very little to nothing to stop it. In fact, when the FBI testified at our hearing, they acknowledged that. They said we haven't been focused on this the past couple of decades like we should have been. We're going to now and they started to. They've starting to make arrests and you probably heard about some of these, arresting scientists all over the country who are abusing our lax attitude toward protecting research by taking research back to China and using it, often, against us. This legislation goes directly to the root of the problem. It makes it punishable by law to knowingly fail to disclose foreign funding on federal grant applications. That is not a law now. The FBI has asked us for that law. It requires the Executive Branch to streamline and coordinate grant making between the federal agencies so there's continuity, accountability, and coordination. That does not happen now. It's too wide open. It's not coordinated. It allows the State Department to deny visas so foreign researchers who are coming to the United States to exploit the openness of our research enterprise. And it requires research institutions and universities to do much more, including telling the State Department whether foreign researchers will have access to export controlled technologies. “We've worked on this legislation, again, for the past few years. We have made lots of compromises and concessions with people who had potential concerns about it. We have come up with legislation that is bipartisan, makes sense. It's already passed, again, with an overwhelming margin here in the United States Senate. I want to be sure that before we spend billions of dollars more in federal research, which is being proposed, including to the National Science Foundation, that that research can be protected. Who could be against that? Who could be for China being able to have better access to this information? Nobody. Again, a vital component of any competitiveness bill is this commonsense extensively negotiated bipartisan bill, which is already concluded in the homeland security title of USICA. I can't stress enough the importance of passing this legislation and it should be done on a bipartisan basis because it has been done before. It just makes sense. The broader USICA bill and the CHIPS bill are both important. And to pass the CHIPS legislation is critical right now. It is urgent. And then what we can pass in terms of USICA is also important, but again, if we're putting more money into research which is being proposed and which I support, it has to be protected. That's pretty simple and common sense. There's no perfect bill, but this bill will help keep America's economy competitive, help keep American jobs here, and grow new, good-paying jobs with good benefits. We should pass this legislation, get it through the House, and take it to the president's desk for signature. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting its passage. Thank you and I yield the floor.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-colleagues-ask-defense-department-expedite-critical-military-aid,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) sent a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley, asking them to immediately expedite shipments of military equipment to Ukraine as appropriated by Congress under the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act. Passed on May 19, the act provided nearly $20 billion for military aid to the Ukrainian military. Equipment recommended for immediate delivery includes medium- and long-range air defense systems, 155 mm howitzers, High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), armored personnel carriers, larger and more capable unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), and Mi-17 helicopters.  The senators also urged the defense leaders to consider recommending the inclusion of fourth-generation fighter aircraft, along with funding for the necessary flight training, in future military aid packages.“While the medium- and long-range air defense capabilities and HIMARS included in the June 27, 2022, and July 8, 2022 aid packages are a good start, these systems must be delivered at a pace and in quantity sufficient to impact the outcome of the fighting in the Donbas, Kherson and other regions,” the senators wrote. “We urge you to act expeditiously, while coordinating with NATO allies and partners, to get this equipment to the Ukrainian military immediately,” said the senators.The full letter can be read below and viewed here.Dear Secretary Austin and General Milley:On May 19, 2022, Congress passed the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided nearly $20 billion for military aid to the Ukrainian military. In the intervening weeks, President Biden has approved five drawdowns and sent $3.3 billion worth of military aid to Ukraine, including the $400 million package approved on July 8, 2022. On June 23, 2022, we met with a delegation of Ukrainian fighter pilots and air defense officers to hear first-hand what they need to defend Ukrainian cities and military installations from Russian air and missile attacks. Protecting Ukrainian cities, military infrastructure, and forces in the field from Russian air and missile attack requires ground-based air defense systems, Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) systems, and Avenger mobile anti-aircraft missile systems. Longer-range air defense systems will allow Ukraine to target Russian aircraft and cruise missiles operating at altitudes that Stingers cannot reach. C-RAM will provide a critical point defense capability against missiles and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) targeting civilian and military critical infrastructure. Avengers will provide Ukrainian forces with mobile, short-range air defense against low-flying aircraft, helicopters, and UAS. In addition to these critical air defense capabilities, it is imperative the United States continue to provide 155 mm Howitzers, High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), armored personnel carriers, larger and more capable UAS platforms, and Mi-17 helicopters to the Ukrainian military. The importance of ongoing delivery of ammunition cannot be stressed enough given the critical nature of Ukrainian efforts to retake lost territory. We also urge you to consider fourth-generation fighter aircraft and necessary flight training for inclusion in forthcoming military aid packages.While the medium- and long-range air defense capabilities and HIMARS included in the June 27, 2022 and July 8, 2022 aid packages are a good start, these systems must be delivered at a pace and in quantity sufficient to impact the outcome of the fighting in the Donbas, Kherson and other regions. Our assistance must be decisive, not incremental. We urge you to act expeditiously while coordinating with NATO allies and partners, to get this equipment to the Ukrainian military immediately.

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-bennet-king-manchin-applaud-fccs-proposed-broadband-standard,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Angus King (I-ME), and Joe Manchin (D-WV) today applauded the FCC’s proposal to redefine broadband connections as 100 megabits (Mbps) per second download or faster, enabling American families to access connections that meet the needs of modern internet users. The senators had previously called on the FCC and the Biden administration to make this change, replacing the current outdated 25 megabits per second download speed definition. “As rural communities across the country begin to see the massive impacts of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s historic investment in affordable broadband technology, we must make sure everyone has the high-speed connections needed to fully engage in 21st century life,” said the senators. “To avoid lagging behind in our increasingly connected world, rural residents need the ability to work remotely, video conference with their loved ones, and access vital services like distance learning or telehealth. The current federal broadband standard of 25 megabits per second download speed has proven to be insufficient for these needs, and must be significantly updated to ensure reliable service. We’re glad Chair Rosenworcel has heard our calls to modernize this definition, and urge the FCC to finalize their decision on the standard as soon as possible.”In March of last year, the senators wrote a letter urging the 100 Mbps standard to then-Acting Chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Jessica Rosenworcel, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, and Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese. In their letter, the senators highlighted the modern demands of internet and how the current definition does not come close to meeting them.###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/greater-cincinnati-portman-meets-cincinnatinorthern-kentucky-international,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) met with officials from the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport to discuss how the airport and the region will benefit from the funding in Portman’s bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). The bipartisan infrastructure law, which was signed into law last November, provides $25 billion in new spending for airports. Ohio’s airports have received more than $163 million for airport improvement projects within the COVID airport improvement program, and this new funding builds on that momentum to further improve Ohio’s terminals and runways. During the visit, Senator Portman also was given a tour of the airport, where he saw the West Apron Reconstruction which will support additional growth and development, as well as the some of the refresh projects, including apron and taxilane improvements around Concourse B. “I had a very constructive visit and tour with leaders from the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport about how the airport is using funding from the new infrastructure law to upgrade its facilities and improve the experience for customers,” said Senator Portman. “The bipartisan infrastructure law, which I helped spearhead last year, has historic new funding for airports to improve their capacity and functionality and I’m excited about the opportunities for growth and expansion here in Cincinnati. I encourage airports across Ohio take advantage of this great opportunity.”In December, Senator Portman announced that nearly 100 airports across the state of Ohio will receive nearly $319 million in federal funding over the next five years thanks to the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Regional Airport will receive $65 million over the next five years in formula funding. These dedicated funds, on top of the new competitive Airport Terminal Improvement program and the FAA NextGen program funding, will allow Ohio’s airports to compete for overdue upgrades, and allow them to continue recovery from the economic impact of COVID-19 and continue their position as catalysts for economic growth.In February, Senator Portman announced that the Federal Aviation Administration opened up applications for airports in Ohio and around the United States for their Airport Terminal Program. This grant program, which will provide a total of $5 billion in funding over five years, provides funding for terminal, on-airport rail access, and airport-owned airport traffic control tower projects. As of earlier this month, two airports in Ohio have already received grants through the program.Photos from today’s event can be found below:###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/robs-rundown/robs-rundown-week-july-11-july-15-2022,"Senator Portman was back in Washington this week where he spoke on the Senate floor for the 17th consecutive session week regarding the situation in Ukraine. Senator Portman continued to urge the Biden administration to send Ukraine more High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) so they can effectively target Russian forces and noted the success they are having currently with just a handful. He also expressed support for NATO and discussed Finland and Sweden’s application to join the alliance, as well as that of Ukraine. He also discussed how it would be beneficial for Ukraine to join NATO. As the world watches this war approach the five-month mark, Portman shed light on recent Russian attacks on a Ukrainian shopping mall and residential apartment complex that horrifically killed dozens of Ukrainian civilians. As Co-Chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, Senator Portman has spoken every week since the Russian invasion began to urge the Biden administration to help Ukraine in its hour of need.Senator Portman expressed his condolences to the people of Japan on the death of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Portman delivered remarks on the Senate floor and reflected on the Prime Minister’s service and noted his friendship with the United States and the positive changes he saw first-hand when visiting Japan recently.On Monday, Senator Portman joined Fox News’ Kudlow to discuss comments by President Biden, in which the President said that Republicans are to blame for our current economic problems. Senator Portman pointed out that not only are Democrats in control of the Senate, House, and the White House, but that the economy became overheated by the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion stimulus package from last March – which Republicans, and some Democrats even, warned against. Senator Portman also pointed out the hypocrisy of the Biden administration asking other countries to produce more oil and gas when the United States has the capacity to do so and we have better environmental standards – but that the administration has done everything it can since day one to discourage domestic oil and gas production.On Wednesday, Portman once again urged the Biden administration to secure the southern border, and reform the asylum process that acts as a pull factor to attract unlawful migrants to the United States during a speech on the Senate floor. Portman pressed the Biden administration to take action on the ongoing migrant and drug crisis at the southern border and put policies in place to deter illicit narcotics and human traffickers. Earlier that day, Portman and Senator Risch (R-ID) introduced the Solving the Border Crisis Act to secure the southern border by resuming construction of the border wall, strengthening management and enforcement capacities, and upholding the rule of law.On Thursday, Portman received confirmation from government officials that the federal government is purchasing Chinese-made Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) at a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on the evolving threat posed by UAS, also known as drones. Following confirmation from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that they are indeed purchasing these Chinese-made drones, Portman stressed how critical it is to pass the Senate-passed United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) package since it includes the bipartisan American Security Drone Act. The American Security Drone Act would prohibit U.S. federal agencies from purchasing Chinese-made drones.On Friday morning, Senator Portman attended the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce’s government affairs breakfast in Kettering, Ohio. During the breakfast, Senator Portman spoke to the Chamber about current legislative priorities in Congress.Friday afternoon Senator Portman led a roundtable discussion with community leaders on ways Congress and others can continue to address the ongoing drug crisis in Ohio and all around the United States. Senator Portman continues to lead the national effort to combat the opioid crisis that is devastating communities. As part of his efforts to help Ohio, Portman has worked to help stop the influx of synthetic drugs like fentanyl and expand access to treatment programs that are so critical to an effective recovery. Senator Portman also visited Warped Wing Brewing, Premier Health, and Wright State University where he discussed the need to pass his JOBS Act legislation to keep Ohio’s workforce strong and resilient. For a more detailed look at Senator Portman’s week, please see the following:Monday, July 11, 2022Portman Announces More Than $2 Million in Grant Funding for Drug-Free Community Programs in Ohio Today, Senator Rob Portman announced that the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has awarded more than $2 million in grant funding for Drug-Free Community (DFC) Programs throughout Ohio. In 1997, Portman authored the Drug-Free Communities Act, which supports evidence-based, community-oriented drug prevention programs. The Drug Free Communities Act is designed to be optimally effective and accountable by capping the amount spent on administrative and overhead expenses, requiring all coalitions that receive grants to have experience in drug abuse prevention, and matching federal funding with local funds. No other drug prevention program has achieved the same reductions in youth drug use that has been achieved consistently by the DFC program. In January of last year, Portman introduced the Drug-Free Communities Pandemic Relief Act to provide flexibility to DFC coalitions during this pandemic by temporarily granting ONDCP the authority to waive the program’s local matching requirements if the grantee is unable to meet them due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “The Drug-Free Communities program is a proven, evidence-based, and community-oriented program that reduces substance abuse among our nation’s youth. I authored this legislation more than 20 years ago during my time in the House of Representatives, and it remains today the most effective program for consistently reducing youth drug use. The COVID-19 pandemic had made our efforts to combat addiction much more difficult and this additional federal funding for Ohio will make a big difference,” said Portman. “I have seen firsthand that prevention is a powerful tool to counteract drug use in our community, and this funding will help these coalitions across the state, along with other coordinated local efforts with local partners, to save lives. With overdose deaths at an all-time high in this country, I am more committed than ever than doing everything I can to help ensure our Ohio communities have the resources and support they need to serve those in need during these unprecedented times.” Recently, the CDC released data showing that there were 107,622 drug overdose deaths in the U.S. last year, the largest number ever recorded in a calendar year. Portman has repeatedly discussed his work to address our nation’s addiction epidemic and the importance of redoubling our efforts to save lives.  On FOX Business, Portman Discusses Inflation, Tax Hikes in the Democrats’ Build Back Better Legislation, and the Need for Pro-Growth Policies Senator Portman joined FOX Business’ Kudlow this afternoon to discuss comments by President Biden, in which the President said that Republicans are to blame for the current economic problems. Portman pointed out that not only are Democrats in control of the Senate, House, and the White House, but that the economy became overheated by the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion stimulus package from last March – which Republicans, and some Democrats even, warned against. Senator Portman highlighted that during the previous administration, there was three percent wage growth for 19 straight months, and now record levels of inflation that cut into higher wages as a result of the Democrats’ overspending and partisan spending bills. Senator Portman also discussed renewed efforts by Senate Democrats to pass its reckless tax and spending spree, which Portman said would be a mistake because it will raise taxes on middle and low-income Americans during a time of surging inflation. Kudlow also touched on President Biden’s upcoming trip to the Middle East, in which the President will ask Arab countries, like Saudi Arabia, to ramp up energy production in order to bring down soaring energy prices. Senator Portman pointed out the hypocrisy of the Biden administration asking other countries to produce more oil and gas when the United States has the capacity to do so and we have better environmental standards – but that the administration has done everything it can since day one to discourage domestic oil and gas production.A video of the interview can be found here. Portman Expresses Condolences to the People of Japan on the Death of Former Prime Minister Shinzo AbeThis evening, U.S. Senator Rob Portman delivered remarks on the Senate floor, offering his condolences to the people of Japan on the death of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Portman reflected on the Prime Minister’s service and noted his friendship to the United States and the positive changes he saw first-hand when visiting Japan recently. Senator Portman highlighted Prime Minister Abe’s leadership in the Indo-Pacific to support democracies, his work to create a stronger, more effective national security posture for Japan that included better trade and security ties, and how he strengthened the Indo-Pacific economic framework. A video can be found here. On Senate Floor, Portman Highlights Russia’s Continued War Crimes In Ukraine, NATO Expansion  This evening, U.S. Senator Rob Portman delivered remarks on the Senate floor in support of Ukraine for the 17th consecutive week while the Senate has been in session. Portman continued to urge the Biden administration to send Ukraine more High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) so they can effectively target Russian forces and noted the success they are having currently with just a handful. Portman also expressed support for NATO and discussed Finland and Sweden’s application to join the alliance, as well as that of Ukraine. He also discussed how it would be beneficial for Ukraine to join NATO.As the world watches this war approach the five-month mark, Portman shed light on recent Russian attacks on a Ukrainian shopping mall and residential apartment complex that horrifically killed dozens of Ukrainian civilians. As Co-Chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, Senator Portman has spoken every week since the Russian invasion began to urge the administration to help Ukraine in its hour of need.A video can be found here. Tuesday, July 12, 2022Portman, Colleagues Request Answers on Why Biden Administration Has Failed to Deliver Billions in Humanitarian Aid to Starving NationsAs Tens of Millions Face Starvation from Putin’s War, the Senators are Demanding Accountability from USAID for Failing to Deliver the More than $10 billion in Aid Congress Sent to HelpAs tens of millions face starvation worldwide from President Putin’s war on Ukraine, Senator Rob Portman and a bipartisan group of 12 of his colleagues are demanding accountability from the Biden administration for their sluggish rollout of nearly $10 billion in humanitarian aid appropriated by Congress across two emergency aid packages. Recognizing the acute need for shelter, medicine, and food both in and beyond Ukraine, Congress approved nearly $10 billion in humanitarian and food aid through two separate emergency packages — one in March 2022 and another in May 2022 — but the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has failed to deliver aid quickly. USAID has not yet delivered or even committed all the funding from the first package and has elected to hold more than half of the funding from the second package until the next fiscal year.Today’s letter to USAID Administrator Samantha Power requests a briefing and answers for the agency’s months-long delays in delivering this Congressionally-approved emergency aid to people in need immediately.“Stopping Russia’s military campaign across Ukraine is a security necessity; preventing a large-scale humanitarian crisis prevents global unrest, mass migration, and widespread starvation and preserves American safety and prosperity here at home. Unless the United States translates well-meaning rhetoric and appropriated dollars into a swift humanitarian response, Russia’s crimes against humanity and weaponization of the global food supply will go unpunished,” wrote the senators.They continued, “The most significant proposal of humanitarian aid in modern U.S. history must be accompanied by an infrastructure that assumes more prudent risk and quickly delivers support.”Joining Senator Portman on the letter to Administrator Power are Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Steve Daines (R-MT), John Cornyn (R-TX), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Rick Scott (R-FL), James Risch (R-ID), and Tim Scott (R-SC).You can read the full letter here.Wednesday, July 13, 2022At Press Conference, Portman Discusses Record Inflation, Harmful Tax IncreasesAt a press conference earlier today, Senator Rob Portman joined his fellow Senate Republicans in discussing the latest inflation numbers released this morning. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ report showed that the consumer price index rose at a 9.1 percent annual rate last month, the highest level of inflation since November 1981. Once again, Senator Portman pointed out that the only way to combat this inflation is to deal with the supply side of the economy, including more domestic energy production which Democrats have been unwilling to consider.At the same time, Democrats propose increasing taxes on small businesses and working families, something that Senator Portman argues will hurt lower and middle-income Americans the most, especially as they deal with soaring inflation and rising costs. Portman especially criticized the proposed tax hike on small businesses, 99 percent of which structure themselves as pass-throughs, meaning the tax hike will inevitably get passed down to workers and consumers in the form of lower wages and high prices. Instead, Senator Portman said, we must return to the pro-growth economic policies that were in place before the pandemic that grew the economy. A video can be found here. Friday, July 15, 2022In Kettering, Portman Speaks at Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce’s Government Affairs Breakfast Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) attended the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce’s government affairs breakfast in Kettering, Ohio. During the breakfast, Senator Portman spoke to the Chamber about current legislative priorities in Congress, including passing the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), the CHIPS Act to reshore our nation’s semiconductor industry, and the FY 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). “It was great to be with the Dayton Chamber of Commerce this morning to provide them an update on my work in Senate. During the last few months of my tenure, I am focusing on a few different priorities that will greatly impact Ohioans, such as keeping America competitive through the CHIPS Act, and my bipartisan JOBS Act that will keep our workforce strong and resilient,” said Senator Portman. “I also want to thank the Chamber for being supportive of my bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which became law last November. Over the next few years, we’ll get to see the positive effects of the bipartisan infrastructure law in Dayton and around the country.” Senator Portman also spoke of his work to advance workforce legislation in the Senate, such as his Jumpstart Our Businesses By Supporting Students (JOBS) Act. The JOBS Act would better support today’s students by making high-quality, shorter-term education and training programs eligible for federal Pell Grants. By expanding Pell Grant eligibility, the JOBS Act would help close the skills gap so workers can afford the job training and credentials that are in demand as industries have shifted as we continue to recover and rebuild from COVID-19. In Dayton, Portman Leads Roundtable Discussion on Addressing Ongoing Drug Crisis in the U.S. Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman held a roundtable discussion with community leaders to discuss ways Congress and others can continue to address the ongoing drug crisis in Ohio and all around the United States. Senator Portman continues to lead the national effort to combat the opioid crisis that is devastating communities. As part of his efforts to help Ohio, Portman has worked to help stop the influx of synthetic drugs like fentanyl, expand access to treatment programs that are so critical to an effective recovery, and secure additional funding for evidenced-based Comprehensive Addiction & Recovery Act (CARA) programs focused on prevention, treatment, recovery, and first responders. During today’s roundtable, Senator Portman highlighted his Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) 3.0, legislation, which will increase the funding authorization levels for the CARA programs and put in place additional policy reforms and new programs to help combat the opioid epidemic that has worsened during the coronavirus pandemic. “I want to thank OneFifteen and all those who participated in today’s constructive roundtable discussion. Drug abuse and overdoses continue to plague our country, made only worse by the pandemic and it is important everyone, from the local to the national level, work together to tackle this issue. I continue to do everything in my power to stop these deadly substances from destroying lives both in Ohio and around the country,” said Portman. “With drug overdoses reaching an all-time high, it is more urgent than ever to pass legislation in Congress that aims to address this problem. CARA 3.0 does just that by providing adequate and sustained resources that appropriately reflect the magnitude of the drug crisis – I am hopeful this critical legislation will be passed out of committee and come to the Senate floor for a vote very soon.”Today’s roundtable discussion was hosted by OneFifteen, a not-for-profit recovery ecosystem in Dayton, Ohio, delivering evidence-based services through its clinical operating partners. To date, OneFifteen has received nearly $1.1 million in Coronavirus Relief Funds from the CARES Act, which Senator Portman supported, to assist in their efforts to care for individuals experiencing substance abuse. OneFifteen also shared how their clinical operating partner, Samaritan Behavioral Health, Inc. has utilized nearly $500,000 in State Opioid Response federal grant funding to enhance outreach and educational efforts regarding medication-assisted therapy (MAT) for substance use disorder to minority communities in Dayton. Senator Portman fought for these programs to help those in the Dayton region battling addiction get their lives back on track.###

Instead, Senator Portman said, we must return to the pro-growth economic policies that were in place before the pandemic that grew the economy. A transcript of his remarks can be found below and a video can be found here. “Thank you. I appreciate Senator Crapo for having this meeting today. “Look, this is the most punitive tax of all. We just got the numbers this morning from Ohio. $8,300 a year in additional spending on energy, on food, utility bills generally, on clothing. $8,300 a year, that’s based on our numbers we have in Ohio, January until now, in terms of inflation and extrapolating that out for the rest of the year. That’s impossible for people to handle if they are on a fixed income. A lot of lower and middle-income folks in Ohio are suffering the worst, some of whom have long commutes. I’m hearing from them. I was home over the break to talk about other issues but pretty much everybody got around to inflation, no matter what the other topic was that we talked about. And this is something that, unfortunately, is going to get worse, not better, unless we change policies.“So we have the worst inflation in 40 years. We’ve got this 1.3 percent last month, by the way, when you extrapolate that over the next year, that’s 16.8 percent. That’s just unimaginable. Even higher than the Carter years. So what do we do? I think Senator Cornyn said it well – we’ve got to deal with the supply side. Demand reduction is not where we want to go, with higher and higher interest rates. Some of that is necessary at this point, I suppose. But what we want to do is help on the supply side of the economy, including producing more fossil fuels here in this country, and all forms of energy, in order for us to see the price go down at the pump and the utility bills go down. We want to see regulatory relief, and certainly not tax hikes, but rather more pro-growth policies, as we had before the pandemic. Remember during that time period we had low inflation and we had a strong and growing economy. We had three percent wage growth every month, at least, for the 19 months prior to the pandemic. Now we see just the opposite. Wages are growing but not nearly as fast as inflation. “So everybody is feeling like they’re losing ground. And what the Democrats’ answer is instead of helping on the supply side, doing things that are counter-inflationary, they are proposing things that are going to make it worse. This chart is an example of that. By the way, it does hit people well under $400,000 a year, but the bigger point is that it’s pro-inflation. Because when you tell a pass-through company, which 99 percent of the small businesses in Ohio and around the country, you going to have to pay more in taxes – where does it come from? Well, a lot of that gets passed along to the consumer. Some of it comes out of workers’ wages. But all of that is going to add to inflation, so this is exactly the wrong way to go. I’m a pass-through owner, a lot of my colleagues are. I grew up in a pass-through company. We used to get a dividend for one reason only, and that’s to pay taxes. The rest got reinvested in the company. And yet it all showed up on the individual income tax form because it passes through to you. “So I think maybe a lot of Democrats don’t realize that’s how these companies work and when you are saying you are going to put taxes on the person who has that income reflected in their individual income tax rate, they take that often out of the company and/or, again, pass this along to the consumers and to the employees. So, my hope is that the Democrats will see that this is the wrong way to go. Don’t add more stimulus spending, that’s one thing they are talking about. Don’t tax America’s small businesses, that’s pro-inflationary. Instead, do what we did before the pandemic that was working for everybody, particularly for lower and middle income workers. They were the ones who benefitted the most from that growing economy and rising wages. If we do that, we’ll begin to get out from under this unbelievable inflation that we’re now facing and begin to get the country back on track.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/portman-colleagues-request-answers-why-biden-administration-has-failed-deliver-billions,"WASHINGTON, DC – As tens of millions face starvation worldwide from President Putin’s war on Ukraine, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) and a bipartisan group of 12 of his colleagues are demanding accountability from the Biden administration for their sluggish rollout of nearly $10 billion in humanitarian aid appropriated by Congress across two emergency aid packages. Recognizing the acute need for shelter, medicine, and food both in and beyond Ukraine, Congress approved nearly $10 billion in humanitarian and food aid through two separate emergency packages — one in March 2022 and another in May 2022 — but the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has failed to deliver aid quickly. USAID has not yet delivered or even committed all the funding from the first package, and has elected to hold more than half of the funding from the second package until the next fiscal year.Today’s letter to USAID Administrator Samantha Power requests a briefing and answers for the agency’s months-long delays in delivering this Congressionally-approved emergency aid to people in need immediately.“Stopping Russia’s military campaign across Ukraine is a security necessity; preventing a large-scale humanitarian crisis prevents global unrest, mass migration, widespread starvation and preserves American safety and prosperity here at home. Unless the United States translates well-meaning rhetoric and appropriated dollars into a swift humanitarian response, Russia’s crimes against humanity and weaponization of the global food supply will go unpunished,” wrote the senators.They continued, “The most significant proposal of humanitarian aid in modern U.S. history must be accompanied by an infrastructure that assumes more prudent risk and quickly delivers support.”Joining Senator Portman on the letter to Administrator Power are Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Steve Daines (R-MT), John Cornyn (R-TX), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Rick Scott (R-FL), James Risch (R-ID), and Tim Scott (R-SC).You can read the full letter here or below.Dear Ambassador Power,The world has not faced a conflict-driven humanitarian and hunger crisis of this magnitude since World War II. Nations in Africa, the Middle East, and elsewhere have sounded the alarm that without immediate aid, their people could face acute hunger and starvation, opening the path for violence and instability in large parts of the world. Data detailing the magnitude of impact that Russia’s war in Ukraine is having on global food security is devastating and revealing. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), for example, projects up to 181 million people across forty-one countries are now facing significant food shortages. The stakes are high, and Congress has met the moment by providing your Agency with generous funding, greater than the gross domestic product (GDP) of some European nation-states. The clear purpose of both emergency Ukraine supplemental appropriations packages is to provide life-saving assistance to the 13.1 million Ukrainians currently in need of food, medicine, and shelter following Russia’s invasion, as well as to assist hundreds of millions more people facing food insecurity due to Russia’s blockade of the Black Sea. We request that you lead decisively, meet Congress’s intent, and expedite the delivery of the nearly $10 billion in emergency assistance provided to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to meet these extraordinary needs. To date, USAID’s effectiveness and stewardship in responding to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine warrants significant concern. At the beginning of the response, the Agency failed to move quickly, especially when compared to other sudden onset emergencies. As of May 16th – more than two months after funds were appropriated – only 60% of the funds for humanitarian aid had been committed, with less than a third obligated. There also were reports that senior Agency leadership was responsible for the relatively slow rate of programming by second guessing humanitarian priorities and seeking to deviate funding to support irrelevant development priorities, thereby undermining humanitarian requirements to scale-up and respond quickly to save lives and alleviate human suffering.  The Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) is the lead for addressing rising levels of emergency food insecurity and life-saving humanitarian assistance. Facing the enormous scope of work, including effective stewardship of nearly ten billion dollars of U.S. taxpayer money, BHA remains poorly resourced, trapped within an inflexible bureaucracy. Data collected from USAID as of June 2022 revealed BHA has fewer than five full-time warranted Contracting and Agreement Officers (CO) to handle 1,244 awards, even while USAID has 177 CO’s at its disposal. By comparison, the USAID Africa Bureau has 54 CO’s overseeing 1,345 grants. The workload differences are stark. A BHA-warranted CO Officer is tasked with processing ten times more than counterparts in other USAID bureaus, on average. Each BHA-warranted CO is currently overseeing 276.4 grants on average, compared to approximately 25 grants per CO in other major bureaus. While BHA processes more than 20% of the Agency’s grants, it is only provided with 2.5% of the Agency’s COs. Delays from senior leaders in the Agency, in addition to the apparent lack of strategic staffing within USAID, have significant consequences. Pre-vetted humanitarian aid groups have been forced to wait until mid-July or later for a determination or technical grant application assistance. USAID has existing tools and authorities to move quickly to expedite humanitarian aid that would mitigate Putin’s efforts to starve the developing world. The need to meet strategic staffing requirements within BHA appears long overdue and does not require Congressional action to address. In 2020, USAID issued a final ruling, “Designation of Personal Services Contractors (PSCs) as Contracting Officers and Agreement Officers (85 FR 11859),” which allows certified and trained individuals as defined in FAR Subpart 1.6 to be issued contracting and agreement officer warrants. These individuals are permitted to approve and process certain types of awards and contracts, and would significantly reduce the burden on the handful of existing BHA contracting officers. These individuals could work for a specified temporary period to augment full-time CO’s through programs developed to satisfy a growing need for surge capacity and backfill full-time staff in emergencies, like the Support Relief Group (SRG). These authorities have already been used for similar purposes with solicitations for qualified U.S. PSCs to assist in a surge response for the Food for Peace (FFP) program, in 2018 and 2019. Trepidation or sluggishness within the Agency to address strategic staffing challenges within your remit is unacceptable, and there must be an immediate course correction.Stopping Russia’s military campaign across Ukraine is a security necessity, and preventing a large-scale humanitarian crisis that triggers global unrest, mass migration, and widespread starvation is necessary to preserve the safety and prosperity of Americans here at home. Unless the United States translates well-meaning rhetoric and appropriated dollars into a swift humanitarian response, Russia’s crimes against humanity and weaponization of the global food supply will go unpunished. The most significant proposal of humanitarian aid in modern U.S. history must be accompanied by an infrastructure that assumes more prudent risk and quickly delivers support.Therefore, we urgently request a briefing and information on the following:Sincerely,###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-floor-portman-highlights-russias-continued-war-crimes-ukraine-nato,"WASHINGTON, DC – This evening, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) delivered remarks on the Senate floor in support of Ukraine for the 17th consecutive week while the Senate has been in session. Portman continued to urge the Biden administration to send Ukraine more High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) so they can effectively target Russian forces and noted the success they are having currently with just a handful. Portman also expressed support for NATO and discussed Finland and Sweden’s application to join the alliance, as well as that of Ukraine. He also discussed how it would be beneficial for Ukraine to join NATO.As the world watches this war approach the five-month mark, Portman shed light on recent Russian attacks on a Ukrainian shopping mall and residential apartment complex that horrifically killed dozens of Ukrainian civilians. As Co-Chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, Senator Portman has spoken every week since the Russian invasion began to urge the administration to help Ukraine in its hour of need.A transcript of his remarks can be found below and a video can be found here. “I’ve come to the floor today, as was noted, to talk about Ukraine. Russia's brutal assault continues. We must do more here being, not just in the United States, but around the world to help Ukraine stand up to this brutality. This marks the 17th consecutive week in session I've been on the floor to discuss the unprovoked, illegal, and deadly assault on the people of Ukraine. This invasion started 138 days ago, and it's more critical than ever the United States and our allies support the efforts of Ukraine to defend itself against this assault. Let me just recap briefly the situation on the ground – a lot has happened since we talked a couple of weeks ago. First, here in the north, you can see the light blue, which is the Ukrainian advances. “Ukrainians have been successful in pushing back against the Russian offensive and taking back some of the territory around the city of Kharkiv. This is a critical area, obviously. Kharkiv is the sister city to my hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio. I was involved in that sister city arrangement 40 years ago, and it's a beautiful city. It's been almost flattened by the unending and barbaric attacks from Russia. In the outskirts of Kharkiv, again, Ukrainian forces are not just holding the line, but also making gradual advances. Same is true here, in Kherson. The light blue here indicates where the Ukrainians have made progress, here in the south. In the south and Kharkiv there has been progress made. This is very important in the south here, because as you know Russia's goal is to try to shut off the entire Black Sea from Ukraine being able to access, and therefore, to continue to be one of the great exporters of the world. “They have blocked any passage here of the ships that could be sending wheat and other grains to the rest of the world, including to Africa, where they are very dependent on Ukrainian wheat to keep people from starving. Yet the Russians are blocking these. But these cities are still in control of the Ukrainians. It's essential that that continue, that Russia not create a landlocked Ukraine, which would over the long-term be incredibly detrimental to the economy of Ukraine. It's vital that they do well there. I will say, though, here in the east it's a different situation. Here is Donetsk and Luhansk, you hear about those, the so-called Donbas region. This is where Russia has made incremental progress in the last couple of weeks using, again, bombs and missiles that are flattening cities, killing civilians. “This city of Sievierodonetsk, you’ve heard about, which is about right here, has fallen to the Russian forces after a months-long battle over the last couple weeks. Its twin city, Lysychansk, also in this region, has also fallen, completing Russia's brutal conquest of the what is called the Luhansk region. Donetsk is still partly in Russia control, partly not. Luhansk is now in Russian control. But it's important to remember this, Russia paid dearly for every inch of Luhansk. By the way, much of which they flattened, literally destroyed before occupying it. They lost troops and they lost military equipment. But significantly, because taking this area required massive amounts of resources from Russia, it drew attention away from the north and Kharkiv as we saw, and down here in Kherson. It enabled these brave Ukrainian forces in other places to make progress, not just to hold out against the overwhelming Russian onslaught, but to make progress. “The Russians have announced they're in an operational pause, meaning they're claiming they're going to stop their large-scale offenses until their soldiers have rested. But as in the past, they can't be trusted and in fact, small-scale offenses, missile strikes and rocket attacks continue all along this front line. We also must not downplay even what these sporadic strikes can do. Consider this tragedy that occurred about two weeks ago at a shopping mall in the Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk. This is in eastern Ukraine, the area we just talked about. As more than a thousand innocent Ukrainian civilians shopped with their friends and families at this shopping mall, a Russian strategic bomber launched a large KH-22 missile. This is a long-range, nuclear-capable missile that was initially designed to destroy aircraft carriers – aircraft carriers – and they shot it into the middle of a shopping mall. Turned it into a burning inferno. You can see here in this photograph. As a result of the explosion and the fire, 20 people were killed immediately and more than 50 were wounded. Dozens more were declared missing. “We are still getting the final numbers from this horrific tragedy, but it occurred during the summit of the so-called G-7. That's the group of developed countries, larger economies – Japan, the United States, and a few European countries – who were meeting to talk about the issue of Russia and Ukraine, among other things. The G-7 rightfully condemned this atrocity as an abominable attack, an attack on civilians at a shopping mall. Just yesterday evening in Chasiv Yar, which is a residential town in eastern Ukraine, a Russian rocket attack struck an apartment complex and killed at least 15 people. More than 20 people are believed trapped in the rubble, as emergency workers continue to work today to be able to free those who are trapped, try to rescue innocent civilians who are under attack. Again, this is an apartment complex. People are trapped inside it even as we talk. These barbaric, cowardly long-range missile attacks on civilian targets have to be condemned by all of us, but they have to be stopped – in two ways. “One, by providing Ukrainians with what they need in terms of anti-aircraft, anti-missile technology, but also by giving Ukrainians the ability to use these longer-range missiles themselves. Right now the Russians can sit back with impunity and launch these attacks. I join the people of Ukraine in mourning the loss of these innocent civilians at the hands of Russia's cruelty. The terror, by the way, that's caused by these attacks is not an accident. It's part of the Russian war plan, to cause terror, striking civilian targets is certainly one thing they're doing, continuing to blockade those black seaports I talked about is another one. Increasing the economic cost of this war on the Ukrainian people. This is one reason why, by the way, a couple of weeks ago just before we left for the recess we had a vote in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on a resolution to name Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. That passed on a bipartisan basis. My hope is it comes to the floor of the United States Senate so we can all go on record again condemning what's going on over there and making it clear that Russia has become a pariah country, that this is not normal behavior, even in the tragedy of war. Striking civilian targets deliberately is unfortunately continuing day in and day out. “In response to these brutal acts, the bravery and effectiveness of the Ukrainian defenders has been impressive, but not surprising. Think about it. They're defending their families. They're also defending freedom, defending their homeland. The stakes of this war are high and the fate of a sovereign country hangs in the balance. But I will say today it's not just about Ukraine as important as that is. It's bigger than that. Because if President Putin is successful in taking more of Ukraine than he already controls, if he does in fact expand beyond what he's already done taking Crimea, taking this area of Luhansk and Donetsk, taking the southern part of Ukraine, he's not going to stop there. I don't think anybody believes that or is so naive to believe that. In 2016 he stated, ‘the borders of Russia never end.’ This is after he attacked Ukraine the first time. It was in 2016. In a speech claiming victory in May of this year, President Putin painted Ukrainians as Nazis. Remember the President of Ukraine is Jewish. His family went through the ordeal of the Holocaust, but he's painting Ukrainians, somehow, as Nazis saying the invasion of Ukrainian was inevitable and that he was forced into this conflict by NATO. NATO is not an offensive organization. It's strictly defensive. “The disinformation and lies also comes from those around him. Vladimir Medinsky, one of President Putin's senior advisers, lamented that Russia’s territory was greatly diminished from the time when Moscow controlled more than 14 currently independent nations, including Finland and Poland. This territorial retreat is, ‘not forever,’ he said. Europeans are waking up to this one-time unimaginable threat. According to a European Council on Foreign Relations opinion poll conducted two months ago, a possible Russian invasion of their nation is seen as one of the top three threats now by 53 percent of Swedes, 54 percent of Romanians, 40 percent of Germans. I was just in Romania a few weeks ago and got to hear from Romanians directly about this concern. I also went to Moldova where there's even more of a concern because there is a Russian occupied area called Transnistria right along their country. So what can be done to stop and reverse the Russian gains here in the east? The most important issue to me is to help these brave Ukrainians be able to defend themselves by giving them the weapons to level the playing field with Russia so they are not constantly outgunned. “I've heard this from President Zelenskyy. We've all heard it from Russian forces that they're making some progress in the east because they have these weapons, these missiles. And the Ukrainians do not. We also heard about this from members of the European Parliament who came here to visit us about three weeks ago, who came to the Ukraine Caucus. We also heard from some fighter pilots who came about two and a half weeks ago and met with our Ukrainian caucus. What they need are the weapons to be able to respond. Their words have been explicit and direct. Russian artillery outguns theirs in terms of range and in terms of accuracy. They can sit back and fire on Ukrainian military and civilians targets and the Ukrainians cannot respond. They cannot reach them.“Ukraine needs advanced Western rocket artillery systems to even those odds. Thankfully the United States and several of our allies have these exact systems. The UK has some systems, Germany has some systems. Over the past month, the United States has provided Ukraine several of what are called HIMARS, or High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems. We've got hundreds of these in our inventory, by the way, and many of which are not with active units. In other words, they'd be available. These are superior to Russian artillery in almost every way. Mobility, reload time, accuracy, and most importantly, range. And yet during Ukraine's hour of need we continue to move too slowly. “In the initial tranche of HIMARS, say about six weeks ago, only four of these units were announced. They are now in service as we understand it and they're working. Four more were announced a few weeks ago and another four were announced this past Friday. Reports are that these are still in transit. They're not yet being used to protect these Ukrainian civilians who are being bombed. They need more and they need them now. Several have come from Germany and from the UK but they need more and they need them now. How many do they need? It depends who you talk to, but the Ukrainian military officials who have spoken out on this, who are the experts say they need at least 48 of these systems to be able to begin to turn the tables in the east. The United States is now committed to 12. Only four are definitely in place. We need to move faster. Apparently there was a lot of discussion within the agencies, within the White House whether to do this or not. That's what took longer for these HIMARS to be approved. My view is we've had the dialogue. These systems are no more escalatory then Javelins were or other weapons. These are defensive weapons. These are the ability for Ukraine for defend itself and I hope we can continue to provide them and move more quickly. They're working. They're proving their worth. “Let me show you a photograph of what HIMARS can do to Russian logistics. These are images of Russian ammunition dumps exploding after reportedly being struck by missiles from a HIMARS system. Previously Ukraine could not reach these munition dumps, but now with HIMARS they can. Striking these ammo dumps can have a devastating impact on Russian forces. These are depots of weapons that are behind the Russian lines but in the country of Ukraine. And finally, they can access them. Striking them is going to have a devastating impact according to, Serhii Kuzan, the Chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center in Kyiv. Ukraine has used HIMARS rockets to now destroy 20 warehouses of Russian artillery ammunition. As I said earlier, Russian soldiers are currently in an operational pause to recover and resupply before future offenses, so they say. But they cannot resupply without ammunition. So destroying these hubs will set Russia's timetables back and buy Ukraine more time to prepare and to receive more western military equipment like the HIMARS.“These pictures are exactly the proof we need to show that what we are sending is now making a difference. Imagine what they could do if they had enough to be able to truly be able to push back. These HIMARS systems arrived in Ukraine too late to avoid some of the damage that we've been talking about today and certainly some of these cities, like Sievierodonetsk that we talked about that has now fallen to the Russians, or Lysychansk, which has fallen to the Russians. They arrived too late for the thousands of brave Ukrainians that were killed and wounded defending those cities. If we don't act quickly, then future HIMARS rockets will arrive too late to save more Ukrainian citizens, more Ukrainian soldiers, more Ukrainian innocents. Time is of the essence and I urge the administration not to delay. Again I'm pleased they're getting those weapons in, wish it had been sooner, and we now have to encourage more and faster. When people understandably ask about our support for Ukraine, our taxpayer-funded aid to the tune of billions of dollars, they deserve to know that their hard-earned taxpayer dollars are being spent wisely. In my view, that means spending it on weapons like HIMARS that are actually making a difference on the battlefield. I believe the aid that we and our allies are providing is a wise investment that will pay dividends over time, but let's provide them the right aid. “Ukrainians are defending their country with bravery and skill, exceeding all expectations and they're ensuring that their country is not being handed over to President Putin. We've got to ensure them that the United States and our allies are doing all we can to help them save their country. We know that making any territorial concessions to Russian would only embolden President Putin and other future would-be conquerors. The lesson they would learn is that with enough patience we can wear down the West and get what we want. So, I was pleased two weeks ago when the leaders of the so-called G-7 countries, again the U.S., Japan, European countries, stated, ‘We will continue to pray financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support and stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.’ We saw how territorial conceptions in the late 1930's only increased Nazi Germany's appetite and this is clearly no different. Russia's goals are not limited to just to Donbas or southern Ukraine. President Zelenskyy clearly understands this. He said to CNN recently, ‘Ukrainians are not ready to give away their land, to accept these territories belong to Russia. This is our land.’ I could not agree more. In fact, it goes beyond Ukraine. President Putin will conquer as much of the former Soviet empire as we let him. We must stop him here in Ukraine. “With regard to sanctions, the EU is still using Russian oil and gas, sending roughly $870 million a day to fund the Russian war machine. We have the capacity here in the United States to help our partners and shore up our domestic energy production, not only important for Americans to get the cost of gas down with more supply, but also critical for our allies. We're seeing some small progress, but much more needs to be done to reduce this reliance on Russian energy. By the end of this year, we expect coal and oil to be phased out. The United States must do its part and expand our energy production, while at the same time be a leader in developing new energy technologies that can help reduce emissions and increase national, as well as global, security. This is not either/or. It should be all of the above. We should be producing what we need right now to ensure that Europe can stop its dependency on Russia, and sending almost a billion dollars a day to fund the war machine. But at the same time we should be producing energy from all sources, including green energy, including nuclear energy. “Like sanctions and military aid, when the United States lead, the world tends to follow. But most importantly our allies and enemies watch us. This is true with regard to a revived NATO right now. In fact in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as we talked about earlier, both Sweden and Finland have applied to join NATO, shrugging off long histories of neutrality. In Brussels, NATO ambassadors on July 5th signed the accession protocols and put them a step closer. Now all 30 NATO nations will review their applications for ratification. Canada, Estonia, Denmark, Norway, Germany have already ratified Finland and Sweden’s applications. Let's join them. Let's do it this week. Let's do it through an expedited procedure and get it done. I look forward to voting in favor of those applications in committee and on the floor. We cannot forget that Russia has claimed that this war started because Ukraine wanted to join NATO. Of course they did. They reaffirmed that in 2014 when they threw off a corrupt Russian-backed government. They're looking westward, to Europe, to us, to freedom, to democracy. They want to join NATO and the European Union and form ever closer bonds with the trans-Atlantic community.  “I've long believed that Ukraine deserved a NATO membership action plan to provide a clear path to eventual NATO membership. They've made significant progress in doing this. This brutal invasion is just Russia's latest attempt to throw that progress off course. We must not be deterred. Now, as we enter the fifth month of this war, I've come down here every week to talk about it, we have seen the resilience and the fortitude of the Ukrainians, even as their brothers and husbands go to fight for the homeland, the women of Ukraine are incredibly brave as well. And I've seen them at the border with Poland, I’ve seen it at the border with Moldova and I've seen them as they've come to the United States and talk about what's going on in their country. They know this is the fight during our generation where democracy is on the line. How this war develops will have far-reaching impacts on the entire globe. “In Ohio I see this all the time. A couple weeks ago I was in Cleveland for what was called Amplify the Voice, a benefit concert for Ukraine. We had a thousand people come to this beautiful Severance Hall, which is the music center for the Cleveland Orchestra, one of the premier orchestras in the world, by the way. They made the center available to the Ukrainian Bandurist Chorus to perform to, again, an audience of people who were Ukrainian-Americans but also from every nationality, particularly the nationalities communities as we call them in Cleveland, which would be people from eastern and central Europe who understand the importance of this fight. So Lithuanians were there, Poles were there, Romanians were there, Hungarians were there, people from all over the region. The concert raised funds for the Ukrainian Organizations of Ohio’s Fund to Aid Ukraine. They are doing great work. It’s amazing, there were people who spoke who were doing something to help with regard to Ukraine: medical supplies, armored vests, helping with regard to emergency supplies just so people can have enough food to get by when they're subject to some of these bombings we've seen today. We also heard a beautiful concert. “Ukrainians of all stripes certainly understand what's going on and why this is so important and have for a long time. Because they know what it's like to live under the thumb of authoritarians. They broke away from it many times during their history and again more recently in 1991 and again in 2014. I was in Ukraine after the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, where Ukrainians decided for themselves that they wanted to turn away from Russian domination and turned to us. I believe we can help them win this time. I'm confident of it. That's why I've introduced a bipartisan resolution with Senators Manchin, Murkowski, and Hassan to recognize the United States commitment to help rebuild Ukraine. “According to the United Nations Human Rights Council, more than seven million civilians have fled their homeland and there's been about $600 billion worth of damage to Ukraine's infrastructure. By the way, those refugees, those civilians who I have met, they all want to go home. In a sense, it's not appropriate to call them refugees because they're really just Ukrainians who are temporarily forced to leave their country. But they all want to go home and rebuild Ukraine. It is not just the human toll we see captured in images and videos, but people's homes and livelihoods have vanished overnight, so they are going to need help. The countries of the free world are with us and we ought to make sure they step up, including some countries that were less comfortable providing military assistance, are providing more monetary assistance. Some of those countries are really going to need to step up in terms of helping to get Ukraine back on its feet. Now is not the time for us to back away. We have to be able to win this militarily and then begin the rebuilding. It is not a time for us to be tentative or equivocal. At this critical juncture, let’s lead our allies to provide what Ukraine needs to protect their homeland and to defend democracy. I yield the floor.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-expresses-condolences-people-japan-death-former-prime-minster,"WASHINGTON, DC – This evening, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) delivered remarks on the Senate floor, offering his condolences to the people of Japan on the death of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Portman reflected on the Prime Minister’s service and noted his friendship to the United States and positive changes he saw first-hand when visiting Japan recently. Senator Portman highlighted Prime Minister Abe’s leadership in the Indo-Pacific to support democracies, his work to create a stronger, more effective national security posture for Japan that included better trade and security ties, and how he strengthened the Indo-Pacific economic framework. A transcript of Senator Portman’s remarks can be found below and a video can be found here. “Before we talk about Ukraine, this has been a difficult time over the last couple weeks, since we were last in session, of a lot of change and volatility around the world. I want to begin by expressing my shock and sorrow over the assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. I know I speak for all Americans when I express my deepest condolences to the people of Japan for this tragic loss. Prime Minister Abe was a dear friend to the United States and leader in building new coalitions in the Indo-Pacific to support democracies in the region, encounter nuclear threats from North Korea, and China's various maligned influences. When I visited Japan a few months ago with a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues, I saw first-hand the changes that he brought to Japan that are now beginning to bear fruit. A stronger, more effective national security posture for Japan. A more confident Japan in the region. Better trade and security ties, including the quad dialogue with Japan, Australia, United States, and India. And the Indo-Pacific economic framework. His imprint on Japan and the very special alliance we have with Japan will be long lasting and beneficial to both of our countries.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/portman-difference/fox-business-portman-discusses-inflation-tax-hikes-democrats-build-back,"Senator Portman joined FOX Business’ Kudlow this afternoon to discuss comments by President Biden, in which the President said that Republicans are to blame for the our current economic problems. Portman pointed out that not only are Democrats in control of the Senate, House, and the White House, but that the economy became overheated by the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion stimulus package from last March – which Republicans, and some Democrats even, warned against. Senator Portman highlighted that during the previous administration, there was three percent wage growth for 19 straight months, and now record levels of inflation that cut into higher wages as a result of the Democrats’ overspending and partisan spending bills. Senator Portman also discussed renewed efforts by Senate Democrats to pass its reckless tax and spending spree, which Portman said would be a mistake because it will raise taxes on middle and low-income Americans during a time of surging inflation. Kudlow also touched on President Biden’s upcoming trip to the Middle East, in which the President will ask Arab countries, like Saudi Arabia, to ramp up energy production in order to bring down soaring energy prices. Senator Portman pointed out the hypocrisy of the Biden administration asking other countries to produce more oil and gas when the United States has the capacity to do so and we have better environmental standards – but that the administration has done everything it can since day one to discourage domestic oil and gas production.A transcript of the interview can be found below and you can also watch the interview here. PORTMAN ON PRESIDENT BIDEN BLAMING REPUBLICANS FOR CURRENT ECONOMIC PROBLEMS“Yeah, I mean it's discouraging because we find ourselves in a situation where the people I represent are having to pay more and more for everything. The paycheck goes less and less far, you know, and yet they're talking about more and more taxes, particularly on small businesses where most people work in Ohio. No, it's not Republicans who are to blame, it is policy choices. They made some very specific policy choices during the campaign. They said they were going to discourage fossil fuel production. They have and look what results, when you cut supply of fossil fuels and you have demand coming out of COVID, you’re going to have high prices and that is what happened. So, you’ve got $4.85 per gallon average right now. You know, that was a policy decision. The stimulus package, you remember, Larry, back in March of last year a number of us, Democrat, and Republican, because it included Larry Summers, famously, the former Treasury Secretary on the democratic side and others, said, you know, this is going to overheat the economy. And in fact, a bunch of us Republicans went down to the White House to say, ‘Slow down here, let’s focus this thing on COVID. Let’s not do a huge stimulus package. That is not what the economy needs right now.’ The Congressional Budget Office was already telling us as were other non-partisan groups, ‘Hey, this economy is picking up nicely.’ But, that big increase in spending caused a lot more demand and it is the reason for the inflationary problems that we see today, in combination with less supply, which happened partly because of COVID but largely, again, on the energy side because of the policy decision to say we'll have less supply and more demand. So, yeah, Larry, it is easy to blame other people I suppose, but you got to look in the mirror sometimes and it is these policy changes that have made the difference.”…“Yeah, we're in the minority. We're trying but, you know, we don't have the majority of the Senate or House right now. I think that will change in another several months here but for now, you know, we have to try to put the guardrails on to keep things from getting worse and reconciliation, you recall, Larry, is one of these things where we have no say. In other words, Democrats can do it on their own under the budget rules. My sense is that they're going to move ahead aggressively with whatever they get done. My hope we keep that from happening. Again, we've been successful the last 18 months, since the last time they did this. And my hope is they will see, again, this does not make sense for the American people. Let's give this economy a chance to get back on its feet by keeping demand under control. Increasing supply, that's the key, keeping supply up. Let’s not just rely on the Fed dampening demand by higher and higher interest rates. That hurts everybody. Let's have a soft landing here, but we can't do it with these policies that they're talking about putting in place.”PORTMAN ON TAMING INFLATION“Well, no, particularly given the campaign. Remember during the campaign he ran as the person who wanted to work with Republicans to get things done. He ran against Bernie Sanders who was his primary opponent and said, ‘Look, you're on the far left. I’m more of a guy who has learned how to work over the years with the other side. I want to be the conciliator. I want to heal the country.’ Then you look at the policies and unfortunately, the policies have led us down a path, as you say, is really radical compared to what he campaigned on and certainly in terms of its impact on inflation, the economy, energy prices, particularly. There is a direct link there. So, yeah, this is really discouraging. What's terrible about it to me is that there was an opportunity there to work together and to try to come up with something that made sense, to deal with COVID, and then get back to the pro-growth policies that remember, before COVID hit, we had incredible economic growth. We had wage gains over the previous 19 months of three percent or more every single month. People I represent were feeling good. Why? Because their paycheck was going up way higher than inflation and they had the opportunity to get ahead in life. So that is what we got to get back to. And that comes from pro-growth policies. They don't need to be partisan policies. Just policies that make sense for the American economy and that is not what is happening.”PORTMAN ON THE POSSIBILITY OF SMALL BUSINESS TAX HIKES “That’s the one that scares me the most because that is where most people work in America. That is where most of the people who are middle and lower-income work and those are the folks that will be hit really hard. Pass-throughs for those who don't follow this stuff, you know, 90 some percent of American businesses are pass-throughs. They don't pay taxes as corporations. They pay taxes as individuals. The owners pay the taxes. If you go after the people, what are they going to do? All studies say the same thing, by the way, a Joint Committee on Taxation study that was released just today, that analyzes the impact of the tax increases in so-called ‘Build Back Better’ legislation, and it says about 33 billion of it comes out of pockets of people who are low income and middle income. Why? Because it hurts the workers and it hurts the consumers. So, don't go after small business. This is a huge mistake, it’s something that is going to help fund more spending which will cause more demand, which is going to cause more inflation, but it is also going to hurt the very people whose wages right now are not keeping up with inflation. Don't dock their wages further and don't continue to make it harder for them to make ends meet.” PORTMAN ON TAX REFORMS AND REGULATORY RELIEF “It is going to hurt jobs and you're absolutely right, the three percent wage growth for 19 straight months that I talked about earlier, in my view, was largely the result of tax reforms, also regulatory relief. But bottom line is, it helped the people we wanted to help the most. It was the lower, middle income workers who had the biggest increase in their wages. That is what you want to do. That is what happened. Just the opposite will happen if these taxes are put in place. By the way, other countries around the world don't apply that minimum tax. It means that American workers are going to be the ones disadvantaged. That doesn't make any sense. We want to encourage more American products to go overseas. We want to encourage American companies to be engaged in the global economy because it creates jobs in America. That is the whole point. It creates good-paying jobs in America. If you put in place a punitive tax on U.S. businesses that’s not on European businesses, that’s not on Japanese businesses, that’s not on Chinese businesses – that hurts American workers. So, I do worry about this, Larry, and my hope we can keep this from happening as we have successfully over the last 18 months and if we don't I think this inflation will get worse and I think we are going see less economic growth and I think we are going to see wages for, again, the lower, middle-income workers continue to stagnate as compared to inflation. Because inflation will be relatively high, wages relatively low. Let's get back to growth. Let's get back to giving people the chance to get ahead in life.”PORTMAN ON THE FAILURE OF JCPOA“No, it didn't work. And it didn't work in part because frankly, other countries in the world were not helping to be able to put in place multilateral sanctions on Iran. In fact, you know, you had some countries that were dealing with Iran. So, Iran wasn't feeling the pressure. No, the legislation that was passed here in Congress, which said that we should not move forward with this deal, we didn't get enough votes, we didn't get 60 votes, but we got a majority, was because we didn't feel the agreement was going to be effective in getting what the administration, at that time, was saying – that was back during the Obama years. Unfortunately, we were correct. You have to only ask the other countries in the region, including the Arab countries in the Gulf region, including Israel, what they thought of it. Unfortunately, that agreement had to be renegotiated because it was not working. So that's what the administration ought to be doing now rather than going back to the old agreement. So, we'll see. What's interesting about this trip, Larry, to me, that he is going over there to ask them to produce more oil so that we have more fossil fuel oil and gas being developed in those countries which, by the way, is not done in the same kind of environmental standards that we have. So, it is not as clean as ours yet here at home, somehow, we can't produce and, therefore, are more dependent on these other countries whether it is Saudi Arabia or Venezuela or other countries that you don't want to be dependent on, like Iran. So, I think there will be a certain disconnect there when at home we're saying we are going to discourage fossil fuel development and there we're saying we would like you to produce more to send to us by ship in terms of liquefied natural gas or oil, which makes no sense. A lot more CO2 emissions will be occurring as a result.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-announces-more-2-million-grant-funding-drug-free-community-programs,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) announced that the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has awarded more than $2 million in grant funding for Drug-Free Community (DFC) Programs throughout Ohio. In 1997, Portman authored the Drug-Free Communities Act, which supports evidence-based, community-oriented drug prevention programs. The Drug Free Communities Act is designed to be optimally effective and accountable by capping the amount spent on administrative and overhead expenses, requiring all coalitions that receive grants to have experience in drug abuse prevention, and matching federal funding with local funds.  No other drug prevention program has achieved the same reductions in youth drug use that has been achieved consistently by the DFC program. In January of last year, Portman introduced the Drug-Free Communities Pandemic Relief Act to provide flexibility to DFC coalitions during this pandemic by temporarily granting ONDCP the authority to waive the program’s local matching requirements if the grantee is unable to meet them due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “The Drug-Free Communities program is a proven, evidence-based, and community-oriented program that reduces substance abuse among our nation’s youth. I authored this legislation more than 20 years ago during my time in the House of Representatives, and it remains today the most effective program for consistently reducing youth drug use. The COVID-19 pandemic had made our efforts to combat addiction much more difficult and this additional federal funding for Ohio will make a big difference,” said Portman. “I have seen firsthand that prevention is a powerful tool to counteract drug use in our community, and this funding will help these coalitions across the state, along with other coordinated local efforts with local partners, to save lives. With overdose deaths at an all-time high in this country, I am more committed than ever than doing everything I can to help ensure our Ohio communities have the resources and support they need to serve those in need during these unprecedented times.” Recently, the CDC released data showing that there were 107,622 drug overdose deaths in the U.S. last year, the largest number ever recorded in a calendar year. Portman has repeatedly discussed his work to address our nation’s addiction epidemic and the importance of redoubling our efforts to save lives.  The following programs each received $125,000 in grant funding: ADAMHS Board For Montgomery County - Montgomery County Prevention CoalitionAlcoholism Council of Butler County, OH, Inc. - Healthy HamiltonCounty of Erie, OH - Roots of Prevention (ROP)Crawford Marion Board of Alcohol Drug Addiction & Mental Health Drug -  Free MarionFamily Recovery Center, Inc. - The Jefferson County United Prevention PartnershipGreater Cincinnati Behavioral Health Services - Coalition for a Drug Free Clermont County (CDFCC)Knox Public Health - Knox Substance Abuse Action Team (KSAAT)McKinley Hall - Clark County Substance Abuse Prevention Coalition (SAC)Mental Health And Recovery Board of Union Co. - Mental Health And Recovery Board of Union CountyOhio Guidestone - Tuscarawas County Anti-Drug CoalitionOneeighty Inc. - Turning Point CoalitionPickaway Addiction Action Coalition - Pickaway Addiction Action CoalitionRichland Public Health - Mansfield RichlandSwanton Area Community Coalition - Springfield Area Prevention CoalitionTalbert House - Mental Health Recovery Services of Warren Clinton CoWilliams County Health District - Educating Communities on Healthy Opportunities (ECHO)Wood County Educational Service Center - Wood County Board of Education###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rio-grande-portman-visits-buckeye-hills-career-center-highlights-need-pass,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) visited Buckeye Hills Career Center in Rio Grande, Ohio, where he met with Jamie Nash, Superintendent of Buckeyes Hills Career Center and Ryan Smith, President of the University of Rio Grande, received a tour of the facility, and had a chance to discuss his work in Congress to promote career and technical education in Ohio and around the country. Senator Portman highlighted his bipartisan Jumpstart Our Businesses By Supporting Students (JOBS) Act during the visit. The JOBS Act would better support today’s students by making high-quality, shorter-term education and training programs eligible for federal Pell Grants. By expanding Pell Grant eligibility, the JOBS Act would help close the skills gap so workers can afford the job training and credentials that are in demand as industries have shifted as we continue to recover and rebuild from COVID-19. He heard from faculty about the center’s short-term credential programs that would benefit from his JOBS Act.  “I want to thank the Buckeye Hills Career Center staff for hosting me – it was great to learn more about the programs offered at Buckeye Hills, which are helping students learn the technical skills needed to find good-paying jobs,” said Senator Portman. “In Congress, I continue to work to expand access to these high-quality, shorter-term education and training programs through my bipartisan JOBS Act. We’ve got a lot of great job training programs in Ohio, but too many students are finding that the programs they want to take are not covered by the Pell Grant because they are shorter than the 15-week course requirement. The JOBS Act expands Pell Grant eligibility to help students get the job training they need for careers that will help them join the workforce and give them economic security. I am working to move this bill forward in Congress and look forward to getting it signed into law.”Photos from the visit can be found below:###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/nelsonville-portman-visits-wayne-national-forest-headquarters-discusses,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) visited Wayne National Forest headquarters, where he met with staff to receive updates on the national forest and its operations, and to discuss his work in Congress to promote conservation and to protect our public lands and parks.Senator Portman highlighted his bipartisan REPLANT Act, enacted as part of his bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The REPLANT Act will help the U.S. Forest Service plant 1.2 billion trees on national forests and create nearly 49,000 jobs over the next 10 years by removing the cap on the Reforestation Trust Fund. “Thanks to the Folks at Wayne National Forest for hosting me today – it was great to hear more about their important work to promote and protect the national forest,” said Senator Portman. “We had a chance to discuss the benefits of my REPLANT Act, which was included in the bipartisan infrastructure law – it will improve our environment by sequestering carbon dioxide, reinvigorating ecosystems, and supporting wildlife that depend on healthy forests, while also creating nearly 49,000 jobs and expanding recreation opportunities on national forestland. It was great to see firsthand how this legislation is going to help our forests.”From destructive wildfires to invasive pests and disease, national forests across the country are in desperate need of reforestation efforts. The demand for reforestation has vastly outpaced the current funding available, which has contributed to a backlog of nearly two million acres in need of restoration. Each year, approximately 15 percent of the national forest tree planting backlog is addressed. Planting these trees will help sequester 75 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in a decade, which is equivalent to avoiding the use of 8.5 billion gallons of gasoline. Reforestation also improves soil health and protects wildlife habitats for hunting and fishing.Photos from today’s visit can be found below:###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-announces-37-million-new-funding-ohio-airports-under-bipartisan,"CINCINNATI, OH – Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) applauded the announcement that two Ohio airports are set to receive grants made available through the Airport Terminal Program. This grant program provides funding for terminal, on-airport rail access, and airport-owned airport traffic control tower projects. Thanks to the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which Portman spearheaded and was signed into law last November, the Airport Terminal Program will provide a total of $5 billion in funding over five years. It is one of three new aviation programs created by the bipartisan infrastructure law.“This announcement is great news for our Ohio airports and all those who use them. Thanks to the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and this brand new airport funding, our aging airport facilities can finally be upgraded, leading to better functionality and efficiency for Ohio travelers,” said Portman.The Darke County Airport will receive $1.35 million so that the airport can construct a new terminal building as the existing terminal building is over 50 years old and an obstruction to current runway design surfaces.The Newark Heath Airport will receive $2.38 million so that the airport can construct a new terminal building as the existing terminal building is over 60 years old and is located in taxiway and runway design surfaces.  The bipartisan infrastructure law provides $1 billion per year for this program over the next five years. It also ensures the FAA awards projects at large, medium, and small hub airports as well as non-hub and non-primary airports each award cycle.###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-manchin-murkowski-hassan-introduce-resolution-rebuild-ukraine,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) have introduced a bipartisan resolution recognizing the United States’ commitment to rebuilding Ukraine after the impacts of Putin’s war. “Russia’s brutal and unjust war against Ukraine has caused horrible destruction and devastation to cities and towns all over the country, while also crippling Ukraine’s economy. As the leader of the free world, the United States must help its ally both now and once this war is over – so that Ukrainians may return home and rebuild their lives and their country,” said Senator Portman. “I am pleased to support this resolution to show our commitment to our ally Ukraine and encourage all of my colleagues in the Senate to do the same.” “It is our responsibility as a world power and democratic leader to support our allies in times of need,” said Senator Manchin. “Putin’s war on Ukraine continues to impact Ukrainians, Americans and our allies, and we must be prepared for the massive recovery efforts that will be needed to rebuild Ukraine. I am proud to introduce this bipartisan resolution that recognizes our commitment to rebuilding and supporting the people of Ukraine and will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to put this resolution on the Senate Floor.”“The United States must continue to play a leading role in the fight to defend democracy. Russia’s ruthless and illegal invasion of Ukraine is a threat to the global rules and norms we hold dear. That is why I strongly support the defense of Ukraine – allowing them to take the fight to the Russian’s – rather than allowing Putin to expand his tyranny around the world. There will come a time when Ukraine will rebuild and as a global leader, we should join others and be there to help,” said Senator Murkowski. “As we continue to counter Putin’s unconscionable invasion of Ukraine, we are also united in our commitment to support Ukraine as it rebuilds,” said Senator Hassan. “This resolution sends a strong bipartisan message that Americans stand with the Ukrainian people, and that we will always stand on the side of freedom.”The bipartisan resolution can be found here. ###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/portman-difference/fox-news-special-report-portman-discusses-need-address-americas,"Last night, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) joined Fox News’ Special Report with Bret Baier to talk about the ongoing addiction epidemic that continues to sweep the nation, caused in large part by illicitly manufactured fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, much of which is coming into the United States from across the border. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data show that there were 107,622 drug overdose deaths that occurred in the U.S. last year, the largest number ever recorded in a calendar year. Fentanyl is behind a majority of the deaths. Portman discussed what needs to be done to get the crisis under control, including tightening border security, strengthening prevention, treatment and recovery services, and educating the public about the dangers of these drugs.A transcript of his remarks can be found below and a video can be found here.   PORTMAN ON THE AMOUNT OF FENTANYL COMING ACROSS THE BORDER“We focus a lot on the border because of the people coming across and last month was the most illegal entries ever again as it was the previous month. What we don't talk about so much is the fact that a lot of drugs are coming as well and sometimes with those individuals. So, we know last month that there were 1,100 pounds seized of fentanyl, that’s a record, by the way it just quadrupled in the last two years, doubled in the last year. That’s enough to kill 200 million Americans.”PORTMAN ON STUDENTS FROM OHIO STATE WHO DIED OF OVERDOSES“A few days before the Ohio State graduation, three students overdosed and died. It appears as though they were taking Adderall which is a study drug that young people take. They apparently bought these on the street. So, you know, it was very sad, because my talk was going to be more inspiring about the future, but I had to include in that the fact that to all the parents and all the students that were there, we cannot trust any drug, any street drug.”PORTMAN ON WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO COMBAT THE DRUG CRISIS“I think there are three obvious things to do. One is to tighten the border. The border problem is about contraband, not just people. Specifically, it’s about fentanyl – this opioid that is synthetic that is deadly, that’s causing about two-thirds of the overdose deaths in America. Second, we have to figure out a national message here that make sense to get out to people. I think it's worth spending some money by the administration to do in national media campaign. We did it at one time. It was somewhat effective. Nancy Reagan was famous for that. But it's a pretty obvious message right now, which simply is any drug that you can take can kill you. So it is being mixed in everything, cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and so on, but even drugs again like antidepressants, Xanax and so on. So that message needs to get out and needs to get out urgently to save lives. Third, more prevention which is this message we are talking about. But also getting people in to treatment and longer-term recovery. So, it’s a combination of things, obviously, the other part of this which is not so much what we need to do but what the other countries need to do with our strong urging is China and Mexico need to clean up their act.”PORTMAN ON BORDER PATROL RESOURCES BEING STRETCHED THIN AND THE NEED TO CLOSE THE BORDER “They are distracted by a group on purpose, this is deliberate distraction, and then quietly you know, you see guys with backpacks actually running through the deserts who are carrying something. And the assumption from the border patrol that I talk to is that they think most of it is getting through. So I do think that tightening up the border makes sense.”PORTMAN ON CHINA’S ROLE IN THE CRISIS“I have always felt that China was being irresponsible in how they dealt with the issue. I went to China a few years ago and actually met with a Premier on this and made a strong pitch, saying again that this is in your interest too because there is leakage in China, people are dying from it. They would never acknowledge that, they won’t talk about that, but it hurts them too.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/portman-difference/cnbcs-closing-bell-portman-discusses-state-economy-inflation-bipartisan,"In an interview with CNBC’s Closing Bell, Senator Portman discusses the current state of the economy, a potential recession and what that means for Ohio’s working families. Portman expressed his concerns about consistent negative economic growth and higher prices for common essential items like oil and gas. Portman also spoke about the need to keep the United States’ economy competitive with China through the bipartisan CHIPS Act legislation to spur semiconductor manufacturing in America and the importance of getting the bill across the finish line. A transcript of the interview can be found below and you can also watch the interview here.  PORTMAN ON A POSSIBLE RECESSION “Well, I would love to see a soft landing and I hope that’s true but we just saw the revised numbers in the first quarter. A lot of people don’t realize that we actually were at negative economic growth in the first quarter, and two quarters of that, technically is a recession. So I don’t know; nobody knows. I suspect we are probably going to be negative economic growth again. In any case, for most Americans, it sure feels like a recession already because they are paying $5 for a gallon of gas, because they are seeing food costs go up dramatically – clothing costs, everything. And so, for working families in Ohio they are already pulling back and cutting back and so I think the recession mentality unfortunately is upon us.”PORTMAN ON INFLATION & FED RESPONSE“Well it’s pretty simple in the sense that you know, demand is exceeding supply still so we have got to do more on the supply side. On the demand side the Fed is taking its role; they’re raising interest rates. No one wants to see that but that will dampen demand. It’s already happening. They will probably by the way have to go higher, based on the history of recession. “The Fed was slow, as almost always. It’s easy to look back in retrospect but they were slow to come to the table if they would have raised interest rates a little bit earlier on, it would’ve been better. I think everyone pretty much agrees with that. But with regard to the supply side we have got to have a more productive economy so we have to ensure that we are producing here in America the oil and gas that we need in our economy. When we do that we will see gas prices begin to go down. We talked about worker retraining. We have got to make sure we are a more productive economy. We have got to reskill people quickly, be sure that we are competitive in the global marketplace. We have talked a lot about semiconductors and being reliant on other countries around the world that don’t like us much for some of the essential products that we have. So this new legislation on the competition act its called or USICA, the CHIPS Act, it’s also about this broader issue of making our economy more competitive, I would also argue that the infrastructure bill is going to be good because it will actually be counterinflationary. As you begin to build long-term assets. But, we need to back off on the stimulus which causes the demand and overheated the economy. The $1.9 trillion stimulus from last March was a real problem. So I disagree with the Biden administration on that. But we also have to do much more on the supply side.”PORTMAN ON CHIPS ACT BECOMING LAW“Well I hope it happens. I spent most of out here being here with you and these great panels and trying to help on that process but I think we will probably get it done because it just makes so much sense. We are falling way behind. Semiconductors are in everything that are essential to our economy. We used to produce a lot of them, in fact we came up with the whole technology. 30 years ago we had about 37 percent of the production here in America, now we are down to 12 percent. 90 percent of the high-end semiconductors are being produced in one country in Asia: Taiwan. So we reliant on other countries right now – you see this with the automobiles. People can’t get a car because they are lined up at a parking lot somewhere waiting for the semiconductors to be added. But it’s about electronics, it’s about everything we do in our lives; its more digital. And then it’s about our national security, and that’s incredibly important to me that we have a semiconductor industry here in the United States that we can rely on for our F-35 fighters – for all of the more sophisticated military technology that we need to keep that qualitative advantage. “Well it’s bipartisan but the House bills and Senate bill were very, very different. I would argue that the House bill should’ve looked more like the Senate bill because we passed the Senate bill 15 months ago. It was entirely bipartisan. We negotiated it with Democrats in the Senate. As a Republican, I was one of the people negotiating but I also negotiated with the White House. We came out with a bipartisan product. The House, over 11 months of adding to it came up with a bunch of stuff that could get virtually no Republican support, and sent it back, and now we are in conference with them trying to figure it out. So it’s been made more complicated in my view but understanding that this is an essential and urgent matter for us to address and the bipartisan compromise has largely been worked out. So my hope is that we can come together. “Europe and Asia. We just had a silicon wafer company say that they are going to produce in South Korea rather than in Texas because of the CHIPS Act not being passed. So we do need to pass this and generally we need to ensure that we have a competitive economy here and there’s more than just the CHIPS Act in this legislation including protecting our research from China because over the last two decades unfortunately China has identified the best researcher, the best research and taken that back to China often helping them to leapfrog us. “I think it’s got to get done quickly. I think if not these companies will make decisions to go elsewhere. You mentioned the fact that Germany has put Euros on the table and so have countries in Asia. A lot more than we are putting on by the way, so we are not going to be as generous with our incentives as they are, but we are doing enough to be able to incentives these companies to produce here. We have got to bring things back and reshore it to America – the things we need that are essential.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-senate-colleagues-statement-bipartisan-opposition-asset-and,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Jon Tester (D-MT), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), John Thune (R-SD), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Patty Murray (D-WA), Steve Daines (R-MT), and Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) released the following joint statement announcing their collective opposition to the Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission process moving forward in the Senate, which signifies the end of the AIR Commission:“As Senators, we share a commitment to expanding and strengthening modern VA infrastructure in a way that upholds our obligations to America’s veterans. We believe the recommendations put forth to the AIR Commission are not reflective of that goal, and would put veterans in both rural and urban areas at a disadvantage, which is why we are announcing that this process does not have our support and will not move forward. The Commission is not necessary for our continued push to invest in VA health infrastructure, and together we remain dedicated to providing the Department with the resources and tools it needs to continue delivering quality care and earned services to veterans in 21st century facilities — now and into the future.”In 2018, Congress passed, and President Donald Trump signed into law, the VA MISSION Act. Among its many provisions, the law required the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to research, develop and publish a list of recommendations intended to modernize VA medical facilities and health care delivery — including through facility expansions, relocations, closures or changes in services. The law further directed those recommendations to be reviewed by a presidentially-appointed and Senate-confirmed Commission, which would then report its views of the recommendations to the President who could end the process or present recommendations to Congress for a vote. Without the Senate’s approval of the nominees, no Commission will be established and the process as outlined by the VA MISSION Act will not move forward. NOTE: In March, the VA’s AIR report recommended the closure of Chillicothe VA Medical Center, in Chillicothe, Ohio. Senator Portman expressed his opposition to the proposed closure and pushed the VA to increase services in Chillicothe, including reinstating inpatient services that were stopped during the COVID-19 pandemic. Senators Portman and Brown hosted VA Secretary Denis McDonough when the secretary visited the Chillicothe VA Medical Center in late April, where Senator Portman communicated the concerns of local veterans who depend on Chillicothe. By ending the AIR commission, the senators can help ensure that the medical center will remain open. ###

The legislation would allow people to save more for retirement, help small businesses offer retirement plans, expand access for low-income Americans, and provide more certainty and flexibility during Americans’ retirement years, ensuring the opportunity for all to have dignity in their retirement years. This legislation is the senators’ fourth and final retirement savings legislation introduced together. Excerpts of the interview can be found below and you can also watch the interview here.PORTMAN ON NEED TO PASS LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE“…it’s about the future because semiconductor production is about the future economy and it’s critical to our national security to have the ability to reassure some of that infrastructure for making chips back to America. We designed these semi-conductors originally, we used to have, you know 40 years ago 37 percent of the production here in America and now we are down to 12 percent, and if this legislation does not pass I believe we will be down to single digits before long. “No, I think from what I have heard that they plan to move forward that the question is timing. They have other countries around the world that are offering them huge incentives to build fabs in their countries. And that’s because other countries, in Europe and in Asia in particular, understand that this is part of the future. It’s sort of like the countries that had the oil in the ground benefitted a lot over the last serval decades. Countries that have semi-conductor production will benefit a lot going forward. You see in places like Ohio, trucks or cars parked at large parking lots at a raceway in northern Kentucky, as an example as I saw recently as I flew into our airport in Cincinnati and they are just waiting for semiconductors. So, this is an example, if you’ve got a car on order probably you’re waiting, and probably because the supply chain is being constrained. It’s an enormous problem for us right now. “I think so, I’ve had lots of conversations even today about it. My hope is that we will make all of the big decisions even before we go out on break here either today or tomorrow and then over the next two weeks finalize some of those decisions so we can put the bill to vote when we get back. It’s certainly is important to move forward because of the competitive issue with our Asian competitors and our European competitors. It’s also very important to my home state of Ohio. It’s not just going to create thousands of great paying jobs eventually, but immediately, thousands of construction jobs. Other companies will come in as suppliers which will create more opportunity. These are good, high paying jobs so it’s important we get this done.”SENATOR PORTMAN ON THE NEED TO PASS BIPARTISAN RETIREMENT SECURITY REFORM“I certainly am. I am concerned about what is happening to people’s retirement savings with the market, both the bond market and the equity market, but I am also concerned about people not setting as much aside for retirement because they need that funding just to be able to survive. With gas prices at $5 a gallon, with food and clothing prices skyrocketing, so, I am concerned and I think that is one reason this legislation is so important. It’s quite timely for us to provide additional incentives for people to save for retirement. “One example that is in the bill, as you may know, is that currently, you may have to take your retirement out and pay taxes on it at a certain age, 72, and we raised that age to 75. Now, that is very significant to a lot of your viewers who are thinking ‘I’m working into my 70s, why should I be taking my money out and having to pay taxes on it?’ But, there is also a lot for small businesses, which is where the biggest problem is right now for not having a plan. Part-time workers will get coverage under this plan, which is very important. We also are helping with regard to low income workers to get them banked, get them into plans. So, there is a lot of good stuff in this legislations. It was passed out of the committee yesterday, it is something we worked on for five years. Senator Cardin is my partner in this, has been on three previous bills and the committee vote yesterday was unanimous, that rarely happens around here. So, my hope is that we can get this significant retirement package to the Senate floor soon. You mentioned the House has comparable legislation, actually, over 30 of our provisions are in the House bill so we worked together with the House over time to make those two bills as overlaps as possible. And the president has indicated that he supports it as well.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/robs-rundown/robs-rundown-week-june-20-june-24-2022,"Senator Portman was back in Washington this week where he spoke on the Senate floor for the 16th consecutive session week regarding the situation in Ukraine. Portman urged the administration to send Ukraine more High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS). He highlighted his meeting with members of the Ukrainian Parliament the week before and conveyed their emotional pleas for the U.S. to give more aid to Ukraine in its time of need. Portman also noted the Americans captured abroad and urged the administration to ensure their safety. A consistent voice for Ukraine, the administration has heeded bipartisan calls led by Portman for sanctions on trade, banking, energy, and tax, in addition to more lethal weaponry.On Wednesday, the Senate Finance Committee unanimously approved Portman’s bipartisan legislation that would allow Americans to save more for retirement, help small businesses offer retirement plans, expand access for low-income Americans, and provide more certainty and flexibility during Americans’ retirement years. Portman also joined Fox News’ Your World with Neil Cavuto to discuss the Biden administration’s call the suspend the federal gas tax, the need to expand American energy production, and the bipartisan gun safety legislation under consideration by the Senate. At a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing on Wednesday, Portman stressed the importance of Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) work to protect our communities from violent threats and technological hazards, while examining what resources and authorities FEMA requires to address worsening emergencies and disasters.On Thursday, Portman pressed experts at a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing on the need to build trust in government through customer experience. Portman made it clear that this can start by fully implementing his bipartisan 21st Century IDEA Act, now law, which is designed to improve citizens’ interaction with the federal government online.  Later that evening, Portman voted for the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which takes common-sense steps to improve access to mental health, protect America’s children, improve school safety, and reduce the threat of gun violence across our country while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners. Finally, Senator Portman released a statement on the Supreme Court’s Dobbs Decision.

The Journal specifically pointed to Portman’s speech on the Senate floor last week where he discussed the issue. During that speech, Portman noted the progress Russia is making in eastern Ukraine and said it is imperative that the United States step up to provide more and better capability to Ukraine to blunt Russia’s offensive.

The Three Seas Investment Fund supports the development of infrastructure in the energy, transport and telecommunications sectors. The U.S. Development Finance Corporation will support the fund with a loan of up to $300 million dollars focused on energy projects. This will enhance regional energy cooperation and connectivity that will help reduce countries’ dependence on Russian energy sources.“Energy independence is one of the most pressing challenges facing Europe amid Putin’s unprovoked and illegal war against Ukraine. The Three Seas Initiative illustrates the importance of investing in critical regional cooperation to diversify energy sources, making Europe stronger, better connected and more resilient,” said the Senators. “We applaud the U.S.’ support for this initiative, which will empower our allies and partners to further develop reliable sources of energy and reduce their vulnerability to Putin’s manipulation and destabilization. And we support the initiative undertaken by members of the Three Seas Initiative to work together in identifying and responding to their shared challenges.” NOTE: Senator Portman traveled to Romania in May to meet with Prime Minister Ciuca and other officials, where Portman was briefed on Romania’s efforts to increase its energy production over the coming years through nuclear energy. As its production increases, Romania has the potential to become an energy hub in Eastern Europe that can help wean its neighbors off Russian energy.Portman, Blumenthal, Durbin, Grassley Urge Department of Defense to Send More Advanced Artillery Rocket Systems to Ukraine Today, U.S. Senators Rob Portman, Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, urging him to send more advanced artillery rocket systems and ammunition to Ukraine, as the systems are vital in Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s brutal invasion. The senators commended the decision by the Biden administration earlier this month to send M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) to Ukraine, but the administration has decided to only send four – a number the senators say is far too low, given the amount of artillery Russia has at their disposal. The senators encouraged Secretary Austin to send additional systems urgently, like HIMARS or the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), in order to level the playing field for Ukraine and allow them to halt Russian advances in the Donbas region and strengthen their counteroffensives in other parts of the country.“The outcome of Russia’s war against Ukraine will hinge on how firmly the West supports Ukrainian forces,” said the senators. “Following the incredible defeat of early Russian attempts to topple Ukraine’s elected government and seize the entire nation, battlefield needs have understandably evolved and we must be nimble in meeting these changing needs. As a result, we ask that you urgently provide a significant number of additional artillery rocket systems to Ukraine.”You can view the full letter here.GOP Senators Send Letter to President Biden Expressing Concern Over Tariff Moratorium on Imported Solar PanelsPresident Biden’s Decision Rewards China and Their Unfair Trade Practices, While Hurting U.S. Workers Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman led a group of fellow GOP senators in sending a letter to President Biden, expressing their concern over the president’s decision to impose a two-year tariff moratorium on imported solar panels – which the senators argue increases our dependence on China, rewards unfair trade practices, harms U.S. workers, and represents an executive branch overreach. The president’s decision also undermines an ongoing investigation by the Department of Commerce into efforts by Chinese solar companies to circumvent our Antidumping and Countervailing Duty (AD/CVD) orders against Chinese-made solar cells and modules by moving manufacturing to countries like Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.“Already the United States is over-reliant on China for solar power. Currently, 80 percent of our solar panels come from China or Chinese companies, and this reliance is not market-based. China has used a variety of anti-free market practices, such as industrial subsidies, to come to dominate the solar sector. This is why the United States imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) orders on unfairly traded solar panel imports from China as early as 2012. It is also why the Department of Commerce is actively investigating circumvention of those AD/CVD orders by solar panel producers and exporters in Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. The unprecedented and sweeping tariff moratorium prioritizes foreign solar panels over those made in the United States. We cannot afford to trade dependence on Russian energy for that of Chinese solar panels. It is counter to the national interest to rely on our adversaries for our energy needs,” wrote the senators.  “…we are disappointed that the climate change agenda has proven to be an effective means to pre-empt and nullify the legitimate claims of U.S. workers and industry before they can be fully considered through the ongoing investigation by your Department of Commerce. To honor those claims, we urge you to end the self-imposed emergency declaration and let the Commerce Department investigation proceed unimpeded so as not to further increase our economic reliance on China,” continued the senators.Along with Portman, senators joining the letter include Senators Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Mike Braun (R-IN), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), and Ted Cruz (R-TX).You can view the full letter here.On Senate Floor, Portman Highlights Ukrainian Victory in Black Sea, Sheds Light on Americans Captured, NATO Expansion, and Warns of High Stakes in Russia’s War on DemocracyThis evening, U.S. Senator Rob Portman delivered remarks on the Senate floor in support of Ukraine for the 16th consecutive week while the Senate has been in session. Portman urged the administration – as outlined in his bipartisan letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin – to send Ukraine more High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS). He highlighted his meeting with members of the Ukrainian Parliament, the Rada, and conveyed their emotional pleas for the U.S. to give more aid to Ukraine in its time of need. Portman also noted the Americans captured abroad and urged the administration to ensure their safety. As co-founder and co-chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, Senator Portman has met numerous times with Ukrainian officials, gone to Ukraine seven times, and has been a staunch ally in their defense of their homeland and democracy. A consistent voice for Ukraine, the administration has heeded bipartisan calls led by Portman for sanctions on trade, banking, energy, and tax, in addition to more lethal weaponry. Senator Portman will continue his support for Ukraine as media coverage has fallen, and commended allies for their continued support.  A video of his remarks can be found here.Wednesday, June 22, 2022Portman, Coons Introduce Legislation to Advance Trade Negotiations with the United KingdomThe SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP Act Builds on the Unique History of Partnership Between U.S. and UK to Grant New Presidential Authority on Future Trade AgreementU.S. Senators Rob Portman and Chris Coons (D-DE), co-founders and co-chairs of the Senate UK Trade Caucus, today introduced the Securing Privileged Economic, Commercial, Investment, And Legal Rights to Ensure Longstanding Atlantic Trade and Investment Opportunities and Nurture Security, Happiness, Innovation, and Prosperity Act, or the SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP Act. The new legislation would give the president five years to take advantage of “fast-track” authority, and secure an up-or-down vote in Congress on any comprehensive trade agreement negotiated with the United Kingdom.“As one of our oldest trading partners, resuming trade talks with the United Kingdom is a no brainer. We are close allies and trading partners and a trade agreement would strengthen our relationship and economic competitiveness, especially with respect to non-market economies,” said Senator Portman. “We need to get back into the business of expanding trading relationships around the world so we can export more American-made products and create jobs here at home. Reaching a bilateral trade agreement with the United Kingdom will benefit U.S. workers and businesses and strengthen the economic and security ties between our two countries.”The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which passed the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support in 2020, set high standards in areas of labor rights, environmental protection, digital trade, and intellectual property rights, and the SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP Act encourages the executive branch to build on those standards in negotiations with the UK. As the bill notes, the robust labor and environmental protections enforced in both countries would reduce the risk of businesses offshoring operations to take advantage of laxer regulations and ensure that U.S. workers and companies can compete on a level playing field.While the UK government has recently moved to override the Northern Ireland Protocol, which sets the post-Brexit trade rules in Northern Ireland, the SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP Act emphasizes that any U.S.-UK trade agreement must uphold peace and stability in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Portman Delivers Opening Remarks at Senate Finance Committee Mark-up to Consider Cardin-Portman Retirement Savings LegislationToday, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) delivered the following opening remarks at a Senate Finance Committee markup of bipartisan retirement security legislation he authored with Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD). The Cardin-Portman legislation, Retirement Security and Savings Act (S.1770), would allow people to save more for retirement, help small businesses offer retirement plans, expand access for low-income Americans, and provide more certainty and flexibility during Americans’ retirement years, ensuring the opportunity for all to have dignity in their retirement years. This is the senators’ fourth and final retirement savings legislation introduced together. Senator Portman pointed out that not only does the Cardin-Portman legislation have strong bipartisan support, but also bicameral support. In March, the House passed Neal-Brady legislation, Securing a Strong Retirement Act, by a vote of 414-5 – which has significant overlap with the Cardin-Portman bill. A video of Senator Portman’s opening statement can be found here.Portman, Durbin Meet With U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget BrinkToday, U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Dick Durbin (D-IL), Co-Chairs of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, met with U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink to discuss the latest events regarding Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. They also discussed how the Senate can continue to better support our ally through military, economic, and humanitarian assistance.“Russia has brought horrible destruction and devastation to Ukraine, but so many Ukrainians are fighting valiantly. It was great to meet with Ambassador Brink and Senator Durbin today to hear about what she is seeing on the ground and how we can better assist our diplomats in-country and Ukrainians defending their homeland,” said Portman. “Ambassador Brink’s presence in Ukraine is vital to working closely with our allies and partners in Ukraine and in the region, and to ensure effective oversight of the significant military, economic and humanitarian assistance that the United States is providing to Ukraine. I am thankful that we were able to move her nomination through the Senate rapidly so that she could start her important work expeditiously.""Senators Portman and Cardin Hail Unanimous Senate Finance Committee Passage of Bipartisan Retirement Security LegislationToday, U.S. Senators Rob Portman and Ben Cardin (D-MD) hailed the unanimous passage of their bipartisan retirement security legislation, S. 1770, the Retirement Security and Savings Act, in the Senate Finance Committee. The legislation, which passed 28-0, would allow people to save more for retirement, help small businesses offer retirement plans, expand access for low-income Americans, and provide more certainty and flexibility during Americans’ retirement years, ensuring the opportunity for all to have a dignity in their retirement years. This legislation is the senators’ fourth and final retirement savings legislation introduced together. The Cardin-Portman legislation not only has strong bipartisan support, but also bicameral support. In March, the House passed Neal-Brady legislation, Securing a Strong Retirement Act, by a vote of 414-5 – which has significant overlap with the Cardin-Portman bill. “Today’s unanimous committee vote is another important step in strengthening Americans’ retirement security. At a time when bipartisanship is hard to come by, I am grateful the Senate Finance Committee voted unanimously to make it easier for Americans to save for their retirement.,” said Senator Portman. “As the economy deals with the effects of the worst inflation in nearly 40 years, working families need all the help they can get when it comes to saving for the next chapter in their lives and Congress is one step closer to making that possible after today. I would like to thank Senator Ben Cardin for his long-time partnership in this effort and look forward to working with him and all my colleagues to ensure that this legislation is signed into law by the end of the year.”On Fox News, Portman Discusses Retirement Legislation, Expanding American Energy Production, and Bipartisan Safer Communities ActThis afternoon, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) joined Fox News’ Your World with Neil Cavuto to discuss the Biden administration’s call the suspend the federal gas tax and the bipartisan gun safety legislation, the Safer Communities Act. Senator Portman explained that the Safer Communities Act does not affect anyone who is a law-abiding citizen and protects the Second Amendment while providing more funding for mental health and community intervention programs. Portman was one of the original ten Republicans to support the original framework for this bill and will support its final passage when it comes to the Senate floor. Senator Portman also noted his bipartisan legislation that unanimously passed out of the Senate Finance Committee that would allow Americans to save more for retirement, help small businesses offer retirement plans, expand access for low-income Americans, and provide more certainty and flexibility during Americans’ retirement years.A video can be found here. Thursday, June 23, 2022 Portman Co-Chairs Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, Presses State Department Energy Nominee on Russian Energy  This afternoon, U.S. Senator Rob Portman questioned The Honorable Geoffrey Pyatt, nominee to be the Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources, on the importance of countering Russian malign influence in Europe by promoting European energy security and independence. Senator Portman questioned Ambassador Pyatt on the Biden Administration’s refusal to sanction the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, as well as its recent decision to continue allowing U.S. financial institutions to process purchases of Russian energy. He also discussed the need for the United States to focus its energy policy on domestic production, instead of relying on foreign nations, like Venezuela, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. A video of Senator Portman’s opening remarks can be found here and a video of Senator Portman’s questioning can be found here.Portman Backs Bipartisan Legislation to Improve School Safety, Expand Mental Health Resources, Reduce the Threat of Gun ViolenceU.S. Senator Rob Portman released the following statement after voting for the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act:“The Safer Communities Act takes common-sense steps to improve access to mental health, protect America’s children, improve school safety, and reduce the threat of gun violence across our country while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners. The bill will provide additional resources to make our schools and communities safer and address mental health issues that are the root cause of many of the shootings in our country. Today’s Senate action is further proof that both parties can work together to make progress on difficult issues.The bipartisan legislation includes:Investment in Children and Family Mental Health ServicesFunding for School-Based Mental Health and Supportive ServicesFunding for School Safety ResourcesTelehealth InvestmentsPenalties for Straw PurchasingProtections for Victims of Domestic ViolenceClarification of Definition of Federally Licensed Firearms DealerSupport for State Crisis Intervention OrdersUnder 21 Enhanced Review ProcessFriday, June 24, 2022Portman Statement on Supreme Court Decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) issued the following statement after the Supreme Court released its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization:“Today’s ruling is consistent with my view that policy questions regarding abortion should be decided by the elected representatives of the people, not the Supreme Court. Through its ruling today, the Court made this clear. The states already play a significant role in abortion policy, but have been constrained by various Supreme Court rulings. Now the issue of abortion will be decided by the states and the elected representatives closest to the people.“While abortion is a very sensitive and emotional issue with strong feelings on both sides, I think most Americans agree that human life is precious and should be protected wherever possible. To that end, we should do more to work together in a bipartisan manner to promote adoption, reduce the number of abortions, and provide support for pregnant women in difficult circumstances.” ###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-co-chairs-senate-foreign-relations-committee-hearing-presses-state,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – This afternoon, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) questioned The Honorable Geoffrey Pyatt, nominee to be the Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources, on the importance of countering Russian malign influence in Europe by promoting European energy security and independence. Senator Portman questioned Ambassador Pyatt on the Biden Administration’s refusal to sanction the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, as well as its recent decision to continue allowing U.S. financial institutions to process purchases of Russian energy. He also discussed the need for the United States to focus its energy policy on domestic production, instead of relying on foreign nations, like Venezuela, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. A transcript of Senator Portman’s opening statement and questioning can be found below. A video of Senator Portman’s opening remarks can be found here and a video of Senator Portman’s questioning can be found here.   Opening Statement: “Thank you, Sen. Markey, and thank you for your perfect timing. I apologize for being a couple of minutes late, we are all juggling all of our commitments this morning but I’m delighted to be here and to be with these nominees. Thank you all for being willing to serve our country. We were just told by Sen. Markey some about your background so I won’t go into that except to say that all of you are looking to join the ranks of some very important responsibilities. Elizabeth Shortino to be at IMF, I look forward to talking to you about that, Ambassador David Pressman for US Ambassador to Hungary, Jeff Pyatt who I got to know when he was Ambassador in Ukraine to be Assistant Secretary of State for energy resources, and Ambassador Robert Wood at the UN. This is a critical time, I guess we always say that in global affairs, but I think it’s not an overstatement to say that right now it is particularly difficult because it is a time of great instability which requires US leadership, in my view, on the world stage so the positions you have been nominated to are all very important and maybe now more than ever.“Ambassador Pyatt, energy security, as you know, is of critical importance as Russia continues to wage this war against Ukraine. $870 million a day is about what the Europeans are sending to Russia to help fund the war machine, and we need to see a change there and we are seeing it slowly, more quickly if the United States has an even stronger leadership role. Unfortunately, it took us a while to work with the EU to get them to make any moves but they have embargoed Russian coal now which will take effect in mid-August as you know, and then they are phasing into some embargo on Russian oil. I’d like to hear from you today of course about how we can be more helpful to accelerate Europe’s independence from Russia. Strong concerns with our energy policies here at home because I don’t think they are helping right now, and we need to do what we can to increase production in this country rather than rely on Venezuela’s and Saudi Arabia’s even and certainly the Iranian sources to backfill our own energy needs. “Ambassador Pressman, Hungary has found itself in the middle of these conversations about European energy security and energy independence from Russia. They were a particularly difficult partner to deal with during Europe’s attempts to agree to ban Russian oil, in fact, the compromise was required because of them. I have concerns with the influence of Russia and China in Hungary and would like to hear from you today about the dynamic and ways in which the United States can work to counter this and the ways in which you personally would work to do so.“Ambassador Wood, no shortage of global issues before the security council, as it was noted Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, the global food and energy crisis, and multiple humanitarian disasters, if confirmed your plate will be full, so I want to talk to you about what your priorities will be at the UN if confirmed and how you plan to work with our partners and allies there to pursue those priorities. And we do have a lot of allies and it turns out that Vladimir Putin’s brutal and unwarranted attack on Ukraine has strengthened some of those alliances. I know that the NATO meeting coming up will have the heads of state from countries like South Korea and Japan and Australia and New Zealand attending. So, although they are not expanding NATO, they are in fact expanding its reach by allying with us so closely. “Ms. Shortino, inflation and energy prices continue to climb upwards. Of course, this is impacting us here and at home but also impacting emerging developing counties around the world and to compound that of course we have a sovereign country Ukraine which needs to be rebuilt. I’m interested, really interested in talking to you about that, I think that IMF can play a central role, following on the $40 billion package that Sen. Markey and I supported to help Ukraine. I would hope the IMF can play a bigger role going forward to help Ukraine get back on its feet. I would like to thank you all for being here again and again for stepping forward to serve your country and look forward to hearing from you.”***Questioning: Senator Portman: “Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ll take that promotion. So, I mentioned earlier that I had the opportunity to with you, Ambassador Pyatt, in your role in Ukraine. I thought you did a very good job there and particularly, you know, advocating a stronger position vis-à-vis Russia. And, I am glad that you are stepping up to do this. I’m going to put you on the spot here though a little bit. You said ‘I’ve seen how Russia weaponized energy. We need to free Europeans of malign actors like Russia.’ That’s good. I just wonder if we are doing that. And, I think about Nord Stream 2 – what we did there.  I mean, what this administration thought, as I understand it, is that if they approved Nord Stream 2, which proves the previous administration had disapproved that somehow that would make Russia a better partner. What do you think about that? Do you think it made Russia a better partner?”The Honorable Geoffrey R. Pyatt: “So, Senator, let me start by saying thank you to you and all the members of the committee for the tremendous support that I enjoyed as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. It made an extraordinary difference in the effectiveness of our diplomacy and our effort to support the choices of the Ukrainian people. On the question of energy, I’ll say a couple of quick things. First, Nord Stream 2 was a bad deal. I wish it didn’t take this brutal war to make the rest of the world understand that so clearly.”  Senator Portman: “I have only got a few minutes here, but not just the rest of the world. What I am asking you really is what lessons did you learn from that and what did the United States learn from it because I think we made a mistake. I mean some people say it gave Putin a green light; I don’t go that far. I think he was seeing a green light everywhere he looked, but that was one of the reasons, I think, he decided well, this is an indication, you know, that Europe and the United States are not going to stand up to me because I have weaponized energy effectively, they have even now approved Nord Stream 2 to make them more dependent on Russian oil. Is that the lesson you get from it?”The Honorable Geoffrey R. Pyatt: “So Senator, I would say Russia’s manipulation continues today – you see it in the reduction of energy supplies.”Senator Portman: “40 percent reduction, of Nord Stream 2. Let me ask you that, I see you’re not going to answer my question directly. But do you think we should do something about Nord Stream 1?”The Honorable Geoffrey R. Pyatt: “I think we need to make sure that we do everything possible to ensure that people in Europe and everywhere else remember the way they felt on the 25th of February. That is to make sure that we make sure that nobody ever again says that Russia can be a reliable energy supplier. That we do everything possible to reduce Russian revenues from oil and gas while also avoiding further disruption of a highly disrupted global energy marketplace.”Senator Portman: “Let me just suggest that we are doing the opposite in some regards, not in regard to Nord Stream 2 anymore, although we did, thanks to the Germans finally deciding rightly so that’s not the issue, but last week the Biden administration Treasury Department announced an extension of HC licenses through December 5th. This is allowing energy transactions to continue to be exempted from sanctions. It otherwise would have ended tomorrow, June 24th. We extended that license, so these Russian banks are now able to transact energy deals and support again, the continued reliance on Russian energy. I pushed Treasury on this and was told the decision was made based on Europe’s phased-in of the energy embargo – the oil embargo in particular. And again, $870 million a day. That’s what I am told is the average daily receipts that Russia is receiving, with a nice margin. And, that is one reason you see the Ruble gaining strength. That’s why you see the Russian economy not being nearly as debilitated as the Ukrainian economy. And, you know frankly, they are not feeling the pressure. So, what do you think about that? Should that license have been renewed that was set to expire tomorrow?”The Honorable Geoffrey R. Pyatt: “So, Senator, I wasn’t part of those policy deliberations. I don’t have the benefit of all the perspectives so I can’t address that. What I will say is that it is very clear to me that we are in the early stages of this campaign and that if you look at what’s happened in the Russian oil and gas industry – the gradual European phaseout, the European decision on insurance for sea-born  Russian oil, the disengagement of international companies from the Russian oil and gas industry which is taking away technology and will inevitably damage Russia’s ability to produce oil and gas. All of these things will raise the cost for Vladimir Putin of the outrageous events that have unfolded since the 24th of February.”Senator Portman: “Well as you know I think we should be more aggressive and I hope we will be. And despite all the things you are saying, they are doing just fine. It’s not just China and India that is providing all these resources to fund the war machine; it’s our allies in Europe and elsewhere.  So, I have lots more questions about Hungary and about the IMF. Hopefully, we have a second round. And, again I’m glad that you’re stepping up. I hope you will be as aggressive as I saw you in Ukraine where you actually helped push the administration policy toward a more realistic view of Russia. I want to see the same thing with regard to your new role with regard to our energy crises we face. Thank you.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/portman-difference/fox-news-portman-discusses-retirement-legislation-expanding-american,"This afternoon, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) joined Fox News’ Your World with Neil Cavuto to discuss the Biden administration’s call the suspend the federal gas tax and the bipartisan gun safety legislation, the Safer Communities Act. Senator Portman explained that the Safer Communities Act does not affect anyone who is a law-abiding citizen and protects the Second Amendment while providing more funding for mental health and community intervention programs. Portman was one of the original ten Republicans to support the original framework for this bill and will support its final passage when it comes to the Senate floor. Senator Portman also noted his bipartisan legislation that unanimously passed out of the Senate Finance Committee that would allow Americans to save more for retirement, help small businesses offer retirement plans, expand access for low-income Americans, and provide more certainty and flexibility during Americans’ retirement years.A transcript of his remarks can be found below and a video can be found here.  PORTMAN ON THE GAS TAX HOLIDAY PROPOSED BY PRESIDENT BIDEN
“Well, Neil, it's not the solution obviously. It's about 3.6 percent of the cost of gas. We're all dying with high gas prices, people who are commuting, people who are on fixed income. I talked to a trucker over the weekend who is paying $1,500 to fill up his 18-wheeler. It's a really terrible punitive tax. Inflation generally is… But this is not going to solve the problem. “Well, I would take a look at it. But, you know, is the money going to come out of the Highway Trust Fund? In other words, fewer roads and bridges. Inflation is hitting there too, so we're having a tough time keeping up. You know, is it going to be for how long? So if it's 3.6 percent of the cost of gas that would help, but what would help a lot more if we had more production of gas and oil. Oil obviously is the biggest part of gasoline, next to refining. And then next would be state taxes, and then next federal taxes. So, let's get the production up. That's where the real opportunity us here. When this administration came in, as you know, they did everything possible to try to stifle the production of fossil fuels, including gas and oil. And that is now, unfortunately, beginning to cause big, big problems. That and increased demand that came out of the pandemic. So, that's the biggest thing to do, is to tell these companies, look, we're not going to undercut you, as we did with the Keystone XL pipeline – billions of dollars invested, ready to go, and the government just pulls it out.” PORTMAN ON BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SAYING THEY ARE NOT STANDING IN THE WAY OF GAS & OIL PRODUCTION“Well, first, I think you did a good job of countering that. I would say two things. One, yes they are because if you look at all the issues, particularly permitting issues, they're giving explicit instructions to the agencies with regard to so-called Waters of the United States, which is something that the oil and gas companies care a lot about. The permitting is very difficult. Second, they're sending every indication, including by saying no leasing production on federal lands or waters, which is in litigation now, and obviously stopping Keystone XL, also stopping pipelines around the country – look, if you make these investments, we may just pull the rug out from under you. So, it's difficult to get the American companies to make the investments we want them to make to be able to have these fossil fuels. 
“By the way, there will be a transition to a greener economy. There will be, but it's going to take time. You can't just immediately say we're going to stop fossil fuels and then have everybody’s costs skyrocket. It’s just terrible for working families in Ohio. So, yes, they have had a big impact on things.” PORTMAN ON BIPARTISAN SENATE GUN LEGISLATION“Well, we made a number of changes, as you know, John Cornyn taking the lead to address some of the concerns the NRA had, and that I had and others had. It actually includes a number of things they wanted, including saying, as an example, with regard to the records of juveniles that will now be provided, which, by the way, everybody thinks should be in these records, that there will be a sunset to that. With regard to the ‘so-called’ loophole right now for a boyfriend, if there's an assault, that person should be subjected.
“There's also an immediate reinstatement of a person's rights after five years, which is not in current law. There is actually some things they wanted that got in there that are pro-Second Amendment. Just in general, yeah, I think it will pass to answer your question. I think there will be more than 14. I don't know how many…15, 16, 17 senators will probably support it in the end, because it's common sense stuff. The biggest part of it, obviously, is mental health, which is what all of us have been saying on the Republican side for a long time, is when you actually look at what's happening here, and unfortunately almost every single one of these cases, certainly the mass shootings, these horrific mass shootings at the schools, it's a mental health issue, that this person is mentally ill, not getting the support that he needs because it's usually a young male. That's huge in this legislation. That's the biggest part of it by far. Second is school safety. There, I think there's a real agreement among Republicans. Then on this notion of ensuring that a juvenile's records are looked at, I think most Republicans are strongly in support of that. You know, if you have, as was the case in the Texas situation, a juvenile record, so a criminal record in essence, a juvenile record, that is sealed or expunged, that obviously should be taken into account when somebody is 18, 19, 20 years old.“No, that's not part of it. There's nothing like that in here. In fact, there are a whole slew of things, about 20 things, that they asked for immediately, none of which are in here. But, this will help I think. Because of the mental health reality of the situation, because of the school safety issue, which is real, and also because of, you know, guns getting in the hands of dangerous people that nobody would want, and having that information in the national background check system, I think it's really common sense legislation. I do think it will pass pretty easily. The question is, will all Democrats support it? They want it to go further. The House wants to go further. I hope they realize that although this isn't what they want that will be helpful to avoid further tragic instances like we just saw in Uvalde, Texas.”PORTMAN ON HIS RETIREMENT SAVINGS LEGISLATION
“Well, as I said earlier, the most punitive taxes. One of the things that's happened because of the pandemic, and because of inflation, is people have less disposable income because it's all going to pay for gas, and pay for groceries, and to pay for clothes. They aren't saving like they should be. We happen to have a bipartisan, bicameral, a very middle ground, I think, a very positive bill, that helps people save more in their 401(k), save more in their IRA, get more small businesses to get engaged in offering a plan. Only about half of them do. So everybody has a chance to get money into retirement so that they can have a retirement nest egg where they can have some peace of mind in retirement. Today we passed it out of committee, it's going to the floor, and it's great stuff. I also enjoyed Jay Powell’s comments today in committee, where he said ‘yes, this inflation started long before the invasion of Ukraine’, which is absolutely true.”  ###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senators-portman-and-cardin-hail-unanimous-senate-finance-committee-passage,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Ben Cardin (D-MD) hailed the unanimous passage of their bipartisan retirement security legislation, S. 1770, the Retirement Security and Savings Act, in the Senate Finance Committee. The legislation, which passed 28-0, would allow people to save more for retirement, help small businesses offer retirement plans, expand access for low-income Americans, and provide more certainty and flexibility during Americans’ retirement years, ensuring the opportunity for all to have a dignity in their retirement years. This legislation is the senators’ fourth and final retirement savings legislation introduced together. The Cardin-Portman legislation not only has strong bipartisan support, but also bicameral support.  In March, the House passed Neal-Brady legislation, Securing a Strong Retirement Act, by a vote of 414-5 – which has significant overlap with the Cardin-Portman bill. “Today’s unanimous committee vote is another important step in strengthening Americans’ retirement security. At a time when bipartisanship is hard to come by, I am grateful the Senate Finance Committee voted unanimously to make it easier for Americans to save for their retirement.,” said Senator Portman. “As the economy deals with the effects of the worst inflation in nearly 40 years, working families need all the help they can get when it comes to saving for the next chapter in their lives and Congress is one step closer to making that possible after today. I would like to thank Senator Ben Cardin for his long-time partnership in this effort and look forward to working with him and all my colleagues to ensure that this legislation is signed into law by the end of the year.”“Helping more Americans save for retirement is a bipartisan effort. I’m proud of the unanimous vote today for this important legislation that builds on the Retirement Security and Savings Act authored by Senator Rob Portman and I. By working together and engaging our colleagues and a wide range of stakeholders, we have a stronger bill today that we hope will be on a fastrack to the president’s desk for signature into law,” said Senator Cardin. “For 30 years, I have worked across the aisle with Rob Portman on retirement security issues. We’ve made real progress over the years, but we have a long way to go to increase the pension and savings rate for Americans and increase opportunities for more Americans to access the retirement system, particularly for lower-wage workers, workers at small businesses and women. We want more Americans engaged in saving for their future and this legislation strengthens and expands the tools available to reach that goal.”    ###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-durbin-meet-us-ambassador-ukraine-bridget-brink,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Dick Durbin (D-IL), Co-Chairs of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, met with U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink to discuss the latest events regarding Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. They also discussed how the Senate can continue to better support our ally through military, economic, and humanitarian assistance.“Russia has brought horrible destruction and devastation to Ukraine, but so many Ukrainians are fighting valiantly. It was great to meet with Ambassador Brink and Senator Durbin today to hear about what she is seeing on the ground and how we can better assist our diplomats in-country and Ukrainians defending their homeland,” said Portman. “Ambassador Brink’s presence in Ukraine is vital to working closely with our allies and partners in Ukraine and in the region, and to ensure effective oversight of the significant military, economic and humanitarian assistance that the United States is providing to Ukraine. I am thankful that we were able to move her nomination through the Senate rapidly so that she could start her important work expeditiously.”“As Putin’s military continues to attack, innocent Ukrainians are forced to flee and fear for their safety. In speaking with Ambassador Brink, we agreed that we need continued U.S. and NATO support to provide equipment, tighten economic pressure on Putin and his cronies, and welcome Ukrainian refugees into the U.S.,” said Durbin. “Ambassador Brink has a deep understanding of the region and received unanimous support from the Senate. I look forward to our many future discussions.”Yesterday, Senators Portman and Durbin, along with U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA), sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin urging him to send more advanced artillery rocket systems and ammunition to Ukraine, as the systems are vital in Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s brutal invasion. The Senators commended the decision by the Biden Administration earlier this month to send M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) to Ukraine and urged the Administration to send additional such aid given the amount of artillery Russia has at their disposal. The Senators called on Secretary Austin to send additional systems urgently, like HIMARS or the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), in order to level the playing field for Ukraine and allow them to halt Russian advances in the Donbas region and strengthen their counteroffensives in other parts of the country.###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-delivers-opening-remarks-senate-finance-committee-mark-consider,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) delivered the following opening remarks at a Senate Finance Committee markup of bipartisan retirement security legislation he authored with Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD). The Cardin-Portman legislation, Retirement Security and Savings Act (S.1770), would allow people to save more for retirement, help small businesses offer retirement plans, expand access for low-income Americans, and provide more certainty and flexibility during Americans’ retirement years, ensuring the opportunity for all to have a dignity in their retirement years. This is the senators’ fourth and final retirement savings legislation introduced together. Senator Portman pointed out that not only does the Cardin-Portman legislation have strong bipartisan support, but also bicameral support. In March, the House passed Neal-Brady legislation, Securing a Strong Retirement Act, by a vote of 414-5 – which has significant overlap with the Cardin-Portman bill. A transcript of Senator Portman’s opening statement can be found below and the video can be found here.“Well first, thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Crapo for both your willingness to work with Senator Cardin and myself to make this project possible, the next big step in retirement security and for your very helpful contributions to this effort. We wouldn’t be here without that. So many of our constituents are really concerned about their retirement. They just don’t see how they’re going to be able to make ends meet in retirement, and they’re right. The pandemic has made it a lot worse, people have not been able to save what they had hoped to be able to do, particularly lower-income Americans. And, rampant inflation now is making everything more expensive. I talked to some folks over the weekend who say, one guy said, ‘I used to put 20 percent away for my retirement, I can’t do that anymore because of the cost of gas and food.’ So, it’s tougher to save. So, in my view, this mark-up to help people be able to do that, save for their retirement, is particularly timely. “Throughout my 24 years in Congress, dating myself, I’ve had an amazing partner on retirement security, and other issues, in Senator Ben Cardin, who spoke earlier. Together, we have enacted three significant retirement bills that were actually quite effective at helping to address the challenges in our retirement system, increasing peoples’ peace of mind in retirement. Since 2001, when we were both in the House and enacted our first bill to expand retirement savings, expanding 401Ks and IRAs and so on, retirement savings have increased by about 150 percent – from $11 trillion to about $28 trillion. Our work together has helped make that possible, and Ben it’s been great working with you.“But there’s much more to do. As we look at this fourth and final Cardin-Portman bill, once again I see an opportunity to pass something that is sensible, middle ground, and bipartisan that can address the challenges we face today.“We spent four years working on this one. We have talked to a lot of people on the outside – think tanks, providers, other stakeholders. We have focused on what are the impediments to expanding retirement savings, so working with people who tell us what the problems are and give us the data.“This legislation is about developing new policies to address those specific concerns. First, helping more low-income and part-time workers save for retirement. Why is that important? Only about 22 percent of part-time workers as an example, about 23 percent of low-income workers, defined as 25 percent quartile and below, have any retirement plan. They aren’t engaged in a retirement plan and that’s a real issue for our country. “Second, we have incentivized small businesses to get more engaged in plans. We’ve worked on that over the years, we’ve had some success. But, honestly, only 28 percent of businesses with fewer than 10 workers have a plan. We have to face that. Large businesses, by the way, pretty much all have good plans. They may not be great plans, but they’re good plans, they’re solid plans, whereas small business, for the most part, do not. So that’s why that’s so important. “Third, encouraging baby boomers near retirement to accelerate their savings. There’s a lot of data out there on this, but, frankly, the baby boom generation, the generation of most of us around this table, just has not saved for their retirement adequately to the point that almost half of baby boomers have no net savings at all, much less retirement savings. So that’s why we do more to accelerate savings in these later years. “And then, the fourth one we learned about over the years, is that as people are living longer and healthier lives, retirement savings don’t keep up so they outlive their retirement savings. So, that’s why we are helping, in this legislation, to ensure that those who have already retired have the savings they need to be able to live comfortably. “So again, thanks to the Chair and Ranking Member for making the bill that Senator Cardin and I worked on the base vehicle for today’s markup, and thanks to all of my colleagues, because the proposals that are either part of the bill, I know for instance Senator Lankford has one in the bill, Senator Daines and others are going to add things to the bill, these all make the bill better and I appreciate their hard work on this.“This bill is not just bipartisan, by the way, it is bicameral, which is a rare experience around here. In fact, 26 of the Cardin-Portman provisions were included in H.R. 2954, Securing a Strong Retirement Act, legislation introduced by the Chairman of the Ways & Means Committee, Richard Neal, and the Ranking Member, Kevin Brady. This bill has passed the House with a lot of momentum. It passed unanimously out of the House committee and then the full House approved it with a vote of 414-to-5. So, this is very bicameral and my hope is we can quickly work together to finalize a product.“Last week, we saw the Senate HELP Committee pass its own retirement package by voice vote. It included nine of the Cardin-Portman provisions and I appreciate the fact that they’ve worked so closely with us. I’m looking forward to moving this package forward today, with a goal of then working with our House colleagues on a final House-Senate agreed-upon product and getting it signed into law before the Congress adjourns and I adjourn my career here in the United States Congress. Thanks again, Mr. Chairman.”###

https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-coons-introduce-legislation-advance-trade-negotiations-united,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Chris Coons (D-DE), co-founders and co-chairs of the Senate UK Trade Caucus, today introduced the Securing Privileged Economic, Commercial, Investment, And Legal Rights to Ensure Longstanding Atlantic Trade and Investment Opportunities and Nurture Security, Happiness, Innovation, and Prosperity Act, or the SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP Act. The new legislation would give the president five years to take advantage of “fast-track” authority, and secure an up-or-down vote in Congress on any comprehensive trade agreement negotiated with the United Kingdom.“As one of our oldest trading partners, resuming trade talks with the United Kingdom is a no brainer. We are close allies and trading partners and a trade agreement would strengthen our relationship and economic competitiveness, especially with respect to non-market economies,” said Senator Portman.  “We need to get back into the business of expanding trading relationships around the world so we can export more American-made products and create jobs here at home.  Reaching a bilateral trade agreement with the United Kingdom will benefit U.S. workers and businesses and strengthen the economic and security ties between our two countries.”“The United Kingdom is one of our oldest trading partners and strongest allies. Negotiating a robust, comprehensive free trade agreement with the UK is in the interest of Delaware workers, businesses, and consumers,” said Senator Coons. “The Biden administration has advanced our engagement through the U.S.-UK Dialogue on the Future of Atlantic Trade, and by passing this bill Congress can demonstrate bipartisan support for a new trade deal that  includes ambitious international standards for our shared priorities on climate, labor protections, digital trade, and intellectual property rights.” The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which passed the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support in 2020, set high standards in areas of labor rights, environmental protection, digital trade, and intellectual property rights, and the SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP Act encourages the executive branch to build on those standards in negotiations with the UK. As the bill notes, the robust labor and environmental protections enforced in both countries would reduce the risk of businesses offshoring operations to take advantage of laxer regulations and ensure that U.S. workers and companies can compete on a level playing field.While the UK government has recently moved to override the Northern Ireland Protocol, which sets the post-Brexit trade rules in Northern Ireland, the SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP Act emphasizes that any U.S.-UK trade agreement must uphold peace and stability in Ireland and Northern Ireland. ###
