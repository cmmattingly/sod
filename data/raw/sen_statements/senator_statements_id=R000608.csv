https://www.rosen.senate.gov/2022/09/23/rosen-young-lead-bipartisan-bicameral-bill-to-hold-russia-accountable-for-human-rights-abuses-against-ukraine/,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is joining Senator Todd Young (R-IN) and Representatives Jimmy Panetta (D-CA) and Pat Fallon (R-TX) in leading the bipartisan, bicameral Ukraine Human Rights Policy Act, which would put in place a robust mechanism to hold Russia accountable for the human rights abuses and crimes it has committed against the people of Ukraine, which includes the mass grave of over 400 bodies recently discovered in Izium, Ukraine.“The horrific atrocities committed by Russia in Ukraine – including the recent discovery of mass graves filled with innocent Ukrainian men, women, and children – cannot go unanswered,” said Senator Rosen. “As we continue to stand with Ukraine in pursuing justice for these crimes, I’m helping introduce bipartisan legislation to hold Russia accountable for its human rights abuses, and I thank Senator Young and Representatives Panetta and Fallon for their partnership on this bill.”“I have met with the spouses and mothers of Ukrainian soldiers currently imprisoned by Russian thugs who have no idea if their loved ones are alive or dead. I have met with Ukrainians who have suffered in unspeakable ways going back to Russia’s first invasion of Crimea in 2014,” said Senator Young. “Russia’s egregious human rights abuses must be met with accountability, both today and in the future. By ensuring strong sanctions are placed on the Russian Federation, this bill marks a step toward justice for the thousands of Ukrainians suffering at the hands of Russia’s barbaric aggression in Ukraine. I’m proud to lead this bipartisan bill to hold Vladimir Putin accountable and urge its passage by Congress.”“As Russia continues its ruthless and remorseless attack on Ukraine, the Ukrainian people are experiencing, and the world is witnessing human rights atrocities,” said Congressman Panetta. “By expanding the authority to apply sanctions against Russia, our Ukraine Human Rights Policy Act is a device to hold Russia accountable for its heinous acts and a deterrent against further crimes against humanity. This bipartisan legislation is consonant with the United States leadership on assisting Ukraine and countering Russia and consistent with our values as the world’s leading democracy.“I could not think of a more fitting bill to introduce with my House and Senate colleagues following the UN Security Council Meeting and the horrific mass graves uncovered in Izyum. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine reflects Vladimir Putin’s complete disregard for human life,” said Congressman Fallon. “Reports indicate that Vladimir Putin’s war machine is responsible for the forced relocation of over 1 million Ukrainian citizens and almost 15,000 civilian casualties. It’s barbarism such as this that has led my colleagues and I to this legislation. Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation deserve to be held accountable for every atrocity that they have committed. The Ukraine Human Rights Policy Act of 2022 provides the United States more tools to accomplish this very goal. The world must ensure justice for every man, woman, and child of Ukraine.”“This bipartisan legislation provides a critical pathway for Congress to provide much-needed oversight of the administration’s efforts to hold Russian human rights violations in Ukraine and elsewhere accountable,” said the Foundation for Defense of Democracies Action.The Ukraine Human Rights Policy Act of 2022 specifically:###"

Yucca Mountain does not have that kind of consensus, and Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto have continually pushed for legislation to provide state, local, and Tribal governments with a central role in decisions regarding the placement of a permanent repository and storage program.“We appreciate that the Biden Administration also opposes the use of Yucca Mountain for the storage of nuclear waste, and we appreciate your prior commitment to a consent-based siting process…,” the Senators continued. “Further, we acknowledge the need to explore and invest in innovative solutions for nuclear waste disposal and will continue to work with you and our Congressional colleagues to find viable and sustainable solutions to dispose of our nation’s high-level nuclear waste. However, Yucca Mountain is not the answer. We believe this is a pivotal step for the Department and request that it continue its commitment to implement the consent-based recommendations made by the Blue Ribbon Commission.”The full text of the letter can be found here.Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto have both fought to ensure Yucca Mountain remains dead. They’ve pushed for a consent-based approach and introduced the Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act to provide state, local, and Tribal governments with a central role in decisions regarding a permanent repository and storage program. The Senators have also successfully fought the Trump administration’s efforts to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process, preventing funds from being included for the failed site in every final appropriations bill. Moreover, Energy Secretary Granholm has repeatedly acknowledged that Yucca Mountain is an unworkable site and expressed her support for a consent-based approach to store the nation’s nuclear waste. ###"

Members of the military, veterans and civilians who have served at military installations and/or live in the surrounding communities found to have been contaminated with PFAS face health risks related to exposure to PFAS chemicals, as these materials are found in AFFF, in personal protective equipment used by firefighters and in standard consumer products,” wrote the Senators. In Nevada, high levels of PFAS contamination have been found at Creech and Nellis Air Force Bases. Senator Rosen has been a leader in the fight against PFAS exposure at military operations. Last year, she questioned officials from the Department of Defense and Environmental Protection Agency about PFAS contamination on military bases in Nevada. And her bipartisan legislation to address PFAS on military bases was signed into law last year as part of the FY22 National Defense Authorization Act.“Our service members, military families, veterans and defense communities deserve the Department’s full attention to appropriately address the scope and severity of PFAS contamination. We ask you to honor that responsibility and take the steps necessary to prioritize this hazard impacting our communities,” the senators concluded. The senators’ letter can be read in full here.###"

This nationwide abortion ban would override Nevada law protecting abortion rights. In 1990, Nevada voters passed a statewide referendum with nearly two-thirds support codifying state law protecting abortion rights.Senator Rosen has been a leader in the fight against Republican attempts to ban abortions and restrict women’s reproductive rights. She helped introduce the Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act to protect doctors in pro-choice states like Nevada from prosecution by anti-choice states. Senator Rosen also helped introduce and voted to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard against dangerous abortion bans and restrictions. Watch Senator Rosen’s full remarks here.Below are Senator Rosen’s floor remarks as delivered: Mr. President,In the months since the conservative majority on the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, the assault on reproductive rights by anti-choice, MAGA Republicans has been relentless.Anti-choice states across the country have already enacted strict and rigid abortion bans that strip our rights away, threaten to jail women and their doctors, and put womens’ health at risk.And, just as we have always known, this threat is not just at the state level.Last week, legislation was introduced in this very chamber to enact a national abortion ban, one that would strip women of the fundamental right to control their own bodies. This abortion ban – and that’s exactly what it is, a nationwide abortion ban – poses a real serious and very real threat to the rights of women across this country.This is a dangerous nationwide government mandate that would threaten women, would threaten their doctors, and threaten them with jail time including those in my state of Nevada.Pro-choice states like Nevada, where the people voted overwhelmingly to protect reproductive freedoms as part of state law, would be forced, forced to abide by this federal mandate.Because federal law supersedes state law, this legislation would override the will of Nevadans and the freedom, the freedom that they’ve had for decades.If anti-choice Republicans in Congress have their way and their national abortion ban passes then listen to this: Nevada doctors could be prosecuted; Nevada women could be jailed; and Nevada women could die as a result of the lack of access to care.So, let’s be clear — the only thing standing in the way of their national abortion ban is the pro-choice majority in the Senate.And I will do everything I can to fight this legislation threatening our reproductive rights, not just in Nevada but across the country.That’s why I helped introduce the Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Healthcare Act along with Senators Murray, Padilla, and Presiding Officer, Mr. President, Senator Lujan to protect doctors in states like Nevada, where abortion remains legal, from facing, from facing prosecution and potentially jail by anti-choice states. No doctor – I’m going to repeat this – no doctor should ever be jailed for providing women with the reproductive, and often life-saving care they need, wherever these women are from. No doctor should ever be jailed for providing care. Anti-choice Republicans in the Senate have blocked these efforts in the past as they continue to push for dangerous bans. Today, today, we have another opportunity to protect doctors and their patients by passing this legislation without obstruction or delay. Because, let’s be clear, we will, we will not give up.  We will not allow a national abortion ban to pass the Senate.  We will not allow doctors to face prosecution for doing their jobs. And we must protect a woman’s right to choose and continue fighting against this ban every step of the way. Thank you. ###"

This funding, administered by the U.S. Department of the Interior, will support fuel management projects in Nevada on 14,655 acres of land across the state.“Every year, wildfires pose a serious and immediate threat to the safety and health of Nevadans,” said Senator Rosen. “I’ve been working to ensure that Nevada, our firefighters, and our land managers have all of the resources and tools needed to fight these wildland fires and protect our communities. As one of the co-authors of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, I’m proud to announce that our landmark legislation will invest more than $5.9 million in Nevada for wildfire resiliency to help reduce the risk and impact of these wildfires.”“I secured historic funding levels in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help reduce wildfire risk, expand fuels management projects, and support firefighters across the state,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “Now, Nevada is set to receive almost $ 6 million of this funding, which will go a long way toward keeping our communities safe and resilient.”The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which both Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto helped pass, included $1.5 billion for the Department of the Interior to support wildfire risk reduction over the next 5 years. Both senators also helped secure over $8 billion for wildfire prevention, suppression, and restoration activities in the bipartisan infrastructure bill, including $10 million for wildfire detection equipment. Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto have also prioritized efforts to provide federal agencies with the resources they need to hire and retain vital firefighters year-round.###"
https://www.rosen.senate.gov/2022/09/20/as-russian-attacks-threaten-ukrainian-nuclear-plants-rosen-asks-experts-on-efforts-to-prevent-nuclear-disaster/,"Watch Video of Senator Rosen’s Remarks HEREWASHINGTON, DC – Today, as threats of Russian attacks on Ukrainian nuclear power plants increase, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) asked former top defense and nuclear security officials during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing about multinational efforts to prevent a nuclear disaster. Earlier this month, Russian shelling near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine led the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect the site. In case of an incident at a Ukrainian nuclear plant, Nevada’s Nellis Air Force Base is one of two bases that house the Remote Sensing Laboratory that provides a radiological emergency response team to deploy anywhere in the world. This personnel, and those of the Nevada National Security Site, are the nation’s experts in nuclear forensics and detecting and locating sources of radiation.During the hearing, Senator Rosen questioned former National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Deputy Administrator Madelyn Creedon about these efforts. Senator Rosen recently met with NNSA officials about the Remote Sensing Laboratory and the radiological sensors the United States has provided Ukraine to help detect a potential nuclear incident in the wake of Russia’s unprovoked invasion.BELOW IS A TRANSCRIPT OF THE EXCHANGE:SENATOR ROSEN: Ms. Creedon, from your time at NNSA and [the Department of Defense], can you speak to the interagency and multinational effort that is occurring to prevent a nuclear disaster from happening in Ukraine?MADELYN CREEDON: As you’ve noted, the Remote Sensing Lab is an incredibly capable lab. It works in a much larger system of laboratories at the Department of Energy and the NNSA, as well as with cooperation from the State Department and [the Department of Defense] to put together and develop the research – do the deployment, do the acquisition of a whole suite of sensors for radiation detection on the ground, on personnel, we have ready radiation detectors in space. But it’s essential that we understand what’s going on there from a public health perspective if the Russians, as Rose [Gottemoeller] mentioned earlier, do something really awful at these two sites, including the second one that they’ve now shot at.###"

The state of Nevada has also launched a new website featuring information on the technical and environmental issues that make Yucca Mountain an unsuitable repository site.The motion is being filed before the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). It asks the NRC to resume the adjudicatory portion of the licensing procedures so that Nevada may take specific additional steps aimed at stopping the project.“For years, I have been fighting alongside our delegation to prevent Nevada from ever becoming the nation’s dumping ground for nuclear waste because it threatens our state’s security, economy, and public health,” said Senator Rosen. “That’s why I’m strongly supporting Nevada’s actions to finally put an end to Yucca Mountain, taking steps that would block future misguided efforts to try to revive this ill-conceived project against our state’s consent.”“I’ve opposed every attempt to revive the failed Yucca Mountain project, and it’s time we take this unsuitable site off the table once and for all,” said Senator Catherine Cortez Masto. “I support Nevada’s efforts to end the licensing process for Yucca Mountain, and I will continue to work with all stakeholders at the federal, state, local, and Tribal levels to find a safe, workable, and consent-based alternative.”“Nevada doesn’t use nuclear energy; we don’t produce nuclear waste; and we shouldn’t be required to store it,” said Congresswoman Dina Titus. “The State’s motion is a step in the right direction toward putting an end to Yucca Mountain once and for all. I will continue to lead the fight in opposition to this dangerous project to force a nuclear waste dumping ground on Nevada.”“The residents of Nevada do not want to be a part of a dangerous experiment. Yucca Mountain must not become a national dumping ground of hazardous waste,” said Congressman Steven Horsford. “It’s beyond time to end the debate on Yucca Mountain and protect the residents in my district and across the state.”“Year after year, we’ve had to fight to ensure that Nevada does not become our nation’s dumping ground for nuclear waste,” said Congresswoman Susie Lee. “I’m proud to sit on the Appropriations Committee’s Subcommittee on Energy and Water, where I’ve successfully blocked any funding going toward reviving Yucca Mountain, and I have worked with the Department of Energy to secure a commitment to finding consent-based alternatives to the proposed nuclear repository at Yucca Mountain. Now, it’s time to put an end to this failed project once and for all. That’s why I support the state of Nevada’s efforts to end the licensing for Yucca Mountain and to open the door to a productive consent-based solutions for nuclear waste storage.”“It is time to take the lessons learned from the Yucca Mountain experiment and chalk them up to experience,” Governor Sisolak said. “This is a fight that Nevada has battled since 1987. The past three Presidential Administrations have agreed that Yucca Mountain is unworkable. It is time for this Administration and the Department of Energy to follow through and support the case made by Nevada’s leaders, legislators, experts and legal team.”Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto, along with Representatives Titus, Horsford, and Lee, have all fought to ensure Yucca Mountain remains dead. They’ve re-introduced the Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act to provide state, local, and Tribal governments with a central role in decisions regarding a permanent repository and storage program. Energy Secretary Granholm has repeatedly acknowledged that Yucca Mountain is an unworkable site and expressed her support for a consent-based approach to store the nation’s nuclear waste. These Members of the Nevada delegation have also successfully fought the Trump administration’s efforts to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process, preventing funds from being included for the failed site in every final appropriations bill.###"

The resolution designated the week of September 12, 2022 as “National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week.” “Hispanic-Serving Institutions are critical in providing a quality education to Latino communities across the nation and Nevada,” said Senator Rosen. “This resolution recognizes the incredible work they do, and I will continue to fight to make sure the five HSIs and two emerging HSIs in Nevada have the resources needed to provide students with the education, tools, and skills to be successful.”“HACU joins the 559 Hispanic-Serving Institutions in the observance of HSI Week to celebrate the many accomplishments in Hispanic higher education. We are pleased that the U.S. Senate has adopted the bipartisan resolution in recognition of the important role HSIs play in improving access to education and grateful to the offices of Senators Menendez, Padilla, and Cornyn for, once again, leading this effort in the Senate,” said Antonio R. Flores, President and CEO of Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities. HSIs are defined as degree-granting institutions where total Hispanic enrollment constitutes no less than 25% of the total enrollment. Nevada is home to five  Hispanic-Serving Institutions, including: the College of Southern Nevada, Nevada State College, Truckee Meadows Community College, the University of Nevada Las Vegas, and Western Nevada College; and two emerging HSIs: the University of Nevada Reno and Great Basin College. They play a vital role in educating Latino youth and creating economic opportunities for the communities  in which these institutions are located.The full text of the resolution can be found here. ###"

Congress appropriated $14.55 million for the hiring of these child welfare professionals under the FY 2022 Consolidated Appropriations Act.“Migrant children arriving at the southwest border have frequently endured severe harm and trauma, coupled with unique vulnerabilities stemming from their age, developmental stage, and communication and comprehension capacity,” wrote the senators. “As you know, as part of the FY 2022 Consolidated Appropriations Act Congress provided $14.55 million to the DHS Office of the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to hire state-licensed child welfare professionals to provide services at facilities along the southwest border in coordination with CBP.”“We respectfully request that you update us regularly on your progress in fulfilling Congress’s intended use of these appropriated funds, and we stand ready to work with you in implementing this important initiative,” the senators continued.Senator Rosen has fought for years to ensure CBP facilities have child welfare professionals. Last year, during a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Rosen questioned Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas about conditions for children in CBP custody. In 2019, Senator Rosen sent a letter to Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf and CBP Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan calling on the Department to hire additional pediatricians and medical professionals to care for migrant children detained in U.S. custody. ###"
https://www.rosen.senate.gov/2022/09/15/rosen-abraham-accords-caucus-members-commemorate-two-year-anniversary-of-abraham-accords-signing/,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV), James Lankford (R-OK), Joni Ernst (R-IA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) honored the two-year anniversary of the historic signing of the Abraham Accords by introducing a bipartisan resolution to commemorate the historic moment on September 15, 2020, for the US, Israel, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates.“The historic Abraham Accords have transformed the Middle East – paving the way for unprecedented cooperation between Israel and Arab partners in energy and water security, cybersecurity, defense, and trade,” said Senator Rosen. “As we celebrate two years since this landmark agreement, I am proud to join my fellow Senate Abraham Accords Co-Chairs in introducing a bipartisan resolution to celebrate the Accords, call for their expansion and enhancement, and encourage other countries to normalize relations with Israel.”“Two years ago, I witnessed a historic moment among leaders from Israel, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates as President Trump held a White House signing of the once-thought-impossible Abraham Accords,” said Lankford. “Since then, we’ve added two other nations, Morocco and Sudan, to the Accords. As we build on that momentum together, we should remember that through reconciliation and common goals, even unlikely allies can find a way to come together. We continue to stand with Israel and should continue to lead in bringing nations together to further US national interests and the interests of our allies.”“Over the past two years, the Abraham Accords have promoted greater economic opportunity and security for Israel and the greater Middle East,” said Booker. “As co-chair of the Senate Abraham Accords Caucus, I remain committed to building on this achievement to bring new countries into the fold, foster meaningful people-to-people engagement, continue integrating the agreements within the region, including with Jordan, Egypt, and the Palestinians, and advance progress towards a negotiated two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”“The Abraham Accords was the most significant peace agreement of the 21st Century,” said Senator Ernst. “This bipartisan measure seeks to honor the monumental effort achieved by the Trump administration in bringing together our Arab allies and Israel to forge an unprecedented and lasting peace deal that has made America and the world more secure. As co-chair of the Senate Abraham Accords Caucus, I remain committed to expanding upon the Abraham Accords and defending America, and our allies, from Iranian aggression.” The Senators launched the Senate Abraham Accords Caucus in order to build on the success of the historic Abraham Accords. For decades, Congress has played a key role in promoting peace between Israel and its neighbors. The Caucus provides an opportunity to strengthen the Abraham Accords by encouraging partnerships among the existing Abraham Accords countries and expanding the agreement to include countries that do not currently have diplomatic relations with Israel.Earlier this year, the Senators introduced the DEFEND Act to establish an integrated air defense capability among Israel and Arab allies. The Senators also joined in a statement earlier this year following the signature into law of the Israel Relations Normalization Act, which builds on the success of the Abraham Accords by strengthening and expanding normalization and peace agreements between Israel and United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco, as well as previous agreements with Egypt and Jordan.###"

https://www.rosen.senate.gov/2022/09/15/rosen-boozman-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-create-a-national-advisory-commission-on-long-term-care-services%ef%bf%bc/,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a member of the Special Committee on Aging, introduced her bipartisan Supporting Our Seniors Act with Senator John Boozman (R-AR) to create a National Advisory Commission on long-term care services for seniors and individuals in need of care and long-term support. In 2013, the Commission on Long Term Care made a key recommendation to create a national advisory committee to continue and expand upon their work. This bipartisan legislation would create that commission to assess and provide regular reporting to Congress on service delivery, financing, workforce adequacy, and other issues to increase seniors’ access to affordable long-term care services.“Like so many Americans who have cared for loved ones, I know the importance of ensuring that our seniors have access to the care and support services they need to live their day-to-day lives,” said Senator Rosen. “This bipartisan legislation will create a commission to further examine challenges and needs in long-term care services, as well as provide specific recommendations, so that Congress can make informed decisions on behalf of our seniors and others in need of quality, affordable long-term support and care.”“As our population ages, the need for long-term care assistance will increase,” said Senator Boozman. “Establishing a national advisory commission will help us better prepare for future challenges including coordinating services, training a workforce to meet seniors’ and individuals’ with disabilities needs and providing information and options to empower them and their caregivers with the resources available. I’m pleased to join Senator Rosen in leading this initiative.”“The American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine is proud to offer its strong support for the Supporting Our Seniors Act, and we commend Sen. Rosen for her leadership in recognizing the importance of integrating palliative care to improve long-term care,” said Tara C. Friedman, MD, President of the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. “A growing number of older Americans are living with serious or complex chronic illnesses, creating significant caregiving responsibilities for families. Understanding and addressing their palliative care needs is critical to ensure that older adults and those with serious illness receive the care they want where they want to receive it.”“NHPCO and HAN are proud to endorse the Supporting Our Seniors Act which will establish a committee to foster bipartisan, transformative changes to better provide individuals with disabilities and seniors access to comprehensive, person-centered care,” said Ben Marcantonio, COO and Interim CEO of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization and the Hospice Action Network. “We thank Senators Rosen and Boozman for their leadership on these issues which positively impact the hospice and palliative health communities.” “With the number of Americans living with Alzheimer’s disease expected to nearly double and total payments for health care costs projected to reach nearly $1 trillion by 2050, our nation must take action to improve long-term care. The Supporting our Seniors Act will establish a bipartisan national advisory commission that will provide policymakers with an actionable plan to increase access to crucial long-term care services and supports,” said Robert Egge, Alzheimer’s Association Chief Public Policy Officer and Executive Director of the Alzheimer’s Impact Movement. “Thank you to Senators Rosen and Boozman for introducing this critical legislation and for your continued leadership on issues important to Americans impacted by Alzheimer’s and other dementia.”The National Advisory Commission created by this legislation would include government and private-sector stakeholders, along with family caregivers, home health care workforce representatives, and long-term care service recipients. This legislation is endorsed by the Alzheimer’s Association, the Alzheimer’s Impact Movement, the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, the Coalition to Transform Advanced Care, the Health Care Chaplaincy Network, the Hospice Action Network, the National Association for Home Care and Hospice, the National Coalition for Hospice and Palliative Care, and the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization. As the co-founder and co-chair of the Senate’s Comprehensive Care Caucus, Senator Rosen has been a leader in elevating the quality and inclusivity of long-term care. Last year, Senator Rosen co-sponsored the bipartisan Credit for Caring Act, which would provide working family caregivers with a tax credit of up to $5,000 to assist with out-of-pocket expenses related to caregiving. Senator Rosen has also introduced the bipartisan Expanding Access to Palliative Care Act to allow palliative care to be covered concurrently with curative treatment for serious illness or injury under Medicare, greatly improving quality of life for the patient and their family.###"
https://www.rosen.senate.gov/2022/09/13/rosen-joins-letter-urging-biden-administration-to-strengthen-privacy-protections-for-women-seeking-reproductive-health-care/,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) joined 29 of her Senate colleagues in sending a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) calling for immediate action to be taken to safeguard women’s ability to safely and confidentially get the reproductive health care they need. In their letter, the Senators urge the department to take steps to strengthen federal privacy protections under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to broadly restrict providers from sharing patients’ reproductive health information without their explicit consent—particularly with law enforcement or in legal proceedings over accessing abortion care.“Our nation faces a crisis in access to reproductive health services, and some states have already begun to investigate and punish women seeking abortion care,” wrote the Senators. “It is critical that HHS take all available action to fully protect women’s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially seek medical care.”“In particular, HHS should update the HIPAA Privacy Rule to broadly restrict regulated entities from sharing individuals’ reproductive health information without explicit consent, particularly for law enforcement, civil, or criminal proceedings premised on the provision of abortion care,” wrote the Senators. Since Roe v. Wade was overturned, the new patchwork of state abortion bans has caused widespread confusion among health care providers over whether they are required to turn over patients’ health information to state and local law enforcement. This confusion fundamentally threatens women’s health, as patients may delay or avoid seeking the care they need out of fear their sensitive health information could be weaponized against them. In recent weeks, states have investigated and sought to punish patients and providers for seeking and providing abortion care.The full text of the letter can be found here. ###"
https://www.rosen.senate.gov/2022/09/13/rosen-statement-opposing-republican-legislation-to-impose-nationwide-abortion-ban-threatening-reproductive-rights-in-nevada/,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) released the following statement in opposition to new Republican legislation introduced in the Senate to enact a rigid nationwide abortion ban that would override Nevada law protecting abortion rights. In 1990, Nevada voters passed a statewide referendum with nearly two-thirds support codifying state law protecting abortion rights.“MAGA Republicans in Congress are following through on what they have always said their ultimate goal was after overturning Roe v. Wade: banning abortion across the country,” said Senator Rosen. “This dangerous nationwide government mandate would take away women’s fundamental freedom to make decisions about their own bodies, and put them and their doctors at risk of being thrown in jail. I will do everything I can to fight this legislation threatening our reproductive rights in Nevada, and I will work with my colleagues to ensure it never becomes law.”Senator Rosen has been a leader in the fight against Republican attempts to ban abortions and restrict women’s reproductive rights.

This funding was made available as a result of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which both Senators worked to pass.“Making sure Nevadans have accessible and reliable roadways is crucial to the safety and success of our communities,” said Senator Rosen. “I’m thrilled to announce that Washoe County will receive $88 million to update and modernize its roads, speed up commute times, and increase pedestrian and bike access. This funding will be transformative for the local economy and communities throughout the county.”“This grant funding for Washoe County is great news for Reno and the surrounding areas, and it’s going to help people all over the community get where they need to go more safely and easily,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “I’m excited that Northern Nevadans will have more transportation options, improved access, and smarter transportation technology, and I will continue working to make sure our transportation network works for everyone in the Silver State.”“I’m excited to see that nearly $89 million in federal grant funds will be headed to Washoe County to add critical capacity to US 395, improve lighting, install cutting-edge traffic safety technology, as well as make multimodal improvements to North Virginia Street, such as new sidewalks, protected bike lanes, and upgraded transit stops,” said Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) Director Kristina Swallow. “Thank you to our federal delegation and local partners for supporting NDOT in our efforts to keep motorists, pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users safe and connected.”This funding supports a project in Washoe County with two components. The first will add two lanes along approximately three miles of US-395, along with improved traffic control, interchange lighting upgrades, sound walls, and Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) elements. The second will modify a separate 2.5-mile stretch of North Virginia Street with added sidewalks, buffered bike lanes, shared-use paths, pedestrian crossings with rectangular rapid flashing beacons, and improved transit stops.In addition to fighting for and supporting the vital bipartisan infrastructure law, Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto have worked throughout their time in the Senate to support work to improve transportation in Nevada, increase safety, promote sustainable economic development, and help Nevadans and visitors alike get where they need to go. Both Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto wrote a letter to DOT Secretary Buttigieg in support of this funding, as did Congressman Mark Amodei (R-NV). ###"

The bill, introduced alongside Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) in the Senate and Congresswoman Susie Lee (D-NV) in the House of Representatives, provides community health centers with the flexibility to use federal funds through the New Access Points Grants program to establish new, mobile health care delivery sites.“Too many of Nevada’s small and rural communities lack access to permanent health centers and reliable health care,” said Senator Rosen. “I’m glad to see that my bipartisan bill to provide these communities with greater resources to expand mobile health clinics has passed the Senate, and is now one step closer to becoming law.”“Community health centers in Maine and across the country play an indispensable role in ensuring that rural and underserved communities receive affordable and quality health care, particularly as we continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Senator Collins. “The MOBILE Health Care Act would help community health centers further expand their reach to the most rural parts of our state by giving them greater flexibility and allowing them to bring clinics even closer to the patients they serve.”“On behalf of Community Health Centers and the 30 million patients they serve, I want to thank Senator Jacky Rosen and Senator Susan Collins for pushing this important bill to extend access to high-quality primary care to rural communities through an expansion of mobile clinics,” said Rachel Gonzales-Hanson, Interim President and CEO of the National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC). “Nearly half of health centers are located in rural and frontier communities, but we know there is still unmet need. Additional mobile health clinics have the potential to leverage the reach of health centers and fully serve hard-to-reach across the country patients.”Senator Rosen has been a champion for expanding access to quality, affordable health care in Nevada. Earlier this month, she helped secure a three-year extension for health insurance premium subsidies as part of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Lee. “It has hit our auto industry particularly hard, leading to a shortage of vehicles, which has led to higher costs for Nevadans. Today’s discussion underscored just how important it is that we bring manufacturing back home.

Senator Rosen recently helped pass this legislation allowing Medicare to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices and capping Medicare beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket drug costs, including for insulin.The hearing was held at the College of Southern Nevada’s Charleston campus and featured local witnesses from across Southern Nevada, including:Below is an excerpt from Senator Rosen’s opening remarks:No one – and especially seniors living on fixed incomes – should have to choose between buying groceries and taking life-saving medication.  But for years, far too many Nevada seniors have faced this impossible choice. In fact, unfortunately, many seniors ration their medications or skip taking them altogether because of high costs and we’re going to hear real-life stories like this today.Simply put, this is unacceptable.That’s why, after nearly thirty years of inaction, I’m proud to have worked with my colleagues in Congress to deliver on the promises that so many have previously made to finally lower drug costs. We are bringing about real relief for Nevada’s seniors and seniors across America.This hearing could not be more timely. My Democratic colleagues and I just passed the Inflation Reduction Act, and just last week, President Biden signed this historic bill into law.This transformative new law will finally allow Medicare to negotiate the best price of prescription medication for America’s seniors.The Inflation Reduction Act also will cap seniors’ yearly out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs at two thousand dollars and will cap the price of insulin for Medicare beneficiaries at just thirty-five dollars per month.This new law will usher in a new era of increased access to and affordability of lifesaving prescription medication for Nevada seniors, and because private insurance often follows Medicare, the new negotiation authority included in the bill could end up lowering prescription drug costs not only for seniors but for all families.As we prepare for this new law to go into effect, I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to hear from our excellent panel of witnesses – including about how the high cost of drugs has imposed burdens on Nevada seniors, how high drug costs impact seniors’ health and well-being, how this impacts health care professionals and caregivers, and how the new law I helped pass will soon help reduce costs right at the pharmacy counter. ###"

In her speech, Senator Rosen highlighted the threat from anti-choice politicians in Nevada and across the country who are working to ban abortion rights and enact strict restrictions on women’s access to comprehensive reproductive medical care. She called on the Senate to immediately pass the Women’s Health Protection Act, legislation to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law.Senator Rosen has been a leader in fighting for women’s reproductive rights. Last week, when the Supreme Court’s opinion was reported, Senator Rosen released a statement calling for codifying Roe into federal law. Last year, she helped introduce the Women’s Health Protection Act and also signed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to uphold Roe v. Wade.Watch Senator Rosen’s full remarks here.Below are Senator Rosen’s floor remarks as delivered:Last week we learned that the United States Supreme Court is preparing to issue a ruling that would fundamentally roll back the constitutional rights of millions of American women.It’s been reported that a group of anti-choice justices on the Supreme Court are planning to overturn Roe versus Wade — the landmark case, decided nearly fifty years ago — which recognized the reproductive rights of women.This decision centered on one of the most fundamental rights we have as Americans: the right to control our own bodies.For nearly half a century, Roe has protected a woman’s right to make extremely personal decisions about her own body, her own health care, and her own family.But now, we’re seeing a clear, coordinated attempt by anti-choice politicians to roll back the clock on the rights of American women, control what happens to their bodies, and strike down reproductive freedom.If the Supreme Court moves forward with this action, it will have immediate and devastating consequences for women’s health.Let’s get something straight: overturning Roe is not going to stop abortions; It’s only going to stop women from getting safe abortions, and women will die as a result.This will also have a severe impact on how miscarriages and other life-threatening medical issues related to pregnancy are handled.For example: if Roe is overturned, ectopic pregnancies could become a death sentence for women in states that ban abortions.That is just one example of the harm this will cause.And this will disproportionately impact women who lack the resources to go to other states to seek care. This will also make it harder for women of color to access the care they need.Unfortunately, many states across our country already have rigid, extreme restrictions on the books — and if Roe falls, many of those laws would go immediately into effect.And in the states that don’t have these restrictions, extreme legislatures are pushing new, dangerous, and restrictive anti-choice laws as we speak.In my home state of Nevada, abortion rights have been enshrined into state law since Nevadans overwhelmingly voted for it as a ballot initiative in 1990.This means women across Nevada will continue to have access to reproductive care if Roe is overturned.But this year, anti-choice politicians are working to eliminate this protection from our state code, and take away Nevada women’s rights to make decisions for their own bodies.This is exactly why the Senate needs to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act today to ensure that women in all 50 states continue to have the right to make their own reproductive health care choices.I helped introduce the Women’s Health Protection Act last year, because it is the best option we have to codify Roe versus Wade into law.This bill will codify the right to receive and provide reproductive health care, and it will prohibit states from enacting rigid, medically-unnecessary restrictions that make it harder for women to access care.We’re not living in a hypothetical anymore.We are staring a post-Roe world in the face, and the time to act is now.My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have also made it clear: If they regain control of this chamber, they will pass a national ban on abortion rights, and they may go even further.I urge every Senator who cares about women, who cares about women’s health, their autonomy, and their rights to join me in voting to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act.Nevadans are watching, the American people are watching, and women everywhere are depending on us.We cannot let them down. ###"

Last year, Senator Rosen led the request, joined by Senator Cortez Masto, to secure this funding as a part of the Fiscal Year 2022 government funding package. “As housing prices in Nevada continue to rise at alarming rates, I am doing everything I can to make sure Nevada families have more access to quality, affordable housing options,” said Senator Rosen. “I am pleased to see that the NeighborWorks funding I requested will bring nearly $1 million to support affordable housing initiatives in Nevada, providing more families a place to call home. I will continue working to lower prices and ensure Nevadans can have access to affordable housing.” “Every Nevadan deserves access to affordable housing,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “I was proud to support efforts to secure this funding, which will help families across the state find a safe place to live and call home.” “Nevada HAND is thrilled that our long-standing and continued partnership with NeighborWorks has resulted in grant funding in 2022,” said Waldon Swenson, Vice President of Corporate Affairs for Nevada HAND. “The grant money received supports local solutions and helps our organization continue to address the shortage of affordable housing in Nevada. Nevada HAND currently has 35 affordable apartment communities in Southern Nevada that provide high-quality affordable housing for over 8,000 low-income working families and seniors. Once again, Congress has demonstrated that it has a sharp eye for a sound investment. Thank you to NeighborWorks for being a valued partner and helping us support our residents and communities.”“We are so thankful to Senator Rosen for her tireless efforts in advocating on behalf of Affordable Housing,” said Michelle Merced, CEO of Neighborhood Housing Services of Southern Nevada. “On April 19th, the Senator took time out of her busy schedule to meet with community leaders and residents as she fully comprehends that Southern Nevada is short of 85k affordable units. Being the first NeighborWorks affiliate here in Southern Nevada for 30 years, we are proud and appreciate the funding we received as they help us build better neighborhoods block by block.”NeighborWorks America is a Congressionally-chartered, national nonprofit that helps create opportunities for Americans to live in affordable and safe homes by providing community development organizations in all fifty states with financial resources and counseling services.###"

This investigation could expand harmful, job-killing tariffs on solar imports, raising costs on consumers, and has already caused widespread cancellations and delays in the U.S. solar industry. The solar industry employs over 230,000 American workers, including more than 6,000 Nevadans. According to a new report issued by the Solar Energy Industries Association, 70 percent of U.S. companies say at least half of their solar workforce is at risk as a result of this investigation. This bipartisan letter was also signed by Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Tom Carper (D-DE), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Mark Warner (D-VA), Chris Coons (D-DE), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Angus King (I-ME), Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), John W. Hickenlooper (D-CO), Christopher Murphy (D-CT), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Maggie Hassan (D-NH). “Initiation of this investigation is already causing massive disruption in the solar industry, and it will severely harm American solar businesses and workers and increase costs for American families as long as it continues,” wrote the Senators. “We strongly urge your administration to swiftly review the case and make an expedited preliminary determination. Such a determination should carefully consider the significant policy ramifications and reject the petitioner’s request for retroactivity.” “Already, as a result of Commerce’s decision to initiate this investigation, industry surveys indicate that 83% of U.S. solar companies report being notified of canceled or delayed panel supply. Without a reliable and cost-effective source of panels, existing and proposed solar projects could come to a halt,” the Senators’ letter continued. “Left unaddressed, cutting off this supply of panels and cells also could cause the loss of more than 100,000 American jobs, including approximately 18,000 manufacturing jobs.”The full text of the letter can be found here. Senator Rosen has been leading the fight against harmful solar tariffs. After spearheading a bipartisan group of a dozen senators in urging Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to carefully assess the validity of a recently filed petition to expand these solar tariffs, Senator Rosen also pressed Secretary Raimondo about expediting this investigation in a hearing last week. In a win for Nevada solar jobs, Senator Rosen successfully pushed the Biden Administration to exclude bifacial panels from an extension of solar tariffs and increase the number of allowable imported solar cells. In response to the Administration’s decision to partially extend Section 201 tariffs on imported solar panels and cells in February, Senator Rosen introduced her Protecting American Solar Jobs and Lowering Costs Act, bipartisan legislation with Senator Moran to fully repeal the solar tariffs while incentivizing domestic solar manufacturing.Last year, Senator Rosen also led a dozen Senators in successfully urging Secretary Raimondo to carefully assess and reject a series of anonymously filed petitions to expand job-killing tariffs on solar panels. ###"

This funding comes as part of the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) established by the American Rescue Plan that they helped pass.“Nevada’s small businesses still need more support as they get back on their feet,” said Senator Rosen. “This important funding that I supported will help ensure  Nevada’s small businesses have the resources they need to thrive.” “Our small businesses are at the heart of our communities, and their continued recovery is critical to our economic rebound,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “I was glad to ensure the American Rescue Plan included this lifeline for Nevada small businesses, and I’ll keep working to make sure they have everything they need to succeed.”Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto have been leaders in advocating for enhanced small business relief programs to save jobs in Nevada. Last year, the senators helped increase the cap on Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) for small businesses.

The Senators highlighted how autonomous vehicles have the potential to create good-paying American jobs, save lives, and ensure the United States will continue leading in the future of mobility.Nevada was the first state to authorize the operation of autonomous vehicles in 2011 and has remained a leader in the space, helping to advance the technology while creating jobs and boosting the state economy. Last year, Las Vegas was selected as the first city for a fully driverless taxi service. “Autonomous vehicles hold great promise to deliver significant benefits for all Americans—but only if the federal government puts the necessary policies in place to achieve these benefits,” wrote the Senators. “The federal government has the opportunity and responsibility to foster a domestic autonomous vehicle industry that is as safe as it is innovative, and that provides high-quality jobs across the economy, including in transportation”“As we look to the century ahead, the pace of innovation will only continue to accelerate, with significant implications for mobility, workers, the economy and society at large…Yet, we lag behind in shaping a regulatory framework that will foster this innovation while simultaneously protecting and encouraging all of the important benefits we believe autonomous vehicles are capable of delivering,” the Senators continued. “Our competitors on the global stage—particularly the Chinese government—have significantly invested in autonomous and connected vehicle technologies. That’s why securing the benefits associated with autonomous vehicles while lifting up our communities and workers will require a nuanced—and proactive—approach to policymaking…But that is all the more reason why the federal government must engage on these issues now.”The full text of the letter can be found here.###"

With antisemitism and Holocaust denial on the rise and last year being the highest on record for antisemitic incidents in the United States, we must take action to combat antisemitism in all of its forms and recommit to expanding Holocaust education across the United States.”“Today we remember the six million Jewish mothers, fathers, sisters, and brothers who were killed because of their faith during the Holocaust,” said Senator Lankford. “After the Allies liberated Europe, we said ‘Never again,’ and now we are making sure we mean it. As co-chairs of the Senate Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Antisemitism, Senator Rosen and I work together with more than half the Senate members to call out antisemitism where we see it, prevent Holocaust distortion, and ensure the next generations are able to learn what happened to ensure it never happens again. Please join us today by taking at least one practical step in your community to remember those we lost, pray for survivors, support our Jewish friends and neighbors who are still experiencing antisemitism today, and speak out against it when you see it.”In 2019, Senators Rosen and James Lankford (R-OK) launched the Senate Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Antisemitism. Last year, the Senate passed a bipartisan resolution introduced by Senators Rosen and Lankford condemning antisemitism. The resolution recommits the Senate to combating antisemitism in all forms, voices solidarity with those affected by antisemitism, urges the President to take specific actions to address antisemitism, and calls on elected officials, faith leaders, and civil society leaders to denounce and combat all manifestations of antisemitism.In 2020, Senator Rosen’s bipartisan Never Again Education Act was signed into law. It established a dedicated federal fund to provide teachers with the resources and training necessary to teach our students the important lessons of the Holocaust. ###"

This bipartisan legislative package is focused on restoring the nation’s travel and tourism industry from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.“We do need what you say, which is full coordination,” answered Secretary Raimondo. “As I said earlier, we’re still a million and a half jobs in travel and tourism below where we were pre-pandemic. We have not fully recovered – you see that in your state. So, yes I would fully support that.” The Omnibus Travel and Tourism Act was introduced by Senator Rosen, Senate Commerce Committee Ranking Member Roger Wicker (R-MS), Subcommittee on Tourism, Trade, and Export Promotion Ranking Member Rick Scott (R-FL), and a large bipartisan group of co-sponsors, including Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV). The bill advanced out of the Senate Commerce Committee with unanimous support in December. Rosen is the Chair of the Subcommittee on Tourism, Trade, and Export Promotion. Tourism is one of Nevada’s key industries and employs nearly 350,000 Nevadans. Although Nevada’s economy is beginning to recover and experiencing strong growth, the state unemployment rate remains one of the worst in the country. In the Las Vegas area, visitor volume is still down 18% and hotel room occupancy is down 17.7% compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019. Nationwide, unemployment in the leisure and hospitality industry, covering the bulk of tourism businesses and workers, is nearly twice the national average.###"
https://www.rosen.senate.gov/rosen-scott-introduce-bipartisan-bill-lower-costs-enhanced-retirement-plans-small-business,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and Tim Scott (R-SC) introduced the Increasing Small Business Retirement Choices Act, bipartisan legislation that would make it easier for small businesses to offer more comprehensive retirement benefits to their workers by reducing administrative expenses. Both senators are members of the Senate Special Committee on Aging; the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship; and the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.Currently, employers who offer 401(k) retirement plans and want to consider a “plan design change,” such as auto-enrollment or auto-escalation, must pay upfront out-of-pocket administrative costs, even if such changes might help employees save more money. This bill would change existing law to allow small business employers to use retirement plan funds to pay expenses associated with retirement plan design changes, lowering the cost of providing better plans to workers.“Small businesses make up more than 99 percent of our state’s businesses and employ over half a million Nevadans. This bipartisan legislation will ensure small business workers have access to high-quality retirement plan benefits without facing a cost barrier,” said Senator Rosen. “Removing this bureaucratic red tape and additional cost will make small businesses stronger and provide their workers with the best and most comprehensive retirement plans possible.”“Retirement planning is often a daunting and complicated process for millions of people concerned about securing the future of their families,” said Senator Scott, Ranking Member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging. “This bill will lighten the burden on workers at small businesses that do not always benefit from the same features of retirement plans under larger companies. Leveling the playing field to maximize benefits for the financial futures of all Americans should be a goal we can all get behind.”“Innovative plan design features such as automatic enrollment and financial wellness programs have been shown to have a huge impact on American workers’ financial health and retirement security,” said Brian Graff, CEO of the American Retirement Association. “The expanded flexibility to cover the expenses associated with these programs means that more employers – and most particularly small business owners – will now be able to bring those advantages to even more workers.”###"

In February, Senator Rosen signed on to a letter asking the Department of Labor to establish this special claims unit before the start of the 2022 wildfire season.“Firefighters routinely put themselves in harm’s way to keep our communities safe, especially to combat wildfires in Nevada and across the West,” said Senator Rosen. “It is highly concerning that these heroes have not received fair compensation for their work-related injuries and illnesses, and I am glad the Department of Labor is heeding our call to streamline the claims process and make it easier for them to file claims.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that cancer is a leading cause of death among firefighters, and research suggests firefighters are at increased risk of certain types of cancers compared to the general population. Each year, OWCP receives approximately 2,600 workers’ compensation claims from federal firefighters. Of those, about 175 claims include conditions such as cancer, heart disease, and lung disease.The full text of the letter can be found here.###"

RENO, NV – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), announced at the Reno Senior Center alongside AARP Nevada and the Washoe Senior Coalition that she is signing on to legislation that authorizes Medicare to negotiate lower drug costs for seniors. The Empowering Medicare Seniors to Negotiate Drug Prices Act, introduced by U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), would allow Medicare to negotiate the best price of prescription drugs for seniors enrolled in Medicare Part D by harnessing the bargaining power of the program for bigger discounts. Current federal law expressly bans Medicare from negotiating directly with the pharmaceutical industry for lower prices.
“In Reno and all across our state, Nevadans are dealing with rising prices and being forced to make difficult decisions because of the outrageous and skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs,” said Senator Rosen. “I’m signing on to legislation to empower Medicare to negotiate lower drug costs because this is a clear solution that will help Nevada seniors afford critical and often life-saving medications. This would be a game-changer helping to bring down costs at the pharmacy for so many Nevada seniors, particularly for those on fixed incomes struggling to make ends meet.”
“It’s wrong that seniors have to choose between medicine and food,” said AARP Nevada State Director Maria Moore. “This is a false choice and it can be fixed by allowing Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices. It’s outrageous to think if consumer prices had risen as fast as drug prices over the past 15 years, a gallon of milk would cost $13.”
“As a president of the Senior Coalition, I meet and hear back from seniors. They tell me they are upset with the rising costs of their medications to stay healthy, especially life sustaining drugs to live longer,” said Connie McMullen, President of the Senior Coalition of Washoe County. “People should not have to choose between keeping their home or extending their life. We have to do something, like allowing Medicare to negotiate for cheaper drug prices, to fix this critical issue.”
Senator Rosen has also introduced legislation to help reduce the cost of prescription drugs and medical devices through the support of nonprofit prescription drug and medical device manufacturers. In addition, Senator Rosen is co-sponsoring the Affordable Insulin Now Act, legislation that would cap the out-of-pocket cost of insulin for Nevadans and Americans across the country at $35 per month.

LAS VEGAS, NV – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) hosted a roundtable listening session with local housing advocates to discuss the need for more affordable housing in Nevada and what can be done to make housing more accessible for hardworking families. The event took place at Calcaterra Community, a new affordable apartment complex under the Neighborhood Housing Services of Southern Nevada.“As housing prices continue to rise, we need to make sure Nevada families have more access to quality, affordable housing options,” said Senator Rosen. “This discussion was an opportunity for me to hear directly from Nevadans on the ground about the housing challenges they’re seeing, the work being done to address this crisis, and what I can do in the Senate to continue to help.”“Events like today’s Roundtable with Senator Rosen are crucial to solving the affordable housing crisis in Nevada,” said Christine Hess, Executive Director of the Nevada Housing Coalition. “While there is much work to be done, having solutions-focused dialogue between leaders and community partners moves us closer to helping our lowest income residents find safe and stable housing.”“As the state’s largest nonprofit affordable housing developer, Nevada HAND understands the critical need of additional affordable housing in Nevada. Access to high-quality affordable housing is a key element of a strong and secure Nevada,” said Audra Hamernik, President and CEO of Nevada HAND. “Hosting today’s affordable housing roundtable is an example of Senator Rosen’s leadership as we work together as a community to continue our efforts to remove affordable housing barriers and build more affordable housing communities for the people of Nevada.”“Affordable housing is the beginning and the start for many working individuals and families,” said Michelle Merced, CEO of Neighborhood Housing Services Southern Nevada. “We are short 85,000 units and need to get ahead of this problem. It is our responsibility to our community to ensure that we as a State are providing solutions to this challenge.”Senator Rosen has been actively working at the federal level to lower housing costs and increase the availability of affordable housing for Nevadans. She recently led the efforts to secure $166 million in the bipartisan government funding bill for NeighborWorks, and she worked with Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) to secure $1 million in Community Project Funding for affordable housing and new business developments in Clark County. Senator Rosen has also co-sponsored legislation that would create a bipartisan task force to better understand and address the affordable housing crisis.###"
https://www.rosen.senate.gov/rosen-applauds-interior-department-heeding-her-call-reform-onshore-oil-and-gas-lease-sales,"Last Year, Senators Rosen and Grassley Introduced Bipartisan Legislation to Require Big Oil and Gas Companies to Pay their Fair Share by Modernizing the Outdated Public Lands Royalty SystemWASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) applauded the U.S. Department of Interior’s recent announcement that it will be raising the royalty rates for new competitive oil and gas lease sales on public lands to 18.75 percent. DOI’s plan to modernize federal oil and gas royalties for public lands – for the first time in more than a century – closely follows Senator Rosen’s bipartisan legislation and her repeated calls to fix this issue. Last year, Senators Rosen and Grassley introduced the Fair Returns for Public Lands Act to increase the royalty rate from 12.5 percent to 18.75 percent, which could raise at least $1 billion a year, over ten years, in additional federal revenue. According to Taxpayers for Common Sense, the state of Nevada has lost more than $50 million in revenue over the last decade because of outdated annual rental rates and minimum bid prices.“The current federal oil and gas program has failed to protect our public lands and American taxpayers, leading to states like Nevada losing millions in revenue while giant corporations make record profits and still increase prices at the pump,” said Senator Rosen. “I’m pleased to see the Interior Department has heeded my bipartisan call for action requiring Big Oil to pay its fair share so that state and local governments in Nevada and across the nation receive fair compensation.” Senator Rosen has been a leader on reforming onshore oil and gas lease sales on public lands. In June, Senators Rosen and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) sent a letter to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland in June urging DOI to include their bipartisan legislation as a policy recommendation in their finalized report. Then, in December, a report issued by the Department of the Interior endorsed the key goals of her bipartisan Fair Returns for Public Lands Act to fix major shortcomings in the current program. Senator Rosen also recently helped introduce the Competitive Onshore Mineral Policy via Eliminating Taxpayer-Enabled Speculation (COMPETES) Act, which would end the current practice of leasing non-competitive taxpayer-owned public lands to private oil and gas companies for as little as $1.50 per acre. Non-competitive leasing is often abused by companies who nominate lands for auction with no intention of bidding on them so they can acquire them later at a minimal cost.###"

Both senators submitted these Community Project Funding requests in the summer of 2021 and ensured they were included in the final bipartisan omnibus funding bill.These federal dollars will fund a variety of projects, including the construction of a training center for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, transportation infrastructure in Northern Nevada, critical upgrades to water infrastructure, and expanded health care access in rural Nevada.“The funding we secured for these dozens of community projects will invest in law enforcement and public safety programs, support our students, strengthen access to health care, deliver clean drinking water, improve our transportation infrastructure, and so much more,” said Senator Rosen. “I will always fight for our communities by ensuring Nevada receives its fair share of federal dollars.”“Nevada families, workers, and first responders will all benefit from the project funding I helped deliver this year,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “I’m always working to make Nevada’s communities safer, strengthen our small businesses, and provide the Silver State with strong federal support.” “Public safety is fundamental to the wellbeing of our communities,” said Tom Kovach, Executive Director of the Las Vegas Metro Police Department Foundation. “We are immensely grateful and appreciative of Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto who have secured much-needed funding to get us closer to our goal of completing the first phase of this project.  Their support means everything to the men and women of LVMPD as well as to local residents and our city’s 42 million-plus annual visitors who expect and rely upon well-trained officers to ensure public safety.”“The City of Reno is truly grateful for this federal funding and the positive impact it will have on The Biggest Little City,” said Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve. “While our budget outlook is positive, it is extremely challenging to fund all of the needed projects in our growing city. Thanks to the forward-thinking of Senators Cortez Masto and Rosen, these dollars will allow us to upgrade sewer service in a low-income neighborhood and make ADA improvements to 14 of our public parks.”“We are so grateful for our elected representatives in Washington D.C. who understand our local needs and fight for funding to support every resident in Nevada,” said Washoe County Manager Eric Brown. “Washoe County’s commitment to the Nevada Cares Campus is unwavering, and $12 million from Congress will allow us to move forward on the next phase of the campus to offer greater resources and service for our unsheltered population. Likewise, $2.3 million for the Washoe County Sheriff’s Regional Medical Infirmary Project will fund a new health and mental health treatment facility, something so dearly needed in our community.” “This funding will help us replace this aging equipment and ensure safe disposal measures,” said Joe Stubitz, Boulder City’s Utilities Director. “I truly appreciate the support of Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, Senator Jacky Rosen, and Representative Susie Lee. They have been instrumental in allocating these needed funds.”“The City looks forward to utilizing this newly available federal assistance on projects important to our community that will have lasting positive impacts on the City’s residents by increasing our quality of life and keeping our utility rates stable for decades to come,” said Carson City Mayor Lori Bagwell.“The City of Ely applauds Congress and our Congressional delegation for the passage of the Fiscal Year 2022 omnibus appropriations bill,” said Ely Mayor Nathan Robertson. “The City is incredibly grateful for the tireless efforts of Nevada’s Senators as they and their staff advocated for this critical infrastructure improvement to be included in this bill as the City’s first-ever CPF request.” “The City of Fallon thanks Senator Rosen and Senator Cortez Masto for all their hard work to secure Community Project Funding for transportation and water infrastructure projects that will greatly benefit City residents and visitors alike for years to come,” said Fallon Mayor Ken Tedford. ###"

The funds will be used to expand the state’s implementation of the 3-digit National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (9-8-8), and connect Nevadans in need with immediate support, including suicide prevention services and mental health crisis counseling.“Like many states across the nation, Nevada is experiencing a mental health crisis that has been exacerbated by the pandemic, and I am fighting to make sure we have the mental health resources necessary to support Nevadans in need,” said Senator Rosen. “I’m proud to announce that Nevada’s 9-8-8 suicide prevention hotline will receive more than $1 million to support and expand their operations and help save lives. I will continue fighting to protect Nevadans’ mental health and well-being and ensure our state overcomes this crisis.”Senator Rosen has been a leader in advocating for mental health support and resources for Nevadans. In February, Senator Rosen joined U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona to tour Spring Valley High School in Las Vegas and discuss mental health issues with Nevada students and school counselors. Earlier this year, Senator Rosen introduced the bipartisan Youth Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Act to provide direct funding assistance to K-12 school districts for comprehensive student mental health promotion and suicide prevention efforts. In 2020, Nevada’s Clark County School District reported 20 student suicides while schools were closed for in-person learning – more than double the number in 2019.###"

The Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Russia and Belarus Act, as amended in the Senate, suspends Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with Russia and Belarus, directs the U.S. Trade Representative to consider steps to block Russia’s participation in the World Trade Organization, and reauthorizes sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.Senator Rosen, who was recently appointed to the bipartisan Senate NATO Observer Group, has been a leader in opposing Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. She has repeatedly called to suspend all American trade with Russia and sanction the Moscow Stock Exchange. Senator Rosen also co-sponsored additional bipartisan legislation to ban all Russian energy imports to the United States.###"

She was recently appointed as one of three new members to join the bipartisan Senate NATO Observer Group at a time when the Alliance is playing a critical role in coordinating the response to Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Senator Rosen also recently signed onto a bipartisan letter requesting answers from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the speed, specifics, and supply of lethal and nonlethal military aid to Ukraine in the wake of questions raised during the CODEL to Germany and Poland. BELOW IS AN EXCERPT OF THE EXCHANGE:ROSEN: We know that [the Russians] are repositioning, the Ukrainian military and the ground forces there have to reposition as well. Looking ahead, do you think the Ukrainians have the right equipment and logistics in place to defend against this repositioning that Russia seems to be doing? MILLEY: They are asking for, and they could probably use, additional armor and artillery. We are looking around through allies and partners to get those types of weapon systems that require no training. Of course, we have armor and artillery but it’s not the kind they’ve used before and would require months of training to get them into a U.S. system. So we are looking around along with other countries in NATO to help them out in terms of building them up for armor and artillery. The fight down in the southeast, the terrain is different than it is in the north. It is much more open and lends itself to armor mechanizing offensive operations on both sides and those are the systems that they’re looking for and that’s what people are trying to help them out with. ###"

https://www.rosen.senate.gov/rosen-joins-inhofe-introduce-bipartisan-medical-student-education-authorization-act,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), joined Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) this week in introducing the Medical Student Education Authorization Act. This bipartisan legislation would reauthorize and expand the Medical Student Education (MSE) Program for five years, ensuring that Nevada is eligible for funding to help reduce its physician shortage. This existing program provides grants to public institutions of higher education to expand or support graduate education for physicians in states with the most severe primary care provider shortages, fostering the next generation of trained medical professionals in places where doctors and other providers are needed most. While under the program’s current funding criteria, Nevada is not eligible for support, this new legislation would amend the formula to support a number of new states, including Nevada. The bill would also provide guaranteed funding to the program for the first time ever. The MSE Program is currently subject to annual authorizations, which has resulted in significant uncertainty over funding and long-term planning for funded institutions. Identical legislation has been introduced in the United States House of Representatives by Congressman Tom Cole (R-OK), Congresswoman Dina Titus (D-NV), and Congressman Markwayne Mullin (R-OK).“Communities across Nevada and our country are in dire need of more health care professionals, and Congress must act to fill these gaps and ensure access to quality medical care,” said Senator Rosen. “This bipartisan legislation would reauthorize the Medical Student Education program for another five years, and expand it to address the physician shortage in states like Nevada by supporting the next generation of medical professionals.”“Doctors play a critical role in the health and well-being of Oklahomans and individuals across the nation—as evidenced ten-fold by this pandemic,” said Senator Inhofe. “I have always been an advocate for retaining the talent of the next generation of medical students in our state, which is why I am pleased to introduce the Medical Student Education Authorization Act alongside Rep. Cole. This bill will support medical student training in Tribal, rural, and medically underserved communities, helping guarantee sufficient doctors in these areas for years to come and ensuring all Oklahomans can continue to have access to high-quality health care.”“The AHA commends Representatives Cole, Mullin and Titus and Senators Inhofe and Rosen for introducing this important bipartisan legislation to help increase the number of physicians across the country, especially in areas with the most severe provider shortages,” said Stacey Hughes, Executive Vice President of the American Hospital Association. “Having a talented, qualified, engaged, and diverse workforce is at the heart of America’s health care system but many physicians and other health care professionals are exhausted from two years of being on the front lines battling COVID-19. We look forward to working with Congress to pass this critical legislation that will continue to help build the physician workforce pipeline, especially in medically underserved communities.”“National Rural Health Association (NRHA) applauds Representatives Cole, Titus, and Mullin and Senators Inhofe and Rosen for introducing the Medical Student Education Authorization Act,” said Alan Morgan, Chief Executive Officer of the National Rural Health Association. “Since the Medical Student Education (MSE) Program was first authorized in 2019, it has made a profound impact on training physicians in rural communities. We know that physician’s training experiences in rural communities result in higher practices rates in rural areas. Passing a five-year authorization of the MSE Program, as this legislation does, will be helpful for stabilizing the depleting workforce in rural communities. As rural communities rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic, strengthening the workforce is a top priority for NRHA. Programs like the MSE Program are critical to ensuring rural communities have the workforce they need to provide services for their residents.”“Nevada desperately needs primary care physicians. We rank 48th nationally and 67% of the state’s population resides in a primary care health professional shortage area,” said Melissa Piasecki, M.D., Acting Dean University of the Nevada, Reno School of Medicine & Chief Academic Officer of Renown Health. “This grant program, if expanded, will allow UNR Med to use proven strategies to recruit and retain Nevada medical students to serve the rural and underserved communities in our state.” ###"

There are nearly 30 bridges in Nevada considered in “poor condition” and this funding will be allocated to projects across the state to repair and modernize dozens of bridges, while supporting good-paying construction jobs. “Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that I helped write and pass, Nevada is receiving $45 million to fix and update our bridges – nearly thirty of which are deemed structurally deficient,” said Senator Rosen. “This funding will make needed improvements in our state while creating jobs, and it’s a reminder of what we can accomplish when we work in a bipartisan way.” “This funding I secured through the bipartisan infrastructure law will create jobs and help Nevada make improvements and repairs to our critical bridges across the state,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “The safety of Nevadans is my top priority, and these investments will make our roads and bridges safer and more resilient to strengthen our economic future.”  This funding from the Federal Highway Administration is the largest investment in bridges in American history. Nevada will receive a total of $45 million under the new program to address highway bridge needs. The funding is available to improve the vital bridges in the state, including 28 deemed structurally deficient, to ensure they are maintained at a safe and efficient level.Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto secured multiple transportation provisions in the bipartisan infrastructure bill to help Nevada communities make even more improvements to their roads and bridges, plan for and build electric vehicle infrastructure, make transit to school safer for students, and support smart cities that use technology to solve transportation challenges.###"

For decades, Congress has played a key role in promoting Israel’s acceptance among Arab states and advancing prospects for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The bipartisan Caucus will provide an opportunity to strengthen the Abraham Accords by encouraging and deepening partnerships among the existing Abraham Accords countries and expanding the agreements to include countries that do not currently have diplomatic relations with Israel.“In just one year, the Abraham Accords have already transformed the Middle East by contributing to regional peace and stability, promoting US interests, and enhancing Israel’s security,” said Senator Rosen. “The Abraham Accords Caucus will build on that success by providing bipartisan leadership to strengthen existing partnerships and widen the circle of peace to new countries. I have long supported America’s leadership role in fostering peace between Israel and its neighbors, and I look forward to furthering that work through this bipartisan Caucus.”“It was a great day for peace when I joined President Trump at the White House and leaders from Israel, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates more than a year ago as they signed the historic Abraham Accords,” said Senator Lankford. “When Morocco and Sudan joined the Accords a few weeks later, the concept of the Abraham Accords demonstrated that reconciliation among even more nations in the region was possible. I stand with Israel and for lasting peace in the Middle East, alongside my colleagues, as we launch the Abraham Accords Caucus. We will seek peace through expanding and encouraging the Accords and set the example for other nations who desire peace. Matthew Chapter 5, verse 9 importantly reminds us that ‘Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.’ ” “I am proud to join as a co-chair of this caucus, and build upon the work of the historic Abraham Accords, which have normalized relations between Israel and several Arab states, promoted greater economic opportunities in the Middle East, and advanced the prospect of peace in the region,” said Senator Booker. “The United States must continue to play an active role in fostering further dialogue and partnership between Israel and other Arab countries, and I look forward to doing just that as part of this bipartisan group.” “Finalizing the Abraham Accords was a historic step toward peace in the Middle East and welcome news, not only for our partners and allies in the region, but for the United States,” said Senator Ernst. “We must continue these efforts to further our nation’s partnership with Israel and promote peace and prosperity, and I look forward to working with my Democratic and Republican colleagues in the Abraham Accords Caucus to do so.”The Caucus is supported by the Atlantic Council, the Abraham Accords Peace Institute, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee, Hadassah – The Women’s Zionist Organization of America, the US-Israel Education Association, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, the Israel Policy Forum, CUFI Action, the Jewish Federations of North America, B’nai B’rith International, and the American Jewish Congress.The mission statement of the Senate Abraham Accords Caucus is available here.###"

This record-high funding, secured as part of the Rosen-backed American Rescue Plan Act, invests in Nevada through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).“Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, Nevadans will have more support and assistance with their energy costs to keep their homes warm this winter,” said Senator Rosen. “I’m proud to have helped secure this record-high level of funding for Nevada, which will help lower costs for hardworking families and help them make ends meet, and I will continue fighting to ensure Nevada always receives its fair share of federal resources.”LIHEAP is a federally funded program that helps low-income households with their home energy bills by providing payment as well as energy crisis assistance. In 2020, more than 26,000 Nevada households were served by the LIHEAP program. Additionally, more than 80% of Nevada households that rely on LIHEAP have at least one vulnerable member who is either over 60 years of age, under the age of six, or disabled.In July, Rosen joined a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee supporting a robust increase in funding for LIHEAP in Fiscal Year 2022.###"

LAS VEGAS, NV – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) led a panel discussion at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, the world’s biggest tech conference, with a delegation of fellow women Senators covering key tech policy issues facing the nation that federal lawmakers expect to tackle in the year ahead. The bipartisan panel featured a record-breaking number of Senators attending CES and included Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME). Before the panel, the Senators walked the floor of CES to visit a wide variety of booths, hear from different groups and companies, and see firsthand displays of their new and emerging technologies.CES is an annual trade show organized by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) and held at the Las Vegas Convention Center hosting presentations of new products and technologies in the consumer electronics industry. A former computer programmer and software developer, Senator Rosen had attended CES in the past – and after visiting for the first time as a U.S. Senator in 2019, she decided to work on convening a panel of Senators and bringing a bipartisan group of her colleagues to Las Vegas.“This conversation is a reminder that there is a real desire and opportunity for us to work together, across party lines, to meet the tech challenges our nation faces and seize on the many opportunities for success to make the United States stronger and more competitive,” said Senator Rosen. “I want to thank Senators Cantwell, Capito, Blackburn, and Collins for all coming with me to Nevada to experience CES in person and for joining our bipartisan discussion on major issues like STEM education, broadband infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, and data privacy. I know that we can continue working to support good-paying jobs, finding common ground, and creating a tech space that’s equitable for all.”In November 2021, Senators Rosen and Capito launched the Senate’s first Women in STEM Caucus, a new bipartisan group to advance women’s participation in science, tech, engineering, and math education and careers.###"

https://www.rosen.senate.gov/rosen-statement-mark-one-year-january-6th-insurrection-against-capitol,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) released the following statement to mark one year since the January 6th insurrection against the U.S. Capitol. “One year ago, violent insurrectionists launched a deadly assault on the U.S. Capitol as Members of Congress began the process of certifying the results of the presidential election. I remain grateful to the brave men and women of Capitol Police and other law enforcement agencies who put themselves in harm’s way to protect not only the Capitol but democracy itself, and made it possible for my colleagues and I to re-enter the Capitol that night to continue the peaceful transition of power,” said Senator Rosen. “January 6th was an inflection point that underscored why we must keep working to stop the spread of disinformation, protect Americans’ voting rights, and bring our country back together. As we reflect on the events of that day, let it serve as a reminder of just how fragile our democracy can be, while also giving us the opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to defending the values of our nation.”###"

He was a voice for all Nevadans, and if you ever went to an event for Senator Reid, he would remind you by making sure ‘Home Means Nevada’ – that’s our state song – it was sung in honor of our beloved state.”WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) spoke on the Senate floor to honor the life and memory of former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Senator Reid represented Nevada for five terms in the U.S. Senate, including eight years as Majority Leader. Watch the full speech here.Below are Senator Rosen’s floor remarks as delivered:Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and memory of former Senate Majority Leader Harry Mason Reid.To some in this chamber, Senator Reid was a colleague, a mentor, a friend.To me, and to so many Nevadans, he was also a source of inspiration and pride.His life, coming from the humblest of beginnings, is the definition of the American Dream.During his decades of public service – from the state Assembly to the Lieutenant Governor’s office, to chairing the Nevada Gaming Commission, he became the most powerful leader in Congress – this former boxer from a tiny town called Searchlight always put Nevada first.Senator Reid served five terms in this very chamber. And what he accomplished during those three decades here – particularly as Majority Leader – is remarkable.Senator Reid stopped Yucca Mountain… he made sure that Nevada would not become the nation’s nuclear waste dump.He is the reason we passed the Affordable Care Act into law, providing quality, affordable health care to tens of millions of Americans.He did more than anyone to rescue Nevada’s economy from the depths of the Great Recession.He passed crucial Wall Street reform to hold the Big Banks accountable for that economic crisis and prevent a future one.He established Nevada’s first National Park, Great Basin National Park.He saved Social Security from being privatized.He was a fearless champion for bold action to stop climate change.And he was a tireless fighter for comprehensive immigration reform and the DREAM Act.And because Senator Reid celebrated our state’s diversity and recognized its importance, Nevada is an early state… the first in the West when it comes to choosing each party’s nominee for the White House.No matter the issue, if it impacted Nevada, you can be sure Senator Reid would do anything to deliver for our state. He was a voice for all Nevadans, and if you ever went to an event for Senator Reid, he would remind you by making sure “Home Means Nevada” – that’s our state song – it was sung in honor of our beloved State.This is how he got things done. He was blunt, he was direct… He was a real straight shooter… He didn’t mince words; when he identified a problem, he would work relentlessly to find a solution.And as so many of us here know, you could try as hard as you wanted to, but you could never leave the conversation, or hang up the phone, before he did!He said what he needed to and he was on to his next piece of work.And I want to share the best advice Senator Reid ever gave to me… He said this: Take every call… Listen to every person… whether you agree with them or not, and then tell them when you’re with them, and tell them when you’re not. Be open and be honest in your conversations — and those are words I try to live by here, every day. They were things Senator Reid was respected for. And Senator Reid, well he also knew that the constituent services, the work we do with our teams, it literally saves lives and it directly helps families and it touches so many people. It is the most important and personal work we do, and through that work, it can often become the foundation for legislation at the federal level.When I was thinking about whether or not to run for the Senate, Senator Reid invited me and my husband Larry over to his home to talk with him about making that decision.Well, in Senator Reid style, instead of taking the lead to give us advice and tell us what to do, he actually asked his wife Landra to talk to us about her experience.Well, anyone who’s met Landra Reid knows just what an incredible woman she is. Senator Reid was a family man, and he adored her and their children, and of course grandchildren, and great-grandchildren so very much.And, as my friend Brian Greenspun wrote the other day in the Las Vegas Sun: “To Harry Reid the greatest accomplishment was his family.”In Senator Reid’s living room, Landra told me and my husband how she juggled being the mom of not one, not two, not three, not four, five kids, while Harry was working as a Capitol Police officer to put himself through law school, while running tough campaigns, and while serving long days and nights in Washington. Needless to say, there’s not much that can top that.And so, the Reids provided my family with inspiration I needed as I was considering what a life in the public view would look like. Their love for each other, their journey and ability to make it work over six decades… raising kids, keeping their love strong… well, it showed me how important it was to have a strong family, of course, and friends as the foundation for this work of public service. You know, we spend a lot of time here in Washington talking about politics every day, but it’s the personal things, at the end of the day, we all know really matter.And that’s the work that Senator Reid did for Nevadans… He fought to make families’ lives just a little bit easier – whether they knew it or not – so that they could focus on what matters, what was most important to them.I want to honor Senator Reid for his lifetime of fighting the good fight for our state. He helped make Nevada what it is today, a world-class destination and a truly a great place to live, work, and raise a family.And I want to thank Landra and the entire Reid family for sharing their husband, their father, their grandfather with Nevada and the nation.The American people have benefited so much because of their sacrifices and his willingness to serve. Thank you. Thank you Senator Reid.###"
https://www.rosen.senate.gov/rosen-leads-bipartisan-letter-dhs-dot-requesting-information-cybersecurity-nations-transportation,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a member of both the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) and the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Roger Wicker (R-MS), are leading a bipartisan group of 10 Senators in a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas ​​and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg requesting information about the two Departments’ ability to meet their responsibilities, as co-Sector Risk Management Agencies (SRMA), to detect, prevent, and respond to cyber threats to the nation’s critical transportation infrastructure. Cyberattacks on American transportation infrastructure are escalating in frequency and severity. The William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act of 2021 delineated specific responsibilities for SRMAs to secure critical infrastructure. A bipartisan group of Senators joined Senators Rosen and Wicker in sending this letter, including Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Rob Portman (R-OH) and Senators Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Shelly Moore Capito (R-WV), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Todd Young (R-IN), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), and James Lankford (R-OK).“Cyberattacks on American transportation infrastructure are escalating in frequency and severity, as evidenced by the ransomware attack earlier this year on Colonial Pipeline, one of the nation’s largest pipelines, which led to the shutdown of a network that carries nearly half the gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel for the East Coast. At the same time, many state and local transit agencies are not fully equipped to implement more than basic cybersecurity protections. In fact, a study by the Mineta Transportation Institute found that only 60% of transit agencies had a cybersecurity plan in place last year,” wrote the Senators. “As such, federal efforts to ensure that our nation is properly prepared to address cybersecurity threats to the transportation system require a delicate balance to provide critical assistance to entities that need new or additional cybersecurity support, while recognizing effective practices that some entities already have in place.”“With this in mind, we request information about how DHS and DOT are meeting their six responsibilities as co-SMRAs,” the Senators continued. “Ransomware attacks on the transportation industry, just one derivative of cyber-attacks, increased by 186% between June 2020 and June 2021. Therefore, we request information on any efforts to update the Transportation Systems Sector-Specific Plan to provide the most effective assistance possible to improve the security and resilience posture of the nation’s transportation system.”The full text of the letter can be found here. ###"

I’m proud of the work my colleagues and I have done in Congress to protect Lake Tahoe, and I am proud to continue partnering with this community as we seek to overcome the environmental challenges that this natural wonder faces. Together, we can keep Lake Tahoe pristine for generations to come.” BACKGROUND: In May, Senator Rosen helped introduce a bill to extend authorization of the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act for an additional 10 years. Senator Rosen also played a role in the development of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which recently passed the Senate. The infrastructure legislation includes $17 million in funding for the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act.In 2019, Rosen’s amendment to set aside $4 million for Lake Tahoe invasive species mitigation passed the Senate and was eventually included as part of the end of year spending bill. ###"

Today, I was proud to hold a roundtable discussion at the University of Nevada, Reno, with some of our state’s student Dreamers to discuss the challenges they’re facing and how we can help,” said Senator Rosen. “It is clear that Dreamers need legal protections, and Congress must act immediately. We must urgently pass immigration reform legislation through any means possible to provide our Dreamers with the stability needed to continue living, working, learning, and contributing to our state.”“Our University’s support for our DACA students and their families remains firm,” said University of Nevada, Reno President Brian Sandoval. “I’m proud to have Senator Rosen come to UNR today to speak with our DACA students, and I applaud her commitment to protecting this community and passing comprehensive immigration reform, including the DREAM Act. The success of our DACA students has long been a point of pride for UNR, and we must take steps to ensure they are supported.”“The recent judicial ruling halting the DACA program creates uncertainty and fear for myself and countless other Dreamers,” said Arturo Macias Franco, a student Dreamer at the University of Nevada, Reno. “Today’s discussion highlighted the challenges that students face now that DACA is up in the air. I am grateful to have Nevada leaders like Senator Rosen and other elected officials, who remain committed to fighting for lasting and permanent protections for Dreamers like me.”BACKGROUND: Senator Rosen is a co-sponsor of the U.S. Citizenship Act, comprehensive immigration reform legislation that would create a pathway to citizenship for immigrants, including Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients; address the root causes of migration; and improve our nation’s security.Senator Rosen is also a co-sponsor of the National Office of New Americans Act (S. 291), legislation that would establish a new office to help ensure a welcoming and inclusive immigration system by promoting and supporting immigrant and refugee integration into, and inclusion in, the social, cultural, economic, and civic life of the United States, including by coordinating federal, state, and local efforts. This legislation will help provide the support and resources immigrants and refugees need to thrive in the United States fully.Senator Rosen also co-sponsored the Protect Dreamer Confidentiality Act (S. 846), legislation to safeguard the private information—such as addresses and telephone numbers—of young immigrants protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), also known as Dreamers. This legislation would protect Dreamers to ensure that they are not targeted for deportation by protecting DACA application information from being disclosed to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) for any purpose other than implementing DACA.  ###"
https://www.rosen.senate.gov/rosen-fischer-re-introduce-bipartisan-bill-address-firefighter-first-responder-mental-health,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and Deb Fischer (R-NE) announced the re-introduction of their Helping Emergency Responders Overcome (HERO) Act. This bipartisan legislation would support efforts by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to collect data on first responder suicides, and direct HHS to develop and compile best practices for identifying and treating post-traumatic stress and combating suicide among firefighters and other first responders. The bill also establishes a grant program for peer-to-peer counseling programs to address mental health challenges for first responders.“Firefighters and emergency medical responders are heroes who routinely put themselves in harm’s way to keep our communities safe. Unfortunately, these same heroes often face a heavy psychological toll as a result of their jobs, which can lead to increased stress, mental health challenges, and even suicide,” said Senator Rosen. “We must take steps to ensure the well-being of first responders in Nevada and across our nation by providing greater access to mental health resources and support. This important bipartisan legislation will provide greater insight into the challenges that first responders face, help better develop strategies to assist them, and increase the number of counseling resources available to our heroes.”“Firefighters and first responders risk their lives every day to protect members of their communities,” said Senator Fischer. “Unfortunately, this work can come at a cost of mental health challenges. That’s why I’m proud to join Senator Rosen in reintroducing the HERO Act. This bipartisan bill would expand resources for firefighters and our first responders to help prevent suicides, set up peer-to-peer counseling, and treat posttraumatic stress.”“Fire fighters and emergency medical responders deal with traumatic events on the job every day. It is a fact that the toll of these experiences directly cause psychological injuries and behavioral health issues. Sadly, we have lost some of our sisters and brothers to these job-related hazards,” said Edward A. Kelly, General President of the International Association of Fire Fighters. “I applaud Senators Rosen and Fischer for their strong leadership on this important mental health issue, and I thank them for introducing the HERO Act.”BACKGROUND: According to a 2018 report by the Ruderman Family Foundation, more firefighters die from suicide than in the line of duty. The bipartisan HERO Act addresses the fact that first responders may be at higher risk for suicide and mental illness than other professions by providing for the study and treatment of the mental health challenges that first responders face.

https://www.rosen.senate.gov/rosen-joins-colleagues-bipartisan-call-protect-afghan-women-leaders-wake-taliban-takeover,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), joined Senate colleagues in urging the Biden administration to take swift, robust action to protect and support Afghan women leaders facing unparalleled danger following the Taliban’s violent sweep across Afghanistan and seizure of Kabul. In the bipartisan letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, the Senators called on the Administration to create a humanitarian parole category specifically for women leaders, activists, human rights defenders, parliamentarians, journalists, and members of the Female Tactical Platoon of the Afghan Special Security Forces, and to streamline the paperwork process to facilitate referrals to allow for fast, humane, and efficient relocation to the United States.“We and our staff are receiving regular reports regarding the targeting, threatening, kidnapping, torturing, and assassinations of women for their work defending and promoting democracy, equality, higher education, and human rights,” wrote the Senators. “While we welcomed the expansion of the eligibility requirements for Special Immigrant Visas and the creation of the Priority 2 category in the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, we must also protect those women who might fall through the cracks of the U.S. Government’s response. We greatly appreciate your efforts to help save the lives of Afghans who have advanced U.S. and Afghan joint interests over the last generation, standing for peace, democracy, and equality. We are all in agreement that we owe them our unqualified support.”The full text of the Senators’ letter can be found here and below.Dear Secretary Blinken and Secretary Mayorkas:As the situation in Afghanistan rapidly deteriorates and the Taliban has taken control of Kabul, we appreciate the urgent measures you and the Department of Defense are taking to protect Afghan women leaders and others most at risk for retaliation by the Taliban.We strongly urge you to create a humanitarian parole category specifically for women leaders, activists, human rights defenders, judges, parliamentarians, journalists, and members of the Female Tactical Platoon of the Afghan Special Security Forces and to streamline the paperwork process to facilitate referrals to allow for fast, humane, and efficient relocation to the United States. We also urge you to increase processing capacity within U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and to immediately appoint an interagency refugee coordinator. We support your efforts to evacuate those who are applying for humanitarian parole and those applying for Priority 1 or 2 pathways, including by allocating seats for them on SIV evacuation flights. Finally, the United States should do everything possible to enable charter flights to safely land at and depart the airport even after U.S. Embassy personnel have been evacuated, and that clear instructions for safely accessing their aircraft are provided to those who are trying to depart and to organizations that have referred people and their dependents.We are gravely concerned about the safety of women leaders, activists, judges, parliamentarians, and human rights defenders. The shocking violence and alleged atrocities occurring have caused mass displacement which, during a global pandemic and severe drought, has created a major humanitarian crisis. In areas captured by the Taliban, there are reports of war crimes including summary executions, public beatings and flogging of women, sexual violence and forced marriage, as well as clampdowns on media and other forms of communication.We and our staff are receiving regular reports regarding the targeting, threatening, kidnapping, torturing, and assassinations of women for their work defending and promoting democracy, equality, higher education, and human rights. While we welcomed the expansion of the eligibility requirements for Special Immigrant Visas and the creation of the Priority 2 category in the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, we must also protect those women who might fall through the cracks of the U.S. Government’s response.Particularly for women who are currently targets—even hunted by Taliban fighters who are going house-to-house with their names—the path to protection and safety under the Priority 2 designation is not accessible. While we understand there is little processing capacity at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, for these women to access a third country for processing is almost or completely impossible with all borders crossings now closed or controlled by the Taliban. We greatly appreciate your efforts to help save the lives of Afghans who have advanced U.S. and Afghan joint interests over the last generation, standing for peace, democracy, and equality. We are all in agreement that we owe them our unqualified support. Sincerely, ###"
https://www.rosen.senate.gov/rosen-statement-situation-afghanistan,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), released the following statement on the current situation in Afghanistan:“I want to start by expressing my gratitude to the hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops who have bravely served in Afghanistan – including members of the Nevada National Guard – and their families, who have sacrificed so much,” said Senator Rosen. “I am horrified by the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan and deeply concerned for the well-being of the Afghan people, particularly women and girls in the country. Our number one priority must continue to be the immediate evacuation of American citizens, embassy personnel, and their families, in addition to the brave Afghan citizens who have provided critical support to our mission over the past two decades. We cannot abandon them during their darkest hour.” “My colleagues and I have been briefed on this developing situation by Secretaries Austin and Blinken, along with General Milley,” Senator Rosen continued. “When we are sure Americans and our Afghan partners are safe, Congress and the Administration must work together to assess why we did not anticipate that the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces would prove so ineffective in holding off the Taliban and why our plans to safely evacuate embassy personnel, Afghan translators, and others did not account for the rapid Taliban takeover of Kabul. For now, though, we must focus on the mission at hand and limit further loss of life.”“As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I will continue to monitor the situation on the ground, and I stand ready to help provide the Administration and our troops whatever resources are needed to save the lives of U.S. diplomatic and military personnel and their families, rescue our Afghan allies, and ensure the safety of Afghan women and girls.” Senator Rosen concluded. ###"

I thank Chairman Peters and Ranking Member Portman for their leadership on this critical legislation.”BACKGROUND: The State and Local Government Cybersecurity Act will facilitate coordination between DHS and state and local governments in several key areas. The legislation will permit the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) to provide state and local actors with access to improved security tools, policies, and procedures, while also encouraging collaboration for the effective implementation of those resources, including joint cybersecurity exercises. The legislation will also build on previous efforts by the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) to prevent, protect, and respond to future cybersecurity incidents. These changes would also ensure that government officials and their staffs have access to the hardware and software products needed to bolster their cyber defenses. ###"
https://www.rosen.senate.gov/rosen-backed-bipartisan-bill-strengthen-k-12-school-cybersecurity-passes-senate,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) released the following statement applauding Senate passage of the K–12 Cybersecurity Act of 2021, bipartisan legislation she co-sponsored. The bill would direct the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to complete a study of cybersecurity risks to schools. This legislative action follows a ransomware attack targeted against Nevada’s Clark County School District, the fifth-largest school district in the United States.“Malicious cyber actors are increasingly targeting K-12 schools across the United States, including the Clark County School District, the fifth-largest school district in the country, which was the victim of a ransomware attack,” said Senator Rosen. “Cyberattacks can be expensive and debilitating, especially for small organizations or public entities. Schools and school districts need an immediate federal response to improve cybersecurity in Nevada and across our nation to prevent the personal information of students, faculty, and staff from falling into the wrong hands. I’m proud to see that this bipartisan legislation, which I co-sponsored, passed the Senate and is one step closer to becoming law. This bill will provide schools with tools and resources to prevent and combat cyber threats.” BACKGROUND: The K-12 Cybersecurity Act directs DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to work with teachers, school administrators, other federal departments, and private sector organizations to complete a study of cybersecurity risks specific to K-12 educational institutions, including risks related to securing sensitive student and employee records and challenges related to remote-learning. Following the completion of that study, the bill directs CISA to develop cybersecurity recommendations and an online toolkit to help schools improve their cybersecurity hygiene. These voluntary tools would be made available on the DHS website along with other DHS school safety information.Last year, following the cyberattack on the Clark County School District, Senators Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) sent a letter to the heads of the Department of Education (ED) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), urging those agencies to provide support, guidance, and resources to schools to respond to and prevent cyberattacks. ###"
https://www.rosen.senate.gov/rosen-votes-pass-budget-resolution,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) voted in favor of passing the Senate budget resolution, which, if adopted by the full Congress, would set spending levels for the federal government for Fiscal Year 2022.“This budget resolution will enable Congress to tackle many of the most pressing challenges that our nation faces,” said Senator Rosen. “The resolution lays the groundwork for significant investments that will lower costs and create jobs for Americans – through economic development, greater health care access, small business support, workforce training, universal pre-K, funding for high-quality child care, and affordable housing. The legislation also outlines plans to support hard-working families in Nevada and across our nation by cutting taxes for working families, by extending the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit, and the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, and also by establishing a first-ever federal paid family and medical leave benefit.”“The budget resolution allows us to strengthen health care in the United States by adding dental, vision, and hearing benefits to the Medicare program and investing in home-based care programs for our nation’s seniors,” Senator Rosen continued. “This resolution also empowers us to take steps to address the urgent issue of climate change by providing a framework for greater development of clean, renewable energy and climate resilience initiatives in Nevada and nationwide. These forward-thinking investments in our country will set the United States on a path toward a successful future.”###"

In her statement, Senator Rosen highlighted the wins she was able to secure for Nevada in the bipartisan legislation. “I’m proud to see that our bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act has passed the United States Senate,” said Senator Rosen. “This comprehensive and critical legislation will allow us to make historic investments in our communities through infrastructure. The bill, which includes the text of 3 of my bills and numerous other provisions I spearheaded, would take major steps to support our traditional infrastructure – roads and bridges, rail, and transit – and also invest in forward-thinking cybersecurity and energy infrastructure to support our nation’s future, creating new jobs and building up our communities in the process.”“Throughout this process, I have been a voice for Nevada, ensuring that this bill uniquely benefits our state and addresses issues that matter most to our state including steps to address the water crisis, increase broadband connectivity, and provide funding to improve and expand our airports,” Senator Rosen continued. “As was made clear over the last year, fast, reliable access to the internet is critical to our daily lives. The broadband section of the bill, which I co-wrote, would make broadband access more available and more affordable, connecting communities across Nevada and all over the U.S. Additionally, a separate section of the bill I co-wrote would provide funding for our nation’s airports, allowing for key construction, expansion, upgrade, and repair projects. These investments will better connect our state to the nation and the world, allowing Nevada’s travel and tourism industries to soar once again.”BACKGROUND: The following full sections of the infrastructure bill were co-written by Rosen:The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act includes the text of three of Senator Rosen’s bills.The bill also includes the following Rosen-led or backed efforts:Among many others, the bill includes the following provisions to benefit Nevada:###"
https://www.rosen.senate.gov/rosen-co-sponsors-state-public-option-act-0,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a member of the Senate Committee on Health Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), released the following statement announcing her co-sponsorship of the State Public Option Act, legislation to create a Medicaid-based public health insurance option to strengthen the Affordable Care Act by providing Americans with a new high-quality, low-cost choice when purchasing health insurance.“All Americans deserve access to affordable, high-quality care, regardless of their income level, and that’s exactly what the Medicaid public option would offer,” said Senator Rosen. “This legislation would strengthen our health care system by providing Americans the choice to purchase health insurance via an expanded Medicaid program, providing quality, affordable coverage to those who need it. I will continue working to protect the health and well-being of Nevadans and ensure that all those in the Silver State can access quality, affordable care.” BACKGROUND: Even with the progress of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), more than 30 million people remain uninsured. The State Public Option Act will help workers who do not have employer-sponsored coverage, but may make too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid or for subsidies under the ACA, by allowing them to buy into Medicaid. The bill will also help consumers who live in counties with limited insurance carriers or who worry they may soon have no options for affordable coverage.The State Public Option Act will allow states to create a Medicaid buy-in program for all their residents, regardless of income, giving everyone the option to buy into a state-driven Medicaid health insurance plan. Medicaid is a popular and cost-effective program with a large provider network. The program has the same positive ratings as private insurance, but provides health coverage at a much lower cost. Based on partnerships between state and federal governments, Medicaid also gives states the flexibility to adapt services and models of care based on their individual needs.Earlier this year, Nevada became the second state in the nation to pass legislation creating a public option for health coverage. Senator Rosen co-sponsored similar legislation last Congress. ###"
https://www.rosen.senate.gov/rosen-tours-just-one-projects-community-market-learn-about-services-provided-during-covid-19,"LAS VEGAS, NV – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) toured the Just One Project’s community market to speak with volunteers and learn about the food distribution services and resources they provide for the Las Vegas community. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, food insecurity has become an even more critical issue in our state,” said Senator Rosen. “Today, I visited Just One Project’s community market to learn more about their incredible efforts to distribute food to community members in need. Through the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan Act – both of which I helped to pass – we have been able to provide funding and support for Just One Project and similar food assistance programs. Together, we can combat food insecurity to ensure that no Nevadan goes hungry.” BACKGROUND: In March of 2020, Senator Rosen voted in support of the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, legislation that established grant funding for programs that help people meet basic needs.In March, Senator Rosen voted to pass the American Rescue Plan Act, which was signed into law by President Biden that same month.

During the event, Senator Rosen encouraged Nevadans to receive a COVID-19 vaccination.“Through the leadership of Governor Sisolak and the Nevada Department of Public Health, we are fighting back against COVID-19 by encouraging Nevadans to protect their health and the health of our communities,” said Senator Rosen. “I want to thank and congratulate all who participated in Vax Nevada Days, and I want to urge Nevadans who have not received a vaccination to speak with a medical professional about getting one. Vaccines are free, they are safe, and they will protect you and your loved ones.” BACKGROUND: As part of a public health initiative launched in June called Vax Nevada Days, Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak and the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services — in partnership with Immunize Nevada —awarded $5 million in cash and prizes to nearly 2,000 Nevada residents who received a COVID-19 vaccination. ###"
https://www.rosen.senate.gov/rosen-applauds-nearly-500000-grant-funding-awarded-unlv-make-computer-science-accessible-nevada,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, released the following statement applauding the National Science Foundation (NSF) for awarding a grant totaling $499,899 to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas to increase computer science access for students with disabilities.“Providing all students equitable access to computer science education will set each of them up for a successful future,” said Senator Rosen. “As a former computer programmer, I know firsthand the benefits that computer science education can provide. In the United States, approximately 16 percent of high school students identify as having a disability, and these same students are often denied the education and career opportunities that computer science courses can provide. I’m glad to see this grant funding has been awarded to the University of Nevada Las Vegas where researchers can work on removing barriers that prevent students from accessing computer science education.”BACKGROUND: The University of Nevada Las Vegas will participate in AccessCSforAll with the goal of including more K-12 students with disabilities in computing classes. Approximately nine million K-12 students are identified as having a disability under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. These students are often faced with significant barriers to their participation in quality computer science education. Some of these barriers include inaccessible tools and curriculum. This project will lead to the adoption of more accessible tools and curricula in the teaching of computer science nationally.The primary goal of the project is to scale up past efforts to make computer science classes equitable and welcoming to all students in the United States. This expansion will work toward reaching the approximately 16% of high school students who have a disability.In April, Senator Rosen re-introduced the Teacher Education for Computer Science Act (Teach CS) Act. This bipartisan legislation would support teacher training and schools in educating students in the area of computer science.###"
https://www.rosen.senate.gov/rosen-holds-roundtable-discussion-unr-focused-medical-residency-programs-nevada,"RENO, NV – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), held a roundtable discussion with representatives from state medical schools and hospitals focused on physician provider shortages and how to better support Nevada’s graduate medical education (GME) programs and medical schools, and identify ways to improve the system to reduce provider shortages in the state and across the country. The roundtable discussion follows the recent issuance of a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report requested by Senator Rosen, which examined GME programs and medical provider shortages in the U.S.“The medical provider shortage in Nevada and across our nation has left countless communities without proper access to care,” said Senator Rosen. “I was glad to meet with Nevada’s medical education professionals to discuss the impact that provider shortages have on care in our state and to develop forward-thinking solutions that will improve access. I will continue to work alongside Nevada’s medical community to ensure that Nevadans have the proper care that they deserve.”“Through increased investment in our state’s medical residency programs, we can provide greater access to care in our communities,” said Melissa Piasecki, M.D., Executive Associate Dean, University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine. “The work Senator Rosen is doing to enhance our medical system will lead to more medical professionals in our state, benefitting Nevadans and improving their ability to seek care.”BACKGROUND: Senator Rosen is a co-sponsor of the Rural Physician Workforce Production Act. This legislation would lift the current caps on Medicare GME payments to rural hospitals. This would help eliminate the disadvantage that rural hospitals face when recruiting new medical professionals. The bill also would allow Medicare to reimburse urban hospitals that send residents to train at rural health care facilities during a resident rotation, and it would establish a per-resident payment initiative to ensure rural hospitals have the resources to bring on additional residents. Senator Rosen is also a co-sponsor of the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act which would increase GME slots by 2,000 per year. Current law provides for an increase of up to 200 positions per fiscal year beginning in FY2023, with a total increase of 1,000 positions (up to 25 per hospital). This bill provides for an additional increase of 2,000 positions per fiscal year from FY2023-FY2029; during this period, each hospital may receive up to 75 additional positions in total under the bill and current law. In 2019, Senator Rosen sent a letter to GAO requesting a report on GME and physician shortages. GAO completed the report this summer. Some of the report’s key findings include: ###"

Broadband expansion is an investment in our communities and in our future success, which is why I am proud to be a co-author of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which makes major investments in broadband, particularly last-mile and middle-mile broadband infrastructure, to connect our rural communities.”“In White Pine County, the lack of access to broadband deprives Nevadans of needed tools for success,” said Caroline McIntosh, Chair of the White Pine Broadband Action Team. “Without broadband, local businesses can’t provide services online, students can’t use the internet to learn, and Nevadans can’t seek health care from their homes. Senator Rosen recognizes the challenges that lack of broadband access brings, and she has helped to lead on this important issue. Her work in Congress will get more Nevadans connected while reducing the price of broadband for customers, benefitting countless Nevada families.”BACKGROUND: As a member of the G-22, Senator Rosen helped draft the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a once-in-a-lifetime investment in American infrastructure. Significant portions of the broadband section were co-written by Senator Rosen, including:The bill also includes a $2 billion set-aside specifically for tribal broadband and over $14 billion to provide affordable broadband to low-income households via a $30/month benefit. ###"
https://www.rosen.senate.gov/rosen-joins-bipartisan-letter-calling-immediate-evacuation-siv-applicants-afghanistan-full,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, joined 52 of her colleagues in a bipartisan letter to the Biden administration calling on them to address the urgent situation in Afghanistan that threatens the lives of tens of thousands of Afghan partners. In the letter, the Senators request the immediate evacuation of Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants and their families, as well as swift implementation of legislation Rosen voted for to expand the SIV program and streamline the application process.“The Taliban’s rapid ascendancy across Afghanistan and takeover of Kabul should not cause us to break our promise to the Afghans who helped us operate over the past twenty years and are counting on us for assistance. American inaction would ensure they become refugees or prime targets for Taliban retribution,” wrote the Senators.  “Specifically, we urge continued coordination between the Departments of State and Defense to secure and hold Hamid Karzai International Airport, including to allow for the continuation of military flights and the resumption of commercial and charter flights. We also urge your Administration to assist with the passage of individuals to the airport to safety – both those within Kabul and those outside of the capital – as well as to consider cases where Afghans fleeing quickly may not have been able to collect or gather appropriate documents,” the Senators’ letter continued. “We were pleased that you immediately signed [our]…legislation to make extensive improvements to the SIV program into law three weeks ago, and now ask that you move just as quickly to ensure it is properly and fully implemented ensuring applicants and their families can get out of harm’s way.”The full text of the letter can be found here and below.Dear Mr. President,  We write to urge the immediate and full implementation of recently-passed legislation amending the process and eligibility for the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program and for the urgent evacuation of SIV applicants whose service to the U.S. mission has put their lives in jeopardy. As you know, this critical program provides safety for the brave Afghans who served alongside United States troops in support of the U.S. missions in Afghanistan. As the situation in Afghanistan deteriorates, these individuals face increased danger at the hands of the Taliban that has sworn retribution. For this reason, Congress provided additional authorities to improve and expedite the application process while maintaining the program’s security and integrity. We implore your Administration to expeditiously implement these changes and immediately evacuate our Afghan allies to safety.  The United States led coalition forces in Afghanistan for nearly twenty years following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Our mission safeguarded the American homeland safe from terrorist attacks, eliminated Osama bin Laden, and delivered freedom and education to a generation of Afghan women and children. At every step of the way, our mission was supported by Afghans who fought alongside us for a better future for their country. They risked their safety and the well-being of their families to work with the United States. With the departure of U.S. forces and Taliban rule in place, the safety and security of our Afghan allies who put their lives on the line to help our service members and diplomats must be a top priority. For this reason, we urge you to continue the expeditious evacuation of SIV applicants and their families. At your direction, on July 17 the United States launched Operation Allies Refuge in order to evacuate SIV applicants in danger from the Taliban’s advances. We appreciate that this effort has already brought 2,000 Afghans, including primary SIV applicants and their families, to the United States. However many more remain. The Taliban’s rapid ascendancy across Afghanistan and takeover of Kabul should not cause us to break our promise to the Afghans who helped us operate over the past twenty years and are counting on us for assistance. American inaction would ensure they become refugees or prime targets for Taliban retribution.   Specifically, we urge continued coordination between the Departments of State and Defense to secure and hold Hamid Karzai International Airport, including to allow for the continuation of military flights and the resumption of commercial and charter flights. We also urge your Administration to assist with the passage of individuals to the airport to safety – both those within Kabul and those outside of the capital – as well as to consider cases where Afghans fleeing quickly may not have been able to collect or gather appropriate documents.   Additionally, the support and protection of our Afghan allies is why Congress recently passed, with broad bipartisan support, legislation to make extensive changes to the SIV program. We did so with the goal of improving the process for applicants while maintaining our national security. We were pleased that you immediately signed this legislation to make extensive improvements to the SIV program into law three weeks ago, and now ask that you move just as quickly to ensure it is properly and fully implemented ensuring applicants and their families can get out of harm’s way.  To this end, we respectfully request that your Administration immediately implement all aspects of the statute as Congress intended, including: 1.     Updating internal and external guidance to reflect the change in the employment requirement for eligibility from two years of service to one. This adjustment of eligibility must be applied to all pending applications, including those on appeal which have been denied on the basis of insufficient duration of service but whose appeal is still eligible to be re-adjudicated. To ensure that this change is fully implemented, we ask that all staff who are charged with processing applications receive training to apply the 12 month standard to all pending applications and appeals.  2.     The issuance of special immigrant visas to all applicants and their qualified family members that have passed all steps of the visa process and only await a medical exam. The adjustment of status conferred by a SIV is preferable both to the processing of visas and to the applicants than paroling evacuated individuals into the country, thus requiring additional filings to confer the statuses included in a SIV.  3.     Full and immediate repeal of the “sensitive and trusted” requirement for individuals employed by or on behalf of the NATO-led military mission in Afghanistan, as required by the Emergency Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021, as well as those employed by or on behalf of the United States government. Congress repealed the “sensitive and trusted” requirement from U.S. government employment in December 2019, but as of this date we are not satisfied that it has been fully implemented. We expect the Department of State to implement the removal of “sensitive and trusted” activities from NATO-led forces support immediately, re-open the cases of any U.S. government employees who have been denied Chief of Mission approval for lack of “sensitive and trusted employment” since December 2019, and expeditiously update internal and external guidance to reflect this change.  4.     The process for appeals of denials. As newly amended, the law now allows that, if an appeal is denied for a reason not listed in the initial denial, the applicant must be allowed an opportunity to address the new denial ground. This allowance is due to the high success rate for appeals when the cause of denial is known to the applicant. As with other changes to the law, we request that your Administration ensure that this change applies to all applications within the appeal period. This spares applicants the time and effort of re-applying and conserves the precious processing resources of the U.S. government. 5.     Prioritization of applications based on date of the initial application. We once again clarify that the “prioritization” scheme that was introduced in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 is no longer law. In addition, all application processing must comply with the Congressionally-mandated nine month processing requirement.  6.     Full transparency and adequate guidance for applicants. This includes, but is not limited to, updating all public websites maintained by the relevant U.S. government authorities to provide applicants with complete information about eligibility and process for applying. Most applicants do not have access to legal counsel for the sake of understanding the current process. All changes in program eligibility must be readily accessible and all changes that impact current applicants must be communicated directly to applicants.  We appreciate the efforts that you and your Administration have made on behalf of Afghans who worked in support of the U.S. in Afghanistan. We must now concentrate all U.S. efforts on supporting and protecting our Afghan allies. Anything short of full implementation results in grave security implications. You have the strong support of both chambers of Congress to ensure that no additional Afghan lives are needlessly lost.  ###"

However, as COVID-19 hit our state, we saw air travel brought to an abrupt halt, creating steep declines in passenger traffic and related revenues.” “The infrastructure bill invests in upgrades and maintenance for airport infrastructure, supporting our travel and tourism economy. The section of the bill – which I co-wrote – would provide an unprecedented $25 billion for investments for key construction, expansion, upgrade, and repair projects at Harry Reid International Airport, at airports in Nevada, and airports all across the country,” Senator Rosen continued. “These infrastructure investments will create jobs and allow us to bring in business and leisure travelers in even greater numbers than before, lifting up our communities, boosting our economy, and allowing Nevada’s travel and tourism industry to soar once more.”BACKGROUND: Last month, Senator Rosen voted to pass the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act through the United States Senate. As part of the bipartisan group that drafted the Senate-passed landmark legislation, Rosen played a leading role in writing the section on airports and ensuring support for travel and tourism.The section of the infrastructure bill focused on investments in our nation’s airports was co-written by Rosen. It includes $25 billion in overall investment for airport infrastructure.The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act also includes the text of Senator Rosen’s bipartisan Travel Optimization by Updating and Revitalizing Infrastructure to Support Mobilization (TOURISM) Act, which requires the Department of Transportation to update its National Travel and Tourism Infrastructure Strategic Plan to develop an immediate-term and long-term strategy for using infrastructure investments to revive the travel and tourism economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.###"

This action follows a year of advocacy from Senator Rosen to raise the caps and get additional financial aid to small businesses in Nevada and across the United States.“The economic challenges brought on by the pandemic have been devastating for our nation’s small business community. COVID-19’s economic impact has been felt particularly hard here in Nevada, where 99% of the state’s businesses are small businesses,” said Senator Rosen. “Throughout this crisis, I have fought to ensure that Nevada’s small businesses have access to the aid they need. Today’s announcement that the SBA will be raising the caps on EIDL loans is a step toward providing greater relief to small business owners and workers in Nevada and nationwide. I am glad to see that my efforts to raise the loan caps were successful, and I will continue fighting to support Nevada’s small businesses and our state’s economy.” BACKGROUND: Nevada is home to:Senator Rosen has been a champion for small business relief programs to help save jobs in Nevada. In March, Senator Rosen successfully helped increase the cap on Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) for small businesses from $150,000 per business to $500,000 per business (and received a commitment that the cap would be raised to $2 million, which has now occurred), the result of a year-long legislative effort that included introducing bipartisan legislation, raising the issue in multiple Senate hearings and floor speeches, and working with the Biden Administration. These low-interest loans can be used to pay for small business operating expenses.On March 6, 2021, Senator Rosen voted in support of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which provided small business relief, including $15 billion in new EIDL grants for small businesses, in line with the amount in Senator Rosen’s EIDL for Small Businesses Act.Small businesses that are experiencing difficulties navigating federal assistance can also send their inquiries and questions to SmallBusiness@Rosen.Senate.gov, and a team of dedicated bilingual professionals will respond to provide assistance. ###"

In her speech, Senator Rosen discussed the work she and her colleagues in Congress have been doing to make child care affordable and accessible, and the critical role it plays in Nevada’s economic recovery. “Over the last year and a half, COVID-19 has had a devastating toll on our nation’s workforce, one that has disproportionately impacted working mothers. The number of women in the workforce dropped to its lowest point in 30 years,” said Senator Rosen. “We’re at a moment where we can make real change to benefit our workforce and grow our economy. During these difficult times, we should be giving families one less thing to worry about. We must take important steps to support existing providers, promote expansion and new operations, and help lower child care costs, giving all families access.
