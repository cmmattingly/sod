https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-opposes-electoral-count-reform-act-for-reducing-congressional-ability-to-address-voter-fraud,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Rules Committee, voted against the Electoral Count Reform Act today during a committee mark-up and gave the following remarks:“This bill is a bad bill. … It’s bad policy and it’s bad for democracy. There are serious constitutional questions in the bill. The text of the Constitution, Article Two says, ‘Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors.” This bill is Congress trying to intrude on the authority of the state legislatures to do that. But it’s also exceptionally bad policy.…“We know that Democrats aren’t opposed to objecting to elections and presidential electors. We know that because Democrats objected in 1969. And then they objected again in 2001. Then they objected again in 2005. And then they objected again in 2017. So Democrats have a long history of going up and objecting to electors.…“We also know that the Democrats are hell bent on federalizing elections. And this bill takes a significant step down that road of putting the federal government in charge of elections. That has been a top Democrat priority for some time.…“What this bill does is decreases the ability of Congress to address instances of fraud when it occurs, and I believe Congress has a responsibility to do that.…“I don’t believe senators from this side of the aisle should be supporting a bill that enhances the federalization of elections and reduces the ability of Congress to respond to the very serious problem of voter fraud. I think this bill does that, and so I intend to oppose it.”Listen to Sen. Cruz’s full remarks here.###"
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-adds-safeguards-to-protect-free-speech-in-journalism-antitrust-bill,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today released the following statement regarding his amendment to the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act (JCPA) (S. 673):“Today I secured significant protections against Big Tech censorship with an amendment to the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act of 2022. The changes that I successfully fought for would prohibit the media and Big Tech from negotiating over or agreeing to censor content. The prohibition against censorship not only protects the content of the journalists whose outlets may be negotiating with Big Tech but it critically protects the speech of journalists and smaller media outlets who don’t have a seat at the table. This is a major win for free speech and it strikes a blow against the virtual monopoly that Big Tech has to limit the information that Americans see online. The bottom line is Big Tech hated this bill from the start and now they hate it even more.”        ###"
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-praised-for-ports-to-plains-legislative-victory-in-big-spring-texas,"BIG SPRING, Texas. – U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, today spoke about his efforts to designate the portion of the Ports-to-Plains Corridor from Laredo, Texas up through New Mexico, as a future addition to the interstate highway system at the Ports-to-Plains Alliance annual conference. Afterwards, he held a press conference where he was joined by Ports-to-Plains Chairman John Osborne, San Angelo Mayor Brenda Gunter, Howard County Judge Kathryn Wiseman, and Lubbock County Judge Curtis Parrish.This year, Sen. Cruz won a bipartisan victory when he worked to build a coalition of Republicans and Democrats to pass two major amendments. The first was the Cruz-Warnock amendment extending I-14, running from the Permian Basin all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. That amendment passed unanimously into law, and it will help bring oil, gas, and crops from west Texas all the way east to the Atlantic.The second amendment, the Cruz-Lujan amendment, designated I-27, part of the Ports-to-Plains Corridor, as a future addition to the interstate highway system. This amendment also passed the Senate this year with bipartisan support and will positively impact 26 counties in Texas. It will lead to upgrades to critical parts of the highway system, and it will improve roadways that Texas farmers and ranchers need to get their products to market faster.About his work to designate a part of the Ports-to-Plains Corridor as a future interstate, Sen. Cruz said:“I was proud to champion this initiative to extend I-14 and designate I-27, the Ports-to-Plains Corridor, as a future addition to the interstate highway system. This is a $55 billion project that will create hundreds of thousands of jobs and will bring tens of billions of dollars of additional GDP to the state of Texas. It was a great bipartisan victory for Texas, and I was proud to bring it across the finish line.”Ports-to-Plains Alliance Chairman John Osborne said:“This has just been a fantastic set of meetings these last couple of days, highlighted this morning by our very own Sen. Ted Cruz coming and speaking with us, talking about the importance of trade and commerce—not just within Texas but more importantly with our greatest trading partner, Mexico, and up and down the Ports-to-Plains Corridor. We had a great session listening about how our I-27 designation bill got passed and I cannot say thank you enough to Sen. Ted Cruz for championing that effort.”San Angelo Mayor Brenda Gunter said:“Sen. Cruz has been instrumental in the fight for the Ports-to-Plains and the economic vitality of our state. I was proud to stand with him today and join the efforts to secure our state’s economic future.”Howard County Judge Kathryn Wiseman said:“I welcome Sen. Cruz so much to our city and our community, and I want to thank him for his work securing the Ports-to-Plains and the infrastructure that we will need to reach from Mexico to Canada. I’m so excited about it. Thank you.”Lubbock County Judge Curtis Parrish said:“I want to welcome the Senator to Big Spring and welcoming him to West Texas. This is Cruz country. We are honored that he has chosen to join with us here at the Ports-to-Plains conference. This Ports-to-Plains Corridor goes from Laredo to Canada, from Mexico to North Dakota. This project is a massive project that’s going to take all of us to work on it. The Senator knows that, and the Senator has done an incredible job in bringing together folks from both sides of the aisle. He recognizes that this is not a Republican issue, this is not a Democratic issue. This is an issue for all of us.” Background: ###"

Cotton (R-Ark.), Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Ernst (R-Iowa), Barrasso (R-Wyo.), and Rubio (R-Fla.), today introduced the Strengthening Entry Visa Enforcement and Restrictions Act of 2022 (SEVER Act) to prevent Iranian President Ibrahim Raisi from entering the United States to attend the upcoming opening session of the United Nations General Assembly.About the bill, Sen. Cruz said:“Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi would already be excluded from entering the United States for the U.N. General Assembly if President Biden and his administration were enforcing existing statutes in good faith. Raisi has a record of terrorist activities, including his advocacy for the assassination of President Trump and other U.S. officials. He is also listed by the State Department as ineligible for entering the United States because of mass atrocities he committed. Nevertheless, the Biden administration seems set on circumventing these restrictions.“The SEVER Act will deny entry to Raisi and the few dozen individuals who are hand-picked by the Ayatollah to repress the Iranian people and pose threats to American national security, to ensure they cannot get into the United States. It is well within the rights of the United States to deny them entry, and we absolutely should.”Read the bill here. ###"

He also blocked the Protect Our Children’s Schools Act, which would have allowed schools to use unspent previously appropriated federal COVID-19 education-related funding to improve school security.On the Senate floor, Sen. Cruz said:“There have been too damn many mass shootings. With kids going back in school all across the country, we need to again revisit what we can do to keep them safe from mass shooters.“Their parents are scared and they they've expressed concerns that the security measures at schools and Uvalde haven't improved enough to make them feel safe. Today, I want to put forth two bills that would address this problem inevitably when a mass murder occurs. “This bill would be the most serious, the most significant, the most major investment in school security Congress has ever enacted. This bill would double the number of police officers on campus.”In response to Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) objecting, Sen. Cruz said:“What we just saw reveals that the Democrats have one objective when a mass murder happens, and that is to take away the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. That is always, always, always their solution. Never mind that it doesn’t work. … If another lunatic attacks a school and there’s not a police officer at the front door to stop it, remember right now. Remember this moment when the Democrats said, ‘No, we will not protect our kids.’”The Securing Our Schools Act would:Sen. Cruz has a longstanding history of advocating for the security of students by improving school safety. In 2013, Sen. Cruz introduced Cruz-Grassley, a comprehensive effort to make schools and communities safer by simultaneously targeting violent criminals and safeguarding the Second Amendment.

Cruz introduced the Cruz-Barrasso Safe Kids, Safe Schools, Safe Communities Act to protect the Second Amendment, improve firearm safety, and prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands.Watch Sen.

Aviation safety and global standards for safe and efficient aviation operations have no loyalty or political affiliation.“Next year Congress will take up, examine, and as needed revise the full range of our national policies related to aviation through the legislative reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration.

Better yet, this week I was accompanied by a very special guest, my daughter Catherine. As much as I enjoy visiting with Texans in our nation’s capital, nothing tops showing around one who calls me “Dad,” even if she steals my desk from time to time…As promised, I wanted to provide a more complete update on the situation at our southern border. President Biden has facilitated the creation of an absolutely chaotic situation there, but he has yet to travel down to the border as President to see it himself, let alone address the issues. Late Thursday evening last week, I arrived in McAllen and immediately joined Border Patrol’s midnight patrol.Let me tell you, following our meetings with Customs and Border Patrol, a Blackhawk tour of the border, a round table with local officials, and meeting with Texan landowners along the border, I can confidently say that I’ve never seen the southern border this bad. The latest numbers prove it. In June, 207,416 illegal immigrants were encountered at the border. If even the Mayor of New York is begging for assistance in the midst of the massive flood of illegal aliens coming in, imagine the burden it presents to those in Del Rio, McAllen, Laredo and elsewhere in Texas.On Wednesday, I led a press conference joined by Senators John Cornyn, John Barrasso, Joni Ernst, James Lankford, Ron Johnson, and John Hoeven to further detail our firsthand observations and experiences on the border. To hear all about our takeaways, click below. ↓   Yesterday, I introduced the Protect Our Children’s Schools Act, which is the Senate companion to legislation introduced by Rep. Randy Weber in the House.  Read the release here.This week, I was able to meet with some of Texas’ best and brightest individuals, from student leaders to oil industry executives. I was also proud to accept both the National Taxpayers Union’s “Taxpayers’ Friend” Award and receive Club for Growth’s Defender of Economic Freedom Award.  Rest assured, I will always be the fiercest advocate of securing our border and will lead the fight to ensure the safety of Texans and Americans alike. Keep Texas Strong,  MORE FROM SEN.

https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sens-cruz-blackburn-introduce-bill-to-combat-racist-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-in-dc-schools,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) today introduced a bill that will protect students in Washington, D.C. public schools from the city’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Senators Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) also joined them.The D.C. school vaccine mandate would prohibit unvaccinated schoolkids from 12 to 15 years of age from attending school in person. The mandate is particularly harmful to black students, who are vaccinated at a lower rate than other students. D.C.’s vaccine mandate comes on the heels of two years of school shutdowns and remote learning – which led to substantial learning loss, particularly for students who were already struggling in school. If the D.C. vaccine mandate is enforced, many D.C. students may fall even further behind in school.Sen. Cruz said:“D.C. public schools are blatantly discriminating against black students in our nation’s capital. The rate of vaccination for black students between the ages of 12 and 15 in Washington, D.C. is 60 percent – far lower than the city average. D.C. schools has already postponed enforcement of this racist policy until 2023 and they should simply scrap it. Until they do, I will fight for the students of D.C. and work to end this mandate.”Sen. Blackburn said:“Right now, any news organization worth its subscription fee is running story after story with evidence that the left’s forever pandemic is destroying the mental and emotional well-being of children. Yet somehow, right here in our nation’s capital, leaders are depriving students of a basic education if they don’t comply with the District’s highly-politicized vaccine mandate. Getting vaccinated should be a decision between a patient, parent, and doctor – not politicians pressured by big teachers’ unions and radical activists.”Read the bill here.When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Sen. Cruz led the fight against unlawful COVID-19 mandates by introducing the first and most sweeping bill to prohibit federal vaccine mandates. Sen. Cruz introduced the Parental Rights Protection Act to prohibit the federal government and any entity that receives federal funding from requiring COVID-19 vaccines for minors, and introduced legislation to end the Biden administration’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention mask mandate for all Americans, regardless of vaccination status. Sen. Cruz has led his colleagues on amicus briefs against vaccine mandates on Navy SEALs and federal employees. ###"

We must never forget the victims of the acts of hate and mass murder committed that day by radical Islamic terrorists. On this day, 21 years later, let us remember not only the act of evil, and the lives lost, but also the unity of our country as we resolved to stand together in the face of adversity, as one nation.“I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our servicemen and women, first responders, and other Americans who answered the call of duty to defend our great nation in the wake of those attacks. It is because of your courageous sacrifices that our country remains a beacon of hope and freedom to this day. I will never forget. We will never forget.

https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/blogs/e-newsletter_-week-of-september-2nd,"The past four weeks I’ve been blessed to travel across the Lone Star State, visiting with Texans and discussing the needs of our great state. From Corpus Christi to hear from city and county leaders about additions I ensured were included in the Senate version of the Water Resources Development Act, to Lubbock to talk about the importance of the Ports-to-Plains legislation and discuss with leaders in the Texas agriculture industry about how I can fight for them on the upcoming Farm Bill, I’ve been traveling nonstop to ensure the needs of Texans are met.In Lubbock, I spoke to west Texas leaders about my successful bipartisan, bicameral effort to designate the I-27 Ports-to-Plains corridor as a “Future Interstate,” which will make Texas eligible to receive additional federal funds to complete the I-27 highway expansion project.  This was an incredible win for west Texans, and I was incredibly proud to lead this effort in the Senate.Most recently, this Monday, I toured the largest Bitcoin mining facility in North America, which of course is situated right here in Rockdale, Texas. With Texas as the epicenter of cryptocurrency and e-commerce innovation, I am proud to learn even more about this industry and lead the fight to promote and protect this burgeoning sector of our economy.Last week, as the 5th anniversary of the second most catastrophic natural disaster in U.S. history came about, I reflected on my experience and the experience of millions of Texans as we endured the wrath of Hurricane Harvey. What we witnessed in the wake of this storm was incredible – a true testament to the spirit and resolve of Texans. I watched as people came together, heroically going out to rescue their friends and neighbors. Whether it was jumping in bass boats or swimming in treacherous waters, it was one Texan helping another Texan.This July, I battled to secure the inclusion of many measures to weatherize our coast. I was proud to lead the fight for these coastal provisions, dubbed the Ike Dike, and win. Having learned from mistakes of the past, we know we need to be prepared and put in place strong mitigation measures to protect and keep people safe during hurricane season. I am proud to have fought for the safety of all Texans, relentlessly advocating for this provision to be added into the Senate version of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) for this year.I thoroughly enjoyed meeting with Galveston County officials, with whom I worked closely to protect for the millions of vulnerable Texans in areas susceptible to hurricane damage. Our tourof the proposed construction sites allows us to see the positive impact that this legislation will have on Texans for generations to come.Fortunately, I was able to meet with leaders in many other counties across the state as well. I spoke to officials in Burleson, Milam and Lee Counties to discuss the federal issues currently impacting each of those areas. In my home county of Harris, I was privileged to meet with the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership to visit with key aerospace industry leaders. I have always enjoyed being on the front lines of the fight to ensure our space program continues to define greatness at a global level and is provided with the tools necessary to pursue innovation. In fact, this Wednesday, I enjoyed participating in a NASA ribbon-cutting as they awarded Collins Aerospace a contract to produce new space suits.I am proud to champion America’s leadership in space exploration, and the leadership of Texas in that effort. This spacesuit unveiling was an important part of the Cruz-Nelson NASA Transition Act of 2017, my legislation that required NASA to actually put pen to paper and pull together a detailed plan for replacing our current space suits with the next generation of space suits. This helped lead to where we are today—actual contracts awarded and jobs being created.After these fantastic four weeks spent crossing the Lone Star State, I’m preparing to return toWashington after Labor Day to fight for the people of Texas in our nation’s capital. As Congress heads back into session, I’m committed to combat the Biden-Harris administration’s repeated failures, from their inhumane border policies, to their skyrocketing inflation, to their expansion of the size and power of the federal government. Read my statement about their illegal debt cancellation of student loans here, and join me in the effort to #AbolishtheIRS and prevent 87,000 new IRS agents from coming after our wallets. Finally, I want to close with a Texas-sized shoutout to the Pearland Little League team, for representing Texas in the Little League World Series! A TEXAS-SIZED SHOUTOUT TOPEARLAND’S VERY OWN TEAM TEXAS FOR THEIR FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE IN THE LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES! Keep Texas Strong,        Ted Cruz "
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/blogs/e-newsletter-week-of-august-5th,"As my team and I come to the end of the fourth week of session in the Senate, we are in the middle of a fight on President Biden’s Schumer-Manchin-revived Build Back Broke tax-and-spend package. If you drive a pickup truck, suburban, or minivan and are already struggling to fill up your gas tanks, this bill will make it worse. It contains new energy taxes that violate Biden’s pledge of no new taxes on the middle class. The Schumer-Manchin bill also contains provisions that will bankrupt West Virginia coal miners by undoing the Supreme Court’s decision in West Virginia v. EPA. Beyond that, this bill will fund 87,000 new IRS agents, a massive influx who will target small businesses and middle class workers in Texas and around the country. Finally, this bill includes a new corporate minimum tax that will punish Texan manufacturers and keep them from investing in new production.Even as we fight against this new threatening bill, we continue working tirelessly to address the many unresolved issues facing our nation. This includes the Biden Border Crisis. I have been fighting hard to secure our border from the Mexican cartels and their rampant drug and human trafficking.Unfortunately, the Biden administration has been doing the opposite. It has failed to enforce the laws that protect our nation, instead spreading false narratives about the crisis. Because of this, on Monday I introduced a Sense of the Senate Resolution to highlight the Biden administration’s failed border policies and provide an accurate account of what occurred in Del Rio last year when mounted Border Patrol officers were falsely accused of “whipping” illegal immigrants.Read the full release here. I have always been impressed with the humanity shown by our Border Patrol to illegal aliens, many of whom have been abused or worse by the cartels that smuggle them to the border.On Thursday, I took to the floor of the U.S. Senate to relay my concern for Colombia's freedom to my colleagues. This weekend, on Sunday, Colombia will become the 10th government in the region controlled by the hard left when the country’s new president, Gustavo Petro, will take office. I am deeply worried that, once he does, Colombia will join the ranks of anti-American forces in Latin America.To hear my remarks, click the image below. Watch my remarks about Colombia here ↑ Wednesday, I introduced the Catch Up Our Kids Act of 2022, legislation to combat learning loss that American children incurred as a result of COVID-19 pandemic-related school closures. Because Democrats dragged their feet about reopening schools, even after science revealed COVID-19 had a minimal impact on children, millions of kids fell behind educationally. This outcome is far more harmful than the pandemic. As a father, I am eager to address this foundationally important issue. Read the release here.  “Senator Cruz’s bill confirms what we already knew: he is a staunch supporter of educational freedom. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted significant problems in the way our current education system operates, and the only real answer is securing parental rights in education by expanding school choice.” -          American Federation for Children  Lastly, but certainly not least, I am proud to have supported the 1.4 million veterans in Texas with my Tuesday evening vote for the PACT Act. I supported the bill because we need to take care of our veterans who have sacrificed so much to keep us safe. However, I’m disappointed that we couldn’t come together to fix a Democrat-created budget gimmick that will allow Congress to subsequently spend another $400 billion in pork, on top of and completely unrelated to the laudable funding in this bill for veterans harmed by burn pits.Rest assured, I will always be the strongest supporter of our brave men and women who serve in the United States Military. By answering the call to serve, you have secured liberty for every American. Your heroic service does not go unnoticed.

Perhaps most notoriously, but certainly not exclusively, she is deeply implicated in the 2015 death of Argentine Special Prosecutor Alberto Nisman, who was found shot in his apartment the day before he was set to present evidence to the Argentine Congress that would have proved Fernández de Kirchner colluded with Iran to cover up Iran’s role in the 1994 bombing of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA) in Buenos Aires, the worst terrorist attack in Argentina's history.“Last week, an Argentine Federal Prosecutor formally implicated Fernández de Kirchner in what he described as “the biggest corruption scheme ever known in the country,”“The evidence supporting the charges against Fernández de Kirchner is public, credible, and now backed by Argentina’s judicial system. Simply what has been verified if only by default – what her defenders have all but conceded – is already as or more significant than the evidence that the State Department recently presented as part of its justification for designating Velazquez. Meanwhile the consequences and threats of Fernández de Kirchner’s corruption stretch globally.“I therefore urge you to process past and recent information about Fernández de Kirchner’s corrupt acts, and to impose a Section 7031(c) designation on her and immediate family members. As always, I stand ready to provide you and the Department with the resources you need to expeditiously conduct these important tasks.”The full text of the letter can be found here.###"
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-sen-cruz-tours-proposed-coastal-texas-construction-sites-commemorates-harvey,"GALVESTON, Texas – U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) met with Army Corps of Engineers Galveston District leadership on Wednesday, August 24th and toured proposed construction sites for the Bolivar Roads Gate System and the Galveston Ring Barrier System as part of the Coastal Texas Program.This year, Sen. Cruz won inclusion of authorization for the Coastal Texas Program, commonly referred to as the Coastal Spine or Ike Dike, in a water resources infrastructure bill, which will better protect coastal Texans from major storms. Following the tour, Sen. Cruz said:“We just spent the last several hours in a very productive meeting with the leadership with the Army Corps of Engineers and with the leadership here along the Gulf Coast. It is very encouraging to see the steady and consistent progress we’re making towards building a Coastal Spine that will protect the Gulf Coast from the next hurricane that we know is coming. This has been a long project in the making. Going back to Hurricane Ike and the initial discussions of an Ike Dike. That since expanded substantially and became a much more comprehensive system to deal with and prevent the catastrophic damage that a storm surge can cause.“But it’s also wise to learn from disasters in the past. I grew up in Houston. If you live in the Gulf Coast, you’re going to face hurricanes. That’s just the way it's always been, and I suspect the way it always will be. But we need to be smart and prepared and put in place strong mitigation to protect and keep people safe. And so I want to commend the local leaders who are working so hard with the state leaders and with the federal leaders to come together with a smart, targeted, serious plan to try to minimize the damage of the next disaster that comes our way, and to try to protect human life to the maximum extent possible, and protect our homes and businesses and economy going forward.”Reflecting on Hurricane Harvey, Sen. Cruz said:“Five years ago, I was proud to lead the effort to pass $89 billion initially in flood relief and hurricane relief for the state of Texas in the wake of Harvey, was proud to author targeted tax relief for those who were victims of damage of hurricane Harvey. And we came through it“Tomorrow is the fifth anniversary of when Hurricane Harvey made landfall five years ago. Today, the hurricane was in the Gulf Coast about to make landfall. Every one of us remembers the horrific challenges that Hurricane Harvey posed: the damage – it was the second most costly natural disaster in U.S. history – the scope of the damage from Corpus Christi all the way up to Orange, Texas. Massive damage, wind damage, flooding damage. “Thinking back to five years ago when Hurricane Harvey hit, I was at home in Houston with my family. And over the days and weeks that followed, what we saw was incredible. We saw Texans come together with a unity, with a resolve. While the hurricane was here, we saw Texans heroically going out to rescue their friends and neighbors, rescue them from harm’s way. We saw people jumping in bass boats and going to pull their neighbor out of trouble. It was one Texan helping another Texan.” In the wake of Hurricane Harvey’s devastation in 2017, Sen. Cruz visited with victims, volunteers, first responders, and local officials in every region affected by the storm. He worked with Sen. Cornyn to bring $89 billion in federal aid to Texas, established a bilingual Hurricane Harvey recovery working group to address Texans’ needs, worked with colleagues on legislation to help Texans applying for disaster assistance, and co-authored the federal law that provided crucial and immediate tax relief to storm survivors along the Gulf Coast. Another law authored by Sens. Cruz and Cornyn expedited distribution of $4.3 billion in disaster recovery funding for community development block grants. ###"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) today issued the following statement in response to the Biden administration’s announcement that they will be rolling out a student loan debt cancellation plan beginning in January 2023. “The highest concentration of student loan debt is held by people in Washington, DC. This administration’s policy is to force blue collar workers and American families across the country to pay off the cost of a Washington bureaucrat’s college degree – it’s morally bankrupt. “This announcement is a gut punch to every hard working single mother who worked double shifts in order to pay for her own education, every parent who borrowed against their home to send their kid to college, Americans who sacrificed to make responsible financial decisions, and our nation’s veterans and service members who risked their lives to earn the G.I. Bill.“Let’s be clear - there is no way to ‘cancel’ student debt. This will cost every taxpayer an average of $2100. Someone will pay the price for this policy and the price is likely to be felt by every American in the form of even higher inflation. This administration is exceeding its legal authority and illegally burdening hard-working Americans with debts they didn’t take on themselves.”###"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today issued the following statement in response to statements by Biden administration officials that they are prepared to accept Iran’s terms for entering a new nuclear deal:“A year ago, Joe Biden gave Afghanistan to the Taliban. Now he intends to give a nuclear arsenal to Iran. The details of this deal are only now emerging, but we already know they will be catastrophic to the national security of America and our allies, and to the safety of Americans.“The Iranian regime right now is trying to hunt down and murder former American officials and dissidents on American soil. This deal will quickly flood the regime with hundreds of billions of dollars, and soon afterwards the deal will be worth trillions. It will dismantle sanctions on the Iranian economy, which is controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and provides the IRGC with the resources it needs to export its terrorism globally.“Meanwhile, the Iranian regime violated the last nuclear deal, violated their most fundamental nuclear obligations beyond the deal, and violated international norms against nuclear proliferation. This deal will excuse Iran from that previous cheating, while enabling it to continue into the future. It repeats the inexplicable folly of the previous nuclear deal by legalizing the regime's nuclear program, which had previously been prohibited by multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions. According to the deal, using waivers the Biden administration has already been providing, Russia and Putin can now help build up Iran's nuclear program. It will eventually be used to develop nuclear weapons that will inflict destruction on America and our allies. When the Ayatollah chants ‘Death to America’ and ‘Death to Israel,’ he means it.“Thousands of people will die because of the Iranian terrorism enabled by this deal. Tens of millions may die because of the nuclear arsenal it will provide to the Ayatollah.“I intend to systematically fight the implementation of this catastrophic deal, and will work with my colleagues to ensure that it is blocked and eventually reversed in January 2025.”###"

The regime must immediately release the Matagalpa clergy and other dissidents they have imprisoned, and Nicaraguan officials should understand that the United States will hold them responsible and accountable for the safety of those prisoners. President Biden should forcefully respond to the recent round of brutality, and if he doesn't Congress should move expeditiously to mandate such responses.”###"

Cruz’s amendment would remove funding for a new army of IRS agents who will surveil innocent Americans and small businesses with 1.2 million additional audits, half of which will target Americans making less than $75,000 a year.“There are a lot of bad things in this bill. But few are worse than the proposal by Democrats in this bill to double the size of the IRS and create 87,000 new IRS agents. I guarantee you citizens in every one of our states, if you ask them, what do they want, they don't want 87,000 new IRS agents. And they’re not being created to audit billionaires or giant corporations. They’re being created to audit you. The House Ways and Means Committee, the minority, has put out an estimate that under this bill, there will be 1.2 million new audits per year, with over 700,000 of those new audits falling on taxpayers making $75,000 or less. I believe personally we should abolish the IRS. But at a minimum, we shouldn’t make the IRS larger than the Pentagon, the State Department, the FBI and the Border Patrol all combined.

Cruz said:“In D.C. the rate of vaccination for students 12 to 15 is 85 percent. For African American students, the rate drops to 60 percent. The D.C. public schools have announced any student that is not vaccinated is not allowed to come to school.

Cruz’s amendment would block the United States from selling our emergency crude oil stockpile to China, following news that President Biden had sold at least two million barrels of American crude oil from our strategic stockpile to the Chinese Communist Party’s state-owned oil and gas company Sinopec.Before the vote on this amendment, Sen. Cruz said:“This bill represents the most significant assault on U.S. energy production the Senate has ever considered. It is designed to bankrupt every coal miner in America, to dramatically increase gas prices consumers are paying, and to permanently harm U.S. oil and gas production. There is however, one group who the Senate Democrats do not oppose having more oil, and that is the Chinese Communists. In the past year, President Biden has sold over two million barrels of oil to the Chinese Communist government from America’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil was paid for by U.S. taxpayers. My bill would block the president from selling our oil to the Chinese communists. I would note also that it was sold to a Chinese company owned by the communist government, in which a significant stake was owned by a private equity firm, owned in significant part by the President’s own son, Hunter Biden. If the Democrats don’t want to see millions of barrels of U.S. oil sold to the Chinese Communists, they should support my amendment.”Watch Sen. Cruz’s remarks here.###"

Cruz’s motion to commit would have blocked the Department of Justice and the FBI from using their resources to inappropriately target parents or classify them as “domestic terrorists” based on the parents’ advocacy at school board meetings, as long as their actions are legal.

https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-colleagues-introduce-asylum-accountability-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas), in conjunction with Senators Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) introduced the Asylum Accountability Act. This legislation would impose a significant increase in the penalty for illegal aliens who fail to appear in immigration court by permanently barring them from gaining any future benefit under the Immigration and Nationality Act.The unsustainable increase in illegal entries at our southern border are due in part to the misconception by illegal immigrants that they will be able to submit a fraudulent asylum application to get a court date, dodge their scheduled court date, and then continue to reside in the United States free of consequences. The failure to secure our border and end fraudulent asylum applications combined with the limitations placed on law enforcement and the Border Patrol by the Biden Administration is the very reason illegal aliens continue to pour across our borders. The current 10-year penalty is clearly insufficient in deterring absconders and does not adequately compel them to appear in court. About the bill, Sen. Cruz said:“Too many asylum claimants are illegal aliens trying to flaunt our laws and ignore immigration court requirements. We need to crack down on people who are abusing our generous asylum system and send the message that America is a country of laws, and if you do not want to obey them, you can’t stay here. This is fair and just, supporting those who actually need asylum while ensuring America’s generosity is not abused. It’s long overdue, and I’m proud to support these reforms to permanently ban anyone who ignores our immigration courts.”Background:Under current law, an illegal alien who fails to appear for their immigration court hearing will be deportable and banned from entering the United States for 10 years. Because of the Biden Administration’s failed catch and release policies, the current wait time for an asylum case to be completed is 4 ½ years. Illegal immigrants are taking advantage of our asylum system by making an asylum claim then running out the clock and never showing up for their immigration court hearing.Read the text of the bill here.###"

His catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan and his inexplicable decision to greenlight Vladimir Putin’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline combined to embolden and enable Putin to invade Ukraine. Now, Putin will only grow more reckless, endangering the food and energy supply lines that Americans rely on for safety and prosperity.“Finland and Sweden will greatly benefit NATO and therefore America’s national security, and will deter further Russian aggression. They are advanced, wealthy countries with high incomes that will contribute greatly to NATO’s capabilities immediately and in the years to come. Both are situated in geographically critical areas. Finland has a large armed forces and almost a million reservists, and of course a history of countering Russian aggression. Sweden’s navy is extensive and experienced, and the Swedes have been enlarging and strengthening the full range of surface, undersea, anti-tank, air combat, and air defense forces.“The only way to address the global threats we face is by supporting our allies around the world. Beyond Europe, China poses the most significant geopolitical threat to American national security.  As we’ve seen Team Biden try to pivot to a warm embrace of Communist China, it’s important that the United States stands firm with our allies in NATO and by expanding NATO to include Finland and Sweden it sends a loud and clear message to the Chinese Communist Party that America stands firm with our allies.”###"
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cruz-introduces-legislative-package-to-combat-covid-19-learning-loss,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) today introduced the Catch Up Our Kids Act of 2022, legislation that would combat K-12 learning loss that American children incurred due to school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly every K-12 school switched to remote learning in the Spring of 2020, not returning to in-person learning until Fall 2020 at the earliest, and for many it was longer. Because of this, students fell behind in math and reading, and low-income students were the hardest hit.The Catch Up Our Kids Act would allow parents to take back control of their child’s education so children can recover from any learning loss resulting from misguided and politically driven pandemic school closures. This proposal includes a mix of tax incentives and re-allocation of some Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER) funding. As of June 2022, states have not spent the majority of their ESSER allotment.About the bills Senator Cruz said:“At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, schools across the country began to close and ‘go virtual’ in order to protect the health and well-being of our kids. But while the science quickly showed that COVID-19’s impact on schoolchildren was minimal, teachers unions, and liberal bureaucrats across the country were slow to return to normal. Because of this, millions of children across the country fell behind educationally – an outcome far more harmful than the pandemic. This is unacceptable, but the Biden administration has done little if anything to help these kids catch up. As a father, I am personally concerned about educating the next generation. This issue is foundationally important, and the Catch Up Our Kids Act will begin to address the learning loss we’ve seen because of the pandemic, and get our kids back on track.”The Catch Up Our Kids Act includes the following:·         Learning Loss Tax Credit: Creates a temporary 3-year Learning Loss Tax Credit of $1,200 per-child to allow the parent or legal guardian of a K-12 student to recoup actual expenses incurred for education-related activities.·         Employer Reimbursement: Temporarily extends the tax provision that allows employers to reimburse an employee for certain tuition and education-related expenses on a tax-free basis to include educational expenses for employee’s children.·         Expand 529 ESAs: Expands Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) to include homeschool expenses for a period of 3 years.·         Double Coverdell Contribution Limit: Doubles the annual contribution limit for Coverdell ESAs from $2,000 to $4,000 per year for a period of 3 years.·         Favorable ESA Gift Exclusion Tax Treatment: Exempts contributions to a 529 ESA and Coverdell ESA from the annual exclusion, ensuring these gifts do not trigger gift tax consequences.·         Reprogram ESSER Money: Allows states to use unspent Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds to fund Scholarship Granting Organizations (SGOs), using ESSER money as seed money. SGOs would then be able to award parents/legal guardians scholarships.Read the legislation here.·  American Federation for Children: “Senator Cruz’s bill confirms what we already knew: he is a staunch supporter of educational freedom. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted significant problems in the way our current education system operates, and the only real answer is securing parental rights in education by expanding school choice.”·  Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist: “Democrats immorally shut down schools across the country using COVID as an excuse to do the bidding of teachers’ union bosses. Meanwhile, Republicans are dedicated to expanding school choice and protecting parental control in their children’s education. Sen. Cruz’s bill cuts taxes for parents who did the right thing and made sure their kids were educated when their schools failed them. The bill also expands education savings accounts and empowers families to make the best education decisions for themselves. Americans for Tax Reform applauds the introduction of Senator Cruz’s Catch Up Our Kids Act.”·  American Principles Project: “Since the onset of the COVID pandemic, public health officials, working hand-in-hand with teachers unions, have done terrible harm to our nation’s families, shutting down schools and setting students significantly behind in their education. And thanks to the monopoly our government has over education, many parents were all but powerless to help their kids. It’s time for that to change. Sen. Cruz’s legislation would be a welcome step towards putting parents back in charge of ensuring their children receive the best education possible. APP fully supports the Catch Up Our Kids Act, and we encourage all pro-family lawmakers to sign on as well.”·  Center for Urban Renewal and Education President &Founder Star Parker: “The ‘Catch Up Our Kids Act’ will empower parents – not government – to make educational decisions on behalf of their children. Millions of students suffered from ill-advised COVID lockdowns, especially children from low-income families, and this legislation will allow parents to guide the educational recovery process for their children. I am pleased to express my strong support for this timely initiative.”·  Concerned Women for America’s Legislative Action Committee, CWA CEO and President Penny Nance: “This is the Year of the Parent, and Senator Ted Cruz’s ‘Catch Up Our Kids Act’ gives parents the tools they need to help their kids take ownership over learning lost during the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic has revealed with greater clarity why choice in education really matters. We are grateful to Senator Cruz for this important bill that enables parents to have greater access and control over the money necessary to pay for educational activities that are best for their children.”·  FreedomWorks President Adam Brandon: “Heavy-handed lockdown policies destroyed the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans. Not the least affected are students suffering from severe learning loss due to mass school closure. Senator Ted Cruz’s Catch Up Our Kids Act works to help the students whose education was upended by government lockdowns and embraces the idea that parents should be able to choose their child’s best path for success.”·  Independent Women’s Voice: “School districts and unions hold all the power when it comes to education. The Catch Up Our Kids Act recognizes that the best way to effectively address the learning loss crisis we are in and get students back on track is to put power back into the hands of parents. The bill empowers parents by directing education funding towards students. We thank Senator Cruz for prioritizing parental rights and educational freedom, not bureaucratic systems and union control.”·  Texas Public Policy Foundation CEO Greg Sindelar: “We are grateful to Senator Cruz for recognizing millions of children are behind due to school closures during the Covid-19 pandemic, and his commitment to helping every child catch up. The ‘Catch Up Our Kids Act’ will help address our nation’s student learning loss problems by providing resources directly to parents who are looking to help their children. We fully support the ‘Catch Up Our Kids Act’ and hope to see it passed quickly.”###"

While I ultimately supported the bill, because we need to take care of our veterans who have sacrificed so much to keep us safe, I’m disappointed that we couldn’t come together to fix the Democrat-created budget gimmick that will allow Congress to subsequently spend another $400 billion in pork, on top of and completely unrelated to the laudable funding in this bill for veterans harmed by burn pits. Now it’s up to Republicans to clean up this mess by lowering the discretionary cap — so that we protect every penny of veterans funding but prevent unrelated pork — when Republicans retake the majority. Having the back of our nation’s veterans doesn’t just mean making sure those who served get the care they rightly deserve. It also means stopping the Democrats’ irresponsible spending spree and curbing inflation and price increases that hurt all Americans, including our veterans.”Throughout his career, Sen.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) today introduced a Sense of the Senate Resolution detailing the Biden Administration’s failed border policies, and explaining how these policy decisions have created the illegal immigration and drug crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border. The resolution also describes what actually happened along the border in Del Rio last year, when mounted Border Patrol officers were falsely accused of “whipping” illegal immigrants.About this resolution, Senator Cruz said:“The real problem is not the way Border Patrol agents treat illegal aliens, but the way the Biden administration encourages immigrants to break the law while undermining the heroes who are serving our country along the U.S.-Mexico border. I’ve been at the border numerous times, and I am always impressed with the humanity that our Border Patrol shows to illegal aliens who have been abused or worse by the cartels who smuggle them to the border. The Biden administration was not only complicit in the fake news narrative that developed about our mounted agents in Del Rio last year, but they actively fanned the flames. It is insulting for CBP to recommend those agents be reprimanded following an investigation that produced zero evidence of whipping. Congress must stand for the rule of law, and stand with our brave Border Patrol agents.”Read the legislation here.This resolution:·         Acknowledges the presence of an ongoing crisis on our southern border.·         Commends U.S. Border Patrol agents for their response to an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.·         Concludes that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ought to commend, rather than punish, Border Patrol agents who answered the nation’s call to respond to this crisis.###"

Ted Cruz released the following statement after voting to support the 2022 Water Resources Development Act, which included numerous provisions to help Texas that he and his staff worked to ensure were included in the bill.“Strong coastal protection and water infrastructure is vital not just for the Texas Gulf Coast, but for the economy of the entire Lone Star State. I was proud to fight for the needs of Texans, and make sure that the Houston and Corpus Christi communities have the resources and tools they need to further economic development and public safety. I look forward to using my position in the U.S. Senate to continue fighting for policies like this, not just for the Texas Gulf Coast and our port communities and employers, but for Texans across the state.”Below is a list of the pro-Texas provisions that Sen. Cruz and his office ensured were included in the final bill:###"
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-issues-statement-on-us-economic-recession,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) issued the following statement after this morning’s release by the Bureau of Economic Analysis indicating that the U.S. economy has officially entered a period of recession.Sen. Cruz said:“Despite the brazen gaslighting from this administration and their cronies in the corrupt corporate media, we are in fact now in the Biden recession thanks to reckless spending by Democrats. It’s time for this White House to take responsibility, acknowledge reality and reverse course before we see more American families suffer.”Historically, an economic recession has been defined as two consecutive negative quarters of GDP growth. Senator Cruz recently introduced a resolution with Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.) to cement the historic definition of an economic recession. Read about the resolution here. ###"
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-issues-statement-on-chips-plus-vote,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Commerce Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued the following statement regarding his no vote on the CHIPS-Plus bill: “Our dependence on semiconductors manufactured abroad is a serious vulnerability. Right now, an enormous amount of the most complex semiconductors are built in Taiwan, where they are vulnerable to everything from natural disasters to Chinese aggression. That’s why I’m enthusiastically in support of taking common-sense steps to bring semiconductor manufacturing – and manufacturing in general – back to the United States. And I’m proud that many of these semiconductors will be built in Texas.“However, the CHIPS-Plus is the wrong approach to this laudable goal. I’m all for using the tax code to incentivize manufacturers to build semiconductors in America, but when the federal government simply gives billions of taxpayer dollars directly to massive corporations, it invites cronyism and corruption. Corporate welfare is the wrong approach to solving a serious problem. The CHIPS-Plus bill allows companies to take American taxpayer dollars without adequate safeguards to ensure American tax dollars are spent here at home to increase American chip production.“This bill does contain several provisions that I’m honored to have championed, including the FABS Act, which would incentivize manufacturing in the U.S. through tax credits for investments here at home. The FABS Act would require chip manufacturers to invest in the U.S. in order to qualify for the tax benefit. In that sense it will help prevent waste, fraud, and abuse while also ensuring the government is not picking winners and losers.  ""Importantly, the bill also includes several provisions that I authored, including extending the International Space Station through 2030, furthering NASA’s exploration efforts, and creating a Moon to Mars Program, which will establish a specific office at NASA to focus solely on putting the boots of American explorers back on the Moon and eventually on Mars. The State of Texas, and especially the Johnson Space Center in Houston, will play an outsized role in making these goals a reality, of administering this new Moon to Mars Program, and ensuring NASA, and the United States, are successful in space exploration. The space provisions in this bill will bolster America’s leadership in space, and I was proud to fight for them.“On balance, although there is much good in this bill, it takes the wrong approach of direct corporate subsidies rather than a more targeted and strategic approach to bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.”Senator Cruz has been a champion for NASA throughout his time in the Senate. He has previously served as the top Republican on the Commerce Committee’s space subcommittee, where he helped secure the extension of the International Space Station to 2024 as part of the most recently enacted NASA authorization, led the effort to extend the ISS, and worked to ensure that the Johnson Space Center remains the home of manned spaceflight in the United States. ###"

No parent should be forced to send their children to failing schools, which is why I’m glad my friend Governor Abbott is so fervently supporting school choice.

https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-colleagues-defend-service-members-from-vaccine-punishment-with-americans-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and 13 of his colleagues have introduced the Allowing Military Exemptions, Recognizing Individual Concerns About New Shots (AMERICANS) Act of 2022. The legislation counters the Biden administration’s efforts to coerce and punish service members who decline the COVID-19 vaccine, and introduces accountability measures in response to DOD efforts to undermine transparency.The bill is co-sponsored by Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Roger Marshall (R-Ks.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), James Risch (R-Idaho), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), and Steve Daines (R-Mont.).This bill would require the Secretary of Defense to make every effort to retain unvaccinated service members, strengthen language to ensure service members receive discharge classifications commensurate with their record of service, require the Department of Defense to report the number and type of COVID-19 vaccine religious exemptions that have been denied, and create an exemption from COVID-19 vaccine requirements for service members with natural immunity. The act would also protect service academy students and Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) members in the same way.About the bill, Sen. Cruz said:“It is absolutely unacceptable that the Biden administration is trying to coerce our men and women in uniform to violate their conscience and religious beliefs, let alone on an issue as polarizing as the COVID-19 vaccine. The AMERICANS Act will ensure that these and similar efforts to politicize our military on this issue are blocked.”Sen. Cruz previously sponsored Sen. Roger Marshall’s (R-Kansas) NDAA amendment to protect service members who refused to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Sen. Cruz previously offered the vaccine exemption and reporting requirements as amendments to the FY2022 NDAA. While the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2022 contained provisions to protect service members, those provisions were weakened by Democrat leadership during the House and Senate conference on the bill before final passage.Read the bill here.###"
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/ted-cruz-the-biden-administrations-antagonism-toward-oil-and-gas-is-hurting-texans,"Gasoline prices were rising before Russia invaded Ukraine, and it was because of White House policy.A year ago, Russian hackers breached the network of the biggest pipeline in the country and demanded a ransom to unlock the system. Within 90 minutes, the pipeline was shut down for the first time in 57 years, and the transport of 2.5 million barrels of fuel a day, about 45% of the Eastern Seaboard’s supply, ground to a halt.The Colonial Pipeline crisis should have been a wake-up call for Democrats, from the Northeast governors who won’t allow pipelines to deliver fuel from neighboring states to President Joe Biden, whose administration has made it exceedingly difficult for energy producers to return to pre-COVID-19 production numbers.Despite the lesson of the pipeline attack, a year later the state of American energy is, holistically speaking, worse: When Biden took the oath of office, the average retail price of gasoline was $2.38 a gallon. On Monday, according to AAA, it was $4.32. In some parts of the country, we’ve seen gas prices reach as high as $6.90 a gallon.That is not an accident. It’s not an unintended side effect. Nor was it principally the result of the war in Ukraine. This was the result of the Green New Deal zealots in the Biden administration and their desire to put an end to oil and gas. Before Putin invaded Ukraine, gasoline prices had already risen 48% since Biden became president.The Biden administration’s assault on oil and gas production began during his campaign when he pledged during the debates: “No more drilling on federal lands. No more drilling, including offshore. No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill. Period.”And Biden kept his promise. On his first day in office, he canceled the Keystone pipeline. The next week, he halted all federal oil and gas leasing, stopping development in the part of the country that produces 25% of the nation’s energy. On May 7, 2021, while the Colonial Pipeline was shut down and millions of Americans were scrambling for gas, Biden’s Interior Department announced plans to take 30% of public lands out of production.On June 1, Biden revoked oil leases on a section of the North Slope of Alaska totaling 16 billion barrels of oil. To put that number into perspective, in the 70 years of oil and gas drilling in the entire U.S. Gulf of Mexico, drillers have produced 22 billion barrels in total.Ironically, the Biden administration halted permitting on new natural gas interstate pipelines and exports, discouraging investment and production in this crucial resource that powers 40% of the nation’s electricity and greatly lowers carbon dioxide emissions when it replaces coal and other fossil fuels.But Republicans are fighting back against the Biden administration’s antagonism toward the oil and gas industry and keeping up the pressure to undo the damage it’s causing to Texas and the country.For example, I successfully pressed Biden’s secretary of energy to approve pending permits to export half a billion cubic feet a day of clean, U.S. liquefied natural gas. I had placed a hold on a senior Energy Department nominee whom the secretary very much wanted confirmed. I told her I would lift the hold if and only if she approved two pending permits to export LNG from Texas and Louisiana.It worked, and roughly two weeks later, at the end of April, the Department of Energy announced approval of both permits, which means tens of billions of dollars of new development in Texas and Louisiana. It was a major victory for Texas and for American jobs, trade and our European allies, who will now have greater access to U.S. natural gas exports to loosen their dependence on Russian gas.We have the resources and ability to produce clean, affordable energy in America in a way that eludes Russia, China and Venezuela. The Biden administration knows this, and yet stymies production instead of encouraging it.Republicans will continue to press Biden and his administration to change their disastrous course, for the sake of millions of Americans struggling because of high energy prices and for our national security.Ted Cruz is a U.S. senator representing Texas.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and U.S. Congresswoman Michelle Steel (R-Calif.) led a bicameral group of 82 legislators filing an amicus curiae (“friend of the court”) brief to the Supreme Court in the cases Students for Fair Admissions vs. Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions vs. University of North Carolina. At both schools, admissions policies have disenfranchised Asian-Americans, as the schools applied racial preferences to discriminate against Asian-American applicants despite superior GPAs and standardized test scores.In the brief, the members wrote:Harvard College and the University of North Carolina indisputably use race as an important consideration in deciding whom to admit. Record evidence suggests, in fact, that the challenged admissions policies may strive for racial balancing—an aim that is unconstitutional on its face.…Race-conscious admissions decisions inflict a heavy toll on Asian-American students. Treating them differently because of their race is a stark departure from equal protection decisions issued early on by this Court, which guarded Asian immigrants from racial prejudice. And the burdens imposed on petitioner illustrate a wider trend. Asian-Americans are increasingly victimized by discriminatory practices.The senators joining Sen.

While there is much in the world that needs our prayer and faithful service, we must remember that He has so many great things for us to do that He planned long ago. Nothing happens without it all working for His greater glory and for the good of those who believe. As Americans wrestle with the impact and outcomes of the events of the last year, we pray that our hearts and actions as a Nation be directed by Him in every way. We ask that He would renew the strength of every believer and help us stand firm during these difficult times. We pray that we would be found faithful in every way.  Read text of the letter here. ###"
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sens-cruz-lee-lummis-introduce-pause-act-tying-covid-border-restrictions-to-punitive-restrictions-on-americans,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) have introduced the PAUSE Act, which would block the Biden administration from lifting Title 42 health-related restrictions on foreigners seeking to enter the United States. Under the PAUSE Act, Title 42 restrictions would remain in place until all federal public health emergencies for COVID-19 end, and until the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) traveler health risk level for Canada and Mexico are reduced to the lowest level. Sen. Cruz said about the bill: Title 42 protects our public health, and it also is the only tool currently being used to secure our border. If Title 42 is rescinded, it will make the crisis on the border catastrophically worse. Bottom line: As long as the Biden Administration maintains COVID-19 to be an emergency, we need Title 42. If President Biden believes that COVID-19 is still such a threat that fully-vaccinated Americans must wear masks on public transportation, and the Department of Justice is trying to reinstate a mask mandate, then we must continue to block illegal entry into the United States on these same grounds. Texans do not want another COVID-19 outbreak and they do not want the even worse humanitarian crisis that will occur if President Biden revokes Title 42. As long as this administration believes COVID-19 justifies restrictions on the people of Texas, we should be enforcing health-related restrictions along the border as well. Sen. Lee said about the bill: Throughout his time in office, President Biden has been dedicated to restricting the freedoms of Americans due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The one group that seems to be exempted from restrictions consists of illegal immigrants.  This administration has not been testing illegal immigrants for COVID, even though all Americans traveling overseas must be tested before they are allowed back into their own country.  Nor are illegal immigrants subject to any kind of COVID-19 vaccine requirement.  It is nothing short of astounding that the administration is now removing the one tool holding back an unprecedented surge of illegal immigrants.  Biden’s open border policies are dangerous for the health, wellbeing, and safety of the American people.  The PAUSE Act will ensure the last line of defense on our Southern Border is not abandoned by an administration that has no interest in upholding our immigration laws. Sen. Lummis said about the bill: Democrats cannot, in one breath, argue a national public health emergency should remain in place, while simultaneously trying to roll back Title 42 border protections. It makes no sense. The people of Wyoming see the hypocrisy. I applaud Senator Cruz for introducing the PAUSE Act and bringing some common sense to this discussion. Rep. Yvette Herrell (R-N.M.) had previously introduced the PAUSE Act (H.R. 471), which has significant support with 94 cosponsors, in the U.S. House of Representatives. She is also the lead on the House companion to Sen. Cruz’s SHIELD Act, which would codify Title 42. Rep. Herrell said about the bill: Until all mandates, rules, and emergency declarations related to COVID-19 have ended, Title 42 border health protections must remain in place to prevent the introduction of new cases and new strains of the virus at our borders. It is fundamentally unfair to hold Americans to a higher standard than the thousands of illegal immigrants that Joe Biden is allowing to waltz into our communities. The PAUSE Act will preserve Title 42 and help prevent the further destruction of America’s borders by this administration. Read the bill here.### "

https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-and-21-colleagues-oppose-biden-doj-expanding-firearm-definitions-and-creating-national-gun-registry,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) along with 21 colleagues have introduced a Congressional Review Act Joint Resolution of Disapproval (CRA) to prohibit President Biden’s Department of Justice from implementing a new rule to expand firearm definitions. The senators joining Sen. Cruz are Senators James Lankford (R-Okla.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), James Risch (R-Idaho), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), and Rand Paul (R-Ky.). The Biden administration wants to institute a final rule redefining a “firearm” under federal law to not only mean a complete product, but also its individual parts, often included in a weapons parts kit. If implemented, this new rule would require gun kits and gun parts to be regulated as if they were fully functional firearms—meaning they wouldn’t be able to be sold without a serial number or without the buyer having to undergo a background check. The new rule would also require those with Federal Firearms Licenses to retain records permanently, in effect creating a national firearms registry. The current rule, which the Biden administration seeks to change, allows for the disposal of records after 20 years.  About the resolution, Sen. Cruz said:“For the past two years, we’ve seen crime rates skyrocket all across the country, aided by Democrats’ soft-on crime policies and left-wing district attorneys operating like progressive activists instead of law enforcement officers. Democrats would love nothing more than to shift the blame and stoke anti-gun sentiment, and create a permanent national gun registry in the process. By introducing this resolution, we’re pushing back—we want to stop the Biden administration from issuing the final rule expanding the definition of firearms and instituting a national gun registry, we want to stop the false narrative that links the rise in crime to ‘ghost guns’ and firearms, and we want to protect law-abiding citizens who are exercising their Second Amendment rights.”According to the Government Accountability Office, “The CRA allows Congress to review ‘major’ rules issued by federal agencies before the rules take effect. Congress may also disapprove new rules, resulting in the rules having no force or effect.”Read the resolution here.### "

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) released the following statement after the U.S. Department of Energy approved permits for two LNG export companies, including Golden Pass LNG in Houston, Texas, to sell American energy overseas.“At such a critical time for global energy needs, I’m proud to have led the fight to press the Department of Energy to help secure permits for export at two new LNG export facilities. This is a tremendous victory for Texans, American jobs, trade, and our European allies who will now have greater access to our clean natural gas exports. America produces the cleanest energy in the world, and I want to thank Secretary Granholm for listening to my concerns about how the delays in permitting was hurting our economy and working productively with me to finally issue these permits.”“We thank Sen. Cruz for his longstanding support of Golden Pass LNG and we are grateful for his role in securing this opportunity to bring clean energy from Texas to power the world. We also appreciate the DOE granting the authorization to sell our full production capacity of 18.1 MTA to non-FTA countries.  This will strengthen U.S. trade and enhance energy security for our allies.”“Developing American energy infrastructure is vital to delivering reliable and affordable oil and natural gas products for our nation and allies who are depending on our country. We applaud Senator Cruz for his diligence in pushing for approval of DOE permits that will result in jobs here at home and a higher level of energy security. To solve today’s crisis, we must continue to unleash American energy leadership.”Earlier this year, Sen. Cruz introduced the Energy Freedom Act, which would approve all pending LNG export licenses. It would also expedite natural gas pipeline permitting applications, in order to accelerate LNG exporting to Europe and other allies. This would decrease Europe’s reliance on Russian gas, increase domestic jobs, reduce the trade deficit, and promote clean and reliable American energy.###"

The Biden administration had rescinded this critically important ten-year waiver, jeopardizing the healthcare of Texans – including one in three disabled Texans and the two out of every five Texas children who rely on Medicaid for healthcare.“By rescinding our Medicaid waiver, the Biden administration had needlessly threatened the healthcare of many vulnerable Texans. While it’s good to see this action today, our waiver never should have been rescinded in the first place. Having our waiver restored is a big win for Texas and I am proud to have fought hard to ensure this day would come. At the end of the day, the state of Texas knows its own healthcare needs better than the federal government, and this decision puts those needs first.”Sen. Cruz previously led a bicameral letter from members of the Texas delegation to the Biden administration calling for the Department of Health and Human Services to approve Texas’ Medicaid 1115 waiver. In April 2021, Sen. Cruz also sent a letter to HHS regarding CMS’ rescission of Texas’ 1115 waiver. Senator Cruz also used his prerogatives as a Senator to withhold consent from the consideration of a CMS nominee to give Texas maximum leverage in its fight to get the waiver restored.### "
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-and-colleagues-to-introduce-resolution-prohibiting-the-biden-doj-from-expanding-firearm-definitions-and-creating-national-gun-registry,"HOUSTON, TX – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, announced that he will introduce a Congressional Review Act Joint Resolution of Disapproval (CRA) to prohibit President Biden’s Department of Justice from implementing a new rule to expand firearm definitions. Sens. Lankford (R-OK), Braun (R-IN) and Lee (R-UT) are partnering with Sen. Cruz in introducing the resolution.The Biden administration wants to institute a final rule redefining a “firearm” under federal law to not only mean a complete product, but also its individual parts, often included in a weapons parts kit. If implemented, this new rule would require gun kits and gun parts to be regulated as if they were fully functional firearms—meaning they wouldn’t be able to be sold without a serial number or without the buyer having to undergo a background check. The new rule would also require those with Federal Firearms Licenses to retain records permanently, in effect creating a national firearms registry. The current rule, which the Biden administration seeks to change, allows for the disposal of records after 20 years.  Upon announcing that he would introduce the resolution, Sen. Cruz said:“For the past two years, we’ve seen crime rates skyrocket all across the country, aided by Democrats’ soft-on crime policies and left-wing district attorneys operating like progressive activists instead of law enforcement officers. Democrats would love nothing more than to shift the blame and stoke anti-gun sentiment, and create a permanent national gun registry in the process. By introducing this resolution, we’re pushing back—we want to stop the Biden administration from issuing the final rule expanding the definition of firearms and instituting a national gun registry, we want to stop the false narrative that links the rise in crime to ‘ghost guns,’ and firearms, and we want to protect law-abiding citizens who are exercising their Second Amendment rights.”Sen. Lankford said:“Crime is going up in far-left cities because of soft-on-crime policies. Biden’s response is to clamp down on guns put together in a kit. Federal law already prohibits felons from owning or possessing any gun, including so called ‘ghost guns,’” said Lankford. “This is another attempt by the Biden Administration to strip law-abiding citizens of their Second Amendment rights instead of addressing the failed policies that have led to increased crime across the country. This action by the Biden Administration is not going to solve rising crime rates. Senator Cruz and I are pushing to overturn this rule and will introduce a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn it.”###  "
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-demands-mayor-bowser-dc-police-chief-preserve-victims-remains-in-partial-birth-abortion-case,"Houston, TX – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on The Constitution, today sent a letter to Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee III demanding the remains of the five preborn children discovered by police be preserved for future oversight.In the letter, the Senator states:“I write today in my capacity as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, to provide notice of your obligations to preserve evidence for future Congressional oversight hearings.”…“It is a clear injustice that these children may have been murdered or aborted in violation of federal law, and that the D.C. government entities that this Congress oversees are unwilling to investigate the circumstance and may instead destroy all evidence.  It appears that the Metropolitan Police Department has assumed the cause and nature of these children’s deaths without an investigation.  It has recently been brought to my attention that the D.C. government may incinerate the bodies of these five children without conducting an investigation, without performing any autopsies, and without affording these children a proper, respectful burial.”…“I write separately now to speak specifically to some of the oversight actions that justify these preservation demands.  Specifically, I ask that you direct the D.C. Medical Examiner to conduct an autopsy of each of these five children’s bodies consistent with the type of method and detail that would be conducted in a murder investigation.”Read the full letter here and below.Mayor Muriel BowserExecutive Office of the MayorJohn A. Wilson Building1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.Washington, D.C. 20004 Chief Robert J. Contee IIIMetropolitan Police DepartmentHenry J. Daly Building300 Indiana Avenue, N.W.Washington, D.C. 20001 Dear Mayor Bowser and Chief Contee:Re: Evidence Preservation Notice for Congressional OversightI write today in my capacity as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, to provide notice of your obligations to preserve evidence for future Congressional oversight hearings.  As you are aware, the United States Congress holds unique jurisdiction and constitutional authority to oversee the District of Columbia under Article 1, Section 8, Clause 17 of the United States Constitution.  This oversight role is especially critical where it appears that the executive leadership of Washington, D.C. may destroy evidence of serious alleged violations of federal law involving constitutional issues.In this instance, D.C. Metropolitan Police recently discovered evidence suggesting that local abortionists violated Congressional prohibitions on partial-birth abortion.  These officers recovered the remains of five preborn children—babies whose bodies appear to have been gruesomely mutilated during partial-birth abortions or even killed after botched abortion attempts.  These bodies appear to have been recovered from the Washington Surgi-Clinic in Washington, D.C., operated by Dr. Cesare Santangelo, an abortionist who conducts late-term abortions.Under the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, Pub. L. 108-105, 18 U.S.C. § 1531, a partial-birth abortion occurs when a physician partially delivers a living child for the purpose of performing an overt act that intentionally takes the life of the child.  The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the federal ban on partial-birth abortions in Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124 (2007).  The Supreme Court made clear in that opinion that Congress’s ban on partial-birth abortion does not impose an undue burden on abortion.  Additionally, Congress passed the Born Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002, Pub. Law 107-207, 1 U.S.C. § 8, to provide equal protections for children who are born alive during an abortion.  As you are also no doubt aware, the legality of democratically instituted limitations on the contested right to abortion is actively being considered by the Supreme Court this term in the case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.It is a clear injustice that these children may have been murdered or aborted in violation of federal law, and that the D.C. government entities that this Congress oversees are unwilling to investigate the circumstance and may instead destroy all evidence.  It appears that the Metropolitan Police Department has assumed the cause and nature of these children’s deaths without an investigation.  It has recently been brought to my attention that the D.C. government may incinerate the bodies of these five children without conducting an investigation, without performing any autopsies, and without affording these children a proper, respectful burial.In recent days, I have joined letters demanding that you, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) open investigations to determine whether these children were aborted in violation of federal law, specifically the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.  The letter led by Senator Lee, which was sent earlier today to the Department of Justice and the FBI, reiterated similar requests to ensure preservation of each of the five bodies as evidence for future investigations. I write separately now to speak specifically to some of the oversight actions that justify these preservation demands.  Specifically, I ask that you direct the D.C. Medical Examiner to conduct an autopsy of each of these five children’s bodies consistent with the type of method and detail that would be conducted in a murder investigation.  At a minimum, as an alternative, I ask that you ensure the preservation of each of these bodies as evidence for future investigations and Congressional oversight, consistent with the request made in the Lee letter to the Department of Justice and the FBI.It is likely that after the upcoming election in November 2022, control of the Senate will shift to the Republican Party.  At that time, when I am Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, I will schedule hearings on likely violations, like those at issue with these five children, of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 and the Born Alive Infants Protection Act.  I also intend to convene hearings on Big Abortion and the abortion industry writ large, including how this industry has directed faulty, one-sided research; promoted statements suggesting that women cannot be equal under the law or succeed in the workplace without the ability to kill their children in the womb; advertised dangerous abortion on-demand pills that create grave risks of medical complications to both mother and child; and profited from the killing of millions of children. To be clear, the remains of these five children are critical evidence in the Congressional oversight that the Subcommittee on the Constitution will conduct in the imminent future.  Should the Executive Office of the Mayor and the Metropolitan Police Department decide not to conduct timely autopsies, this letter provides notice that these remains should not be destroyed, incinerated, or discarded, but instead should be respectfully preserved so that Congress can conduct necessary and vital oversight.Please confirm proof of your compliance with these evidence preservation demands no later than April 11, 2022.### "
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-demands-answers-from-biden-administration-on-lowering-security-standards-and-raiding-veteran-benefits-to-fund-open-border-agenda,"HOUSTON, TX – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to President Biden urging him to renew Title 42 and pressing him on reports that the administration may lower security standards at the border and raid veteran programs to deal with the self-inflicted crisis at the southern border. According to government estimates, as many as 18,000 illegal immigrants per day are expected to cross the southern border with Title 42 revoked. In preparation, DHS is considering several misguided strategies to deal with the influx of illegal immigrants.According to reports, DHS is considering allowing volunteer staffers and outside contractors to access the federal government’s internal immigration data entry system, which includes sensitive information such as biometric data. If true, these reports seem to indicate that the Biden administration would prefer to cut corners rather than secure the border or renew CBP’s crucial Title 42 authority.Additionally, they are reportedly planning to divert VA medical personnel and deploy them at the border. This occurs in the backdrop of the VA’s announced recommendations to cut or close altogether dozens of VA facilities, including one in the Dallas area. In the letter, Sen. Cruz wrote:“CBP’s Title 42 authority to expel migrants is necessary both to protect public health and to adequately manage the challenges the agency continues to face due to exponential increases in border encounters at the Southern border. I have deep concerns that this Administration may attempt to lower security standards and divert resources away from the Department of Veterans Affairs… specifically, medical personnel, to deal with the consequences of this self-inflicted border crisis.” “[T]he Department of Homeland Security has been considering potential strategies for dealing with the anticipated influx of migrants when CBP’s Title 42 authority is revoked. Reportedly, one such strategy, according to a source from within CBP, includes diverting VA medical personnel and deploying them to the border. The CBP source went on to say “[w]e’re going to take medical services away from people…[w]ho went to combat…to give free medical attention to illegal migrants.“Additionally…DHS is reportedly considering allowing volunteer staffers and outside contractors to access the federal government’s internal immigration data entry system, which includes sensitive information such as biometric data. Lowering security standards by allowing individuals who have not undergone the applicable background check scheme to access this sensitive law enforcement database demonstrates a dangerous and careless disregard for border security. Further, redirecting scarce resources approved by Congress to provide care to our nation’s veterans, especially as our nation is emerging from a pandemic, seems to be callous and a slap in the face to the men and women who put on the uniform to protect our nation. To date, your Administration has failed to deny any of these troubling reports.”Read the full text of the letter here and below.President Joseph R. BidenThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NWWashington, D.C. 20500Dear President Biden:I write to you today to express my continued concern about reports that your Administration may soon rescind Customs and Border Security’s (CBP) legal authority to expel migrants under Title 42 via the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC) March 2020 order. CBP’s Title 42 authority to expel migrants is necessary both to protect public health and to adequately manage the challenges the agency continues to face due to exponential increases in border encounters at the Southern border. Furthermore, I have deep concerns that this Administration may attempt to lower security standards and divert resources away from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), specifically medical personnel, to deal with the consequences of this self-inflicted border crisis.According to reporting late last week, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been mulling around potential strategies for dealing with the anticipated influx of migrants when CBP’s Title 42 authority is revoked. Reportedly, one such strategy, according to a source from within CBP, includes diverting VA medical personnel and deploying them to the border. The CBP source went on to say “[w]e’re going to take medical services away from people…[w]ho went to combat…to give free medical attention to illegal migrants.” That is completely unacceptable.Additionally, as reported by the Washington Free Beacon, DHS is reportedly considering allowing volunteer staffers and outside contractors to access the federal government’s internal immigration data entry system, which includes sensitive information such as biometric data. Apparently, DHS has also proposed expanding the volunteer force to employees at other federal agencies, including the VA. Lowering security standards by allowing individuals who have not undergone the applicable background check scheme to access this sensitive law enforcement database demonstrates a dangerous and careless disregard for border security. To date, your Administration has failed to deny any of these troubling reports.Worse, these disturbing reports occur in the context of the VA’s recommendations to the Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission to close or downsize dozens of facilities across the nation, including the Bonham VA Medical Center (VAMC) in Fannin County, Texas, which serves rural veterans. Dismantling the Bonham VAMC would force rural veterans to travel over 80 miles to the Dallas VAMC for specialty care, as there are “limited community resources in the surrounding rural counties for specialty care and complex care needs” which the VA’s own recommendation admits. The very idea that your Administration’s VA would close a vital resource for Texas veterans while contemplating diverting VA medical personnel to be deployed at the border is baffling and deeply troubling.There has been an outcry from a bipartisan coalition of legislators pleading with you to reverse course on rescinding this authority and to ensure that our border is secure. At a bare minimum, American veterans’ medical care needs should not suffer due to this misplaced policy choice.I call on you to categorically denounce any policy which would result in diverting resources intended for American veterans to migrants at the Southern border. Further, I urge you to secure our Southern border and immediately renew Title 42.  Sincerely, /s/"
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/-sen-cruz-releases-statement-on-judge-jacksons-supreme-court-confirmation-vote,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released the following statement after today’s vote on Judge Jackson’s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court:“Republicans were clear from the outset that we would assess Judge Jackson’s nomination based on her record and judicial philosophy. In examining these qualities throughout the course of these hearings, it became abundantly clear that her record is radical and that she would be an activist on the Supreme Court. Judge Jackson handed out dramatically lower sentences in some of the most heinous criminal cases, well outside of the mainstream – including multiple truly horrific cases involving child pornography. It also became apparent that Judge Jackson will be an activist jurist on the Supreme Court, and a consistent vote to undermine our fundamental rights, such as free speech, religious liberty, and the Second Amendment. Based on Judge Jackson’s abysmal record on criminal sentencing, the repeated incidents in which she has substituted her political preferences in place of the law, and her inability to explain her judicial philosophy, I voted against confirming her to the Supreme Court.”###"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, skewered the Biden administration for their incompetence dealing with skyrocketing gas prices. During today’s hearing, the Senator stated:“Over the past 15 months, we've seen inflation grow higher than any time in the last 40 years. Perhaps the most painful driver of inflation has been the skyrocketing cost of gasoline at the pump. When Joe Biden took the oath of office, the average retail price of gasoline was $2.38 a gallon. Today, it is $4.23 a gallon. In some parts of the country, the price has crossed $6.90 a gallon. This was not an accident. It was not an unintended side effect. Nor was it principally the result of the war in Ukraine. This was the result of the Green New Deal zealots in the Biden administration. They told the American people they would do this. And they kept their promise. And now, the Democrats have discovered they have a problem.”“That's why we're having this hearing. Not to discuss how President Biden launched a war on American energy, and would rather buy gas from the Maduro regime or from Vladimir Putin than from Americans making money here in America. Rather, it's that people don't like paying four and five and six and $7 a gallon to fill up their tank.”“The Biden administration's assault on oil and gas production began during his campaign when he pledged during the debate and I want you to look at what he said. He said quote, ‘No more drilling on federal lands. No more drilling including offshore. No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill. Period. Ends.”“That's what he promised the American people and you know what? He delivered on that promise the first day in office - he cancelled the Keystone pipeline. The next week he halted all federal oil and gas lease sales, stopping development on the part of the economy that produces 24% of America's energy. On May 7, Biden's Interior Department announced plans prohibiting oil gas production on 30% of U.S. federal lands on June 1, but first Biden revoked leases on the North Slope of Alaska, totaling 16 billion barrels of oil in stranded production. On October 7, Biden eliminated Trump's permit streamlining regulations. On October 29, Biden's interior began using the quote, ‘social cost’ of carbon in permitting, which is a new kind of analysis never enacted by Congress designed to get to know and deny permits. And then on March 21, just a few weeks ago, Biden’s Security and Exchange Commission announced a new regulation aimed at reducing investment in oil and gas cutting off capital for drilling. Supply and demand has been how prices have been set from the dawn of time, supply and demand still operates. The Biden administration has waged a war on supply and prices have skyrocketed. This is not an accident. This is not Putin. This is Joe Biden and the Democrats in the Green New Deal and they're desperately looking for a political excuse to blame somebody else for the consequences of what they promised they would do to the American people.”Watch Sen.

https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-sends-letter-to-military-service-academies-fighting-for-the-religious-freedom-of-cadets-and-midshipmen,"HOUSTON, TX – Senator Cruz (R-TX), sent a letter to the United States Air Force Academy, United States Naval Academy, and United States Military Academy West Point today regarding their handling of exemption requests submitted by cadets and midshipman to the institutions’ COVID-19 vaccine mandate. While cadets and midshipmen have been able to apply for exemptions to the COVID-19 vaccine, there are reports that requests based on religious grounds are being routinely denied. As a result, individuals who are denied an exemption will be forced to choose between receiving the COVID-19 vaccine and serving their nation as a part of our armed forces.In the letter, Sen. Cruz wrote:“I am concerned that our nation’s military academies have not given appropriate deference to religious and health exemption requests consistent with laws duly enacted by Congress, such as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and other civil rights laws. I am also deeply troubled with reports concerning the manner in which our nation’s service academies have implemented vaccine-related policies, leading to requests for exemption being summarily denied.“The Biden Administration has clearly overreached when it comes to rules, regulations and orders that impose vaccine mandates on American citizens. In a number of cases, these mandates have been struck down or blocked from going into effect by the courts. …“Any institutional failure to follow our nation’s civil rights laws, including those protecting religious views, undermines the core objective of your institution.“Therefore, it is incumbent on each of you to ensure that every request for a waiver from your institution’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate is fully and fairly considered, consistent with federal civil rights laws.”Read the full text of the letter here and below.Dear Gen. Clark, Gen. Williams and Admiral Buck:I write to express grave concern with the COVID-19 vaccination mandate policies at your institution and to seek information about these policies to ensure your respective academies have instituted a legally compliant system to consider and review religious and health exemption requests submitted by your institution’s cadets or midshipman, as the case may be.My office has received numerous letters from persons enrolled at our nation’s military academies and their families. These letters state that cadets and midshipman are routinely being denied requests for religious and health exemptions with respect to the implementation of the Department of Defense’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate. This is unacceptable.Since the memorandum titled “Mandatory Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination of Department of Defense Service Members” was first issued by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on August 24, 2021, I have repeatedly raised concerns about the manner in which this directive has been implemented, not only as affects military personnel generally but also as to the impact on individuals enrolled in our nation’s military institutions. I am concerned that our nation’s military academies have not given appropriate deference to religious and health exemption requests consistent with laws duly enacted by Congress, such as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and other civil rights laws. I am also deeply troubled with reports concerning the manner in which our nation’s service academies have implemented vaccine-related policies, leading to requests for exemption being summarily denied.The Biden Administration has clearly overreached when it comes to rules, regulations and orders that impose vaccine mandates on American citizens. In a number of cases, these mandates have been struck down or blocked from going into effect by the courts. For example, on January 13, 2022, the Supreme Court struck down the Biden Administration’s vaccine mandate issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) which required COVID-19 vaccines or weekly testing and the wearing of face coverings for all private employers with 100 or more employees.Congress has also weighed in on the vaccine mandate issue. On December 8, 2021, a majority of the United States Senate voted in favor of a resolution of disapproval that would overturn President Biden’s workplace mandate affecting businesses with at least 100 employees. Additionally, on February 17, 2022, the Senate voted 46 to 47, narrowly defeating the Lee-Cruz amendment that would have repealed five of the Biden Administration’s vaccine mandates, including the DOD mandate.In your current capacity, you have taken on the responsibility to lead one of our nation’s finest institutions and to help mold the character and intellect of America’s next generation of military officers. As part of your responsibility, you have a sacred duty to instill in the young men and women enrolled in your academy not only a proper respect for the chain of command in our civilian-led military but also to ensure that officers are able to deduce right from wrong when given an order. Any institutional failure to follow our nation’s civil rights laws, including those protecting religious views, undermines the core objective of your institution.Therefore, it is incumbent on each of you to ensure that every request for a waiver from your institution’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate is fully and fairly considered, consistent with federal civil rights laws. In order to ensure that your institution is following all applicable civil rights laws, I am hereby requesting responses to the following requests and questions listed and ask that you provide your response no later than April 8, 2022. Please provide a separate response to each question below, rather than a narrative response.1. Please provide a copy of all written materials, policies, guidelines, directives, notices and any other materials that explains your academy’s current COVID-19 vaccine policies and the manner in which an individual is able to seek an exemption from that mandate. 2. Please provide a copy of all written materials, guidelines, directives, notices and communications related to COVID-19 vaccines received by your institution from the White House and/or the Department of Defense. 3. Please provide the total number of requests submitted in response to your institution’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate that seek an exemption based on religious grounds or due to sincerely held beliefs. In your answer, please distinguish between requests for exemptions submitted on these grounds by academy employees as compared to cadets/midshipman. 4. Please provide the total number of approvals granted in response to any request for an exemption to your institution’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate based on religious grounds or due to sincerely held beliefs. In your answer, please distinguish between approvals granted to employees as compared to cadets/midshipman. 5. Please provide the total number of requests submitted in response to your institution’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate that seek an exemption based on health reasons or medical purposes. In your answer, please distinguish between requests for exemptions submitted on these grounds by academy employees as compared to cadets/midshipman. 6. Please provide the total number of approvals granted in response to any request for an exemption to your institution’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate based on health reasons or medical purposes. In your answer, please distinguish between approvals granted to employees as compared to cadets/midshipman. 7.

https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-introduces-bills-to-prevent-covid-19-discrimination-in-healthcare,"HOUSTON, TX – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) this week introduced the GIVE LIFE Act (Doss’s Bill) with Sen. Grassley (R-IA) and the Ending Discrimination in COVID-19 Treatments Act. Doss’s Bill is named after a teenage Texan who was denied a kidney transplant because he had not been vaccinated against COVID-19. Both of these bills would ensure that Americans are not discriminated against while trying to access critical, life-saving care. The GIVE LIFE Act would prohibit denying an individual from donating or receiving an organ because of their COVID-19 vaccination status, and from the number of COVID-19 cases in a region being used as a factor in determining eligibility to donate or receive an organ transplant. The GIVE LIFE Act would also prevent Medicare and Medicaid providers from denying services to individuals based on their COVID-19 vaccination status. The Ending Discrimination in COVID-19 Treatments Act would mandate the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to require that providers receiving monoclonal antibodies do not engage in discriminatory practices such as considering someone’s race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, religion, disability, vaccination status, veteran status, political ideology, or speech when allocating the antibodies. There have been reports that states across the country are using race and ethnicity as a factor in determining whether someone is eligible to receive monoclonal antibodies which are critical, life-saving therapies that aide in the recovery from COVID-19. Upon introducing these bills, Sen. Cruz said: “No American should be denied a life-saving drug or organ because of their race, ethnicity, or COVID-19 vaccine status. That is wrong. Unfortunately, we’re seeing this kind of discrimination. My bills would prohibit the federal government from enabling this discrimination, so that every American has access to the care and treatment they need—regardless of their COVID-19 vaccination status or any other contrived criteria.”Jon Schweppe, Director of Policy and Government Affairs at the American Principles Project said: ""COVID-19 has taken far too many American lives—we certainly shouldn't let it take America's soul. But a number of haughty elites have decided that they should be granted a license to discriminate against those who they view as lesser for not obeying the vaccine edicts of Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. Everyone should get the vaccine, but if they don't want it, they shouldn't have to get it, and they certainly shouldn't face any sort of punitive treatment. The idea that medical professionals should be allowed to say who lives and who dies based on whether someone got the vaccine is not only un-American and discriminatory, but it would seem to violate the Hippocratic oath. We should be better than this. The GIVE LIFE Act would safeguard access to life-saving treatment for all Americans—it will save lives. American Principles Project is proud to endorse it.""Adam Brandon, President of FreedomWorks said:“The decision to take the COVID-19 vaccine belongs solely with the individual. It is beyond reprehensible for any person to be denied medical care based on their COVID-19 vaccination status.  “Sen. Ted Cruz's GIVE LIFE Act will protect medical freedom while ensuring access to life-saving organ transplants. The COVID-19 regulatory madness must stop. We thank Senator Cruz for continuing to protect Americans’ medical freedom from the entrenched ‘public health’ establishment.”###"
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-calls-for-senate-judiciary-hearing-on-fbi-rule-breaking-in-sensitive-investigations,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to committee Chairman Dick Durbin today calling on him to conduct a critical oversight hearing into the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s pattern of rule-breaking in sensitive investigations. According to an audit obtained by the Washington Times, FBI agents violated agency rules at least 747 times in 18 months while conducting investigations into politicians, political candidates, religious groups, and the news media. These are exactly the types of sensitive investigations subject to meticulous compliance and oversight requirements to ensure the FBI avoided abusing its immense powers to engage in politically-motivated investigations. The number and nature of the errors reported in the audit suggest a disturbing pattern of mismanagement, misconduct, and abuses within the FBI. In the letter, Sen. Cruz wrote: “As the report details, of the 997 non-compliance errors made, 79% were substantial in nature, meaning they were ‘of significance to the matter and…more than a minor deviation from a … requirement.’ Notably among those is the failure to obtain authorization in opening an investigation, which is “about as radical as it gets.” Further, several portions of the audit, including those regarding investigative methods, search warrants, and recommendations were redacted, presumably to shelter the FBI from public criticism.”…“…I am concerned about Director Wray’s FBI and its pattern of stonewalling. For example, the FBI declined to provide responsive information regarding its 2016 probe of Concerned Women for America as requested by Chairman Grassley and similarly declined to provide simple answers in my recent questioning of Director Sanborne, regarding the FBI’s degree of involvement in January 6th.”“I believe that the Senate would benefit from hearing directly from Inspector General Horowitz, FBI Director Wray, as well as any division directors with knowledge of the audit or the errors detailed in it. I, therefore, call on [Chairman Durbin] to convene a full Committee hearing, or to the extent necessary, a closed hearing of the full Committee, to ensure transparency and accountability.”The full text of Senator Cruz’s letter can be found here. "

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today released a comprehensive review of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s record of handing down significantly lower sentences in criminal cases, but especially lower sentences in cases involving child pornography.The review is linked here and below:Judge Jackson’s sentences have been dramatically lower than comparable averages for both child pornography cases, specifically, and all criminal cases, in general.SENTENCE IMPOSED FOR POSSESSION OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY·         National Average: 68.0 months                       Jackson Average: 29.3 months·         Difference: Jackson imposed sentences 57% less than national average. SENTENCE IMPOSED FOR DISTRIBUTION OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY·         National Average: 135.0 months                        Jackson Average: 71.9 months·         Difference: Jackson imposed sentences 47% less than national average.SENTENCE IMPOSED AT U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR DIST. OF COLUMBIA·         District Average: 39.8 months                Jackson Average: 29.9 months·         Difference: Jackson imposed sentences 24.9% less than D.C. Dist. average.SENTENCE IMPOSED BY ALL U.S. DISTRICT COURTS (NATIONAL AVERAGE)·         National Average: 45.1 months              Jackson Average: 29.9 months·         Difference: Jackson imposed sentence 33.8% less than national average.In addition to the above data, Judge Jackson’s statements at sentencing speak for themselves. The following cases illustrate Judge Jackson’s significantly lenient approach to sentencing child pornographers and her personal policy disagreement with federal sentencing policy.United States v. Cane (2019): In Cane, the defendant amassed a collection of over 6,500 files depicting school-age children, including elementary school children who were engaged in sexual conduct and sadomasochistic acts such as with adult men and foreign objects. Judge Jackson failed to apply sentencing enhancements to address the significant number of files at issue and she did not apply the enhancement for sadistic or masochistic content, as recommended by the probation office. Judge Jackson “modified the facts” against probation’s recommendation, ordering thousands of files excluded from consideration at sentencing. She ultimately handed down the lowest allowable sentence: 60 months (the mandatory minimum).Key Quote from Judge Jackson in this case: “[You’re] obviously aware of my policy disagreement.  I just think it’s very, very hard to deal with number of images as a significant aggravator…”United States v. Hawkins (2013): In Hawkins, the 18-year-old defendant downloaded child pornography depicting prepubescent boys, ages 8 to 12, engaging in sexual acts with other children and adults. Defendant uploaded 37 such images to a file-sharing service. Law enforcement ultimately discovered 17 videos and 16 images saved on the defendant’s computer. Judge Jackson’s sentence of 3 months was significantly lower than every other recommendation (18 months from probation, 24 months from the prosecutor, and 97 to 121 from the Sentencing Guidelines). After serving his short sentence, defendant reoffended and violated the terms of supervised release in 2019. Judge Jackson placed him in a halfway house for six months.Key Quotes from Judge Jackson in this case:United States v. Cooper (2019): In Cooper, the defendant pled guilty to distribution of child pornography. He had posted graphic depictions of prepubescent male children to his blog, and saved over 600 additional videos and images on his personal devices. The videos and images depicted sadomasochism, including sexually explicit images depicting bondage of young children, usually male, ranging in age from prepubescent to teenaged. Videos depicted prepubescent children engaging in sexual acts with each other and with adults. Because the prosecutor knew that Judge Jackson held fundamental policy disagreements with some of the aggravating Guidelines factors, the prosecutor noted he had intentionally not argued for some enhancements that would have resulted in a higher Guideline range. Judge Jackson noted during sentencing that in similar cases nationwide, judges issued average sentencings ranging from 84 to 92 months.  Judge Jackson ultimately gave the lowest sentence she could give under law: 60 months (the mandatory minimum).Key Quotes from Judge Jackson in this case:Key Quote from Federal Prosecutor in this case: “I understand from my experience before Your Honor, Your Honor’s objection—policy objections to the . . . sentencing guidelines.”CONCLUSIONJudge Ketanji Brown Jackson has a record of handing down dramatically lower sentences in criminal cases, but especially lower sentences in cases involving child pornography.Resulting in sentences in child pornography cases 47% less than the national average.### "
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-introduces-legislation-prohibiting-unilateral-fed-control-of-a-us-digital-currency,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Commerce Committee, today introduced legislation to prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) directly to individuals. Sen. Cruz’s bill was cosponsored by Sens. Braun (R-IN) and Grassley (R-IA). Specifically, the legislation prohibits the Federal Reserve from developing a direct-to-consumer CBDC which could be used as a financial surveillance tool by the federal government, similar to what is currently happening in China. The bill aims to maintain the dollar’s dominance without competing with the private sector.As other countries, like China, develop CBDCs that omit the benefits and protections of cash, it is more important than ever to ensure the United States’ digital currency policy protects financial privacy, maintains the dollar’s dominance, and cultivates innovation. CBDCs that fail to adhere to these three basic principles could enable an entity like the Federal Reserve to mobilize itself into a retail bank, collect personally identifiable information on users, and track their transactions indefinitely. It is important to note that the Fed does not, and should not, have the authority to offer retail bank accounts.Unlike decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin, CBDCs are issued and backed by a government entity and transact on a centralized, permissioned blockchain. Not only would this CBDC model centralize Americans’ financial information, leaving it vulnerable to attack, it could be used a direct surveillance tool into the private transactions of Americans.Upon introducing the legislation, Sen. Cruz said:“The federal government has the ability to encourage and nurture innovation in the cryptocurrency space, or to completely devastate it. This bill goes a long way in making sure big government doesn’t attempt to centralize and control cryptocurrency so that it can continue to thrive and prosper in the United States. We should be empowering entrepreneurs, enabling innovation, and increasing individual freedom—not stifling it.”### "
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-sends-letter-to-president-biden-urging-him-to-renew-critical-title-42-border-policy,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today sent a letter to President Biden urging him to renew the Title 42 policy, which has played a crucial role the past two years in protecting Americans from COVID-19 by allowing border officials to expeditiously expel illegal immigrants. The Biden administration is reassessing Title 42 on Wednesday, March 30th. There have been reports that rescinding this policy would lead to a massive influx of more than 170,000 illegal immigrants at the southern border. In the letter, Sen. Cruz wrote:“As you may know, there is currently a crisis occurring at the Southern Border. In Texas, South Texas border communities Del Rio and McAllen are already suffering and are running low on resources from dealing with a massive influx of illegal immigrants. These communities cannot further be burdened by a mass influx of illegal immigrants, due to the ending of Title 42. It has been reported that U.S. intelligence officials are privately bracing for a massive influx of more than 170,000 illegal immigrants at the Southern Border if this Title 42 policy is ended.As elected officials, we have a duty to protect the American people and Title 42 has played an integral role in the past two years in doing this. As America continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, our focus should be on securing our borders, rather than opening the flood gates to additional persons.”Read the full text of the letter here and below.Dear President Biden,We must protect Americans and secure the Southern Border. As you know, in March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Title 42 emergency order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This order allows for illegal immigrants to be expelled in order to protect U.S. citizens from COVID-19. I strongly urge you to ensure this policy is renewed before it expires on March 30, 2022. As you may know, there is currently a crisis occurring at the Southern Border.

https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/gop-senators-called-for-ketanji-brown-jacksons-hearing-to-be-adjourned-until-democrats-share-probation-reports-chairman-durbin-denies-request,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on The Constitution, led nine other Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee in writing a letter to Chairman Durbin asking for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation hearing to be adjourned until probations reports and all information that Chairman Durbin and the Democrats on the committee have access to are released to Republicans.During the middle of Judge Jackson’s first day of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, after more than half of Republicans had finished their questions, a Democrat member disclosed that she had access to probation recommendations that were not in the public record. After initial pushback, Democrat staff members admitted that the White House provided them with a summary spreadsheet of probation office recommendations in Judge Jackson’s sentencing cases involving sex offenders. Sen. Cruz and nine other Republicans are now seeking the information underlying the White House’s summary spreadsheet.Judge Jackson has said the probation documents, which the White House used to create the summary spreadsheet, are necessary to understand the cases where she repeatedly issued sentences for child pornographers that were lower than what the prosecution asked for and Sentence Guidelines called for. The full text of the letter can be seen here and below: Chairman Durbin,We write to ask that you provide documents to the Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee in connection with President Biden’s nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.  As you know, Judge Jackson served on the United States District Court for the District of Columbia from 2013 to 2021.  During this time, she sentenced approximately 100 defendants in criminal cases.  Thirteen of those cases involved child pornography or sex offenses.  Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have asked Judge Jackson about her judicial record and the individual facts of each of these cases. However, it appears that not all participants in this nomination process are playing on a level field.  In response to questions about her sentences, Judge Jackson has defended her record by pointing to her sentences in relation to sentencing recommendations of the U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services (“probation”).  Similarly, the White House has made political defenses of her sentencing decisions by pointing to the same comparison to these probation recommendations.  During today’s hearing, after a majority of Republicans had concluded their questions, a Democrat member of the Committee identified that she had information about the probation office’s sentencing recommendations in several of those sex offense cases.  In contrast, Republicans have been asking for access to information about those probation reports so that all members of the Committee can accurately and fairly assess her record.In response to concerns from Republicans that they had not received probation information, you said that some information is a matter of public record.  That is only partially true.  You referenced an article in the Washington Post,[1] which includes probation recommendations on six cases: United States v. Stewart, United States v. Cooper, United States v. Chazin, United States v. Downs, United States v. Hawkins, and United States v. Sears.  But this article did not include the records for Judge Jackson’s seven remaining cases.  Presentencing probation reports are often sealed, leaving Republican staffers to review only the probation recommendation information available from sentencing hearing transcripts and documents available on the public dockets.To set the record straight: Several Republican members requested access to probation records that were not reported.  When staff for Republican members asked your staff about whether Democrats had access to the probation records, your staff declined to elaborate as to the source of their knowledge concerning the recommendations from probation.  Eventually your staff admitted that the White House provided a spreadsheet with probation records for all of Judge Jackson’s sex offender sentencing decisions earlier this afternoon. In past confirmation processes, Senate Democrats have raised concerns when documents from nominees records were released to the Senate Judiciary Committee without significant notice—but at least in those circumstances, all members of this Committee were at equal disadvantage.  Whether or not you agree with a line of questions cannot be the basis to withhold documents.  To do otherwise will shatter what little remaining public trust exists in the confirmation process. Moreover, the Senate Judiciary Committee has statutory authority and jurisdiction to request Sentencing Commission reports and the underlying documents.  Under federal law, “[t]he Chief Judge of each district court shall ensure that, within 30 days following entry of judgment in every criminal case, the sentencing court submits to the [U.S. Sentencing] Commission, in a format approved and required by the Commission, a written report of the sentence, the offense for which it is imposed, the age, race, sex of the offender, and information regarding factors made relevant by the guidelines. The report shall also include … the presentence report.”[2]  Additionally, “[t]he Commission shall, upon request, make available to the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary, the written reports and all underlying records accompanying those reports described in this section, as well as other records received from courts.”[3]To that end, we are asking that you adjourn the nomination hearing until you produce all documents and information that you have regarding sentencing and probation recommendations in Judge Jackson’s criminal cases that have not been shared with Republican members of the Committee.  In particular, please provide (1) the pre-sentence report associated with each case sentenced by Judge Jackson that involved charges concerning child pornography; and (2) all minutes and other records of the U.S. Sentencing Commission during the years when Judge Jackson served as the Commission’s vice-chair.  Additionally, please provide answers to the following questions by the morning of Wednesday, March 23, 2022.     Sincerely,/s/"
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-on-judge-ketanji-brown-jackson-there-is-a-very-consistent-pattern-in-her-light-sentencing-of-child-pornographers,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, during the second round of questioning in the confirmation hearing for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on The Constitution, pressed the judge on whether or not she would recuse herself from the Supreme Court’s consideration of the case concerning discrimination of Asian Americans at Harvard, where Judge Jackson is on the Board of Overseers, on gender discrimination and the definition of ‘woman,’ and her pattern of giving child pornographers sentences below what the prosecutor has asked for. Watch Sen. Cruz’s full round of questioning here. Excerpts are included below. WATCH: Sen. Cruz’s Full Q&A with Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on Day 3 of Senate Judiciary Confirmation HearingSen. Cruz asked Judge Jackson for her thoughts on standing under Article III of the Constitution and the lawsuit brought against Harvard for Harvard’s policy of discriminating against Asian Americans: “Under Article III of the Constitution, federal courts have jurisdiction over only cases and controversies. Which means under the Constitution, it has to be an actual dispute—that federal courts cannot simply issue advisory opinions on a question they may have a view on. And one component of Article III jurisdiction is the requirement of standing, that in order for a plaintiff to have standing to bring a case, that plaintiff, at least generally speaking, must have a real and concrete injury. Is that right?” …“So for example, that means that even if I might have a disagreement with some particular policy, or some particular law, that I can't bring a case unless I am personally aggrieved by that policy or that law. So for example, your and my alma mater, Harvard, is currently being sued for its explicit ,and in my view, egregious policy of discriminating against Asian Americans. Even though I think that policy is egregious, I as an individual plaintiff could not bring a lawsuit challenging it, because I'm not Asian American. Is that right?”Sen. Cruz continued, asking Judge Jackson about her statement that she cannot define what a ‘woman’ is:“We discussed yesterday how the standard for race discrimination was strict scrutiny. The court has laid out a different standard for gender discrimination. What is the constitutional standard that applies to gender discrimination?”…“So yesterday, under questioning from Senator Blackburn, you told her that you couldn't define what a woman is, that you are not a biologist. Which I think you're the only Supreme Court nominee in history who has been unable to answer the question, ‘What is a woman?’ Let me ask you, as a judge, how would you determine if a plaintiff had Article III standing to challenge a gender based rule, regulation, policy, without being able to determine what a woman was?”…“But let me ask, under the modern leftist sensibilities, if I decide right now that I'm a woman, then apparently I'm a woman. Does that mean that I would have Article III standing to challenge a gender based restriction?”…“Okay, if I can change my gender, if I can be a woman, and then an hour later, if I decide I'm not a woman anymore, I guess I would lose Article III standing. Tell me, does that same principle apply to other protected characteristics? For example, I'm an Hispanic man. Could I decide I was an Asian man? Would I have the ability to be an Asian man and challenge Harvard's discrimination because I made that decision?""Sen. Cruz also asked Judge Jackson about child pornography cases where she gave defendants lower sentences than what the prosecution asked for 100 percent of the time: “Okay, let's go back to your favorite topic of this hearing, which is the criminal law cases you had as a district judge, and in particular the cases involving child pornography. Now, your defenders, both on the Democratic side of the dais and also in the press, have suggested that the criticism that has been raised has been somehow cherry picked, that it's only some specific examples. So I'm going to give you an opportunity to discuss each and every case you've had, because looking at your cases, and I've now examined all of the child porn cases you've had as a federal district judge, there is a very consistent pattern. So let's start and by the way, I'm excluding the cases—so Sen. Durbin and Sen. Coons focused on the Nickerson case, the Fyffe case, the Nguyen case, the Hillie case. I'm excluding those because those are not child porn cases. Those are actual sexual assault of a child, which is markedly different. And I will concede when you're dealing with sexual assault, you have been willing to impose stricter penalties. So let's focus on actual child pornography cases. And let's go through each of them. Because if it's right that we're cherry picking, then you should be able to explain quite powerfully. Now your justification is that you're following the statute. And as you know, 18 U.S.C. § 3553 lays out the factors that as a district judge, you had to consider in sentencing. And let's start with the Hess case, United States v. Hess. Now in that case, a man sent six pictures of a prepubescent girl that he claimed was his daughter, to an undercover law enforcement officer. Officers found over 600 images of child pornography, including images of sexual acts being performed on prepubescent children. The defendant pled guilty, and I believe in all of these cases, the defendant pled guilty. So there's no question about guilt. They came in and pled guilty in your courtroom. The charge carried a mandatory minimum sentence of five years and a mandatory maximum sentence of 20 years. The sentencing guidelines recommended 151 to 188 months sentence. The government, as part of a plea deal agreed to argue for 60 months but didn't agree that that would be the sentence, simply that they would advocate it. And you in turn sentenced Hess to 60 months. So under the terms of the statute, why did you choose to sentence Hess to the absolute lowest possible sentence you were allowed to sentence under law?”Sen. Cruz further asked about Judge Jackson’s light sentencing of child pornographers in United States v. Chazin and United States v. Stewart:“Chazin is equally horrifying. And you say in Chazin, and this is something Sen. Graham asked you. So the guidelines lay out different enhancements, and you say repeatedly, and this is true in all your cases, you say you disagree with the guidelines, you think they're wrong. And the two guidelines you disagree with is one, there's an enhancement for use of a computer and you say the world has changed and now all of these are on a computer. And I understand that. I don't agree with you, but I understand that. That is an understandable thing to say. But the second thing you say over and over again, is there's an enhancement for the number of images. And you say repeatedly, for example, in Chazin, you say ‘Whatever the state of the law and technology at the time of the guidelines were first adapted, neither the use of the computer, nor the number of images are especially aggravating factors today.’ Now I find that bizarre and you say it in every case—you say the number of images, it's not an aggravating factor, it doesn't matter and you won't apply the enhancement. Do you really believe that a predator that has hundreds or thousands of images of hundreds or thousands of children being sexually violated has not committed an offense that is more serious than someone that has a single picture of a single child? A single picture of a single child is horrifying. But hundreds of children that have been violated? Do you really believe that is not a more serious offense?”…“Well, I will point out that you have a pattern, it doesn’t matter how egregious the case is. Sen. Hawley talked about the Hawkins case where you had an 18 year old with pictures of boys as young as eight being sexually assaulted and raped, and you sentenced him to just three months in jail. And I will point out the Stewart case, the last one on this list, because we’re running out of time, the Stewart case you describe that he had over 6,700 images and videos. So that’s a lot—6,700. That’s a lot of kids being sexually assaulted.…Judge, in the Stewart case, you said from the bench: ‘Thus, although this is not necessarily an a-typical case, your child pornography possession crime was egregious in the court’s view.’ Okay, so this is a bad one. If you’re actually sentencing defendants, you said this was egregious. What did you sentence Stewart for? The guidelines said 97 to 121 months, the prosecutor said 97 months. You said it’s egregious—6,700 images. You come in at 57 months….why did you sentence him for half the amount?”Watch Sen.

https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-on-judge-ketanji-brown-jackson-i-see-a-record-of-activism-and-advocacy,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – During the initial round of questioning in the confirmation hearing for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on The Constitution, highlighted the judge’s comments about the 1619 Project, Critical Race Theory, her leadership on the board of Georgetown Day School—which teaches Critical Race Theory—and her record of giving child pornographers sentences far below what prosecutors have asked for in those cases. Watch Sen. Cruz’s full round of questioning here. Excerpts are included below.Sen. Cruz asked Judge Jackson about a speech she gave in 2020 where she hailed the 1619 Project and its author, Nikole Hannah-Jones:“As I read your speech at the University of Michigan Law School, however, there was a portion that surprised me. And in particular, in that speech, you reference the work of quote, ‘acclaimed investigative journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones’ and her, and again, this is a quote from the speech ‘provocative thesis that the America that was born in 1776 was not the perfect union that it purported to be.’ “And indeed, Miss Hannah Jones in her 1619 Project describes the central thesis of the 1619 Project, which The New York Times laid out as a revisionist look of history, revising American history, and Miss Hannah-Jones described her central thesis as quote, ‘one of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare independence was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery.’ “Now that claim is a highly contested historical claim. Do you agree with Miss Hannah-Jones that one of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare independence is because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery?Sen. Cruz continued, asking Judge Jackson if she was aware that the 1619 Project has been refuted by historians and that The New York Times has had to issue multiple corrections:“So are you aware that since the 1619 Project came out that it has been roundly refuted by very respected historians, including Gordon Wood of Brown University, including James McPherson, of Princeton University. McPherson called it a quote, ‘very unbalanced one sided account which lacks content and perspective.’ And indeed, it was so thoroughly refuted that The New York Times quietly altered the digital version to remove references to 1619 as the year of America's true founding, and the moment America began, were you aware of that?On Critical Race Theory and Judge Jackson’s position on the board of Georgetown Day School, Sen. Cruz asked:So Judge Jackson, all of us will agree that no one should be discriminated against because of race. When you just testified a minute ago that you didn't know if Critical Race Theory was taught in K-12, I will confess I find that statement a little hard to reconcile with the public record because if you look at the Georgetown Day School’s curriculum, it is filled and overflowing with Critical Race Theory—that among the books that are either assigned or recommended, they include Critical Race Theory: An Introduction. They include The End of Policing, an advocacy for abolishing police. They include How To Be An Anti-Racist by Ibram Kendi. They include literally stacks and stacks of books, and I'll tell you two of the ones that were most stunning. They include a book called Antiracist Baby by Ibram Kendi, and they’re portions of this book that I find really quite remarkable. One portion of the book says babies are taught to be racist or anti-racist, there is no neutrality. Another portion of the book they recommend to babies, ‘Confess when being racist.’ Now this is a book that is taught at Georgetown Day School to students in Pre-K through second grade, so four through seven years old. Do you agree with this book that is being taught with kids that the babies are racist?Sen. Cruz pressed her further on Critical Race Theory, specifically at Georgetown Day School, asking:Another book that is on the summer reading for third through fifth grade is a book called Stamped (For Kids) again by Ibram Kendi. I read the entirety of the book and I will say it is an astonishing book. On page 33 it asks the question, ‘Can we send white people back to Europe?’ That's on 33. That's what's being given to eight and nine year olds. It also on page 115 says ‘The idea that we should pretend not to see racism is connected to the idea that we should pretend not to see color. It's called color blindness.’ Skipping ahead, ‘Here's what's wrong with this. It's ridiculous. Skin color is something we all absolutely see.’ Skipping ahead. ‘So to pretend not to see color is pretty convenient if you don't actually want to stamp out racism in the first place.’ Now, what this book argues for is the exact opposite of what Dr. King spoke about on the floor of the Lincoln Memorial, and are you comfortable with these ideas being taught to children as young as four in respect to the first book and as young as eight, nine in respect to the second book?On Judge Jackson’s 1996 note in Harvard Law Review examining whether sex offender statutes are punitive or preventative, Sen. Cruz asked:“I'll confess, Judge Jackson…look, as I listened to your testimony, I believe you are someone who is compassionate. I believe you care for children, obviously your children and other children. But I also see a record of activism and advocacy as it concerns sexual predators that stems back decades and that is concerning. You wrote your note on the Harvard Law Review on sex crimes. Your note is your major academic work on the Law Review and yours is entitled ‘Prevention versus Punishment: Towards a principled distinction in the restraint of released sex offenders.’“And in it, you argue, and I quote, ‘a recent spate of legislation purports to regulate released sex offenders by requiring them to register with local law enforcement officials, notify community members of their presence, undergo DNA testing, and submit to civil commitment for an indefinite term. Although many courts and commentators herald these laws as valid regulatory measures, others reject them as punitive enactments that violate the rights of individuals who have already been sanctioned for their crimes. Under existing doctrine, the constitutionality of sex offender statutes depends upon their characterization as essentially preventative rather than punitive.’ And what you go on to explain is that if they're viewed as punitive, they are unconstitutional. If they're viewed as preventative, they are not. And throughout the course of your note, you argue they should be viewed as punitive and therefore, unconstitutional. Indeed, in the second to last page, you go through each of those four categories. You say requirements that sex offenders register may or may not be unconstitutional, depending upon whether, quote, ‘In which sex offenders have no privacy right in registration information or blood samples.’ So you suggest that may or may not be constitutional, you raise doubts about it. And then you raise very significant doubts about community notification. And you heavily suggest that civil commitment for sexual predators is unconstitutional. Do you still agree with the sentiments you expressed in your law school note?Sen. Cruz also asked Judge Jackson about her comments on child pornography offenders:“So when you were Vice Chairman of the Sentencing Commission, you expressed significant concerns that the White House has argued that your quotes were taken out of context. So I want to provide the full context of your quote, because you said ‘Yes. I want to ask you about the means by which we can distinguish more or less serious offenders. I know that all of you sort of touched on that. Mr. Fottrell, you talked about going from singular to one on one to group experience. And I am just wondering if there's some sort of inevitable and natural progression from one stage to the other such that you could say that the least serious offenders are in the singular experience stage? And I guess my thought is in looking at some of the testimony that other people will have later in the day, I was surprised at some of the testimony with respect to the motivation of offenders’— and we're talking about child pornography offenders—‘and that there are people who get involved with this kind of activity, who may not be pedophiles, and who may not be necessarily interested really in the child pornography but have other motivations with respect to the use of technology, and being in the group. And you know, here are lots of reasons perhaps why people might engage in this. And so I'm wondering whether you could say that there is a—that there could be a less serious child pornography offender, who is engaging in the type of conduct in the group experience level, because their motivation is the challenge or to use the technology. They're very sophisticated technologically, but they aren't necessarily that interested in the child pornography piece of it.’ Now, I find that a pretty remarkable argument that people in possession of child pornography, are not actually interested in the child porn, they're not pedophiles, they're just interested in technology. Is that, and I wanted to provide the whole quote, because the White House said that portions of this were used out of context. So this is your entire quote. Do you agree with that sentiment that there is some meaningful population of people who have child pornography but are not in fact pedophiles or getting satisfaction from it?Sen. Cruz continued, asking Judge Jackson why she consistently gave child pornagraphers lower sentences than what prosecutors asked for:“Let's take a look at your actual sentencing. And you've had 10 different cases involving child pornography. These are the cases, there are two U.S. vs. Buttry and U.S. vs. Cane for which the government did not make a recommendation. And you said earlier, when Chairman Durbin was trying to preempt this line of attack, you said it's a sickening and egregious crime, which I very much agree with. And you said the guidelines lean to extreme departures. Okay. Let's look at what the prosecutors are asking for it. And I would note that this was in the District of Columbia where prosecutors are far more liberal than many of the prosecutors in this country. And in every case in which, so United States v. Hess there was a mandatory statutory minimum of 60 months and you imposed 60 months because you had no discretion. In United States v. Nickerson, there was a mutual agreement of the parties to 120 months and that's what you imposed. In every other case, United States v. Chazin, the prosecutor asked for 78 to 97 months. You imposed 28 months—28 months is a 64% reduction. In the United States v. Cooper, the prosecutor asked for 72 months. You imposed 60 months. That was a 17% reduction. In United States v. Downs, the prosecutor asked for 70 months. You imposed 60. That was a 14% reduction. In United States v. Hawkins, the prosecutor asked for 24 months, you imposed three months. That was an 88% reduction. In United States v. Savage, the prosecutor asked for 49 months, you imposed 37. That was a 24% reduction. In the United States v. Stewart, the prosecutor asked for 97 months. You imposed 57. That was a 41% reduction. Every single case, 100% of them, when prosecutors came before you with child pornography cases, you sentenced the offender to substantially below, not just the guidelines which are way higher, but what the prosecutor asked for on average of these cases—47.2% less. Now, you said you made sure the voice of the children was heard. Do you believe in a case like United States v. Hawkins, where the prosecutor asked for 24 months and you sentenced the offender to only three months, do you believe the voice of the children is heard when 100% of the time you're sentencing those in possession of child pornography to far below what the prosecutor is asking for?Watch Sen.

https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-at-ketanji-brown-jackson-hearing-will-you-protect-freedom-or-restrict-it,"WASHINGTON, D.C. –  Today, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on The Constitution, gave his opening statement on the first day of the Supreme Court confirmation hearing for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. Watch Sen. Cruz’s opening statement here. The full text of Sen. Cruz’s opening statement is included below.“Thank you Mr. Chairman. Judge Jackson, congratulates on your nomination.“Eleven thousand, one hundred and seven men and women have served as members of the House of Representatives. One thousand, nine hundred and ninety four men and women has served as members of the United States Senate. Only 115 men and women have served as Supreme Court justices. The position to which you have been nominated is extraordinarily important. And that is why the Senate is given the responsibility for advice and consent under the Constitution—because the job matters immensely. “Supreme Court confirmations were not always controversial. In fact, Bushrod Washington, when nominated to the Supreme Court in 1798, was confirmed the very next day. So what changed? Well, what changed is starting in the 1960’s and the 1970’s, the Supreme Court's role in our society changed dramatically. The Supreme Court became a policymaking body rather than a merely judicial body. Just a moment ago, my colleague Sen. Klobuchar said we should consider the Supreme Court's place in our democracy. Starting in the 60’s and 70’s, the Supreme Court decided its place in our democracy, at least to many justices, was to set aside the democratic decisions of the people and instead to mandate the policy outcomes they themselves supported. “Our Democratic colleagues want the Supreme Court to be anti-democratic. Our Democratic colleagues get frustrated with the democratic process when they can't pass gun control laws, because the American people don't support them. They want unelected judges to mandate those same laws instead. Law after law after law that they can't get through the democratic process, the Democrats have decided it's much simpler to convince five lawyers in black robes than to try to convince 330 million Americans.“That is why Supreme Court confirmation hearings have become so contentious. It’s because the Supreme Court is arrogated to itself a responsibility the Constitution doesn't give it, which is to make contested policy decisions and take them away from the American people. “Now, what should this hearing be and what should it not be? Well, you've heard a number of members on the Republican side of the aisle [be] quite clear on what it should not be. This will not be a political circus. This will not be the kind of character smear that sadly, our Democratic colleagues have gotten very good at. And it's important to note, you know, a couple of years ago, I was doing my weekly podcast, and I was on with a noted liberal intellectual who made a comment something to the effect of well, both sides do this, both sides smear Supreme Court justices. And I was forced to laugh out loud and say, look, I understand that's a pretty good talking point, it just happens not to be true. It is only one side of the aisle—the Democratic aisle—that went so into the gutter with Judge Robert Bork that they invented a new verb, ‘to Bork’ someone. It is only one side of the aisle that with Justice Clarence Thomas, was so reprehensible that as the president who nominated him, President George Herbert Walker Bush, wrote at the time quote, ‘What's happening to Clarence Thomas is just plain horrible. All the groups that tried to beat him up on abortion, affirmative action have now come out of the woodwork. They're trying to destroy a decent man…This is an ugly process, and one can see clearly why so many good people elect to stay out of public life.’“As Justice Thomas observed in that hearing, what happened there was to use his words, ‘a high tech lynching.’ And I would note, the chairman who presided over that disgrace was Joe Biden. “And then most of the members of this committee remember the confirmation hearing of Brett Kavanaugh. One of the lowest moments in the history of this committee were Democrats on this committee sat on allegations, didn't refer them to the FBI, didn't ask for investigations, hid them and then leaked them against the wishes of the complaintant. And we began a circus that featured Spartacus moments, featured such nuts as Michael Avenatti, whom CNN breathlessly for some months described as a possible Democratic presidential candidate—that’s before presumably he became a felon in recent months. “Judge Jackson, I can assure you that your hearing will feature none of that disgraceful behavior. No one is going to inquire into your teenage dating habits. No one is going to ask you with mock severity, ‘Do you like beer?’ But that's not to say this hearing should be non-substantive and non-vigorous. In this hearing, this committee has a responsibility to focus on issues, to focus on your record, to focus on substance, to do our very best to ascertain what kind of justice you would be. And a couple of straw men—it is no longer the case that Supreme Court confirmation hearings are merely about qualifications. There are some who say, ‘Well, if the justice is qualified, the Senate should confirm.’“There was a time that was the case. Our Democratic colleagues have abandoned that standard long ago. Our Democratic colleagues—then-Sen. Joe Biden was perfectly happy to vote against John Roberts, someone who was unquestionably qualified for the court. He was perfectly happy to vote against Sam Alito, someone who was unquestionably qualified for the court. And indeed, every member of our Democratic colleagues, who was here at the time, participated in the first ever filibuster of a Supreme Court justice on partisan lines with Justice Neil Gorsuch. They did so for someone unquestionably qualified, but they had a political agenda and so every one of them happily, filibustered Justice Gorsuch. “Likewise, it's not about race. We will see Democrats in the media suggest that any senator that is skeptical of your nomination, that questions you vigorously, or that dares to vote against you must somehow harbor racial animus. If that were the standard, I would note we are sitting on a committee where multiple members of this committee, the senior Democrats in the committee, happily filibustered Judge Janice Rogers Brown, a very qualified African-American woman nominated to the D.C. Circuit. And they did so precisely because they wanted to prevent Judge Brown from becoming Justice Brown, the first African-American woman. Joe Biden was among the Democrats filibustering the first African-American woman nominated the D.C. Circuit. “The senior Democrats on this committee also filibustered Miguel Estrada. As the staff for Sen. Ted Kennedy said in writing at the time, the Democrats filibustered Miguel Estrada, quote, ‘because he is Hispanic.’ They were explicitly racial. If you dare, if you are Hispanic or African-American and you dare depart from their political orthodoxy, they will crush you, they will attack you, they will slander you, they will filibuster you.“So this is not about race. It is however, about issues and substance, and I gotta say I agree with Chairman Durbin. Chairman Durbin quoted Paul Simon, and he said, history will judge quote, did she ‘restrict freedom?’ Or did she ‘expand it?’ I agree with that. The reason the American people care about the Supreme Court is it is integral to protecting or taking away our constitutional rights.“When it comes to free speech, this committee should inquire—will you protect the rights of Americans to speak, to say unpopular ideas, to say ideas that the government doesn't want you to say that you nonetheless have a right to say? Will you protect freedom or restrict it? When it comes to religious liberty, will a justice vote to protect your right to live according to your faith and according to your conscience, or will a justice vote to crush religious liberty and strip those rights away? The Second Amendment—will a justice vote to defend your Second Amendment rights to keep and bear arms, to defend your family, to defend your children, or will a justice roll over to the Democrats that want a disarmed citizenry? The right to life—will a justice protect the rights of the people, the rights of state legislatures to enact laws protecting innocent life, protecting unborn life, stopping abominations like partial birth abortion, or will a justice view her job as a super legislator, striking down all such rights? School choice—will a justice protect the rights of kids to get a quality education or will a justice legislate from the bench and shut down school choice programs across this country? And crime—we are seeing murder rates, carjacking rates, crime rates skyrocketing across the country, in significant part because political Soros-backed district attorneys, because of Democratic efforts to abolish the police, and part of the Democratic effort to abolish the police is nominating justices that consistently side with violent criminals, release violent criminals, refuse to enforce the law, and that results in jeopardizing innocent citizens.“So all of those questions are fair game. Will you follow the law? What does your record indicate? Will you protect the rights of every American citizen regardless of race, regardless of party, regardless of views? That's what the focus of this hearing should be.”###  "
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/-sen-cruz-introduces-legislation-to-ban-the-biden-administration-from-waiving-sanctions-on-iran-nuclear-activities,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today introduced legislation to prohibit the Biden administration from waiving Congressional sanctions that prohibit cooperation on Iran’s nuclear program, originally issued under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The bill is cosponsored by Sens. Cotton (R-AR), Cassidy (R-LA), Cramer (R-ND), Ernst (R-IA), Braun (R-IN), Rubio (R-FL), Rick Scott (R-FL), Hoeven (R-ND), Tillis (R-NC), Blackburn (R-TN), Hagerty (R-TN), and Inhofe (R-OK). Last month, the Biden administration notified Congress it was giving Iran and its international partners—including Russia—a waiver for seven civil nuclear activities, which Iran uses to build its nuclear program. Sen. Cruz fought to rescind those waivers, and the Trump administration did so in 2019 and 2020.This week the Biden administration confirmed that the waivers will allow Russia to conduct projects with Iran valued at $10 billion.Upon introducing the legislation, Sen. Cruz said:“The Biden administration is dismantling sanctions and is aching to secure a new agreement with the Iranian regime that is even weaker than the original catastrophic Obama-Iran nuclear deal. The Biden administration is so committed to their deal that they are willing to make Iran a nuclear client for Putin, including work that amounts to a $10 billion subsidy for his war machine.That’s why I’ve introduced legislation to stop the Biden administration from issuing civil-nuclear waivers allowing Russia to build up Iran’s nuclear program. The Ayatollah exploits these civil nuclear waivers to build up Iran’s nuclear program with the express intention of eventually developing nuclear weapons to inflict destruction on America and our allies. When he chants ‘Death to Israel’ and ‘Death to America,’ he means it. President Trump rightly ended these waivers, and now the Biden administration is resurrecting them. It’s unconscionable, and Congress must put a stop to it.”### "

https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-demands-answers-from-doj-about-highly-questionable-ethical-waiver-involving-racial-discrimination-case-before-the-supreme-court,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to Department of Justice (DOJ) Attorney General Merrick Garland demanding transparency into an ethical waiver granted to Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar despite the clear conflict of interest that was created after DOJ decided to allow Prelogar to participate in an affirmative action lawsuit Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard College given the case involves allegations that her former client and employer, Harvard, has been sued for racial discrimination. The case is poised to have a potentially transformative effect on universities’ ability to consider race in admissions.Ms. Prelogar attended law school at Harvard, consulted for them for nearly a decade, and taught a law school course as recently as fall 2020. On January 24, 2022, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. As Solicitor General, Ms. Prelogar will argue against her former employer on behalf of the government. Senator Cruz continues to hold the DOJ accountable for their questionable ethical practices and to demand answers from this administration.After sending his oversight letter to DOJ, Senator Cruz issued the following statement:“For too long many of America’s top universities and colleges have engaged in blatant discrimination against Asian Americans during the admissions process. It is unconscionable that the Biden administration would grant the Solicitor General a waiver that allows her to use the full power of the Department of Justice to go after college students and in order to defend the racially discriminatory practices of her former client and former employer. The clear takeaway from the decision to issue an ethics waiver in this case is that President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland are fully supportive of ongoing racial discrimination at America’s colleges and universities.”In the letter, Sen. Cruz wrote: “Only three weeks after becoming Solicitor General, on November 18, 2021, Ms. Prelogar was granted an ethics waiver…allowing her to participate in a case pending before the Supreme Court—Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard College. Days before this waiver was granted, Harvard published a flattering piece related to Prelogar’s confirmation that touted how she would “carry on a Harvard Law School legacy.” This puff piece appears to have been written while Ms. Prelogar was awaiting word from DOJ in response to her conflict-of-interest waiver request. The timeline of these events gives rise to serious concerns about the appearance of impropriety and calls into question DOJ’s impartiality in not only this case but other cases as well.”… “Elizabeth Prelogar has a long-standing history with the defendant, Harvard College. She attended law school at Harvard. After law school, Ms. Prelogar consulted for Harvard College for nearly a decade—between 2011 and 2020. Additionally, she taught a course at Harvard Law during the fall of 2020. Prelogar’s public financial disclosures reveal she was paid $10,500 in 2019 and 2020 for these services.”… Despite these obvious conflicts, Ms. Prelogar sought an ethics waiver rather than simply recusing herself from the case. The reasoning provided to justify the waiver ultimately granted to Ms. Prelogar is vague, arbitrary, and broad enough to encompass nearly any conflict. In other words, the ethics waiver granted to Ms. Prelogar was not “granted in the narrowest [of] circumstances when necessary and in the public’s interest as the Biden Administration purports to require of its appointees, but, instead, amounts to a blank check.”The full text of Senator Cruz’s letter can be found here. ###"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, joined 48 Republican senators today in a statement declaring they will block and reverse any new agreement with Iran that will weaken sanctions and impose fewer restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program than the original Iran deal.“According to press reports, the Biden Administration may soon conclude an agreement with Iran to provide substantial sanctions relief in exchange for merely short-term limitations on Iran’s nuclear program. “By every indication, the Biden Administration appears to have given away the store. The administration appears to have agreed to lift sanctions that were not even placed on Iran for its nuclear activities in the first place, but instead because of its ongoing support for terrorism and its gross abuses of human rights. The nuclear limitations in this new deal appear to be significantly less restrictive than the 2015 nuclear deal, which was itself too weak, and will sharply undermine U.S. leverage to secure an actually ‘longer and stronger’ deal. What is more, the deal appears likely to deepen Iran’s financial and security relationship with Moscow and Beijing, including through arms sales.“The administration has thus far refused to commit to submit a new Iran deal to the Senate for ratification as a treaty, as per its constitutional obligation, or for review under statutory requirements that passed on a bipartisan basis in response to the 2015 deal. Additionally, despite earlier promises to the contrary, the administration has failed to adequately consult with Congress.“Republicans have made it clear: We would be willing and eager to support an Iran policy that completely blocks Iran’s path to a nuclear weapons capability, constrains Iran’s ballistic missile program, and confronts Iran’s support for terrorism. But if the administration agrees to a deal that fails to achieve these objectives or makes achieving them more difficult, Republicans will do everything in our power to reverse it. Unless Iran ceases its support for terrorism, we will oppose removing and seek to reimpose any terrorism-related sanctions. And we will force the Senate to vote on any Administration effort to do so.“We strongly urge the administration, our Democrat colleagues, and the international community to learn the lessons of the very recent past. A major agreement that does not have strong bipartisan support in Congress will not survive.”The following senators signed on to the statement:### "

The Senators are demanding answers about the impact of the Biden administration’s negligence on crime in American communities.Co-signers of the letter are: Sens. Blackburn (R-TN), Boozman (R-AR), Braun (R-IN), Crapo (R-ID), Cotton (R-AR), Daines (R-MT), Graham (R-SC), Hagerty (R-TN), Hoeven (R-ND), Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Inhofe (R-OK), Johnson (R-WI), Kennedy (R-LA), Lankford (R-OK), Lee (R-UT), Lummis (R-WY), Paul (R-KY), Risch (R-ID), Rubio (R-FL), Scott (R-FL), and Young (R-IN).In the letter, the Senators explain how Secretary Mayorkas’ September 2021 guidance to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has deprioritized removal of dangerous criminal aliens. It points out that the predictable result has been increased rates of illegal crossings and instances of violent crime against American citizens. The letter lays out sixteen examples of tragic crimes—including homicides, rapes, assaults, robberies, and deaths caused by driving under the influence—committed by illegal aliens across the country since 2021. In the letter, the Senators wrote: “[Y]ou asserted that there is no bright-line rule, such as past criminal convictions, that officers may use to determine which individuals may pose a public safety threat, and therefore hold priority for enforcement action. This misguided policy deprioritizes the removal of dangerous criminal aliens—individuals who have been convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, and has resulted in further unnecessary victimization of American citizens.The result has been predictable: By signaling that you will not enforce immigration laws, you have invited unprecedented increases in illegal border crossings. In 2021, CBP recorded over 2 million migrant encounters. According to CBP arrest data, the agency has arrested 2,424 criminal aliens so far in FY 2022. Although it is only March, this number is just 14 arrests shy of the total number of arrests in all of FY 2020. These individuals have been convicted of murder, rape, assault, robbery, weapons possession, and drug possession among other crimes. Your directive sends the unfortunate message that violating our country’s immigration laws is not a serious crime and will not result in any adverse civil legal actions.[…]Under your leadership, the humanitarian crisis at our Southern border has spilled over into a crime wave impacting public safety for communities all across this nation. Strong enforcement of our nation’s immigration laws will act as a deterrent and help prevent additional tragic crimes in the future.We urge you to reconsider the direction you are leading these agencies in and to immediately rescind your September 2021 guidance.”Read the full letter here."
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-introduces-bill-to-stop-the-biden-administrations-rationing-of-monoclonal-antibody-treatments,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) this week introduced a bill to stop the federal takeover of monoclonal antibody treatment distribution and empower states to determine their own needs. Since September of last year, the Biden administration has taken complete control of the supply and distribution of monoclonal antibody treatments, which has resulted in rationing and shortages.  Upon introducing the bill, Senator Cruz stated: “One of the things we've learned during this pandemic is that monoclonal antibodies can have a very effective therapeutic effect in combatting Covid-19 infections. And in fact, we've seen them reduce hospitalization and death by 70%. The Biden administration responded to these encouraging results by rationing and limiting the ability of people to access monoclonal antibodies and stopping states like my home state of Texas from ordering the treatments directly. This federal takeover is an abuse of power that denies people lifesaving medication. That’s why I’m proud to introduce this bill to return power to the states so each state can determine how many monoclonal antibody treatments it needs. Background:On September 3, 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) announced an update to the distribution of Monoclonal Antibody (mAb) therapeutic treatments for COVID-19. ASPR cited the increase in demand for mAbs across the country due to the surge of the Delta variant of COVID-19. On September 13, 2021, HHS/ASPR announced that the agency was taking complete control of the supply of certain mAbs, and it would do weekly distributions for all states and territories. Previously, states, administration/infusion sites, hospitals, healthcare centers, and healthcare providers were able to directly order mAbs from the distributor, AmerisourceBergen with no limit on the amount of mAb units that could be ordered.Senator Cruz’s bill would prohibit the federal government from rationing, limit access to, restricting, or otherwise controlling the quantity of drugs made available to or distributed to states. This would apply to those drugs under emergency use authorization.###"
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-issues-statement-of-solidarity-with-the-jewish-community-after-hostage-crisis-at-congregation-beth-israel,"HOUSTON, Texas – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) issued the following statement of solidarity with the Jewish community after the 11-hour standoff at the Congregation Beth Israel Synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, where a terrorist held four hostages in an anti-Semitic, targeted attack:“During Shabbat, a bigoted, anti-Semitic coward held four people hostage at Congregation Beth Israel for hours. He targeted them because they were Jewish.“Heidi and I praise God that the hostages are now safe. We are thankful for the brave men and women in law enforcement who swiftly responded, freed the hostages, and stopped the terrorist. “Terrorism, religious persecution, bigotry, and hatred have no place in our society. Heidi and I stand in solidarity with the Jewish community in Colleyville, which is coming together to support each other during this difficult time. “The ancient hatred that is anti-Semitism has been on the rise all over the world—sometimes manifesting itself in horrific, deadly ways—as we saw in 2018 with the attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history, and with the attack on the Chabad of Poway Synagogue in 2019, which left one dead and several injured. “We must speak with one voice and stand resolved that the United States unequivocally condemns anti-Semitism and commits to combating it in all forms.”###"
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-democrats-are-engaged-in-a-double-power-grab-with-a-twist,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) this week lambasted Senate Democrats for their brazen attempt to hold on to power by blowing up the filibuster and enact a federal takeover of our elections.WATCH: Senator Ted Cruz Blasts Democrats for Brazen Attempt to Pass the Corrupt Politicians ActDuring his remarks on the Senate floor, Cruz stated:“We are today seeing Democrats in the Senate, with the active encouragement of President Joe Biden, engaging on not one but two partisan power grabs, and doing them both with a twist. Let me explain. Democrats are desperate to hold on the power. It's their number one priority. It's more important than anything else. It's more important than jobs in our economy to Democrats. It's more important than getting kids back to school. It's more important than defeating COVID. Nothing matters more to today's Democrats than stay in power no matter what. How do we know that? Well, very first bill introduced in the House of Representatives HR 1, the bill many of us call the Corrupt Politicians Act. It's a bill designed to keep Democrats in power forever. That was Nancy Pelosi’s number one priority. The very first bill introduced in this chamber, S1, is likewise the Corrupt Politicians Act—a bill designed to keep Democrats in power forever.”…“Now, Democrats want to subject every significant decision concerning voting to the unreviewable—in most instances—arbitrary power of an unelected bureaucrat in the Federal Department of Justice. My state of Texas has 29 million people. Those 29 million people have democratic rights. They have rights to elect legislatures that reflect their views, their policies, and their values.You know what Senate Democrats say? We don't care. We don't care what those 29 million people want. We the Democrats want to stay in power. So let's take for example, photo ID. I have in my wallet, my driver's license, most people do. Voter ID is a policy that is supported by the overwhelming majority of Americans, roughly 80% of Americans support voter ID requiring a driver's license to vote. Two thirds of African American voters support voter ID.It is overwhelmingly supported across the country. You know who doesn't support it? Elected Democrats. Sadly, every single Democrat in this chamber has been willing to go on board with proposals to strike down voter ID laws. And here's what the Democrats want to do. They want to say that even though the voters of Texas want voter ID—because we want elections with integrity, we want to know that if you come in and vote and say your name is John Doe, that you're not somebody else pretending to be that person—congressional Democrats don't care.”…“We saw Joe Biden give an incredibly demagogic, racist speech, accusing half the country of being racist or being Bull Connor. Democrats say this is Jim Crow 2.0. And, you know, Madam President, ironically, and I think inadvertently, the Democrats are telling the truth. They don't mean to be but they are. What was Jim Crow 1.0? Jim Crow 1.0 were laws that were written almost exclusively by elected Democrats. You look at the authors of Jim Crow—they were Democrats, as were the founders of the Ku Klux Klan. And the purpose of Jim Crow laws was to do one thing: stop the voters from voting Democrats out of office. Because if you look at the African Americans who were freed from slavery, they were electing Republicans. In many instances they were electing black Republicans. And the Democrats didn't want that. How dare the voters select someone not from their party? And so Jim Crow was written to strip the right to vote from the voters who dare to vote against Democrats. We'll fast forward to today. The Corrupt Politicians Act is Jim Crow 2.0. It is once again written by Democrats to strip the right to vote from the American people to prevent them from voting Democrats out of office.”…“Senator Chuck Schumer in 2005 gave a speech. I'm going to read to you verbatim what he said. He said ‘they want, because they can't get their way…to change the rules midstream.’ Alright, what would be the effect of that—you change the rules midstream steam, you nuke the filibuster. What would be the effect of that according to Chuck Schumer? The effect of that? ‘To wash away 200 years of history.’ That's what Schumer says is the effect—‘washing away 200 years of history.’ That sounds serious. Anything else? ‘They want to make this country into a banana republic. Where if you don't get your way you change the rules.’ Wash away 200 years of history, make this country a banana republic. That's pretty serious stuff that ought to concern us. But at least that's the worst it gets, right? Well, actually, no. Schumer continued, ‘It'll be doomsday for democracy if we do.’“Madam President, there are reporters teaming, the United States Capitol. Any reporter who wants to be something other than a partisan shill and mouthpiece for the Democrats ought to ask every single Democrat: ‘Senator so-and-so, do you agree with Chuck Schumer that ending the filibuster will turn our nation into a banana republic? Do you agree, Senator so-and-so, that ending the filibuster would be  ‘doomsday for democracy’? And by the way, if there are any reporters left who actually have journalistic ethics, you shouldn't just ask Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. Right now they're the lone Democrats with the gumption to stand up for democracy.”“But you ought to ask all 50 of them, every single one of the Democrats: Do you agree with Chuck Schumer [that] ending the filibuster is ‘doomsday for democracy’? And if not, why? Is it just that your team is the one that can't get their way? Now it's your side that wants to change the rules midstream. Now it's your side that if you don't get your way you change the rules. Was Joe Biden lying in 2019? Was Senator Schumer lying in 2005? I don't know your ask them. Double power grab with a twist.”…“I cannot think of another time when a senator has voted for something that he is called ‘doomsday for democracy.’ That's not just a little hypocritical. And by the way, all the Democrats agreed with it. They were all standing shoulder to shoulder in 2005. When Senator Schumer said this, he was either lying or telling the truth. If he was lying, I guess you should ask him why he was lying. If he was telling the truth, I guess you should ask 48 Democrats who don't care why they're willing to vote for ‘doomsday for democracy.’ You want to understand the dangers of this double power grab with a twist, look no further than the vicious partisan, divisive, hateful speech President Biden gave insulting half this country. Oddly enough, blaming Republicans for the sins of his own party, the Democratic Party who wrote Jim Crow and founded the KKK.”…“A double power grab with a twist. Jim Crow 2.0 seizing federal elections, striking down the laws adopted by democratic legislators, putting an unelected radical leftist bureaucrat in charge of elections with more power in this one leftist bureaucrat than all 29 million people in the state of Texas. Doing so by breaking the Senate rules, to change the Senate rules, and the twist you is with a dose of hypocrisy unusual even for this place.”Listen to Sen. Cruz’s remarks HERE.###"
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-introduces-bill-protecting-the-right-to-vote-regardless-of-vaccination-status,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) today announced he’s introduced the Securing Enfranchisement and the Rights of Voters regardless of Inoculation Status (SERVIS) Act to prohibit requiring vaccine passports to vote. The SERVIS Act would also render mask mandates at polling locations unenforceable unless masks are readily provided, free-of-charge, to voters.Upon introducing the bill, Senator Cruz stated:“It’s the height of irony that the same politicians fighting to remove voter ID laws are locking down cities and imposing vaccine passport requirements to participate in everyday life. These petty tyrants should not be able to strip Americans of their voting rights by demanding vaccine passports at the voting booth. The American people have tolerated enough from lockdown politicians who have grossly marginalized constitutional liberties in the name of COVID-19. This is wrong.”BackgroundAccording to data from the Mayo Clinic, in December 2021, 62.6% percent of Americans were considered “fully vaccinated.” Data also shows that, nationwide, African-Americans are less likely to be vaccinated than are Asians, Hispanics or Whites. In 48 states, the proportion of African-Americans who are vaccinated is below the population share of African Americans. See here and here. This legislation would ensure they’re not denied their constitutional right to the ballot box.”###"

A full transcript is below.Senator Ted Cruz: Mr. President, the eyes of history are upon us. Today, each of us will be faced with a momentous question: Can we put petty differences aside and can we come together to defend our friend and our ally Ukraine against imminent Russian aggression?  This isn't theoretical. Russian tanks and troops are right now massed on the Ukrainian border and they are preparing for invasion.  The Senate in just a few hours will vote on a bill that represents the best way to deter Putin from invading Ukraine by sanctioning the company that is racing to finish and make operational the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which Putin desperately wants completed so that he can use it as a cudgel against our European allies.  If we don't come together today, Ukraine risks getting wiped off the map altogether. Putin didn't just wake up one day and decide he wanted to invade Ukraine. He's wanted to invade Ukraine for years and he did so already in 2014. But he stopped short of a full invasion because he couldn't endanger Ukraine's energy infrastructure which he needs to get Russia's natural gas to Europe. That stopped Putin from marching all the way to Kiev.  The next year in 2015, Putin began the Nord Stream 2 project, to build a pipeline to go around Ukraine so that he could get his gas to Europe and invade Ukraine with no risk to the billions he relies on every year.  Nord Stream 2 as we know, as we've heard from Republicans and from Democrats literally hundreds of times over the past years—on this floor, in committees, in briefings—Nord Stream 2 was designed to circumvent Ukraine. It's why the Senate has worked together for years, in a bipartisan manner, to stop Nord Stream 2 from coming online.  In 2017, Congress came together and passed the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA, which sanctioned investments in Russian energy export pipelines.  In 2019, Congress passed Protecting Europe’s Energy Security Act or PEESA, which sanctions Nord Stream 2 directly. I authored that bill along with Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen.  And in 2021, Congress expanded those sanctions in the Protecting Europe's Energy Security Clarification Act. Again, I authored that bill, along with Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen.  For the next several hours, this body will revisit and debate this issue once again. We will revisit our successes from 2019-21 in using targeted sanctions to end construction of the pipeline. When President Trump signed our bipartisan sanctions in the law, Putin stopped construction of the pipeline literally 15 minutes before the law became effective.  Sanctions worked, they succeeded, and together we won a bipartisan foreign policy and national security victory.  But we will also revisit in this debate the catastrophic decision President Biden made in May of this year to waive those sanctions—the sanctions that had worked, the sanctions that were successful. President Biden waived them nonetheless.  When this debate is over, each of us will have to decide whether he or she will vote to finally and definitively put an end to this pipeline through mandatory sanctions. Our Ukrainian allies are crying out for us to do so. Ukraine's President and Prime Minister and Speaker of the Parliament have all explicitly and passionately done so in recent days. Ukraine's Prime Minister said last week Nord Stream 2 is quote, ‘No less an existential threat to Ukraine’s security and democracy than Russian troops on our border.’ That's the Prime Minister of Ukraine begging this body, the United States Senate, to help them. Just this week, a public letter from leaders in Ukrainian Civil Society said and I want to quote this at length—they said quote, ‘Since late October 2021, Russia has amassed more than 120,000 troops close to the Ukrainian border, along with the logistical support for a major new offensive. This menacing buildup had been accompanied by increasingly belligerent rhetoric from senior Russian officials. We believe the green light given to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in May 2021 served as one of the key triggers for the current crisis and must be urgently revised,’ end quote. Mr. President, in ordinary times that open letter from Ukrainian Civil Society would resonate with both Democrats and Republicans. This is a plea for help!  Opponents of our legislation are clutching at pretexts to avoid doing what we have done many times before and I want to address those pretexts one at a time.  One argument we've heard again and again is that imposing sanctions on North Stream 2 AG, the Gazprom-owned cutout that runs Nord Stream 2, would shatter European unity. That's an argument that's being repeated by the White House repeatedly: that this is all about transatlantic unity—we should give Putin this pipeline because of transatlantic unity.  Mr. President, I urge every Senator to ask a simple question: What unity and with whom? In January, the European Parliament voted to condemn and stop the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The vote was 581 to 50. 581 to 50. Mr. President, if you care about transatlantic unity, let me suggest that we side with the 581 and not the 50. The Biden White House's argument is literally, ‘Go with the 50 in the name of transatlantic unity.’ I don't know how you stand up and make that argument with a straight face. 581 to 50. In August of 2021, the chairs of the Foreign Affairs Committee in nine countries opposed explicitly the Nord Stream to US-German agreement, the Biden agreement to allow the completion of Nord Stream 2.  Among those countries that explicitly oppose that agreement: Estonia, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.  Mr. President, are those countries Europe? Do we care about transatlantic unity with those countries that are begging us to find the courage to stand up to Vladimir Putin? When President Biden made his deal to allow the pipeline to go through anyway, the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Poland issued a remarkable joint statement declaring that the decision President Biden made to surrender to Putin—that it created an immediate ‘security crisis for Europe.’ They told us then—Ukraine and Poland—both told us then, as a result of waiving sanctions, we’re going to see Russian troops. They were right.  It's almost as if they understand their neighbor. It's almost as if they understand Putin's desire to reassemble the Soviet Union.  It’s almost as if they believe Vladimir Putin when he said that he believes the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th century was the dissolution of the Soviet Union. And he wants to bring it back together by force, which I would note would be a grave national security threat to the United States.  Now some will say when they mean European unity, they really mean unity with Germany. Indeed, I've heard members on this floor say ‘Listen, I'm just not prepared to sanction Germany.’  Mr. President, this bill doesn't sanction Germany. It doesn't sanction the German government. It doesn't sanction a German company. It sanctions Nord Stream 2 AG, which is wholly owned and controlled by Gazprom.  This is sanctioning a Russian cutout because this pipeline is a tool for Putin's aggression in Europe.  And even when it comes to unity in Germany, what they really mean is unity with Angela Merkel. And I'll concede that. Angela Merkel wants this pipeline. I don't fully understand why, but she does. But Angela Merkel is no longer the Chancellor of Germany.  Indeed, the German people went to the polls and they voted her party out of office.  So one would think from the United States—to the extent we're concerned about standing with an ally—we should be concerned about the current government of Germany, not the former government. And we should respect the views of the German people. Now the current government of Germany is hopelessly fractured on Nord Stream 2. The Greens, who are part of this coalition government, passionately oppose Nord Stream 2. Vocally, repeatedly they've condemned Nord Stream 2 and they're an integral part of this German government.  But just a few hours ago, the German Defense Minister—on the other side—said Nord Stream 2 is off the table. They're not willing to do anything to stop Nord Stream 2.  And the German Chancellor has said the same, declaring that he seeks a positive reset with Putin. This is the same Putin that has tanks on the border of Ukraine and he is preparing to invade.  Another argument that we will hear is that sanctions should be kept in our pocket, we should reserve them for use later, in the case of a Russian invasion.  Now, I would note, this is not what our Ukrainian allies advocate. And I have trouble believing anyone in this chamber actually takes this argument seriously, nor should they. Putin doesn't.  Putin believes that once he brings Nord Stream 2 online, and once he's changed the region through invasion, that no one will have the will to impose sanctions. And I would note, he's not crazy to believe that.  When the Biden administration first capitulated to Russia on Nord Stream 2, the Biden administration and the German government made a promise. They said if, if, if, Russia uses energy for energy blackmail, then we will stop the pipeline. They beat their chest with that promise. They were quite bold about it. I've had some members of the Senate say, ‘Well, we've got really strong promises from Germany now.’  Well, what's happened since then? Russia has nakedly and unequivocally used energy for energy blackmail. Energy prices have skyrocketed in Europe. And Putin is openly boasting, he is laughing and saying ‘Well turn Nord Stream 2 on, your energy prices will go down.’ He's not hiding it. He's not pretending, he did exactly what the Biden White House and the German government said—if you do X, we will stop it. He did it openly, brazenly, laughingly, and absolutely nothing happened. Zero. Crickets.  Mr. President, I ask you as a reasonable man, if the German government and if the Biden White House was unwilling to impose sanctions when Putin immediately triggered what they said was their redline, in what universe will the Biden White House or the German government have greater resolve once millions of Germans are dependent on Russian natural gas from Nord Stream 2 to heat their homes?  When it is literally stopping the Germans from freezing to death, because if the Ukrainian pipeline is shut down it becomes the only viable source of heat. Do we really think they're going to have greater courage then than they have had so far? Nobody does. Putin doesn't.  And it's important to understand, the debate before this chamber is: Do we impose sanctions before an invasion in order to stop the invasion or do we threaten sanctions after an invasion is done?  The bill that my colleague Senator Menendez is pushing would do the latter. It would impose sanctions after an invasion is completed. I don't think Putin believes those sanctions would ever be imposed. But, I can tell you Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has very explicitly addressed this issue. Here's what he said—quote, ‘Only if the sanctions are applied prior to the armed conflict. Would they become a prevention mechanism for any possible escalation?’ That's the president of Ukraine, begging the members of this Senate to vote in favor of the bill on the floor today. Today will be one of our very last chances to stop Nord Stream 2 and to stop an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Just a few minutes ago, two of my colleagues, Senator Murphy and Senator Shaheen, had a colloquy in which they explained why they had flipped their positions. They and every other Democrat in this chamber have voted for sanctions on Nord Stream 2 not once, but twice. Every Democrat voted in support of my bipartisan sanctions on Nord Stream 2.  Only two things have changed since all of the Democrats voted in favor of these sanctions. Number one: The occupant of the White House. Who now has a D behind his name instead of an R.  The White House is furiously lobbying Democrats, asking Democrats to stand with their party, sadly at the expense of our allies, at the expense of Europe, at the expense of US national security. On the merits, Mr. President, this should be a very easy vote. And I would suggest, if Joe Biden were not President, if Donald Trump were sitting in the Oval Office today, every single Democrat in this chamber would vote for these sanctions. All of them. As they did twice when Donald Trump was sitting in the Oval Office.  The other thing that has changed, by the way, are the Russian troops on the border of Ukraine. Which is exactly what the Ukrainians in the Poles told us what happened when Biden waived these sanctions.  Those are the two things that have changed.  And I have to say my colleagues, Senator Murphy and Shaheen had a very odd colloquy, because they decided to go after me personally instead of focusing on the merits of the issue. And in particular, they said, ‘You know when Trump was President, Senator Cruz didn't hold his State Department nominees over Nord Stream 2. And Trump didn't impose sanctions over Nord Stream 2.’ Now Mr. President, I recognize in politics sometimes—heat of the moment—you say things you don't entirely think through them. But even in the annals of bad arguments, that is a singularly absurd argument. It's true, I didn't hold the State Department nominees over Nord Stream 2. It's true Trump didn't impose sanctions. Why? Because we stopped Nord Stream 2. Because we were successful.  When I authored the bipartisan sanctions, there were significant elements of the Trump administration that resisted it. The Treasury Department fought mightily against it. And I was more than happy to battle my own party on this because this is the right thing to do for US national security. Is there even one Democrat with the courage to do that? Against his own party?  Now that it's the other side, the argument ‘I didn’t hold any nominees,’ why would I hold nominees? President Trump signed the bill!  I've said from the beginning, if Biden imposes the sanctions, I will lift all the holds. I lifted 32 holds in December to get this vote.  My focus is on stopping this pipeline and stopping Putin and Russia. And their argument will be well, Trump didn't impose sanctions. That's correct. Because Putin stopped building the pipeline.  I remind you of the timing: President Trump signed the bill—if my memory serves correctly—at 7pm on a Thursday night. Putin stopped building the pipeline at 6:45pm, 15 minutes beforehand. There was nothing to sanction because they didn't commit the sanctionable conduct—they stopped. They only returned to building the pipeline.  Mr. President, do you know what date Putin began building deep sea pipeline once again? January 24, 2021, four days after Joe Biden was sworn into office. Putin knew that Biden was going to do what he did: Waive the sanctions and surrender. The sanctions worked! We had a bipartisan victory that inexplicably this White House gave away.  Now I want to take a minute to speak to my Democratic colleagues. Listen, there are lots of issues we're going to disagree with in a partisan manner. That's fine. We'll talk about tax rates, whether they should be high or low. We can have good, vigorous arguments about that. That's part of our democracy. But in this instance, the Biden White House is carrying out a policy that makes no sense. That abandons our allies. That is harmful to American national security. That strengthens and encourages the aggression of Vladimir Putin, a bully and a tyrant. And that makes war much more likely.  Most if not all of my Democratic colleagues know all of this. And I'm gonna ask my Democratic colleagues to do something hard, which is have the courage to stand up and take some partisan grief for voting against the White House on this. Save the White House from the mistake they're making. That's one of the roles of the Senate.  We keep hearing the analogy the Framers used of a saucer to cool the tempers of the moment. The Senate did that with President Trump. The Senate should do so with President Biden as well.  In my 10 years in the United States Senate, I've taken a lot of votes. Mr. President, you've taken a lot of votes. There are very few votes I think are as consequential as the vote we're getting ready to take. If Senate Democrats put partisan loyalty above national security, if they vote simply by party line, it will dramatically increase the chances of a violent Russian invasion of Ukraine. And days or weeks or months from now, if we turn on the television set and see Russian tanks in the streets of Kiev, the reason will be that the United States Senate heard the pleas of our Ukrainian allies and we turned a deaf ear to them. I pray that we don't do so. The eyes of history are upon us, and this body—Republicans and Democrats—should rise to the occasion. ###"

It's not medicine. It's not actually taking care of the health of the kids’WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) today announced that he plans to introduce a bill to stop the recently-passed vaccine mandate for D.C. students from going into effect. Two weeks ago, the D.C. City Council voted to mandate D.C. students get vaccinated against Covid-19 by March 1, 2022, taking healthcare decisions away from parents. The bill passed 11-1, with only one member of the City Council voting against the measure.LISTEN: Cruz blasts school vaccine mandates: Who are these petty authoritarians trying to make this decision for you?During an interview with Ben Shapiro, Senator Cruz stated:“These mandates, we're seeing them all over the place. You know, we're seeing them in schools. It is amazing how many Democrats are willing to try to force parents to get their kid vaccinated.”“I’ll tell you, the District of Columbia—the school board—voted to force every child in D.C. to get vaccinated. I'm introducing this week legislation in the Senate to reverse that order. Under the Constitution, the District of Columbia is under the authority of Congress.”“The school board has no right to force you to get your five year old vaccinated. If you want to vaccinate your kid, vaccinate your kid. But if you don't want to, who are these petty authoritarians trying to make this decision for you? And sadly, it's a pattern we're seeing across the board.” …“I don't know that it was ever science—this administration treated it as politics from day one. You look at something like mask mandates in schools, the email traffic has come out with the White House and CDC that the reason they did that is the teachers union bosses wanted it. Now listening to union bosses may be good politics for a Democrat, but it's not science. It's not medicine. It's not actually taking care of the health of the kids.”“And if you look right now where we are, 40% of parents across the country of school aged kids say that their child has fallen behind due to the pandemic and the school closures. And yet nonetheless, we've got right now this week, nearly 4,000 schools across this country are shut down. They're not offering in-person school for at least one day of the week and many of them for every day of the week. This is wrong. It’s hurting children. … Unfortunately, the union bosses—they don't give a damn about the kids.”Listen to Sen. Cruz’s remarks HERE.###"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, spoke to The National Review’s Jimmy Quinn about his leadership in the Senate urging President Biden to impose Congressionally mandated, bipartisan sanctions on Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline—a project that if completed would threaten the national security of the United States and our allies. In response to President Biden’s refusal to impose these sanctions, Sen. Cruz is holding several of President Biden’s nominees for the State and Treasury Departments.In the article, Jimmy Quinn wrote:“In an interview with National Review last Friday, Cruz fired back, hitting Biden’s ‘capitulation’ to Putin, Senate Democrats’ hypocrisy, and the media’s wrongheaded reporting on his stance: ‘The next dictator in Russia will be reaping the rewards of Biden’s unilateral surrender, and those billions will be used to fuel Russia’s military buildup, hostility, and aggression directed at Europe, directed at America and our allies.’“The Senate Foreign Relations Committee this afternoon moved 33 additional nominees to the Senate floor, setting up a showdown. By all indications, Cruz sounds ready to stand his ground, but in his interview with NR, he also reiterated an offer that he recently extended to the Biden administration as a way to resolve the standoff: He just wants a congressional vote on the administration’s policy. That offer is based on a sanctions law — the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act — that requires the president to sanction entities involved in Nord Stream 2, or else attempt to waive the required penalties via a congressional vote.“‘If they follow the statute, it triggers an automatic vote in Congress on a congressional override, and what I told the administration in writing a month ago is that if they comply with federal law and trigger that congressional override, I’ll lift the hold on the career State Department nominees and the Treasury nominees the instant they trigger that vote,’ he says.”[…]“Cruz told NR, however, that he thinks that it’s the Democrats who are motivated by politics, as they pull their punches while the White House advances a policy that Democrats themselves see as damaging to U.S. national security.”[…]“Cruz also cites inaccurate reporting about the scope of his holds. He told NR that he currently has holds on 18 of the president’s nominees to posts at the State Department and Treasury Department, a number that’s likely to go up when the latest nominations reach the Senate floor. The New York Times, which initially reported on October 2 that Cruz was blocking 59 nominees, issued a correction last week to clarify that holds could ‘potentially’ be placed on 59 of Biden’s nominees.“‘They had to correct it because the State Department’s talking points are laughably wrong — the Biden administration has been incredibly slow in making nominations,’ Cruz says. ‘The Senate Democrats have not prioritized confirming those nominees. So the overwhelming majority of the delay is due to their own incompetence. And they somehow think planting these stories will make me acquiesce to Joe Biden’s capitulation to Russia.’”Read the full article featuring Sen. Cruz’s interview here and below. Watch Sen. Cruz object on the Senate floor here.National ReviewJimmy QuinnOctober 19, 2021In an interview with NR, the Texas senator fires back at smears from the White House, Senate Democrats, and the media over his stand against a Russian pipeline.President Biden’s refusal to stand in the way of Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline has earned him rebukes from America’s Eastern European allies and members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. Biden and his team agree with the critics’ central objection — that it’s a malign influence project that will increase the Kremlin’s leverage over its neighbors. But they argue that imposing tough sanctions on the pipeline, which runs over 750 miles under the Baltic Sea to Germany, would anger Berlin.Quite possibly the only person with the leverage to force the administration to change its stance is Ted Cruz. The senator from Texas is blocking several of Joe Biden’s nominees to diplomatic posts and other positions until the Biden administration relents and imposes congressionally mandated sanctions.His stance has provoked a furious reaction, though, even from Senate Democrats who agree that the pipeline needs to be stopped before it becomes operational. His blockade has earned him the ire of those lawmakers, the White House, and major newspapers for, as the Washington Post editorial board wrote, “putting sand in the gears of government” and displaying an “indifference to the hard work of maintaining U.S. leadership abroad.”In an interview with National Review last Friday, Cruz fired back, hitting Biden’s “capitulation” to Putin, Senate Democrats’ hypocrisy, and the media’s wrongheaded reporting on his stance: “The next dictator in Russia will be reaping the rewards of Biden’s unilateral surrender, and those billions will be used to fuel Russia’s military buildup, hostility, and aggression directed at Europe, directed at America and our allies.”The Senate Foreign Relations Committee this afternoon moved 33 additional nominees to the Senate floor, setting up a showdown. By all indications, Cruz sounds ready to stand his ground, but in his interview with NR, he also reiterated an offer that he recently extended to the Biden administration as a way to resolve the standoff: He just wants a congressional vote on the administration’s policy. That offer is based on a sanctions law — the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act — that requires the president to sanction entities involved in Nord Stream 2, or else attempt to waive the required penalties via a congressional vote.“If they follow the statute, it triggers an automatic vote in Congress on a congressional override, and what I told the administration in writing a month ago is that if they comply with federal law and trigger that congressional override, I’ll lift the hold on the career State Department nominees and the Treasury nominees the instant they trigger that vote,” he says.He also says that “more than one Senate Democrat” has called his compromise “reasonable,” and has “urged the administration to accept it.” But Biden’s team hasn’t shown any interest in compromising, and Cruz blames “the political operatives at the White House” for refusing to play ball.Indeed, the administration knows that Republicans and Democrats have united against the pipeline and would certainly override any attempt to waive the sanctions. So the administration’s best bet is to avoid that vote as long as it can.In May, as is required under a different sanctions law, the State Department found that the Nord Stream 2 corporate entity and its German CEO are engaged in sanctionable activity, but it still waived the ensuing sanctions. At the time, the pipeline was more than 90 percent complete, and the waivers all but ensured its completion, which came about late, in September. The pipeline now awaits EU regulatory approval, which Moscow is trying to expedite by withholding gas flows to Europe, a move intended to extract concessions by exacerbating the continent’s energy-supply crisis.There’s widespread bipartisan opposition to the administration’s policy toward Nord Stream 2, but a number of Senate Democrats have nonetheless ripped into Cruz’s effort to block Biden nominees. During a hearing in June, Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Menendez slammed Cruz: “Maybe it’s your presidential aspirations — I don’t know — but you’re turning to political purposes.” And last month, Cruz went toe-to-toe with many of them on the Senate floor during a late-night session to debate and vote on senior State Department nominations over Cruz’s objections. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer panned Cruz’s “irrational stonewalling.”Cruz told NR, however, that he thinks that it’s the Democrats who are motivated by politics, as they pull their punches while the White House advances a policy that Democrats themselves see as damaging to U.S. national security.“A point that I have made to my Democratic colleagues many, many times, both on the floor of the Senate and also privately in conversations, is that when we had a Republican president, Donald Trump, I was not remotely shy in leaning in vigorously against the Trump administration to urge them to fully implement these sanctions, which they did,” he says. “And there was meaningful resistance within the Trump administration to fully implementing these sanctions. Ultimately, President Trump and the administration did so.”“But a question I’ve asked my Democratic colleagues repeatedly: Why are they so unwilling to stand up to their own party’s president?”It’s worth noting that Cruz’s blockade isn’t an absolute one. He emphasized that, since the start of the Biden administration, he has been holding regular conversations, “sometimes even daily,” with the State Department. When Antony Blinken, soon after his confirmation as secretary of state, expressed a willingness to work with Cruz, the two of them “negotiated incremental releases of those holds in exchange for incremental improvements in their policy,” Cruz says. And Cruz took credit for Blinken’s release of a “strong statement” in March condemning the pipeline and vowing to impose sanctions on the entities involved in its construction. In the statement, Blinken called the pipeline “a bad deal” and warned that companies participating in its construction risk facing sanctions.If that doesn’t sound far from Cruz’s own position, that’s by design, Cruz says:Within moments of that statement, I listed several of the holds I had placed and indeed worked with the State Department on the precise wording of Secretary Blinken’s statement in exchange for my lifting those holds. Throughout this process, the administration has seen that I’m willing to be reasonable and engage in compromise moving forward so long as we are making real progress confronting Russia.The March compromise led to the confirmation of William Burns as CIA director.But since the waivers in May of the sanctions, no more of those deals have been reached. “Unfortunately, State was overruled by the White House, and the political operatives of the White House disregarded the national-security interests of the United States and instead ordered the administration to capitulate to Russia,” Cruz says. The Washington Post reported in June that Blinken had supported tough Nord Stream 2 sanctions but was overruled by the White House.Nevertheless, Cruz has made a number of concessions for reasons other than the policy changes he negotiated with the administration. “Out of senatorial courtesy,” for instance, Cruz declined to place a hold on the confirmation of Ken Salazar as the U.S. envoy to Mexico; Salazar is now serving in that post. To date, he is the only one of Biden’s ambassadorial nominees to be confirmed“I have likewise conveyed to the administration a willingness to dial up or down the holds as appropriate to specific circumstances,” Cruz says. “So national-security positions where there is a critical need, I have deliberately not placed holds.” He also lifted holds on State Department nominees who “might arguably provide some help trying to clean up the mess that the Biden administration made in Afghanistan.”Meanwhile, Cruz says, the State Department is leading an “amusingly inept” PR campaign against his holds, beginning with a Politico article that blamed him for keeping U.S. ambassadorships in Europe empty. “I have to admit I laughed out loud. They somehow seem to think that rich Democratic donors who want to move into their ambassadorial mansions and start throwing wine-and-cheese parties are a high priority for the people of Texas.”Cruz also cites inaccurate reporting about the scope of his holds. He told NR that he currently has holds on 18 of the president’s nominees to posts at the State Department and Treasury Department, a number that’s likely to go up when the latest nominations reach the Senate floor. The New York Times, which initially reported on October 2 that Cruz was blocking 59 nominees, issued a correction last week to clarify that holds could “potentially” be placed on 59 of Biden’s nominees.“They had to correct it because the State Department’s talking points are laughably wrong — the Biden administration has been incredibly slow in making nominations,” Cruz says. “The Senate Democrats have not prioritized confirming those nominees. So the overwhelming majority of the delay is due to their own incompetence. And they somehow think planting these stories will make me acquiesce to Joe Biden’s capitulation to Russia.”###"
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sens-cruz-cornyn-rep-pfluger-call-on-amb-salazar-to-defend-usmca-provisions-that-benefit-texas-energy-and-agriculture,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and John Cornyn (R-Texas), along with U.S. Rep. August Pfluger (R-Texas), today sent a bipartisan, bicameral letter with other members of the Texas Congressional Delegation to the recently confirmed U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar. In the letter, the lawmakers draw attention to Mexico’s discriminatory actions that violate the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), and urge Ambassador Salazar to directly engage with senior Mexican officials to ensure fair trade for Texas agriculture and energy producers.Co-signers include Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), Michael McCaul (R-Texas), Michael C. Burgess (R-Texas), Randy Weber (R-Texas), Roger Williams (R-Texas), Brian Babin (R-Texas), Vicente Gonzalez (D-Texas), Jodey C.

Jackson (R-Texas), Tony Gonzales (R-Texas), Beth Van Duyne (R-Texas), Jake Ellzey (R-Texas), and Pete Sessions (R-Texas).In the letter, the lawmakers wrote:“Mexico has taken several actions that discriminate against American energy producers and favor SOEs [state owned enterprises]. This includes the recent modifications to the Hydrocarbons Law, which allows Mexican officials the power to suspend and revoke key permits for private operations. Most recently, the government’s proposed constitutional reforms would increase state control of the electricity industry and severely limit private investment. These steps, among others, harm our critical trading partnership with Mexico and potentially violate key tenets of the USMCA.”[…]“Proper implementation of the USMCA is a top priority and the U.S. must engage at all levels of government to ensure that the American people can reap the full benefits from this important trade agreement.”Read the full text of the letter below and here.October 19, 2021The Honorable Ken SalazarAmbassador of the United States of AmericaPaseo de la Reforma 305Colonia Cuauhtemoc06500 Mexico City, Mexico.Dear Ambassador Salazar,Congratulations on your recent confirmation to serve as the United States’ Ambassador to Mexico. As members of the Texas delegation, we understand the close cultural and economic ties our country has with Mexico. We look forward to working with you on the many shared issues facing our countries, including border security and economic cooperation.The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is a historic, bipartisan pro-growth trade agreement that puts American businesses, families, and workers first. This agreement is especially important for our home state, because it will allow more made-in-Texas goods to flow freely across North America. That is why we are focused on ensuring full implementation of USMCA and are concerned with recent actions taken by the Mexican Administration to favor state owned enterprises (SOEs) and push out American investment. These actions violate the spirit and letter of the USMCA and need to be addressed.Mexico has taken several actions that discriminate against American energy producers and favor SOEs. This includes the recent modifications to the Hydrocarbons Law, which allows Mexican officials the power to suspend and revoke key permits for private operations. Most recently, the government’s proposed constitutional reforms would increase state control of the electricity industry and severely limit private investment. These steps, among others, harm our critical trading partnership with Mexico and potentially violate key tenets of the USMCA. The Mexican government’s measures on renewable energy and recent news related to the Zama field serve as good examples of the larger problems that concern us.  We urge you to engage directly with senior Mexican government officials to ensure that American energy firms are able to export goods fairly and can continue to drive private investment and job growth throughout the region.Additionally, Texas farmers and ranchers have long benefited from free trade with Mexico and Canada. The USMCA locked in key provisions for agriculture and includes state of the art rules on agricultural biotechnology. Rigorous enforcement of these important priorities is vital for Texas producers.  Mexico remains the top destination for U.S. agricultural trade – ensuring that Mexico abides by these commitments remains a top concern for the producers we represent.We also have raised these concerns directly with United States Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai. Proper implementation of the USMCA is a top priority and the U.S. must engage at all levels of government to ensure that the American people can reap the full benefits from this important trade agreement. We appreciate your commitment to these issues and look forward to working with you to deliver solutions for Texas businesses, workers, farmers, and ranchers.Sincerely, /s/ ###"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today introduced the Stop the SURGE Act to demand President Biden, his administration, and Congressional Democrats address the unprecedented man-made crisis on the South Texas border and their political decisions that directly created it. This legislation would establish new ports of entry in 13 communities across the country and mandate that all illegal aliens encountered at Border Patrol Sectors in Texas be transferred to these new ports for processing. The legislation would provide much needed relief to Border Patrol and local law enforcement who have been stretched beyond capacity at the Texas border, and require insulated communities to help shoulder the burdens of their preferred open-border policies.Upon introduction, Sen. Cruz said:“For the past ten months, President Biden and his administration have willingly surrendered the United States’ southern border to dangerous criminal cartels, with no thought given to the South Texas border communities like McAllen and Del Rio, which are running low on resources from dealing with this massive influx of illegal immigrants. That’s why today I am introducing this crucial legislation to alleviate the massive overload at the southern border by establishing new ports of entry in Democrat-led communities such as North Hero, Vermont, where Bernie Sanders spends his summers, and Martha’s Vineyard, where Democrat elites host their cocktail parties.“If Washington Democrats had to endure even a fraction of the suffering South Texas families, farmers, ranchers, and small businesses have had to face, our nation’s immigration laws would be enforced, the wall would be built, and the Remain in Mexico policy would be re-implemented. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stop ignoring the plight of South Texas communities and act swiftly to end this horrific humanitarian crisis.“My Democrat colleagues have hosted hearing after hearing on amnesty and federalizing elections while completely ignoring the crisis at our southern border. From my time this year on the ground in Laredo and Del Rio, it is abundantly clear that President Biden has all but abandoned our border patrol agents and processing facilities, and left Texas communities to fend for themselves. President Biden and Democrats need to step up to defend our southern border and support our heroic Customs and Border Protection officials.”Read the full text of the Stop the SURGE Act here.BACKGROUNDThe Stop the SURGE Act, or Stop the Surge of Unsafe Rio Grande Encampments Act, would relocate illegal immigrants from South Texas to newly established ports of entry for processing under the Immigration & Naturalization Act (Title 8) and Public Health Service Act (Title 42), including:Local Border Patrol Sectors in Texas continue to be overwhelmed by the volume of illegal aliens at the border. The Texas government has been forced to declare a state of disaster and provide its law enforcement and fiscal resources to address the crisis. This month, the Biden administration announced that as many as 400,000 additional illegal aliens will enter through the southern border. According to Panamanian officials, roughly 60,000 of those in the caravan are now anticipated to come from Haiti. As the crisis worsens, the state and local governments have been requesting help and have been met by inaction from the Biden-Harris administration. In response to this worsening crisis, the Biden administration has instead chosen to release illegal aliens into South Texas communities like McAllen, even as the communities raise concerns about a lack of federal support and resources to establish and maintain proper shelters.Last month, Sen. Cruz traveled to Del Rio and received a briefing from Interim Chief Patrol Agent in Charge Robert Garcia and Border Patrol command staff after the initial surge of illegal Haitian immigrants were encountered at the border, none of whom have been tested for COVID-19, with roughly 15,000 of them camping under the Del Rio International Bridge. Earlier in the month, Sen. Cruz led his fellow Republican Senate Judiciary Committee members in sending a letter to Chairman Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) urging the Democrat-led committee to hold a hearing and invite the Mayor of McAllen, Texas, Javier Villalobos, to testify on the ongoing humanitarian, national security, and public health crises on our southern border after illegal crossings in July hit an all-time high. In August, Sen.

https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sens-cruz-lankford-rep-hartzler-stand-for-coachs-right-to-pray,"WASHINGTON, D.C. –  U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on The Constitution, and James Lankford (R-Okla.) today filed an amicus brief signed by 11 other Senators and 14 Representatives in support of Coach Joe Kennedy in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District. The brief asks the Supreme Court toreverse the Ninth Circuit’s decision that allowed Coach Kennedy to be fired for silently kneeling and praying after school football games. U.S. Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) is co-leading the brief for the House. Senate co-signers include Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), and John Thune (R-S.D.).In the brief, the members wrote:“This Court’s review is urgently needed to correct the Ninth Circuit’s clearly erroneous interpretation of the Establishment Clause that upheld Respondent’s firing of Kennedy and obliterates the Free Exercise rights of public school teachers and coaches. The immediate and cascading effects of this case can scarcely be overstated—if the Ninth Circuit’s holding is left to stand, certain school districts will be emboldened (and others will feel compelled) to curtail the Free Exercise and Speech rights of half a million public school teachers and coaches who work in Ninth Circuit jurisdictions, while seriously threatening those rights for the three million teachers and coaches in other circuits nationwide.“According to the Ninth Circuit, teachers’ and coaches’ speech degrades into unprotected government speech the moment they step through the schoolhouse gate and engage in ‘expression . . . during a time when [they are] generally tasked with communicating with students’—meaning any time during school hours or functions. “Perhaps realizing that position is indefensible, the Ninth Circuit doubles down by concluding that even if Kennedy’s speech is private and protected, the Establishment Clause still requires the School District to shut it down and punish him to avoid the perception that it 'endorsed' Kennedy’s religious beliefs . . . Under this expansive legal theory, any private religious expression by a teacher or coach violates the Establishment Clause and requires the school’s immediate and decisive action to stop it—all because there’s a chance that someone might think that the School District endorses the otherwise private religious expression. But that theory, of course, contradicts both the Establishment Clause’s purpose and this Court’s precedent.“The Establishment Clause was enacted to protect the religious practice and expression of individuals and minorities from the preferences of majority rule, whether that majority be theist or atheist. The drafters never intended to eradicate religiosity in public life—whether in the form of prayer or any other expression. But the Ninth Circuit’s approach falsely pits the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses against each other in a zero-sum game.”Read the full text of their amicus brief here.Kennedy was head coach for the Bremerton High School junior varsity football team and an assistant coach for the varsity team. After each game, he waited until the players cleared the field, then took a knee and silently prayed. Bremerton High School sent Kennedy a letter demanding he stop praying after games. Coach Kennedy’s contract with Bremerton School District was not renewed, resulting in his termination. Kennedy filed a lawsuit against Bremerton School District, which a federal district court dismissed. On appeal, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit argued Kennedy’s prayers were not protected by the Constitution because he was praying as a public employee rather than in his private, personal capacity. In 2019, Coach Kennedy asked the Supreme Court to review the case, and Sen. Cruz joined 14 members of Congress to file an amicus brief in support of Coach Kennedy. The Court denied review of the case, with a concurring statement by four Justices requesting more information. As such, the case went back to the lower courts. In March 2021, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit upheld the District Court’s decision that Kennedy’s silent, public prayers after football games violate the Establishment Clause, and the circuit court denied a request for en banc review.###"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) today announced a bipartisan resolution to honor and commend the women who served the United States in the Navy’s Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES) during World War II.Additional cosponsors include Sens.

Cruz said:“On today’s 246th anniversary of the U.S. Navy, we rightfully honor the extraordinary courage and sacrifice of the tens-of-thousands of women who voluntarily answered the call to serve our great nation in WWII. As the father of two daughters, I am proud to join Sens. Warren and Blackburn on this bipartisan resolution ensuring America’s early female sailors are memorialized for generations to come.”Sen. Warren said:“Tens of thousands of women bravely stepped forward to serve our country in the U.S. Navy during World War II—we owe them our gratitude. Today, on the Navy’s birthday, Senator Blackburn and I are calling on our colleagues in Congress to honor these women for their work and their perseverance through this resolution.”Sen. Blackburn added:“Nearly 400 women of the Volunteer State valiantly answered the call to serve their nation during WWII. Their sacrifice—and that of countless others across the nation—ensured victory for our allied forces. This bipartisan resolution honors their legacy and ensures their bravery is not forgotten.”President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the WAVES on July 30, 1942, when he signed the Navy Women’s Reserve Act into law. While women had served in the U.S. Navy’s enlisted ranks in a variety of positions during World War I, legislation passed after World War I limited women to serve as nurses until the creation of the WAVES. By the end of World War II, more than 400,000 women had served the United States in military capacities, with every U.S. Navy aviator who entered combat receiving some part of his training from a WAVE.###"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) last week introduced legislation to disrupt illicit gold mining and trafficking of other precious metals that are commonly used to fund terrorist groups and rogue regimes. This bill would empower the United States to take action against those complicit in mining and moving these resources. Sen. Cruz previously introduced this legislation in early 2019. Last month, Sen. Cruz joined a bipartisan resolution calling attention to the rise in illicit mining and trafficking of gold in Latin America.Upon introduction, Sen. Cruz said:“The mining and trade of illicit precious metals across the globe continues to pose a national security threat to the U.S. and our allies. The porous border between Venezuela and Colombia facilitates the smuggling of illegal gold with ties to Marxist guerrilla groups like the National Liberation Army (ELN) and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Venezuelan mining is also exported and laundered to boost dangerous regimes such as Iran, and moved through countries such as Turkey without transparency or accountability. This bill would help disrupt these activities by empowering the Treasury Department to designate jurisdictions of primary money laundering concern for trade in illicit metals.”Sen. Tillis said:“Illegal mining and trafficking of natural resources in many countries, including Venezuela and Iran, are used to fund rogue regimes and other terrorist organizations. This is a direct threat to our national security. We must take action against these organizations in order to further prevent these regimes from benefiting financially from these illegal transactions. I am proud to work with Senators Cruz and Rubio to combat these illicit acts and bring a stop to these regimes.”Sen. Rubio added:“I’m proud to join my Senate colleagues in supporting this legislative effort, which would empower our nation to hold those countries, institutions, or banks accountable for illegally trading gold from Iran or Venezuela. We must prevent individuals and entities who are illegally enriching themselves from exploiting their nation’s natural resources and trying to sell precious metals abroad.”Read the full text of their bill here.###"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today sent a letter to Attorney General (AG) Merrick Garland raising serious concerns and questions over a possible conflict of interest between AG Garland, whose son-in-law reportedly runs an educational organization that sells critical race theory to schools, and Garland’s recent memorandum directing the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to pursue parents who oppose critical race theory.In the letter, the senators wrote:“On October 4, you issued a memorandum directing the Federal Bureau of Investigations (“FBI”) and United States Attorneys’ Offices to address purported harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school board members. Actual violence, harassment, and threats are criminal activities and must be condemned. Yet your directive to the FBI runs a serious risk of conflating legitimate and meritorious protest by concerned parents with criminal conduct.”[…]“Your daughter, Rebecca Garland, married Alexander (“Xan”) Newman Tanner in 2018. Mr. Tanner is a co-founder of Panorama Education (“Panorama”), a ‘social learning’ provider that provides consultancy services that reportedly aids schools in teaching critical race theory under the guise of ‘equity and inclusion’ to America’s children.”[…]“In early September, Parents Defendant Education (PDE) released an article detailing parents’ concerns about data collection and student surveys implemented in Fairfax County, Virginia, under the local school district’s contract with Panorama. On September 29, the National School Boards Association sent a letter to the Biden administration raising complaints about parents’ protests at school board meetings. Then, less than a week later, you issued the memorandum, which will benefit companies like Panorama, whose contracts may be in jeopardy as parents stand up to school boards and demand that their children not be indoctrinated with critical race theory.”[...]“According to the Department of Justice’s (“DOJ”) Conflict of Interest Policy, ‘An employee may not participate, without authorization, in a particular matter having specific parties that could affect the financial interests of members of her household.’ This policy is to prevent both actual conflicts of interests, as well as the appearance of a conflict of interest.”On Wednesday, Sen. Cruz questioned Assistant AG for the Civil Rights Division, Kristen Clarke, on the politicization of President Biden’s DOJ and AG Garland’s recent reference to parents protesting critical race theory as possible “terrorists” in a memorandum. Watch his full line of questioning here.Read the full text of today’s letter here and below.October 8, 2021The Honorable Merrick GarlandAttorney General of the United StatesUnited States Department of Justice950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.Washington, D.C. 20530Attorney General Garland:On October 4, you issued a memorandum directing the Federal Bureau of Investigations (“FBI”) and United States Attorneys’ Offices to address purported harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school board members. Actual violence, harassment, and threats are criminal activities and must be condemned. Yet your directive to the FBI runs a serious risk of conflating legitimate and meritorious protest by concerned parents with criminal conduct. The memorandum implies that parents who protest school boards, including those who oppose the inclusion of critical race theory in elementary, junior high, and high school curricula, may pose a public safety threat. In doing so, the memorandum appears intended to intimidate parents across the country into silence.As a matter of policy, this memorandum is extraordinarily concerning, which is why I joined Senator Grassley’s letter on behalf of the 11 members of the Senate Judiciary Committee in writing to you about this policy. Equally concerning, however, is reporting about an alleged connection between your family members and controversial curricula that will directly benefit from this memorandum and the chilling of speech.Your daughter, Rebecca Garland, married Alexander (“Xan”) Newman Tanner in 2018.[3] Mr. Tanner is a co-founder of Panorama Education (“Panorama”), a “social learning” provider that provides consultancy services that reportedly aids schools in teaching critical race theory under the guise of “equity and inclusion” to America’s children. According to a recent report from the Daily Wire, Panorama holds contracts with at least 22 school districts across the country, which have paid Panorama a combined $12 million in recent years. These reports outline allegations that parents and advocacy groups have recently raised about Panorama’s contracts, curriculum, data collection practices, and student surveys in early September. In early September, Parents Defendant Education (PDE) released an article detailing parents’ concerns about data collection and student surveys implemented in Fairfax County, Virginia, under the local school district’s contract with Panorama. On September 29, the National School Boards Association sent a letter to the Biden administration raising complaints about parents’ protests at school board meetings. Then, less than a week later, you issued the memorandum, which will benefit companies like Panorama, whose contracts may be in jeopardy as patents stand up to school boards and demand that their children not be indoctrinated with critical race theory.According to the Department of Justice’s (“DOJ”) Conflict of Interest Policy, “An employee may not participate, without authorization, in a particular matter having specific parties that could affect the financial interests of members of her household.” This policy is to prevent both actual conflicts of interests, as well as the appearance of a conflict of interest. In light of the allegations that your son-in-law’s company may benefit directly from your memorandum, I request that you respond to the following questions no later than October 21, 2021:The American people have a strong interest in ensuring that the Department of Justice is acting in their best interests, and not in the financial interest of its officials or their families.Sincerely,/s/###"
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-on-the-senate-floor-why-are-we-bankrupting-our-kids-and-grandkids,"Slams Democrats’ political theater over raising the debt ceiling to push socialist spendingWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) today delivered remarks on the Senate floor calling out Democrats for using their self-made debt ceiling crisis as a political pawn to avoid taking accountability for more reckless, out of control spending that will bankrupt the next generation. Read excerpts of his remarks below.“I rise to speak for the generations of Americans who this body is irresponsibly drowning in debt. Now, to be clear, debt is a bipartisan problem. That is a problem both parties bear substantial responsibility for.”[…]“I would note, last year was an extraordinary year with a pandemic, unlike anything any of us have ever seen in our lives. I wish Republicans had been better at exercising fiscal responsibility when we had control of the White House, and both houses of Congress. The unfortunate reality in this body, though, is that when you have a multi-trillion dollar spending bill, you can usually count on the votes of every single Democrat, and about half the Republicans. And so on spending bill after spending bill, we see 75 to 80 senators coming together, usually all the Democrats and half the Republicans. And there are about 20 of us who tried to say, ‘Why are we bankrupting our kids and grandkids?”[…]“Let’s put 9.5 trillion in context. $9.5 trillion is more than twice what the United States spent to win World War II. The entire course of the war, it costs us less than half of that to save the free world to defeat the Nazis, and Washington Democrats are trying to spend that in 12 months. It is wildly irresponsible. It is reckless. They’re trying to accompany that with trillions of dollars of new taxes. If the Democrats get their way, every tax you can think of is going up: individual income tax is going up. Corporate taxes are going up. Small business taxes are going up. Capital gains taxes are going up. The death tax is going up. Farmers are paying more in taxes, ranchers are paying more in taxes, small businesses are paying more in taxes, working families are paying more in taxes. Joe Biden’s campaign promised no one who makes $400,000 a year or less will see their taxes go up. That statement was a flat-out falsehood.”[…]“Take the Joint Committee on Taxation’s word for that, analyze the Democrats tax program, and found for roughly 80 percent of Americans taxes either stayed the same or go up. That it’s cutting taxes for a very small portion of Americans, it’s raising taxes on people with incomes as low as $40,000 a year.”[…]“Inflation is a cruel tax. It’s a tax on everybody. But it’s particularly cruel on the most vulnerable, you know, who get hammered with inflation. Senior citizens, seniors who spent their whole lives saving, they suddenly see the values of their savings going down and down and down because Washington politicians are devaluing their money. Seniors who are on a fixed income, get the same amount of money each month. But suddenly, the cost of everything goes up. Right now today, all across this country in Texas and Virginia and in every other state, prices are going up. The cost of gasoline has skyrocketed as a direct result of Joe Biden and the Democrats’ policies. The cost of food is going up, the cost of rent is going up. The cost of lumber is going up. The cost of homes is going up. According to the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, for households earning the U.S. median annual income, which is about $70,000 a year, the current inflation rate has forced them to spend another $175 a month in food, fuel, and housing. That works out to $2,100 a year. So each month if your family is at the median income level in the United States, the democrat inflation tax is about 175 bucks a month.”[…] “Yet Democrats want to add trillions more to that. How many trillions? We don’t know; they’re battling within their conference? Just how many trillions more to saddle this country, but it’s going to be a lot. But you know, the curious thing. This crisis is 100 percent, manufactured by Democrats. Why is that? Because for the entirety of this Congress, Democrats have had complete 100 percent power to raise the debt ceiling anytime they want it. How is that? Well, ordinarily, in this body, the way legislation moves, it needs 60 votes to move. It’s called the legislative filibuster. But there’s an exception to that. It’s a big exception. It’s called budget reconciliation. It comes from the Budget Act of 1974. under budget reconciliation, you only need 50 votes, not 60 votes; it’s the biggest exception that exists to the filibuster rule. Democrats, unfortunately, have 50 votes in this body, they have a majority in the House, and they have the White House. That means Democrats using budget reconciliation, and it is clear by the way that you can raise the debt ceiling using budget reconciliation. Democrats could have raised the debt ceiling in January. They didn’t. They could raise the debt ceiling in February. They didn’t; they could have raised it in March, or April, or May, or June, July, August, September. They didn’t. Were in October, Democrats could have raised the debt ceiling today. They didn’t. They could have done it with only Democratic votes. And there was not a single thing Republicans could have done to stop them. They know that. They don’t dispute that. So why are we facing a crisis? If for 10 months, Democrats could have done this anytime they wanted. Why didn’t they? Well, because there are at least some Democrats who realize drowning the nation in debt and spending in taxes is not popular back home. The voters don’t like it.”[…]“Now, I believe the end result of this game of chicken was clear that Democratic Leader Schumer was on a path to surrender was on a path to doing what he should have done a week ago or two weeks ago, or three weeks ago, or a month ago or two months ago, which is moving a reconciliation bill and raising the debt ceiling. And I can tell you; there were Democratic senators, multiple Democratic senators coming to me and coming out of the members of my party, saying, ‘Okay, how much time would it take to move a reconciliation bill? Can we get it done in time for the October 18 date that the treasury secretary is laid out?’ And to a person, Republicans answered, ‘Yes, there’s plenty of time. Under the rules of reconciliation to move forward, there’s no barrier you have all the time you need.’ I believe Democratic Leader Schumer was on the verge of surrendering. And then, unfortunately, yesterday, Republicans blinked. I think that was a mistake. I think that was the wrong decision.”[…]“If the Democratic senators who give speeches about how bad a default would be if they actually believe that we could come together today. And we could ensure the citizens of Texas citizens of Virginia, the citizens of Utah, that there will never ever, ever be a default of our debt. But if we did that, it would mean that Senator Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and President Biden couldn’t engage in the kind of theatrical, the kind of reckless brinksmanship that we’ve seen over the last several weeks that would jeopardize their radical agenda. I hope and pray that this body, the Senate, serves as the last Bulwark to stop the radical socialist agenda that Washington Democrats are trying to ramp through.”###"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today demanded the Department of Justice (DOJ) not interfere with local school board meetings or threaten the use of federal law enforcement to deter parents’ free speech. This comes after DOJ issued a memorandum suggesting federal law enforcement may need to assist policing local school board meetings.In the letter, the senators wrote:“We are concerned about the appearance of the Department of Justice policing the speech of citizens and concerned parents. We urge you to make very clear to the American public that the Department of Justice will not interfere with the rights of parents to come before school boards and speak with educators about their concerns, whether regarding coronavirus-related measures, the teaching of critical race theory in schools, sexually explicit books in schools, or any other topic.”[…]“To be clear, violence and true threats of violence are not protected speech and have no place in the public discourse of a democracy… However, the FBI should not be involved in quashing and criminalizing discourse that is well beneath violent acts… It is not appropriate to use the awesome powers of the federal government – including the PATRIOT Act, a statute designed to thwart international terrorism – to quash those who question local school boards.”Last month, the National School Boards Association (NSBA) sent a letter to President Biden asking for help from federal law enforcement, referencing the PATRIOT Act, a statute that helps the federal government fight international terrorism. NSBA highlighted situations involving angry parents often frustrated by COVID-19 mask mandates for children and the possibility of incorporating critical race theory into the academic curriculum. Angry parents are not necessarily threatening parents and these discussions are clearly protected under the First Amendment.Read the full text of the letter below.October 7, 2021The Honorable Merrick B. GarlandAttorney GeneralU.S. Department of Justice950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, D.C. 20530Dear Attorney General Garland:On October 4, you issued a memorandum titled, “Partnership Among Federal, State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial Law Enforcement to Address Threats Against School Administrators, Board Members, Teachers, and Staff.”That memorandum discussed a “disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff who participate in the vital work of running our nation’s public schools.”You directed the FBI and the various United States Attorneys to hold meetings with “federal, state, local, Tribal, and territorial leaders in each federal judicial district within 30 days” in order to “facilitate the discussion of strategies for addressing threats against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff….”Your press release for this memorandum involves numerous offices within DOJ, including, inexplicably the National Security Division, the FBI, and DOJ’s Civil Rights Division.A few days earlier, on September 29, the National School Boards Association sent a letter to President Biden asking for help from federal law enforcement “to deal with the growing number of threats of violence and acts of intimidation occurring across the nation.”According to that organization, it is  seeing an increased number of “attacks against school board members and educators for approving policies for masks to protect the health and safety of students and school employees” as well as “physical threats because of propaganda purporting the false inclusion of critical race theory within classroom instruction.”The letter references the PATRIOT Act, a statute that helps the federal government fight international terrorism, a reference that is entirely inappropriate.We are concerned about the appearance of the Department of Justice policing the speech of  citizens and concerned parents. We urge you to make very clear to the American public that the Department of Justice will not interfere with the rights of parents to come before school boards and speak with educators about their concerns, whether regarding coronavirus-related measures, the teaching of critical race theory in schools, sexually explicit books in schools, or any other topic. Furthermore, we urge you to instruct the FBI and the various United States Attorneys to make clear in the meetings discussed above that speech and democratic processes, like those that occur at a local school board meeting, must be respected.To be clear, violence and true threats of violence are not protected speech and have no place in the public discourse of a democracy. To the extent such violence and true threats of violence employ mechanisms within federal jurisdiction, the FBI is squarely within its authority to help local law enforcement investigate such crimes. However, the FBI should not be involved in quashing and criminalizing discourse that is well beneath violent acts. The reported heated encounters between concerned parents and school boards often involve speech that is clearly protected by the First Amendment. Federal law enforcement muscle should never be used against protesting parents. For example, the NSBA letter references a school board meeting being disrupted in Florida and cites to a Sarasota Herald-Tribune article discussing how the Sarasota County School Board might change its public comment protocol because of that disruption.10 That article describes how “[o]ver the past year, large crowds have shown up [at Sarasota school board meetings] to address items that are not always on the agenda, like critical race theory, masking in schools, or complaints over items in the curriculum” and that “boards throughout the state are examining their public comment protocols.”Large numbers of citizens expressing their concerns in an appropriate forum is not a matter for law enforcement, and it is even more difficult to imagine what role federal law enforcement would play in such a scenario. In the very next example, the NSBA letter cites to a Board of Education meeting in Gwinnett County, Georgia being disrupted.12 In that situation, the supposed disruption appears to have been participants refusing to wear masks while protesting the school district’s requirement that students wear masks in school.13 This too does not appear to warrant criminal investigation, especially by the federal government. Rather, these actions look a lot like civil disobedience in protest of public policy, a tactic often embraced as virtuous by Democrats when it comes to policies they oppose. Not wearing a mask in a public place may or may not be a violation of a local law, but at most it is a petty offense wholly unworthy of the federal government’s attention and the sort of civil disobedience many Democrats would embrace if the politics of wearing masks were reversed.The NSBA letter describes14 a similar meeting in Clark County, Nevada in which participants exchanged allegations of who was a “Marxist” and who was a “racist.”15 According to a news report, that meeting appears to have been disrupted on different occasions, but local law enforcement also appears to have been capable of handling the disruptions.16 Then the NSBA letter describes school board meetings in Michigan, one of which involved “the [school] board … call[ing] a recess because of opposition to critical race theory.”The article cited in the letter about this incident described the school board meeting being delayed to another day because “two board members were speaking to one another and the audience kept interrupting…. after multiple warnings to the public, [the school board president]announced that they would be going into recess and reconvene another day.”18 Again, this appears to be passionate civic engagement that local law enforcement can handle if it evolves into criminal action. And at one point the NSBA letter states, “Other groups are posting watchlists against school boards and spreading misinformation that boards are adopting critical race theory curriculum and working to maintain online learning by haphazardly attributing it to COVID-19.”19 It supports this claim with a citation to a partisan Substack article titled, “TPUSA launches project targeting school member,” which attacks the right-wing group Turning Point USA.20 Law enforcement at every level must always remain neutral in the marketplace of ideas, and your office should make clear that federal law enforcement may never intervene in the marketplace of ideas.The school board meetings at issue in the National School Boards Association letter largely appear to involve parents being frustrated by COVID-19 mask mandates for children as well as the possibility of school curricula newly incorporating the controversial academic discipline generally known as critical race theory. Parents who get upset about these topics, and others, are engaging in speech that is clearly protected under the First Amendment. We ask you to explain how any of this rises to the definition of criminal harassment. After a year of prolonged school closures, even well after it was clear that schools could safely reopen amidst COVID-19, parents are understandably asking questions and seeking accountability. Even if tempers flare at school board meetings because of these and other topics, that does not make the discussions of them any less protected under the First Amendment. As a former federal appellate judge, you are surely well aware that the legal threshold in the United States for what speech can be sanctioned because of its propensity for inciting lawless action is a high bar. In the seminal Supreme Court case Brandenburg v. Ohio, the Court ruled that speech could only be sanctioned for condoning illegal activity if that speech “is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.”21 We seriously doubt the discourse at school board meetings across the country rises to this level.Moreover, angry parents are not necessarily threatening parents, especially in the eyes of the law. In Virginia v. Black, the Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that only “true threats” were unprotected by the First Amendment, stating, “‘True threats’ encompass those statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.”22 Parents who are angry at school board members, and even verbally attack them on a personal level, are not necessarily making true threats, and is not the job of law enforcement – and cannot be the job of law enforcement, especially the FBI – to make sure parents are nice to their elected officials. They are certainly not domestic terrorists who require the use of tools such as the PATRIOT Act and the expertise of the National Security Division.Violence and true threats of violence should have no place in our civic discourse, but parents should absolutely be involved in public debates over what and how our public schools teach their children, even if those discussions get heated. When you were sworn in as the Attorney General, you took an oath to uphold our Constitution, and now your fundamental job is to protect the rights of all Americans. Perhaps the most basic and most important right every American has is the right to question our governments, from the heights of the Congress and the Presidency all the way down to the local school boards. That includes asking them some very tough questions and requesting changes to school policies. It is not appropriate to use the awesome powers of the federal government – including the PATRIOT Act, a statute designed to thwart international terrorism – to quash those who question local school boards. By even suggesting that possibility, important speech by American citizens will be chilled in school board meetings across this country. Your job now is to make clear to all stakeholders and the American people that such action is decidedly not the role of the federal government nor the role of any other government in the United States – in fact, it can never be.Sincerely,/s/###"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), and 20 of their Republican colleagues this week sent a letter to Xavier Becerra, Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Director of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Dr. Janet Woodcock, Acting Commissioner of Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The letter details how the Biden administration has not only ignored potential early treatments, but seems to have participated in an aggressive campaign against the use of specific early treatment options. Co-signers include Sens. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Reps. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), Tom Tiffany (R-Wis.), Andy Harris (R-Md.), Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), Randy Weber (R-Texas), Scott Perry (R-Pa.), Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.), Bill Posey (R-Fla.), Bob Good (R-Va.), Chip Roy (R-Texas), Jody Hice (R-Ga.), Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Mary Miller (R-Ill.), Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), and Clay Higgins (R-La.).In the letter, the senators wrote:“Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, public health officials have not only ignored potential early treatments, but at times seem to have participated in an aggressive campaign against the use of specific early treatment options,” the members write. “Even though a basic tenet of medicine is: early detection allows for early treatment which produces better results; your agencies have overtly discouraged the use of cheap and widely-available early treatments like ivermectin in favor of expensive new drugs like Remdesivir (which costs more than $3,000 per treatment). Despite the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding a study examining the effectiveness of ivermectin as an early treatment for COVID-19, your agencies have already demonstrated your strong bias against this and other potential early treatment drugs. The Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) mocking of ivermectin, conflating a widely-available human drug that was the basis for Nobel prize winning research, with its veterinary version, has cast doubt over the integrity of this study’s eventual results. We strongly believe you should explain to the American people why your agencies have failed to sufficiently examine and ensure access to a growing list of drugs being used by doctors who have had the courage to ignore NIH’s ongoing compassionless guideline of doing virtually nothing until COVID-19 patients are so sick they require hospitalization.”Read the full text of their letter below.October 5, 2021The Honorable Xavier BecerraSecretaryDepartment of Health and Human Services200 Independence Ave, SWWashington, DC 20201 Dr. Anthony S.

Peter McCullough, Harvey Risch, and George Fareed testified about real world experience and metadata analysis of multi-drug treatment protocols for early treatment of COVID-19.[6]  Dr. McCullough also described the four pillars of pandemic response:  1) Contagion Control; 2) Early Home Treatment; 3) Hospital Treatment; 4) Vaccines.[7]  At the December 8, 2020 hearing, Dr. Pierre Kory testified that “emerging publications provide conclusive data on the profound efficacy of the anti-parasite, anti-viral drug, anti-inflammatory agent called ivermectin in all stages of [COVID-19].”[8]Since these hearings, evidence of the potential of ivermectin and other repurposed drugs to treat COVID-19 has continued to accumulate.  For example, Mexico City and India’s Uttar Pradesh have both reportedly experienced positive outcomes after using ivermectin to treat individuals with COVID-19.[9]  Mexico City apparently saw reduced hospitalizations and Uttar Pradesh experienced lower positivity and fatality rates.[10]  Unfortunately, there appears to be a complete lack of information or interest by U.S. public health agencies to examine what factors contributed to these apparent positive outcomes.  Your agencies have also taken steps to curtail the use of potential early treatments.  Even though an estimated 12 to 38 percent of doctor-office prescriptions are off-label treatment drugs, your actions have created a new industry standard that restricts doctors’ abilities to prescribe certain off-label treatments for COVID-19.[11]  To justify your actions restricting access to COVID-19 drugs, your agencies claim that these treatments require randomized controlled trials (RCTs) before they can be deployed against the virus.[12]  As mentioned above, NIH is funding an RCT on ivermectin that you appear to have already prejudged.[13]  However, even in cases where an expensive and time-consuming RCT has proven a treatment’s safety and efficacy, health agencies have failed to take action.  For example, in April, following an RCT, the U.K. government authorized budesonide, an inhaled steroid to treat COVID-19 patients.[14]  Unfortunately, more than five months later, your agencies have not recommended budesonide to treat COVID-19 patients in the U.S.[15]By de facto requiring potential COVID-19 treatments go through RCTs or else be subject to your campaign of misdirection, you have dramatically tipped the scales in favor of expensive new drugs.  Manufacturers of generic drugs do not have the profit margins to afford expensive RCTs.  In the case of COVID-19, this strong bias against generic drugs has prevented early treatments from being widely adopted and has cost an untold number of lives.It is beyond puzzling that the federal government continues to ignore foundational medical principles like early treatment or natural immunity, that federal agencies lack basic data regarding vaccine immunity and durability, and that agencies will highlight the relatively few adverse events for one treatment—ivermectin—but largely ignore hundreds of thousands of adverse events and over 15,000 deaths reported on VAERS for COVID-19 vaccines.[16]  As the number of breakthrough COVID-19 cases increase in the U.S. it is urgent that Americans have access to early treatment options.Rather than seriously consider evidence showing the potential of early treatments including ivermectin, your agencies prefer to mischaracterize, conflate and misconstrue anything that goes against the mainstream narrative and the financial interests of the pharmaceutical industry.  The American people deserve transparency from federal agencies and the most up-to-date information regarding COVID-19 to inform their health decisions.  To better understand your agency’s positions regarding early treatments for COVID-19, we respectfully request the following information:Please provide this material as soon as possible but no later than 5:00 p.m. on October 19, 2021.  Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.          Sincerely,/s/ ### "

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Roger Marshall (R-Kansas), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) today introduced a bill to bring parity to gun owners using public lands. The Recreational Lands Defense Act would restore Second Amendment rights of individuals recreating on lands managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Under current law, an individual may carry a firearm on lands managed by the U.S. Department of Interior and U.S. Department of Agriculture, including National Parks and National Forests, as long as it is consistent with state law.  The Recreational Lands Defense Act would treat Army Corps land in the same manner, allowing parity on nearly 12 million acres of Army Corps recreation lands.  It would not change current legal prohibition of guns in federal facilities.Upon introduction, Sen. Cruz said:“I am proud to join Sen. Crapo on this bill to restrict federal overreach and restore Second Amendment rights for law-abiding gun owners on land controlled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This bill protects the right to bear arms on this public, federally owned land as long as it is consistent with state law – a right that should never have been removed from Texans and Americans in the first place.”Sen. Crapo said:“The inability to carry firearms on Corps land is inconsistent with regulations governing public, federally-owned lands, and a violation of the intent of the Second Amendment. Americans to carry firearms on land managed by the Corps will allow law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and provide needed consistency across federal lands to reduce the complexity of tracking where one federal agency’s land management ends and another’s begins.”Sen. Risch said:“The federal prohibition preventing individuals from exercising their Second Amendment rights on U.S. Army Corps land is inconsistent and unconstitutional. Arbitrary regulations based on often unmarked jurisdictional boundaries do nothing but punish law-abiding citizens.  This bill will restore the right to bear arms for sportsmen and women recreating on some 12 million acres of federal lands.”Sen. Scott said:“I’m a strong supporter of the Second Amendment and take seriously government’s role in protecting Americans’ constitutional right to keep and bear arms. This bill makes a commonsense fix to current law to allow Americans to exercise their constitutional rights on federally-managed Army Corps land.” Sen. Tillis said:“We must recognize that the right to bear arms should include Army Corps of Engineers lands. The law currently states that law-abiding gun owners may carry in National Parks and National Forests, but does not extend these same protections to lands owned by the Army Corps.  I am proud to work with my colleagues to correct this problem and ensure that the Second Amendment is protected on public lands.”Sen. Braun said:“It is long overdue that we remove the unnecessary federal restriction on state law and align federal policy to allow Americans to express their Second Amendment rights on Corps land. The Recreational Lands Self Defense Act will do just that by aligning firearm policy on Corps land with the Department of the Interior precedent.”Sen. Marshal said:“Almost 50 years ago, Americans’ Constitutional right to bear arms on land under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was stripped by the federal government. This legislation restores our Second Amendment rights on public lands overseen by the Army Corps, leaving the American people’s ability to carry a firearm for self-defense or recreational purposes to the discretion of state and local governments – protecting law abiding gun owners from further federal overreach.”Sen. Barrasso said:“Every day, people across Wyoming responsibly use their Second Amendment rights to keep and bear arms. Our legislation will make sure people in Wyoming and other public land states can exercise these constitutionally protected rights on lands managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.” Sen. Lummis added:“For decades, Americans’ Second Amendment rights have been checked at the entrance to federal land under U.S. Army Corps of Engineers management. Nearly 50 percent of Wyoming is federal land, and restoring this constitutional right is long overdue. I’m proud to work with Senators Mike Crapo, John Barrasso, and other colleagues to end this ridiculous infringement of Americans’ liberties.” ###"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) this week sent a bipartisan letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken drawing attention to the Ortega regime's harassment and jailing of over 150 opposition leaders, including Presidential candidates, and its ongoing authoritarian crackdown in advance of the country's November 2021 presidential election. The senators call for increased efforts to secure the immediate release of political prisoners targeted by Ortega, urging the Biden administration to expand its use of sanctions authorities granted under the NICA Act and the RENACER Act to designate Ortega as well as his regime's top military brass.In the letter, the senators wrote: ""In addition to arbitrary and unjust detentions, the Ortega regime is prohibiting the country's leading opposition parties from participating in the November elections. It has also dissolved the legal registration of dozens of civil society groups in Nicaragua, and banned respected international organizations from operating in the country. Ortega's National Assembly has legalized arbitrary detention, enacted abusive legislation that restricts freedom of expression and the work of independent human rights organizations, continued its attacks on press freedom, and is ratifying a new agreement with Russia to censor the internet. Taken together, these actions amount to an expansive authoritarian assault on Nicaragua's institutions and civil society."" The senators pressed the Biden administration to condemn the upcoming November election as illegitimate, consider suspending Nicaragua from the Organization of American States (OAS), and called for a review of Nicaragua's participation in the Dominican Republic-Central America (CAFTA-DR) free trade agreement. The letter also called for greater, sustained global attention to the situation in Nicaragua, including at the United Nations and the OAS.Read the full text of their letter here. Dear Mr. Secretary, We are writing to urge you to increase pressure on Nicaragua's Ortega regime and prevent the further erosion of democratic norms and the rule of law in Nicaragua. The international community must take urgent actions to stem one of the most severe campaigns of repression in the Western Hemisphere since the military dictatorships of the 1980s. In the months ahead, democratic actors in Nicaragua will require robust support from the United States and international partners as they seek a peaceful return to democracy. Since late May, the regime has jailed five opposition candidates for the November 2021 general elections: Arturo Cruz, Félix Maradiaga, Juan Sebastián Chamorro, Medardo Mairena, and Miguel Mora. Two more contenders, Cristiana Chamorro and Noel Vidaurre, are under house arrest. Many of them are subject to politically motivated prosecutions. In total, the regime is holding at least 150 political prisoners, denying them due process and regular access to legal counsel and their families. On July 27, the regime incarcerated Nicaragua's 77-year-old former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Francisco Aguirre-Sacasa, under bogus charges of treason and without regard for his health. Aguirre-Sacasa and many others are being held at El Chipote detention center, a facility infamous for acts of torture and other ill-treatment, according to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.In addition to arbitrary and unjust detentions, the Ortega regime is prohibiting the country's leading opposition parties from participating in the November elections. It has also dissolved the legal registration of dozens of civil society groups in Nicaragua, and banned respected international organizations from operating in the country. Ortega's National Assembly has legalized arbitrary detention, enacted abusive legislation that restricts freedom of expression and the work of independent human rights organizations, continued its attacks on press freedom, and is ratifying a new agreement with Russia to censor the internet. Taken together, these actions amount to an expansive authoritarian assault on Nicaragua's institutions and civil society.We commend the steps you have taken to respond to Nicaragua's slide into authoritarianism, including suspending the visas of 150 individuals associated with the regime. We also applaud the European Union's recent move to freeze the assets and suspend the visas of Rosario Murillo and seven other regime officials on August 2. However, more must be done. Most urgently, we must use diplomatic channels to press for the immediate release of all political prisoners. Until they are released, the Biden administration and our international partners, must press the regime to allow political prisoners access to legal representation and humanitarian visits.  The Administration has powerful tools at its disposal, including the 2018 Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act (NICA) Act, and the measures defined under the Reinforcing Nicaragua's Adherence to Conditions for Electoral Reform Act (RENACER) Act, which passed the Senate on August 6. Full implementation of the NICA Act will send the Ortega regime a clear message: continued repression is unacceptable. As you evaluate options, we encourage you to expand sanctions to President Daniel Ortega and the ranks of the Nicaraguan military and its investment fund, the Instituto de Previsión Social Militar (IPSM). We also urge you to coordinate with Treasury Department to fully enforce the NICA Act's provisions on investment conditionality by providing guidance to the U.S. Executive Directors at international financial institutions to oppose extensions of loans or assistance that could benefit regime officials, rather than providing the people of Nicaragua the aid they desperately need. It is imperative that U.S. Executive Directors coordinate their approach towards Nicaragua with other major donor countries.  The Ortega regime thrives on the lack of effective multilateral coordination. We ask that you encourage sustained international scrutiny and condemnation by UN Secretary General António Guterres and relevant UN bodies. Unless the opposition presidential candidates are released from detention, their parties are re-registered, and they are together allowed to nominate an opposition presidential candidate to run in the November elections, the United States should rally its partners at the Organization of American States (OAS) to support a resolution condemning the vote as illegitimate and consider invoking Article 21 of the Inter-American Democratic Charter to suspend Nicaragua from the OAS.Taken together, these steps may push Ortega to permit an opening for democratic change. However, if Ortega refuses to uphold the rule of law and respect human rights, we believe that a review of Nicaragua's membership in the Dominican Republic-Central America (CAFTA-DR) free trade agreement is needed, as called for under the Senate-approved RENACER Act. Please count on our full support in your efforts to help Nicaraguans to restore their democracy.   Sincerely, /s/###  "

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today participated in a committee markup on President Biden's nominee to be U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts, Rachael Rollins. Sen. Cruz pointed to her policy while serving as District Attorney for Suffolk County, where she declined to prosecute certain dangerous crimes and pushed for ‘reallocating' police funding. He then urged his Democrat colleagues to consider the safety and security of their constituents and vote against this radical nominee. Read excerpts of his remarks in committee below.WATCH: Sen. Cruz Calls Out Democrat Colleagues for Supporting Biden Nominee Who Refused to Prosecute Crime""The debate over abolishing the police is sadly and astonishingly to me a real debate in today's Democratic Party, because there are multiple elected Democrats who vocally embrace abolishing the police. It's not just at the local level. It's not just the mayor of New York City. It's not just the mayor of Minneapolis. It's not just the mayor of Portland that advocated abolishing the police. Sadly, it is now senior officials at the U.S. Department of Justice. The number two official at the Department of Justice and the head of the Civil Rights Division at Department of Justice. Both are among the leading advocates in the country for abolishing the police, both in writing repeatedly and emphatically advocated for abolishing the police last year. One year ago in writing they advocated abolishing the police. ""Now, every Democratic member of this committee maintains, ‘Oh, no, no, no, no, I don't support abolishing the police.' At the same time, every single Democrat in the United States Senate voted to confirm not one but two senior officials at the U.S. Department of Justice who are among the leading advocates of abolishing the police. And now we get a third time, where - listen, our votes have consequences. By the way, I voted hell no on both of them, because I think abolishing the police is insanity. And I'm emphatically against it. That's an easy vote. And I'm very comfortable telling the people of Texas why I cast that vote. Now we have the nomination of Ms. Rollins. I'll confess, a week ago I had no idea who Rachel Rollins was. I'd never heard of her, never encountered her. Then I looked at her record and it takes your breath away. We're dealing with an individual nominated to be a U.S. Attorney in Massachusetts, who has been vocal and aggressive against prosecuting crime. Look, part of abolishing police is getting rid of the men and women in blue that keep us safe. Another part of abolishing police is telling prosecutors, ‘You no longer prosecute crimes. We're not in the crime business anymore.'""[...]""Well, let's look at her record. First of all, Ms. Rollins in February, she was very candid that she came into the job of DA as a crusader. Here's what she said: ‘If you want to change the criminal legal system, become a prosecutor.' Why? She explains why. Because you have, ‘the power to determine charges and what crimes to decline to prosecute.' So that's what Ms. Rollins tells you matters about a prosecutor, the power to say, ‘I won't prosecute these crimes.' Well, surely she exercised it with reason and restraint. That's what our Democratic colleagues on this committee are suggesting. Well, let's look in writing, and I will say this document, it is entitled Appendix C. SCDAO declination and diversion policy. Boy, what an incredibly boring title designed to mask a horrific policy.""[...]""Let me suggest something to you: go read this document, I'll tweet out this document, just read it, read it yourself and then ask who's telling the truth. Because for all the Democrats saying, ‘No, no, no, no. What do you mean she won't prosecute crimes?' Let me read from the document she prepared: ‘Charges on the list of 15 should be declined or dismissed pre arraignment.' So even before the proceedings start, ‘without conditions.' So we're not going to put any conditions on that, no matter what, just get it and throw it out. We don't even want to see these cases, and in fact, the next sentence says, ‘The presumption is the charges that fall in this category should always be denied.' Always. So no wiggle room of, ‘oh just in some cases.' ‘Always is what she wrote.' Even when attached to another charge. So if you have a multiple criminal, we just throw out these crimes. Basically, this is the prosecutor saying, ‘I'm the legislature. Those pesky elected legislators that actually voted on the Criminal Code. I don't care what they say, I am erasing these crimes from the Criminal Code.'""[...]""What's the first one on the list? Trespass. Okay, I want everyone to think about this. And by the way, what's interesting is this is not just in red states. I want the people at Delaware to think about this. The people of Connecticut, the people of Hawaii, the people California, Georgia. Do you want laws against trespass enforced in your community? Well, according to this individual that the Democrats want to make the top federal prosecutor in the state of Massachusetts - trespass is no longer against the law. Someone comes into your house, onto your property, ‘No, biggie, it ain't a crime anymore.'""Alright, what else isn't a crime? Shoplifting. You know, all of us have seen the videos, I think exclusively in Democratic cities, of shoplifters brazenly breaking into stores and stealing and running out. And why do they do it? They do it, for example, in San Francisco, because you have a prosecutor that won't prosecute him. So you know what, ‘Hey, I like stores where the price of everything is zero, that'd be a pretty amazing thing.' Not very good for the stores, not very good for the community. But this prosecutor says there is no shoplifting. Now, if you want to steal a bunch of stuff, this is your person. If you're actually a small business owner, if you'd like to not have it, [it's] open season on people breaking into your store and stealing everything in it - that might concern you. ""What else? Larceny. Larceny is not a crime. Remember, she said they should always be declined to be prosecuted. Larceny is on the list. What else is on the list? Disorderly conduct disturbing the police. So let me ask you, the amazing thing is even in blue states, in Minnesota, I promise you there are a lot of moms that are not eager to discover that if someone is drunk and screaming and trespassing on their front lawn, and urinating and defecating on their front lawn in front of their children and cursing at their kids, that, hey, according to the Democrats - not a crime, [they] won't be prosecuted. And by the way, when that person comes back to your front lawn tomorrow, and does it again, it's not a crime tomorrow either. Remember, always declined to prosecute. So disorderly conduct is apparently not a crime.""[...]""What else is not a crime? According to this radical, B&E, which all of us who watch Law and Order knows that stands for breaking and entering, into a vacant property to sleep or escape the cold. Okay, that sounds kind of reasonable. Alright, a vacant lot, it's cold, you're going there. Alright, that actually is on the list, you can understand the reasoning. If it's cold, you're breaking into a vacant lot. I get it, I mean, it's vacant, there's not anyone there to be hurt. You understand that one, and at least she has the good sense to say it's got to be vacant, because that way no people, no innocent people will be hurt, right? What's the next one on the list? B&E into a non-vacant property to sleep or escape the cold. Well, what's a non-vacant property? Like, I don't know, your home. So apparently, what she's saying is, if it's cold outside, it is no longer a crime for somebody to break into your home so they can trespass on your property. They can break into your home, they can commit larceny, and apparently sleep in your living room. ""I want each of you to imagine, look, there's an element of, how would you answer one of your constituents if someone is doing this, and the answer from the prosecutor is we will always dismiss the case? What else won't she prosecute? Wanton or malicious destruction of property. I don't know about you but wanton and malicious are typically pretty bad. Isn't a crime under her. What else? You could say well, at least none of these are violent, right? Well, breaking into a non-vacant property, that has the potential for violence. You know what else is not a crime? Threats. You can make a direct threat, you can threaten innocent people, you can threaten children, you can commit a threat. Not a crime.""[...]""By the way, on the question of do you support cops or not, the last one on this list is really incredibly revealing. Resisting arrest. A police officer goes to confront someone who's violent, they're violent, they engage with them, they resist arrest. What's the prosecutor say? ‘Man, it really stinks to be you. I'm sorry you chose to be a cop.' But it's open season. Apparently resisting arrest is now the standard way of interacting with the police in Massachusetts. This is lunacy, and by the way, to make clear that her policy of not prosecuting anything is consistent with her advocacy of abolishing the police, here's what she said at an earlier public gathering. ‘Rollins also spoke about the much discussed concept of defunding the police.' Okay, let's find out - where is she on defunding the police? ‘She said that defunding is not the verb she would use.' Okay, that's good. I'm sure every Democratic talking point is going to take that portion of the statement. ‘She wouldn't use the verb ‘defund,' but rather ‘reimagine.'' Okay, ‘reimagine' may be good, may be bad, hard to tell, ‘or ‘reallocate.'' Now, anyone who knows anything about defund, [it] means [to] take the money out, get away their funding. Reallocate means take the money away, get away their funding. And she explains, she elaborates on this. ‘I think we're asking the police to do far too much. I think we can reimagine and reallocate some funding.' Take money away from the cops. Those are her views. ""I'll give you to have a sense of just how extreme this nominee is. I want to point to Art Acevedo. Senator Cornyn knows Art Acevedo. He used to be the chief of police in Austin. He used to be the chief of police in Houston. He's now in Miami. Art is a Democrat. He is a partisan Democrat. Art is an ambitious, partisan Democrat. He has his eyes on higher office. No one has ever missed that about Art. Art is now the president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association. I've had a lot of disagreements with Art Acevedo. Here's what liberal Democrat Art Acevedo says about Rachel Rollins: ‘People like Ms. Rollins are going so far that they're putting the criminal and their interests in front of the victim's interest.'""So I started these remarks by saying transparency matters. I assume moments from now we're going to vote and we're going to have a party line vote, and every Democrat is just going to go ahead and vote for this candidate. You're not going to listen to anything the Republicans have said. And then you're going to go tell your constituents, ‘What do you mean? I don't support abolishing the police.' Well, transparency matters. You now know her record. If you believe that we should actually prosecute crimes, if you believe that people shouldn't trespass on your property at home, shouldn't be able to break into your home, shouldn't be able to shoplift, shouldn't be able to resist arrest, shouldn't be able to commit threats. And have someone who is ostensibly the prosecutor immunize them and allow that conduct, there's only one thing to do, which is vote. And let me say I find it amusing. We're having an argument about whether this is a roll call vote or not. I agree, it should be a voice vote, and we should unanimously reject this nominee. That would be if we were in the land of reason. That's what we would do. But we're instead in partisan polarization, and so every Democrat will happily like Pravda vote aye and then pretend you didn't. But facts are stubborn things. And anyone who reads this document knows exactly what kind of radical this prosecutor is.""###"
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-issues-statement-on-continuing-resolution,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) today issued the following statement on the Continuing Resolution to fund the government through December 3:""Despite controlling the Senate, the House, and the White House, Democrats in Washington, D.C. have refused to govern responsibly and instead focused on radically transforming our country and destroying our economy with crushing tax hikes and spending sprees.""Unfortunately, when they finally got around to funding the government, they cynically tied critical disaster relief to a dangerous ploy to bring in unvetted Afghan evacuees who could pose a security threat to the United States. ""The Democrats also shamefully took out a provision to replenish funding for Israel's Iron Dome defense system. Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer were apparently too afraid of the leftwing radicals and socialists who control the Democrat Party to stand by our close ally Israel.""Make no mistake: I would have gladly supported standalone disaster relief funding for Texas, which would provide critical assistance in our recovery efforts from Hurricane Laura and Winter Storm Uri. We also should have stood by our allies and provided needed funding for Iron Dome in this package.""The legislation I voted against today will make America less safe. It gives President Biden a blank check to continue pursuing reckless policies that deepen the crisis caused by his botched withdrawal from Afghanistan. As we know, President Biden and his administration failed to vet tens of thousands of evacuees that it brought into the United States and explicitly confirmed they facilitated the trafficking of child brides and the travel of evacuees they later linked to security threats. This bill ignores those acute human rights and national security concerns and instead relies on an inadequate vetting procedure. It then provides evacuees with indefinite federal welfare benefits and enhanced IDs that facilitate access even to flights and federal buildings. I could not support a bill that will deepen this humanitarian catastrophe and prevent us from beginning to undo the damage President Biden has done."" ### "
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sens-cruz-menendez-colleagues-introduce-resolution-on-illicit-gold-mining-in-latin-america,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), and Ben Cardin (D-Md.) today introduced a resolution calling attention to the rise in illicit mining and trafficking of gold in Latin America.As the profits derived from illicit gold mining and trafficking surpass those generated by coca and cocaine production, the bipartisan Resolution outlines the pervasive challenges such practices pose for security, stability, and the environment in the Western Hemisphere. The Resolution also expresses the Senate's staunch support for the rights of rural and indigenous populations adversely affected by the surge in illicit mining practices, urging better coordination with governments and industry actors to mitigate the risks posed by illicit gold flows out of hotspots like Venezuela, where approximately 90 percent of gold extracted is mined illegally. Upon introduction, Sen. Cruz said:""I've long worried about the use of gold as a monetary instrument of illicit finance. The Maduro regime traffics gold and precious metals to fuel its malign activities, including by exporting it abroad. In 2018 alone, Turkey purchased nearly a billion dollars of Venezuelan gold-more than the total trade between the two countries in the previous five years combined. We must make a concerted effort to disrupt such flow of illicit precious metals.""Sen. Menendez said:""The astounding proliferation of illicit mining and trafficking over the last decade has degraded the environment and undermined legal trade. It has also led to heinous human rights abuses, largely against rural and indigenous communities, and incited a malaria epidemic that has reached levels not seen in the past 75 years. In Venezuela, Maduro has cast off the fetters of basic morality to continue lining the pockets of his regime from the illegal gold trade. I am proud to introduce this critical Resolution to combat illicit gold mining, making clear the United States Congress will not ignore the imperilment of the health, security, or safety of populations throughout the Western Hemisphere.""Sen. Rubio said:""As illegal mining and gold trafficking continues to wreak havoc on communities across Latin America, it is important the U.S. Senate calls for better coordination to counter this illicit activity. Back in 2018, during the Eighth Summit of the Americas, I was briefed by members of our diplomatic corps in Lima about the significant regional threat illegal gold mining poses for our national security interests. Since then, I have remained committed to tackling this grave issue - which enriches malign actors in our hemisphere.""Sen. Kaine said:""Illicit gold mining and trafficking in Latin America threatens U.S. national security and jeopardizes the safety, stability, and environment of the region and its people.  I'm proud to join my colleagues in calling attention to this critical issue. We must work with our partners in the region to counter illicit mining and hold accountable those who condone and promote it, including the Maduro regime in Venezuela.""Sen. Cardin added:""The rise in illicit mining and trafficking of gold in Latin America poses a serious threat to the security, stability, and environment of the region. I have long been a champion of anti-corruption efforts, particularly transparency and regulation in global mining industries, and am proud to support this resolution - which also contributes to the human rights of the rural and indigenous populations that have been deeply affected by illicit gold mining practices.""###  "

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, today delivered opening remarks in a bipartisan hearing entitled ""Toxic Conservatorships: The Need for Reform."" Sen. Cruz discussed how Britney Spears' ongoing conservatorship highlights the need for states to ensure their conservatorship process protects the fundamental rights of their citizens. Read his opening remarks below.""Let me start by thanking you for holding this hearing. I think this is an important topic, and I welcome each of the witnesses for attending and testifying. Every so often, an individual case of injustice captures the nation's attention, and it opens our eyes to issues that are by no means unique to that individual, but that previously had remained hidden from the public. That's what has happened with Britney Spears, one of the most iconic American pop stars of all time, who has been under a California conservatorship since 2008. The case has captured the attention of the world. I count myself emphatically in the free Britney camp, and have been so vocally for some time.""For more than a decade, someone else, Britney Spears' court-appointed conservator has made all of the critical decisions in her life. Even though she's a grown woman who has grown to incredible heights in her career, even though she's a mother, to this day, she can't make basic decisions about her own life, her own career, her own health, her own finances. Ms. Spears has fought this conservatorship, but it seems that at each critical juncture, the legal system has been designed not for her benefit, but to trample on her rights. ""When the conservatorship was first put into place, for example, Ms. Spears tried to hire a lawyer to fight the conservatorship, but the California court threw out her lawyer saying effectively, ‘No, she's not capable of hiring a lawyer.' The court based its reasoning on a purported medical report, but because she didn't have a lawyer or a copy of the medical report, she didn't have someone on her side to challenge that determination. As a result, she was placed in a conservatorship, even though from outside appearances, there was nothing to indicate the lack of competence that should have been required to justify her conservatorship for one week, much less for 13 years.""Ms. Spears has made stunning allegations that because she is subject to the whims of the conservatorship, doctors forced her to have an IUD, a birth control device, against her wishes because their conservator didn't want her to have children. That is not somebody else's choice to make. That is grotesque. This type of forced prevention of childbearing and forced sterilization, sadly, it goes on all the time in oppressive nations like China. And sadly, it has an ugly, ugly history here in the United States. But few of us would have believed it was happening in America today. ""Given recent changes, including Ms. Spears' first ever public testimony in her conservatorship case, Britney may be able to get out of the conservatorship as early as tomorrow, and if so, that will be a great victory for justice. But for so many people across the country, their conservatorships are likely to continue under the same system or a similar system as the one that has trampled on Ms. Spears' writes for over a decade.""There are approximately 1.3 million adult conservatorship cases in the United States, with an estimated $50 billion in assets controlled by those conservatorships. Sadly, in at least some of the instances, it's all about the money and control of the assets in that conservatorship. Conservatorships can have their place; they can be necessary, they can be appropriate. They can help protect individuals who cannot care for themselves, whether because they suffer from a severe developmental or intellectual disability, or an injury or an illness such as dementia. We rarely hear about conservatorships where honest and conscientious courts and conservators act in the best interest of the individual and are responsible and responsive to changing circumstances. Those cases don't make the news.""Unfortunately, conservatorships can also be abused. They can deprive individuals of rights, of liberties, of opportunities to make decisions that most of us take for granted. We must be vigilant when individuals suffer from diminished capacity. We protect and we respect their personal liberty and their fundamental rights, including the right to make decisions that many of us disagree with or find irresponsible, and that's important here. The question is not whether you agree with every decision the individual might make. The question is whether they have such diminished capacity that the law has to step in and protect them. And that means ensuring that the conservatorship process affords full due process protections, from basic steps like providing adequate notice of proceedings to ensuring that individuals have the right to counsel and that the burden of proof rests on the state.""I talked a minute ago about the beginning of Britney Spears' case. For the court to throw out her lawyer based on a secret medical report that she couldn't access, the lawyer couldn't access, and couldn't be charged is something straight out of Kafka. It's not right. It's not how our legal system is meant to operate. Instead, we need to ensure that there is ample opportunity for people to contest conservatorships.""We're fortunate today that one of our witnesses will be able to speak firsthand about how difficult it can be to terminate a conservatorship and to have his rights returned to him. It also means seriously considering alternatives to conservatorships and whether individuals have reasonable access to those alternatives that could include supportive decision making, which allows an impacted individual to form a support network of people they know and trust, and consult this group in the course of making their decisions. It could also include the use of representative payees, special needs trusts, joint bank accounts, Power of Attorney agreements, and advanced healthcare directives.""As a general matter, state law, and state courts create and manage conservatorships. That means that most meaningful reform should be driven primarily by the states, not the federal government. And the states are equipped to drive reform in this area. My home state of Texas, for example, has been at the forefront of reforming conservatorships to protect individual rights. In 2015, Texas was the first state to codify supported decision making as an alternative to legal guardianship. Texas also implemented several other fundamental reforms, including a bill of rights for awards, and increased court oversight of existing conservatorships. Other states, thankfully, have followed Texas' lead and have instituted similar reforms.""The Britney Spears conservatorship has brought to light real issues with conservatorship law that should shock every American. If the conservatorship process can deprive someone like Ms. Spears, someone with immense celebrity, immense wealth, immense material success, of her fundamental liberties, then what chance does the average American have? Because of what has happened to Ms. Spears under California laws, in California courts, states all across the country should be asking themselves what they can do in this area to make sure that they aren't falling into the same traps, and that they are instead protecting the interests and the rights of every one of their citizens. I look forward to the discussion today. In today's polarized environment, there are many issues on which the two parties disagree. There are many issues on which Chairman Blumenthal and I disagree, and I'm sure we will again in the future, but I'm glad we found a topic on which there is very significant common ground. I know both of us look forward to learning more from our witnesses today."" ###"
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/sens-cruz-cornyn-urge-president-biden-to-grant-gov-abbotts-federal-emergency-declaration-for-border-communities-as-crisis-worsens,"‘We strongly support the Governor’s request and urge you to provide any and all emergency measures afforded by the approval of an emergency declaration’U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and John Cornyn (R-Texas), members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today sent a letter to President Biden supporting Governor Abbott’s request for a federal emergency declaration as a result of the crisis on the southern border. Last week, Governor Abbott requested federal assistance to help state authorities deal with the influx of illegal immigrants at the Del Rio International Bridge.On September 15, a surge of migrants illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border and began to camp at the International Bridge in Del Rio, Texas. Sen. Cruz traveled to Del Rio the next day and heard firsthand how the influx of migrants far exceeds local capabilities and strains community resources. Just two days later, this number reached approximately 16,000 illegal immigrants.In the letter, the senators wrote:“It is our understanding that the State of Texas, through the Office of the Governor, has formally requested an emergency declaration as a result of the ongoing crisis at the border, consistent with Title V of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Act. Governor Abbott previously issued a state disaster declaration for a number of Texas counties along the state’s southern border due to the increase in illegal border crossings and the ongoing humanitarian crisis for most of 2021.”[…]“We strongly support the Governor’s request and urge you to provide any and all emergency measures afforded by the approval of an emergency declaration. We stand ready and willing to assist in any way possible to ensure prompt evaluation of this request.”Read the full text of their letter here and below.September 27, 2021The Honorable Joseph R. Biden, Jr.President of the United StatesThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, D.C. 20500Mr. President:It is our understanding that the State of Texas, through the Office of the Governor, has formally requested an emergency declaration as a result of the ongoing crisis at the border, consistent with Title V of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Act. Governor Abbott previously issued a state disaster declaration for a number of Texas counties along the state’s southern border due to the increase in illegal border crossings and the ongoing humanitarian crisis for most of 2021.Most recently, the situation at the southern border has deteriorated even further with the surge of aliens attempting to enter the United States illegally by crossing the Texas-Mexico border in Val Verde County. The number of aliens at the Del Rio International Bridge increased from approximately 4,000 individuals on Wednesday, September 15, 2021, to over 16,000 aliens on Saturday, September 18, 2021. Overall, CBP officials reported 208,887 encounters with illegal aliens in August, including 103,129 single adults, 18,847 unaccompanied children, and 86,487 individuals in a family unit. All of these numbers have increased over 100 percent since the previous year.We strongly support the Governor’s request and urge you to provide any and all emergency measures afforded by the approval of an emergency declaration.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Chairman of the committee, will hold a hearing on Tuesday, September 28, 2021 at 2:30 PM titled ""Toxic Conservatorships: The Need for Reform.""Upon announcing this hearing, Sen. Cruz said:""Conservatorship abuse has come to the forefront of a political, pop culture, and civil rights conversation like never before in America. Britney Spears' conservatorship has shown fundamental liberties can be taken away with little opportunity for legal recourse. The threshold for a conservatorship should be incredibly high to protect the civil liberties of Americans while still ensuring the safety and security of individuals who cannot care for themselves. I look forward to shining a light on this issue tomorrow with a bipartisan conversation in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing along with my colleague Sen. Blumenthal.""Sen. Blumenthal added:""This hearing will examine harmful, restrictive conservatorships that far too often deny people due process and strip them of their rights to make legal, financial, and even personal decisions. The brave decision by Britney Spears to speak out and fight back has shown the world how harmful these legal arrangements can be. Sadly, her case is far from an isolated incident. I look forward to hearing from experts and a former subject of a conservatorship to explore how we can bring transparency, accountability, and overall reform to a system that is rife with abuse."" BACKGROUND  Conservatorships, also referred to as guardianships in many states, are legal arrangements that occur when a person is determined to have a diminished capacity to make decisions about personal affairs or property management. The arrangements allow a court to transfer the individual's right to make decisions to a conservator or guardian, with some of the most commonly affected groups including the elder, disability, and youth communities. Under the current conservatorship system, these legal arrangements often leave individuals deprived of some or all of their legal rights and can lead to social issues such as helplessness and stigmatization. The broad agreements also bring up troubling due process concerns, as ending or amending conservatorship arrangements remain very rare.     Recently, conservatorship concerns have been brought to the forefront with documentaries and reporting focusing on Britney Spears, who was forced into a conservatorship in 2008. Under her conservatorship, there have been reports Spears has been isolated from her family and friends, financially exploited, spied upon, medicated against her will, and even denied access to her own children.   Spears was originally forced into the conservatorship while still in the hospital after being involuntarily hospitalized the day before. Since 2008, there have not been consistent check-ins to reevaluate the conservatorship, the psychiatrist who originally provided the declaration for her lack of mental fitness has said he, ""did not know why she still has a conservatorship,"" and it is clear her father Jamie and other members of her team have a financial incentive to keep Spears in the arrangement.    The hearing will include testimony from:###"
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sens-cruz-menendez-rubio-colleagues-applaud-final-passage-of-renacer-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, along with Reps. Albio Sires (D-N.J.) and Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.), today applauded the House of Representatives’ final passage of the Reinforcing Nicaragua’s Adherence to Conditions for Electoral Reform (RENACER) Act. This legislation would dramatically increase the United States’ response to the continued use of repressive tactics by Daniel Ortega and his government to intimidate, inhibit, or arrest every aspiring opposition candidate ahead of Nicaragua’s scheduled elections on November 7. This bipartisan legislation now goes to President Biden for his signature and enactment.Upon final passage, Sen. Cruz said:“Today, Congress sends a unified message to the Nicaraguan regime. Daniel Ortega and his Marxist strongmen have hijacked democratic institutions and criminalized the opposition, resulting in a fundamentally unfree society with a deteriorating economy, governed by fear and repression. The bipartisan, bicameral support of the RENACER Act shows the United States stands unequivocally with the brave Nicaraguans calling for their freedom.”Sen. Menendez said:“Today, as the RENACER Act heads to President Biden’s desk for his signature, I am proud to see Congress come together – in a bicameral, common-sense way – to let the people of Nicaragua know we are not turning a blind eye to their cries of desperation. It’s not very often that Republicans and Democrats are able to come together these days to find common ground and address a serious challenge – this bill is a rare exception. We are witnessing the worst authoritarian assault on democracy in Latin America in decades, and I am proud to lead this effort for Congress to act decisively so the Ortega-Murillo regime knows there will be major consequences for the pseudo coronation of their dynastic dictatorship. I look forward to working with President Biden to ensure the swift implementation of the RENACER Act.""Sen. Rubio said:“Ahead of Sunday’s sham presidential election in Nicaragua, the Congress of the United States is sending a strong message against the corrupt and authoritarian Ortega-Murillo regime and its attempt to subvert the will of the Nicaraguan people. The Biden Administration should swiftly sign this bill into law and work with international allies to coordinate sanctions against this regime.”  Rep. Sires said:“Having locked up every potential opponent, Nicaragua’s Daniel Ortega will soon hold a coronation ceremony in place of an election. I thank my colleagues in the House and Senate who worked hard to pass this bipartisan legislation, which will improve our sanctions coordination with allies, expand oversight of international financial institutions’ lending to Nicaragua, and hold Ortega accountable for his regime’s crimes against humanity. Today’s passage of the RENACER Act shows that the United States Congress will not stand by as Ortega consolidates a one-party dictatorship and it reflects our firm support for the democratic aspirations of the Nicaraguan people.”Rep. Salazar added:“For months, the Nicaraguan people have pleaded for us to help stop Daniel Ortega’s reign of terror. The passage of the RENACER Act will hit Ortega where it hurts just days before he solidifies his dictatorship through his sham presidential elections. It’s past time we review Ortega’s ability to profit from free trade with the United States. Thank you to my colleagues for taking bold action against this evil regime and for standing with the Nicaraguan people during their fight for democracy. The United States is making its message clear – access to American markets is a privilege, and we should not do business with dictators.”The legislation proposes new initiatives to monitor, report on, and address corruption by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega’s government and family, as well as human rights abuses perpetrated by Nicaraguan security forces. The RENACER Act also requires the United States government to increase sanctions on key actors in the Ortega regime that prevented democratic elections in Nicaragua, and expand sanctions coordination with Canada and the European Union. The bill also calls for the executive branch to open a formal review to determine whether Nicaragua should be allowed continued participation in the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). Additionally, the bill requires increased intelligence reporting on Russian activities in Nicaragua and a review of Russian arms sales to Nicaragua for potential sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). The RENACER Act includes the following elements:Read the full text of the bill here.###"
https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-rep-davidson-introduce-the-capital-gains-inflation-relief-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) today introduced the Capital Gains Inflation Relief Act, legislation to ensure an individual’s cost basis in a capital asset receives the same fair and equitable treatment as other areas of the tax code by indexing the basis for inflation. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, inflation has increased 5.4 percent from September 2020, which matches the highest rate since 2008.Cosponsors of the Capital Gains Inflation Relief Act include Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), and James Lankford (R-Okla.). Sen. Cruz previously introduced this legislation in 2018.Upon introduction, Sen. Cruz said:“The Biden administration’s inflation crisis is causing prices to skyrocket, destroying the purchasing power of Americans’ hard-earned dollars. By indexing the costs basis of capital assets to inflation, we are protecting hardworking Americans from being punished by the cruel tax of inflation created by this administration’s reckless spending. This bill would promote savings and investment, encouraging people to save for things like a child’s college education and for retirement, and would help job creators hire more people and raise wages when Americans need it most. I will continue to lead the fight in the Senate for a fairer, simpler tax code and for fiscal sanity as this administration threatens to destroy the wealth of Americans.”Rep. Davidson said:“As Biden’s economy continues to spiral, it’s critical that Congress make every effort to protect the value of Americans’ hard-earned dollars. Adjusting the tax code to account for rising prices by indexing the tax basis of capital gains for inflation is a simple first step to defend Americans from the invisible tax of inflation.”Grover Norquist, President of Americans for Tax Reform, added:“Senator Cruz should be commended for reintroducing the Capital Gains Inflation Relief Act. Not only does this bill end the unfair practice of taxing inflationary gains, but it will help grow the economy by encouraging saving, investment, and innovation.  It is always a good idea to index capital gains to inflation but because of Joe Biden’s inflation, it is more important than ever to do it now.”The Treasury Department currently determines capital gains taxes by the sticker price at the time of purchase without considering the inflation-adjusted cost of the asset in today’s dollars. As a result, an individual who sells a capital asset must pay tax on the gain even if the asset’s value only grew and kept pace with inflation.The Capital Gains Inflation Relief Act indexes certain assets to inflation for the purpose of determining a gain or loss which ensures the capital gains tax is treated equitably to other sections of the federal tax code, such as individual income tax brackets, the standard deduction, and income thresholds of certain tax credits. Sen. Cruz’s previously introduced legislation has been updated to include digital assets, such as cryptocurrency and NFT’s.Read the full text of the bill here.Read Sen.
