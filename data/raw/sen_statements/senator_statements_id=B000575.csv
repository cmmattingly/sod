https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-klobuchar-statements-on-rules-committee-passage-of-bipartisan-legislation-to-update-the-electoral-count-act,"September 27, 2022WASHINGTON –
Today, U.S. Senators Roy Blunt (Mo.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), the top
Republican and Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration
with oversight over federal elections, released the statements below after the
Rules Committee voted 14-1 to advance S. 4573, the Electoral Count Reform and
Presidential Transition Improvement Act, bipartisan legislation to reform the
Electoral Count Act. At the markup, the committee adopted Blunt and Klobuchar’s
bipartisan manager’s amendment
that makes key improvements to the bill. “I’m encouraged by the strong, bipartisan support the
Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act received in
the Rules Committee today,” said Blunt.
“This legislation was thoughtfully crafted with input from election experts,
legal scholars, and senators on both sides of the aisle. I am grateful to the
working group, led by Senators Collins and Manchin, for their dedicated efforts
over the past year. The bill addresses the major flaws of the Electoral Count
Act and merits the support of the full Senate.”“We must update the antiquated Electoral Count Act to ensure
that electoral votes for president accurately reflect the will of the people in
each state and to improve the process for counting electoral votes in Congress.
At today’s Committee markup, we implemented key bipartisan improvements that
will strengthen the Electoral Count Reform Act and help protect our
presidential elections,” said Klobuchar.
“Now that this bill has passed the Rules Committee with a strong bipartisan
vote, I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle
to ensure this critical legislation continues advancing through the Senate and
is signed into law this year.” 
Last month, Blunt and Klobuchar held a Rules Committee hearing
to examine the need to update the Electoral Count Act. At the hearing, the
committee heard testimony from U.S. Senators Susan Collins (Maine) and Joe
Manchin (W.Va.), the leaders of the bipartisan group that drafted the Electoral
Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act, as well as a
bipartisan panel of legal scholars."
https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/missouri-to-receive-348-million-in-grants-to-combat-opioids-funded-by-blunt-led-bill,"September 23, 2022WASHINGTON –  Today, U.S. Senator Roy Blunt
(Mo.), the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor,
Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (Labor/HHS),
announced that Missouri will receive $34.8 million in grant funding through the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to help communities
throughout Missouri combat the opioid epidemic.“More
than 1,500 Missourians lost their lives to an opioid-related overdose last
year,” said Blunt. “It is a public health crisis that is devastating families
and communities. These grants will help expand access to opioid prevention,
treatment, and recovery programs across the state – especially in areas that
need it the most. Our subcommittee has worked in a bipartisan way to support
life-saving programs to combat the opioid epidemic, and we need to continue
making it a priority as we move forward.”Blunt
secured a total of $4.28 billion, an increase of $299 million, for opioid
programs in the FY2022
Labor/HHS appropriations bill. Under Blunt’s leadership, funding for
health-related opioid programs has increased by $4 billion.Specifically, HHS announced that Missouri will receive:$25.3
Million in State Opioid Response Grants: Missouri will receive $25.3 million in state opioid response
grant funding. State opioid response grants provide flexible funding to states
to implement opioid use disorder interventions in the best way that fits their
needs.
$9.5
Million in Rural Communities Opioid Response Program Grants:
HHS will provide $9.5 million to nine Missouri health providers to expand
access to substance use disorder treatment and prevention services in rural
areas. Blunt started the program in the FY2018 Labor/HHS bill. Missouri grant

https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-capito-and-colleagues-introduce-comprehensive-regulatory-and-permitting-reform-legislation,"September 13, 2022WASHINGTON – Yesterday, U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.),
a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment,
and Related Agencies, U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), Ranking Member
of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, and 37 of their
Republican colleagues introduced the Simplify Timelines and Assure Regulatory
Transparency (START) Act, comprehensive federal regulatory permitting and
project review reform legislation.“Across
the country, permitting delays and bureaucratic red tape are seriously hurting
our ability to get important infrastructure projects off the ground,” said
Blunt. “Supply chain disruptions, along with higher energy and material
costs, are adding to those challenges. The START Act is an important step
Congress can take right now to help move these projects forward, which in turn
will support good-paying jobs and strengthen our economy. ”“Since
our calls for action and offers to see legislative text from the permitting
‘deal’ remain unheeded, Republicans are introducing this legislation today to
deliver solutions to the roadblocks, delays, and postponements of key
infrastructure projects across the country,” said EPW Ranking Member Capito.
“The START Act would provide regulatory certainty to states, expedite
permitting and review processes, codify substantive environmental regulatory
reforms, and expedite permitting of the critically important Mountain Valley
Pipeline. Republicans are unified in working to deliver needed permitting
reform, and this legislation is a blueprint for how we can help communities
benefit from being able to finally get critical projects across the finish
line.”In
additional to Blunt and Capito, the legislation is cosponsored by U.S. Senators
Mitch McConnell (Ky.), John Thune (S.D.), John Barrasso (Wyo.), Joni Ernst
(Iowa), Rick Scott (Fla.), Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Kevin Cramer (N.D.), Jim

U.S. Representative Emanuel Cleaver, II (Mo.), along with the Missouri
congressional delegation, including U.S. Senator Josh Hawley and U.S.
Representatives Billy Long, Blaine Luetkemeyer, Ann Wagner, Vicky Hartzler, Sam
Graves, Jason Smith, and Cori Bush, joined the Truman Library Institute in
announcing that the congressional dedication ceremony for the Harry S. Truman
statue is scheduled for 3 p.m. ET / 2 p.m. CT on Thursday, September 29, in the
U.S. Capitol Rotunda.“President
Truman’s tenacity, character, and courage to confront difficult problems are
values admired by his fellow Missourians and people who study our history,” said
Senator Blunt, who played a crucial role in steering the Truman Statue Project.
“No president faced more crucial decisions than those President Truman
confronted in the first nine months of his presidency. It’s been an honor to
work in the same Russell Senate offices he used for the last 12 years.”“The
world needs to know about this man from Missouri who did so much for this
country and whose name must be placed among those who've done the most for
racial equality in America,” said Congressman Cleaver, who proudly
represents Missouri’s 5th congressional district—the district of Harry Truman’s
hometown of Independence, Mo. “President Truman’s decision to eliminate
racial discrimination within America’s armed forces and federal workforce was a
true display of moral leadership—and a monumental contribution to the American
Civil Rights movement. He stepped forward and placed himself directly in the
line of fire—even putting his reelection in jeopardy. But he did what was right
and necessary for the U.S. to carry the mantle as the world’s leader in the
cause of democracy and human rights. For that, I’m pleased he will make his
return to the U.S. Capitol to inspire the next generation of Americans to
defend the sacred values of democracy, freedom, and equality for all.”“President
Harry Truman was a true son of Missouri, devoting his life to service and to
the good men and women of the state he loved,” said Senator Hawley. “He
was a decisive and honest leader when our nation needed it most and saw us
through difficult and perilous times. It’s an honor to join my colleagues in
dedicating a statue to his memory.”“I
am excited to be able to join in the unveiling ceremony for President Harry S.
Truman’s new statue in the United States Capitol Building,” said Congressman
Long. “President Truman embodied the American Dream. From a farmer in
Missouri to President of the United States, President Truman remained humble
throughout his entire life. I am glad that his statue now joins other great
American presidents in the Capitol Building, so that future generations can
continue to learn about his incredible life and legacy.”

“After only three months as Vice President, Harry Truman succeeded an extremely
popular President in the middle of the deadliest war in human history,” said
Congressman Luetkemeyer. “President Truman led the United States out of
World War II and into one of our nation’s more prosperous periods. As the only
Missourian to serve as President, he has certainly earned a place in the
Capitol.”“I
am proud to join my Missouri colleagues in honoring one of the most influential
public servants from our great state, President Harry S. Truman,” said
Congresswoman Wagner. “Throughout his life, President Truman served our
nation at every level, from enlisting in the Missouri National Guard, to
fighting in France during World War I, serving as a judge, representing our
state in the United States Senate, and finally leading our nation as
Commander-in-Chief. President Truman’s statue in the U.S. Capitol will serve as
an important reminder of his long-lasting legacy and dedication to our
country.”“President
Harry Truman was born in my district and lived a life reflective of his rural
upbringing – with a strong work ethic, steadfast patriotism, and plainspoken
‘The Buck Stops Here’ accountability,” said Congresswoman Hartzler.
“These qualities enabled him to lead with courage and conviction ending World
War II. I am pleased the Show Me State’s distinguished son’s statue will be
displayed in our nation’s Capitol as an inspiration for future citizens to
achieve greatness through humble leadership.”

“President Harry S. Truman was a true statesman and one of Missouri’s finest,” said
Congressman Graves. “As an artillery officer, he fought bravely in the
trenches of Europe during World War I. As President, he made some of the most
difficult decisions in the world, brought an end to World War II, and helped
usher in a new era of peace and prosperity for these United States. No matter
where he served, Harry Truman never forgot his roots and he always lived up to
his favorite slogan: the buck stops here.”

“President Harry S. Truman’s rise from the son of humble Missouri farmers to
the leader of the greatest nation in the world is the story of the American
Dream,” said Congressman Smith. “As a proud Missourian, bold leader, and
successful president, President Truman is a great addition to the U.S.
Capitol’s National Statuary Hall Collection.”

“From desegregating our military to issuing executive orders prohibiting
discrimination in housing and the workplace, President Truman implemented
actions that prioritized civil rights,” said Congresswoman Bush. “I am
glad to join the Missouri delegation in the announcement of the Congressional
unveiling of the President Harry Truman statue.”“President
Truman may be remembered largely in black and white, but he is a 21st century
standard for presidential leadership and public service. His story is our
story, America's story,” said Alex Burden, executive director of the Truman
Library Institute. “Inheriting a global catastrophe after World War II,
Truman shouldered the burden of leadership in a rudderless world with
remarkable courage, integrity and humility. That’s why it’s a tremendous honor
to lead this effort to bring Truman back to Washington more than 75 years since
he boldly led our nation through some of the most dramatic and consequential
chapters in America’s history.”The
statue of President Harry S. Truman will represent the State of Missouri in the
Statuary
Hall Collection and will be the 10th presidential statue installed in the U.S.
Capitol Rotunda.
The
Truman Library Institute — founded by President Truman — spearheaded the Truman
Statue Campaign to fund, create, and install the new Truman statue for the
State of Missouri. The Truman Library Institute is the member-supported,
nonprofit partner of the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library & Museum, one
of 15 presidential libraries of the National Archives and Records
Administration. The Truman Library Institute recently led a $41 million
renovation of the Truman Library in Independence, Mo. Additional information on
the statue is available here: https://www.trumanlibraryinstitute.org/trumanstatue/."
https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-biden-student-loan-proposal-a-one-two-punch-for-hardworking-americans,"August 24, 2022WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.) released
the following statement on the Biden administration’s plan to extend the
student loan repayment pause and forgive loan debt for high-income Americans.“The administration’s student loan plan is a one-two punch for
hardworking Americans,” said Blunt. “It’s a handout for high-income college and
advanced degree graduates paid for by taxpayers who had no part in taking out
these loans. And, it will drive inflation up even further when families are
already struggling with skyrocketing costs. As the first person in my family to
graduate from college and a former university president, I understand how
valuable higher education is. That is why I have worked in a bipartisan way to
make college more affordable for students with the greatest need through the
Pell Grant program. We could fund Pell Grants for more than a decade at the
cost of the administration’s misguided proposal. The president’s plan not only
rewards high-income earners, it will increase the cost of higher education,
making it harder for low-income students to pursue a degree. Americans need
relief from the economic strain they are facing, not another politically-driven
policy that benefits the wealthy at the expense of those who can least afford
it.”Blunt spoke
on the Senate floor in June to outline his concerns with the president’s
proposal. Blunt noted that 87% of Americans do not have federal student loans,
and 60%
of student loan debt is held by households with incomes over $74,000.
According to estimates
from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, student loan debt forgiveness will cost
between $300 billion and $980 billion.
As the chairman and now top Republican on the appropriations
subcommittee that funds education programs, Blunt led efforts to reinstate
year-round Pell Grants and has secured
annual increases in the maximum Pell Grant award.

https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-klobuchar-graham-coons-murkowski-and-blumenthal-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-allowing-afghan-allies-in-the-united-states-to-apply-for-permanent-legal-status,"August 09, 2022WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators Roy Blunt (Mo.),
Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Chris Coons (Del.), Lisa
Murkowski (Alaska), and Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) introduced the Afghan
Adjustment Act, bipartisan, bicameral legislation allowing Afghans with
temporary status that undergo additional vetting to apply for permanent legal
residency. Currently, Afghans who were admitted on temporary humanitarian
status can only gain permanent legal status through the asylum system or
Special Immigrant Visa process (SIV), which both face severe backlogs and long
processing times.The Afghan Adjustment Act would also improve and expand the
Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) process, including by broadening SIV eligibility
to include groups that worked alongside American forces such as the Afghan
National Army Special Operations Command and the Female Tactical Teams of
Afghanistan. Companion legislation is being led in the House by U.S.
Representatives Peter Meijer (Mich.) and Earl Blumenauer (Ore.).“Nearly a year ago, thousands of our Afghan allies fled
their homes as their country fell to the Taliban,” said Blunt. “These
evacuees are people who stood by our service members, risking their safety and
the safety of their loved ones, in support of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.
This bill maintains a rigorous vetting process while providing an opportunity
for Afghan refugees to rebuild their lives in America. I urge our colleagues to
support this bipartisan effort to help those who helped us.”“Giving our Afghan allies a chance to apply for permanent
legal status is the right and necessary thing to do,” said Klobuchar.
“This bipartisan legislation will help provide these newly arrived Afghans who
have sacrificed so much for our country with the legal certainty they deserve
as they begin their lives in the U.S. It’s important to do what we can to help
our Afghan friends find stability, opportunity, and community in their new
home.”“I look forward to working with my colleagues in a
bipartisan fashion to deal with the Afghan parolee problem in a manner that
enhances our national security and keeps our commitment to those who helped us
at their own peril,” said Graham. “This legislation starts us down a
road of creating a strong vetting program to protect our national security
while allowing for Afghans who risked their lives for America to move forward
in the process, and while determining what to do with other parolees we brought
to the U.S. after our hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan. Most have no place to
go, and it is imperative that we protect our own nation while also not
abandoning those who were there for us in the fight. This is a complicated
endeavor, and we will seek input from our colleagues as we try to move
forward.”“We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the Afghan people
for the ways they supported U.S. forces for almost 20 years, often at great
personal risk,” said Coons. “The introduction of the Afghan Adjustment
Act is a first step towards keeping our word as a nation and honoring that
debt. This bipartisan legislation will provide a pathway to lawful permanent
status for certain Afghan civilians, offering them a way out of legal limbo and
the looming threat of deportation with great risk to their personal safety.
Congress has a track record of passing similar legislation on humanitarian
grounds, and we must swiftly do so again. Our Afghan partners deserve nothing
less.”“This month, we mark the one-year anniversary of the U.S.
military withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the end of America’s longest war at
nearly 20 years. During the withdrawal, and the weeks that followed, I worked
diligently with my staff, and alongside our military and our federal agency
partners, to urgently evacuate American citizens, vulnerable Afghans and our
Afghan allies; brave individuals who risked their lives supporting our troops
and mission in Afghanistan. More than 76,000 Afghan evacuees were brought the
United States, many of them were given humanitarian parole – a temporary
immigration status typically granted for one to two year periods. Alaska has
welcomed over 100 Afghan evacuees who are now settling in as valuable members
of our communities across the state,” said Murkowski. “I never supported
indefinite American troop presence in Afghanistan, but I shared the concerns
about the lasting negative impact that complete withdrawal would have. Those
concerns have become reality as the Taliban wreaks havoc on Afghanistan,
condemning millions to live under oppression, and sentencing our allies who
were unable to evacuate to death. It is unlikely than Afghans brought to the
United States on temporary status will be able to return to their homes in the
near, mid, or even long-term future. At the same time, there are allies and
vulnerable Afghans who are desperately trying to leave their crumbling nation,
and who live under great risk. The United States must ensure that we keep our
promises to our Afghan allies, and provide certainty for those who fled to the
United States and have no place to return. I am proud to join my Senate
colleagues in legislation to give innocent Afghans hope for a safer, brighter
future.”“This measure will provide safe haven for Afghans fleeing
Taliban persecution. Our bipartisan bill fulfills a moral obligation to the men
and women who sacrificed in support of the U.S. mission helping American troops
and diplomats. These Afghan allies worked as journalists, translators,
non-profit workers, guards, and interpreters – as well as other dangerous
professions that put their and their families’ lives on the line. This effort
is urgent as their situation is increasingly desperate. These at-risk Afghans
deserve a clear path to citizenship. I am especially proud to have authored
language in the bill that will expand eligibility for the SIV program to
members of the Afghan Special Forces, including the Female Tactical Teams. The
idea developed from the work my office has been doing with several U.S.
veterans and service members who fought alongside these Afghans and who have
spent the last year trying to get them to safety. I am honored to work with
them to fulfill our moral obligation to those who fought alongside us,” said
Blumenthal. “As we reflect on the last year without a U.S. presence in
Afghanistan, it is clear that our mission there is not yet complete,” said
Meijer. “We still have thousands of interpreters and other Afghan partners
who put themselves and their loved ones at risk remaining in Afghanistan, and
thousands more who were evacuated to the U.S. now facing legal uncertainty as
they try to rebuild their lives. I am proud to help lead this bipartisan,
bicameral effort to enhance security vetting procedures, support our allies
overseas, and keep the promises we made to our Afghan partners by providing a
pathway for them to obtain legal status to stay here in the United States. Our
credibility with our allies and our moral standing in the world depend on the
completion of this mission.”“The Afghan Adjustment Act is critical for tens of thousands
of U.S.-affiliated and at-risk Afghans, many of whom are already living in the
United States,” said Blumenauer. “We must keep our commitment to provide
safe, legal refuge to the those who willingly put their lives on the line to
support U.S. mission in Afghanistan. Congress has provided a legal adjustment
process for previous wartime evacuations and humanitarian crises and should do
so once again, without delay.”Modeled after bipartisan bills that Congress has passed in
the wake of other humanitarian crises, including the Vietnam War, the Afghan
Adjustment Act would:·     
Allow Afghans on humanitarian status who submit
to additional vetting to apply for permanent legal status. For these Afghans,
the primary options under current law to gain permanent status are through our
asylum system or the burdensome SIV process;·     
Expand the SIV program to include four
previously omitted groups, including the Female Tactical Teams of Afghanistan,
the Afghan National Army Special Operations Command, the Afghan Air Force, and
the Special Mission Wing of Afghanistan;·     
Establish a task force to develop and implement
a strategy for supporting Afghans outside of the United States who are eligible
for SIV status and require the Department of State to respond to congressional
inquiries about SIV applications.
The legislation has received the endorsement of the Iraq and
Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), Veterans for American Ideals, With
Honor Action, Association of Wartime Allies, Church World Service, National
Immigration Forum, International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), Afghans For
a Better Tomorrow, Voice for Refuge Action Fund, Immigrant ARC, Afghan-American
Foundation, Human Rights First, and the Advocates for Human Rights."
https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-votes-against-democrats-reckless-tax-and-spend-bill,"August 07, 2022WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.)
released the following statement after voting against Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spend bill:



“Last
year, Democrats passed a massive, partisan spending bill despite warnings it
would fuel historic inflation. Now, families are facing the highest level of
inflation in 41 years, straining budgets to the breaking point. This latest
round of massive spending, passed once again without a single Republican vote,
will only make matters worse. The bill does nothing to lower inflation and
raises taxes on middle-class families during a recession. It advances partisan
priorities like supercharging the IRS and restricting domestic energy
production. Democrats need to start listening to the people who are stuck
paying for their failed economic policies.”"

delegation, including U.S. Senators Roy Blunt and Josh Hawley, and U.S.
Representatives Cori Bush, Blaine Luetkemeyer, Ann Wagner, Vicky Hartzler,
Emanuel Cleaver, II, Sam Graves, Billy Long, and Jason Smith, sent a letter
calling on President Biden to support Governor Mike Parson’s request for a
disaster declaration in the city of St. Louis as well as St. Louis, St.
Charles, and Montgomery counties due to severe weather. Following
record-shattering rainfall levels and subsequent flash flooding, Acting
Governor Mike Kehoe declared a state of emergency on July 26, 2022. The
disaster declaration is a necessary step in order for the state to access
critically important federal resources.“Dangerous flash flooding has resulted in hundreds of
evacuations from homes and vehicles, reports of submerged vehicles and,
tragically, two deaths. According to the state, this flooding emergency has
resulted in more water rescues throughout the course of one day than at any
other point in St. Louis’s history. Moreover, joint assessments conducted by
the State Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Small Business Administration,
Federal Emergency Management Agency, and local officials have determined more
than $35 million in damage to uninsured infrastructure and emergency response
costs in the City of St. Louis and St. Louis, St. Charles, and Montgomery
counties, and showed 131 of 206 businesses examined had sustained major
damage,” the delegation wrote. “We respectfully request your prompt
action to ensure that these communities receive the immediate federal support
needed to respond to the disaster.”Full text of the letter is available here.

https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-demands-answers-from-hhs-on-monkeypox-response-plan,"August 03, 2022WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.), the
top Republican on the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health
and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, released a letter he sent
to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra
demanding answers about the administration’s monkeypox response plans. Blunt
criticized the administration’s partisan approach and lack of transparency with
regard to the information that has been shared with Congress on this issue.“As
the number of confirmed cases of monkeypox in the U.S. steadily climbs, my
appropriations staff has tracked and monitored the U.S. response, regularly
asking the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for cost estimates and
projected resource needs for the U.S. response,” Blunt wrote. “HHS has
not provided a plan of action, cost estimates, or a supplemental funding
request in response to these inquiries.”In
the letter, Blunt cited recent reports that the administration has briefed
Democrat leaders about potential response options and cost estimates.
Republicans have requested, but have not received, information from the
administration regarding a potential supplemental funding request.Blunt
continued, “During the
first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress worked with the Trump
Administration to provide funding through five bipartisan COVID-19
appropriations bills. Unfortunately, the Biden Administration has made
infectious disease response unnecessarily partisan. If we learned
anything from the American Rescue Plan Act and the failed COVID-19 supplemental
request this year, infectious disease preparedness and response becomes
infinitely more challenging when it is both political and partisan. Please do not make the same mistake with the monkeypox response.”

a vote of 86-11, and is now headed to the president’s desk.“We
know the damaging impact of toxic burn pits, and we know that toxic-exposed
veterans may not develop an illness for several years after their time in the
service. Today, the Senate took action to ensure these brave men and women
receive the care and benefits they have earned,” said Blunt. “The
Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act expands VA health
care eligibility to include millions of post-9/11 veterans who were exposed to
toxic burn pits. The PACT Act also expands the VA’s list of service
presumptions to include more than 20 toxic exposure-related conditions and
provide resources to the VA to help them better care for all generations of
toxic-exposed veterans. This legislation could significantly boost Missouri’s
role in developing new precision medicine therapies by providing resources for
critical VA health-related research. I’m glad the Senate approved this
legislation with strong, bipartisan support, and I look forward to seeing it
signed into law.”The

The
PACT Act also includes authorization for major medical leases, including leases
for a facility for research in Columbia and outpatient clinics in Farmington,
Kansas City, and Rolla. Blunt has long led
efforts supporting a lease for a research facility in Columbia to establish
a Department
of Veterans Affairs partnership with public research universities to
further the discovery and application of precision medicine therapies. The
University of Missouri’s NextGen Precision Health Initiative will be eligible
to compete for the lease.    "

commended Senate passage of the bipartisan Water Resources Development Act of
2022 (WRDA), legislation authorizing critical investments in water
infrastructure projects. Blunt voted in favor of the legislation, which passed
by a vote of 93-1.“As a national transportation hub, Missouri’s waterways play
an important role in moving goods around the country,” said Blunt.
“Making sure our waterways and surrounding infrastructure are maintained and
improved is essential for our economic competitiveness. While our waterways do
provide a huge advantage to our economy, they also present a flood risk that
impacts families and farms throughout our state. This bill authorizes funding
for critical projects to help to protect Missouri communities from dangerous and costly flooding. I’m encouraged
by the overwhelming, bipartisan support for this bill and hope we can get it to
the president’s desk soon.”WRDA authorizes key projects and studies to tackle water
resources challenges across the country, including Missouri. The bill also
makes important revisions to the Civil Works policies and programs of the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers to increase the agency’s responsiveness to national and
local priorities.Blunt-backed priorities in the WRDA bill:Inland Waterways: The bill reduces the share of costs
derived from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund to construct an inland waterways
project to 25%, and makes the new cost share permanent.Environmental Review Process Reforms: The bill directs
the Corps to track, and annually submit to Congress, a report on the time to
complete the environmental review process for projects as required by the
National Environmental Policy Act.Expanding Water Resource Projects: The bill authorizes 17 new projects, modifies four
existing projects, and authorizes 36 feasibility studies nationwide.
Help Protect Communities from Dangerous Flooding: The
bill enables critical investments in the protection and restoration of
shorelines and riverbanks from erosion and other damaging forces."

https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-lankford-and-colleagues-move-to-stop-flawed-social-cost-of-carbon-metric-from-driving-energy-regulations,"July 21, 2022WASHINGTON – Today,
U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.), a member of the Senate Appropriations
Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, and U.S. Senator
James Lankford (Okla.), a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee, joined 11 of their Republican colleagues in introducing the Transparency
and Honesty in Energy Regulations Act, a bill to prohibit the federal
government from using the flawed social cost of carbon, social cost of methane,
social cost of nitrous oxide, or the social cost of any other greenhouse gas
metrics in the rulemaking process. U.S. Representative Richard Hudson (N.C.)
introduced companion legislation along with five House Republicans.“Using
the ‘social cost of carbon’ to justify burdensome, costly energy regulations
will deal another blow to American families, farmers, and small businesses that
are already facing crushing inflation and skyrocketing energy prices,” said Blunt. “If a new regulation is
needed for the health and safety of Americans, and falls within the appropriate
jurisdiction of the department or agency issuing it, the administration should
be able to defend that regulation on the merits. Relying on the ‘social cost of
carbon’ is a transparent effort to invent new ways to enact a radical,
green-energy agenda that Americans cannot afford. I’m proud to join my
colleagues in this effort to prevent more regulatory uncertainty and protect
families and our economy from even higher costs.”“Oklahomans
want clean air, land, and water. But the ‘social cost of carbon’ was created
without transparency for the public or the industries it impacts. It has no
basis in reality,” said Lankford.
“The social cost of carbon has a big impact on every Oklahoma family and their
pocketbook since it is used to justify many parts of Democrats’ illegitimate,
progressive climate-change scheme that increases the cost of gasoline,
electricity, and other goods. The Supreme Court recently determined in West
Virginia v. EPA that the EPA may not cap greenhouse gas emissions because Congress
did not provide the agency with that authority. In the same way, the social
cost of carbon metric is clearly outside the scope of EPA’s regulatory
authority, and our bill ensures they stop using it.”“The
Transparency and Honesty in Energy Regulations Act takes important steps to
halt the use of flawed metrics to justify overreaching government regulations,”
said Hudson. “American industries
and job-creators need regulatory certainty, not biased estimates that fail to
comply with key rulemaking guidance. I appreciate Senator Lankford’s leadership
on this issue and look forward to working with my House colleagues on this
important bill.”In
addition to Blunt and Lankford, the bill was introduced in the Senate by U.S.
Senators Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), Jim Inhofe (Okla.), Kevin Cramer (N.D.),
Tom Cotton (Ark.), John Hoeven (N.D.), Steve Daines (Mont.), Cynthia Lummis
(Wyo.), John Barrasso (Wyo.), John Cornyn (Texas), Roger Marshall (Kan.), and
Jim Risch (Idaho). In addition to Hudson, the bill was introduced in the House
by U.S. Representatives David McKinley (W.Va.), Jeff Duncan (S.C.), Buddy
Carter (Ga.), Greg Steube (Fla.), and Byron Donalds (Fla.).“In
West Virginia, we know all too well the negative impact of burdensome
regulations on our energy producers, including coal and natural gas,” Capito said. “With a troubling lack of
transparency, the Biden administration seeks to apply an obscure figure, known
as the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases, to justify these costly, job-killing
regulations. The Transparency and Honesty in Energy Regulations Act would
prevent federal agencies from future overreach through opaque and overstated
cost analyses. This comes at a critical time as Americans are facing
skyrocketing energy costs and runaway inflation and the Biden administration
continues to stifle American energy production, citing these very same ‘social
cost’ figures. I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing this legislation
that would enable West Virginia to remain a key energy-producing state in the
years to come.”“President
Biden and his administration are so focused on peddling their far-left
policies, they can’t be bothered to take time to address real issues like the
border crisis or inflation,” Inhofe said.
“Their development of the social cost of greenhouse gases like methane, carbon
and nitrous oxide is severely flawed, and using it to inform the energy and
environmental regulatory process will increase costs on American families. I am
glad to join Sen. Lankford in introducing legislation which prevents the
Executive Branch from using this flawed metric to thwart the needed
construction of energy infrastructure like natural gas pipelines and energy
export projects around the nation.”“The
social cost of carbon is an arbitrary and inconsistent metric. It is being used
to justify the Biden Administration’s radical climate agenda and has already
been changed multiple times, causing major changes in the already cumbersome
permitting process. The metrics have become a silver bullet for fringe
environmentalist groups and their friends in the administration seeking to stop
energy development projects and implement overbearing regulations. The
Transparency and Honesty in Energy Regulation Act bars the federal government
from using these analyses so projects are not held hostage by activist
bureaucrats in Washington. The legislation also requires a report to Congress
on the use of social cost of carbon and its related entities in order to
provide additional insight into the rules and regulations promulgated by the
Biden administration using these secret, capricious measurements,” said Cramer.“The
Obama-era ‘social cost’ measurement resulted in costly regulations and job
losses across the energy sector. Now, President Biden is continuing his war
against American energy by reinstating this arbitrary metric,” said Cotton. “Our bill will prohibit
the use of ‘social costs’ as justification for any regulations from the EPA or
FERC.”“American
energy production is being stifled due to the Biden administration using biased
estimates to justify burdensome regulations. Our legislation would help ensure
that energy and environmental regulations are based on factual scientific
standards rather than the social cost of carbon, a subjective metric which
lacks oversight and transparency and is used to hide the true economic costs of
a regulation,” said Hoeven.“Montanans
are worried about heating their homes and filling up their tanks—not the
‘social cost’ of energy. We need to be unleashing made in America energy, not
subjecting producers to the woke whims of the radical green Left,” said Daines.“My
home state of Wyoming is the largest net energy exporter in the United States,
and the Biden Administration using the ‘social cost of carbon’ in setting
regulations is crippling to not only Wyoming, but our entire country,” said Lummis. “I’m proud to join my
colleagues in introducing the Transparency and Honesty in Energy Regulations
Act to prevent President Biden from using this misguided metric in determining
the costs and benefits of proposed regulatory action.”“Energy
and environmental regulations must have a basis in scientific fact, not
hypothetical social costs based on far-left political priorities,” said Barrasso. “This important bill
will ensure no administration can use flawed social cost metrics to justify
harmful regulations aimed at crippling American energy production.”“This
Administration will use any tool at their disposal in their relentless and
damaging war against American energy. Bogus emergency declarations, phony
greenhouse gas metrics like the ‘social cost of carbon,’ nothing is off the
table,” said Marshall. “The pain
Americans are feeling at the pump and when they pay their electricity bills is
real. President Biden is not serious about tackling inflation, so it is up to
Congress to act. Stopping destructive regulations needs to be at the top of our
list.”























































These
social cost of greenhouse gas metrics are theoretical measurements to try to
put a price or economic impact on emissions. The measurement theories have been
used in the federal government to determine the economic impact of potential
federal regulations, even though they are unscientific and can result in more
burdensome regulations. The bill would prohibit the Environmental Protection
Agency, the Department of Energy, the Department of the Interior, the
Department of the Treasury, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of
Commerce, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Council on
Environmental Quality, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from using
the social cost of carbon, social cost of methane, and social cost of nitrous
oxide as rationales for their regulations. "
https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/missouri-delegation-makes-the-case-for-arpa-h-headquarters-to-be-located-in-missouri,"July 21, 2022WASHINGTON – This week, the entire Missouri congressional delegation, led by U.S. Senator Roy Blunt, the
top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and
Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, and signed by Senator Josh
Hawley, and U.S. Representatives Emanuel Cleaver, II, Blaine Luetkemeyer, Billy
Long, Ann Wagner, Jason Smith, Sam Graves, Vicky Hartzler, and Cori Bush, sent
a letter to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier
Becerra urging the department to select Missouri for
the new Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) headquarters.
ARPA-H will utilize public-private partnerships to dramatically accelerate the
development and approval of new treatments and technologies, and to respond to
the most daunting health problems Americans face today.“We write to express our strong support to locate the Advanced
Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) in the State of Missouri, where an
extraordinary biomedical ecosystem already exists,” the delegation said.
“Missouri is home to world-class universities and the health and technology
innovation districts created in tandem with hospitals, a convergence of a wide
variety of technical specialties with health as a unifying theme,
entrepreneurial talent, cutting-edge independent research centers,
multinational health companies, and unique research facilities.”In the letter, the members highlight Missouri universities whose
innovation districts and partnerships with hospitals combine traditional health
sectors with emerging technologies to help prepare for future health
challenges. The members cite successful partnerships across the state,
including the Cortex Innovation Community in St. Louis, the UMKC Health
Sciences District in Kansas City, and the One Health and Mizzou Forward
initiative in Columbia.The delegation continued, “With the state’s heritage of life science, biopharmaceutical,
veterinary medicine, and health care services, we are integrating nanoscience,
IT/software, law, and finance. … Leveraging Missouri’s universities, innovation
districts, health corporations, and unique research facilities will serve as a
benefit to ARPA-H and we hope the state will receive due consideration when
choosing a location for ARPA-H.”

Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Michael Regan urging the agency to
increase the proposed biodiesel volumes in the upcoming Renewable Volume
Obligations (RVOs) for 2023 and 2024 to provide certainty to farmers and
producers. The senators highlighted how American biodiesel moderates fuel
prices and benefits the economy and environment.“We
strongly encourage EPA to utilize the upcoming RVOs for 2023 and 2024 to
continue to increase volumes of biomass-based diesel,” the senators wrote. “The
production and use of biomass-based diesel contributes significantly to our
economy and environment. These homegrown fuels add to our country’s critical
fuel supplies, which helps to moderate fuel prices.”“Farmers
and biofuel producers are an essential part of the solution to the nation’s
economic, environmental, and energy security challenges. They deserve certainty
in this policy. A multiyear rule would provide the predictability and market
signals that the biomass-based diesel industry needs to grow,” the senators
continued. “Biofuels are poised to play an essential role in a sustainable,
homegrown energy future. With the increased use of biomass-based diesel, we can
advance efforts to diversify our nation’s fuel supply while creating and
sustaining jobs, strengthening local economies, generating tax revenues, and
improving energy security.”In
addition to Blunt, Klobuchar, Grassley, and Thune, the letter was signed by
U.S. Senators Tina Smith (Minn.), Roger Marshall (Kan.), Debbie Stabenow

https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-welcomes-launch-of-new-988-national-suicide-prevention-lifeline-phone-number,"July 15, 2022WASHINGTON –
Today, U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.), the top Republican on the Senate
Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and
Related Agencies, welcomed the launch of the National Suicide Prevention
Lifeline’s new, three digit 988 number. The National Suicide Prevention
Lifeline is a national network of more than 200 local- and state-funded crisis
centers. The new number, which will be available starting tomorrow, July 16,
will allow individuals experiencing a mental health crisis to call or text 988
to connect with a trained mental health professional.“The number of calls to the National Suicide Prevention
Lifeline skyrocketed in recent years as Americans struggled with the mental
health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Each one of those calls can be a life
or death moment for a person in crisis,” said Blunt. “We need to be sure the
capacity is there to answer every call as quickly as possible. As the top
Republican on the appropriations subcommittee that funds health programs, I
have been proud to work with my colleagues to substantially increase federal
funding to transition to the lifeline’s new 988 number and strengthen the
network of crisis centers answering the calls. We will continue working to
ensure the resources are in place to meet the needs of the lifeline as the new
988 number goes into effect. I hope this transition will make it easier for
people to reach out and get the lifesaving help they need, when they need it.”The Blunt-backed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which was
signed into law last month, provided $150 million to support the launch of 988,
including crisis center operations. The FY2022 government funding bill, signed
into law in March, provided $101.6 million, a $77.6 million increase, for the
988 transition.
The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act also authorized the
nationwide expansion of the Excellence in Mental Health program, giving every
state the opportunity to establish or expand community-based mental health
clinics if they choose to do so. The Excellence in Mental Health Act was signed
into law in 2014 and marked the most significant expansion of community mental
health and addiction services in decades. It created Certified Community
Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) that provide a wide range of services,
including 24/7/365 crisis services, immediate screenings, risk assessments, and
diagnoses. Missouri is one of the nine states currently participating in the
Excellence in Mental Health pilot program, which has a proven track record of
improving access to care, reducing hospital and ER visits, and providing mental
and behavioral health support to local law enforcement."

of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban
Development, and Related Agencies, commended the Federal Aviation
Administration’s (FAA) announcement that it is investing $5.2 million to
improve terminals in three airports across Missouri: Waynesville-Saint Robert
Regional Airport, Rosecrans Memorial Airport, and Hannibal Regional Airport.“This announcement is great news for our state,” said Blunt.
“The grants will help these airports build better, more resilient terminals
that can accommodate current and future passenger demand. Missouri’s greatest
competitive advantage is our location, and investing in safer, stronger
transportation infrastructure is one of the best ways to ensure our state
remains a national transportation hub.”
Waynesville-Saint
Robert Regional Airport will receive $3 million to construct a new commercial
passenger terminal facility to increase capacity and passenger access. In the FY22 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development,
and Related Agencies funding bill, Blunt secured
an additional $9 million for infrastructure improvements at Waynesville-Saint
Robert. Rosecrans Memorial Airport will receive $1.98 million for the reconstruction of the commercial passenger terminal to
replace aging infrastructure and improve energy efficiency. Hannibal Regional
Airport will receive $285,000 to repair damaged infrastructure and extend the
use of the current terminal building.Funding for the grants comes from the Airport Terminal
Program, one of three aviation programs created under the Blunt-backed
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The law provides $1 billion annually
for five years for Airport Terminal grants.

U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.) and seven of their colleagues in sending
a letter to the CEO of TikTok, Shou Zi Chew, following reports about the
company giving Beijing backdoor access to private user data.In addition

(Miss.), John Thune (S.D.), Ted Cruz (Texas), Jerry Moran (Kan.), Shelley Moore
Capito (W.Va.), Cynthia Lummis (Wyo.), and Steve Daines (Mont.).“We are
writing about the June 17, 2022, BuzzFeed News report that highlighted how
TikTok’s U.S. consumer data was, on multiple occasions, accessed by the
companies’ engineers in China,” the Senators wrote. “According to BuzzFeed
News, the outlet reviewed 14 statements by nine different TikTok employees,
each of whom attested to such incidents between September 2021 and January
2022. A member of TikTok’s Trust and Safety Department alleged that ‘everything
is seen in China,’ and stated that one Beijing-based engineer had ‘access to
everything.’ Further, U.S. employees apparently did not even have the
permissions or knowledge needed to access the data.”The Senators
continued, “we are very concerned that, in light of these reports, TikTok’s
representative did not provide truthful or forthright answers to the Senate
Commerce Committee at its subcommittee hearing. It appears that TikTok is now
taking steps to deflect from its knowing misrepresentations by changing the way
in which ‘protected’ data can be accessed by its employees. The implications of
these findings are stark, but not surprising. Rather, they simply confirm what
lawmakers long suspected about TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance—they
are using their access to a treasure trove of U.S. consumer data to surveil Americans.
And this unfortunately extends beyond consumer data into the national security
space.”

Senators Roy Blunt (Mo.) and Patty Murray (Wash.), Ranking Member and Chair of
the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services,
Education, and Related Agencies (LHHS), along with U.S. Representatives Tom
Cole (Okla.), Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor,
Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (LHHS), and Rosa
DeLauro (Conn.), Chair of the House Appropriations Committee, announced that
they have introduced a resolution celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Pell
Grant program, which was established on June 23, 1972. Pell Grants are the
cornerstone of federal financial aid and, today, they help about 40% of all
undergraduates pursue a higher education.“As the first person in
my family to graduate from college, I know how important Pell Grants are for
students to realize their goal of a higher education. Pell Grants provide
critical support to the students who need it most,” said Blunt. “I’m proud of
the bipartisan work we’ve been able to do in Congress to strengthen the Pell
Grant program, like raising the maximum award amount and reinstating year-round
Pell. I’m glad to join Senator Murray and our House colleagues in introducing
this resolution to celebrate 50 years of the Federal Pell Grant program.”“For fifty years, Pell
Grants have been a lifeline for students and families across the
country—helping tens of millions of students and families like mine afford
college and complete degrees,” said Murray. “I’m so proud to celebrate the 50th
Anniversary of the Pell Grants program, and I’m going to keep fighting for Pell
Grants and working to make them go even further for students with the tightest
budgets.”“As a first generation
college graduate, I know firsthand how important it is to provide opportunities
for those to pursue higher education,” said Cole. “For 50 years, the Pell Grant
program has done just that. On this milestone anniversary, we remember the
doors Pell Grants have opened for countless Americans and reaffirm our
commitment to work across the aisle and ensure they continue to be funded.”“The Pell Grant is the
most effective college assistance program in our government,” said DeLauro. “
Today, we celebrate the success of the Pell Grant. For 50 years, it has
supported the dreams and ambitions of millions of American students, ensuring

great career. I promise to continue my strong support for this program, and to
fight to strengthen it for generations to come.”In the fifty years
since they were established, Pell Grants have helped over 80 million students
afford college. Today, Pell Grants help nearly seven million students with the
fewest resources pursue higher education. The vast majority of Pell Grant
recipients come from families making $40,000 a year or less, and the grants

following statement applauding Senate passage of the Sergeant First Class Heath
Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of
2022. The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 84-14, with Blunt voting in favor
of the legislation.“Toxic-exposed veterans may not develop an illness for
months or even years after their service. That should not prevent them from
receiving the care and benefits they’ve earned,” said Blunt. “The Sergeant
First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act expands eligibility for VA
health care to millions of post-9/11 veterans who were exposed to toxic burn
pits, adds more than 20 toxic exposure-related conditions to the VA’s list of
service presumptions, and provides resources to the VA to help ensure they’re
able to serve all generations of toxic-exposed veterans. I’m glad the bill also
includes resources for health-related VA research that could substantially
enhance our state’s role in developing new precision medicine therapies. The
strong, bipartisan support for this bill underscores our shared commitment to
keeping the promises we made to service members and their families.”
The PACT Act also includes authorization for major medical
leases, including leases for a facility for research in Columbia and outpatient
clinics in Farmington, Kansas City, and Rolla. Blunt has long led efforts
supporting a lease for a facility for research in Columbia to establish a
Department of Veterans Affairs partnership with public research universities to
further the discovery and application of precision medicine therapies. The
University of Missouri’s NextGen Precision Health Initiative will be eligible
to compete for the lease."

of the Interior Deb Haaland, the National Park Service has announced they will
reinstate police escorts for American veterans traveling to Washington,
D.C., as part of the Honor Flight Network. In their letter to Secretary
Haaland, the senators noted that Missouri-based Honor Flights were denied
vehicular escort services this year and urged the Secretary to reverse course.

""The Honor Flight program has touched the lives of hundreds of thousands
of veterans and their families,” said Blunt. “One of the incredible
privileges of serving in Congress is being able to welcome veterans to the
National Mall and thank them for their service. These memorials belong to the
veterans they were built to honor. I’m glad the Department of Interior has
reversed course and will resume police escorts to ensure Honor Flight travelers
can get to their destinations safely and quickly. I would like to thank Honor
Flight networks in Missouri and across the nation for bringing attention to
this issue and working with us to get it resolved.”

""This is the right decision – these police escorts should have always
remained in place,” said Hawley. “Our veterans are American heroes and
they deserve the very best when visiting our nation’s capital.""

Rob Portman (Ohio), and Chris Coons (Del.) introduced a resolution recognizing
Poland’s efforts in welcoming Ukrainian refugees and supporting the Ukrainian
resistance. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, over three million Ukrainians
have fled across the border into Poland. Poland continues to accept the highest
number of refugees compared to surrounding countries since the war started, and
provide critical military aid to Ukraine.“During my recent visit to the Ukrainian border, I saw
first-hand the incredible generosity that Poland and its citizens have shown to
the millions of Ukrainians displaced by Putin’s brutal war,” said Blunt.
“On top of providing humanitarian assistance like food, shelter, and health
care to refugees, Poland has played a vital role in the international effort to
arm the Ukrainian fighters. I’m proud to join my colleagues on this resolution
expressing our immense gratitude to Poland for its commitment to supporting the
Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom.” “In the two months since Russia’s brutal and unprovoked
invasion of Ukraine, more than five million Ukrainians have been forced to flee
their country; over three million of those refugees have traveled to Poland. It
has been incredible to see the response by Poland, doing everything they can do
to help their neighbors escape violence,” said Portman. “I want to thank
the Polish people for opening their hearts and homes and continuing to donate
their time and resources to help these refugees. Also, to the Polish government
for giving $1.6 billion worth of military aid, which has been vital to
Ukraine’s efforts to defend its homeland.”“The people of Poland are demonstrating to the world what it
means to care for the stranger, the widow, and the orphan in our midst,” said
Coons. “When I was in Poland in February, I witnessed firsthand the
strength of our alliance and commitment to standing behind the Ukrainian people
against Russian aggression. Their generosity, their role in arming the
Ukrainian military, and their relentless efforts in support of displaced
Ukrainian refugees, accepting over 3 million of those displaced by the conflict
and welcoming many into their own homes, is a moving example for the rest of
us. I am glad to join with Senator Portman and Senator Blunt on Poland’s
Constitution Day in recognition of these efforts.”  Text of the resolution: Expressing appreciation for the Republic of Poland’s
efforts to assist Ukrainian refugees and support Ukraine’s sovereignty
following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Whereas, on February 24, 2022, Russian Federation
President Vladimir Putin instigated an unprovoked, unjustified, and unlawful
war violating the territorial integrity of the sovereign country of Ukraine; Whereas, as of April 27, 2022, more than 5,300,000
Ukrainians have fled Ukraine since the Russian Federation began its invasion; Whereas the Republic of Poland has played a critical role
in responding to the influx of Ukrainian refugees into Europe, admitting more
than half of the Ukrainians who have fled from the conflict; Whereas the Republic of Poland has accepted more
Ukrainian refugees than any other country, admitting more than 2,900,000 as of
April 27, 2022; Whereas prior to the invasion, the Republic of Poland had
admitted more than 1,500,000 Ukrainians since Russia illegally annexed
Ukraine’s Crimea region and started a separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine in
2014; Whereas the Republic of Poland continues to provide
critical services to Ukrainian refugees in the country, including access to the
country’s labor market, health care system, education, and social
benefits;   Whereas the people of the Republic of Poland have joined
their government in responding to Ukrainian refugees with generosity,
leadership, and resolve, including by welcoming Ukrainian refugees into their
homes;    Whereas the Republic of Poland’s leaders supported
Ukrainian sovereignty and presented the need for a united front against Russian
aggression prior to the invasion of Ukraine;  Whereas the Republic of Poland has facilitated the
shipment of humanitarian assistance into Ukraine by collecting and sending aid
into Ukraine and by serving as a transit hub, simplifying border crossing
procedures, and waiving road tolls for aid trucks; Whereas the Republic of Poland continues to provide vital
military assistance to Ukraine and serves as a crucial transit hub for sending
international military supplies and equipment into Ukraine;  Whereas the Republic of Poland is a key partner in
deterrence efforts against additional Russian aggression in Eastern Europe,
including through their hosting of approximately 10,000 U.S. troops;   Whereas the Republic of Poland has hosted the United
States Embassy Kyiv during its temporary relocation, supporting the Department
of State’s vital work of assisting American citizens and their families
departing Ukraine;  Whereas Poland is a crucial member of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance and a historic friend of the United States; Resolved, That the Senate— (1) thanks the Republic of Poland for its pivotal role
accepting Ukrainian refugees; and  (2) appreciates the Republic of Poland’s ongoing support
for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including through the
NATO alliance.

As part of these trips, theHonor Flight Network organizes buses to bring veterans to the National Mall, where they can visit memorials for the wars in which they fought, reflect on the sacrifices they and their comrades made in those campaigns, and remember those who never came home. To say that the Honor Flight Network is performing a national service is an understatement. For thousands of American veterans, these trips are a once in a lifetime opportunity for honor, reflection, and remembrance that simply cannot be replaced.The Department of the Interior has historically played an important role in making these trips possible by providing U.S. Park Police escorts for buses carrying Honor Flight veterans to the National Mall. These escorts are important because of many of these veterans are no longer able to walk long distances on their own. Being able to drive and park close to the memorials they are visiting is therefore essential. Escorts also help to ensure Honor Flight trips are safe and run smoothly without logistical challenges or schedule delays that can impact the trip’s experience for our veterans.Yet it appears the Department of the Interior has changed its policy about providing these vehicular escorts for Honor Flight trips. For example, in response to an inquiry from Rep. Bill Posey (FL), the Chief of theU.S. Park Police admitted that there had been a “suspension” of these services in part due to the Department’s “policy on escorts.” In addition, we have recently been made aware that Missouri-based Honor Flights have been denied these vehicular services, even though they have received these same services in years past.Such a policy change is wholly unacceptable and deserves further explanation. It needlessly creates new challenges for Honor Flight groups, including veterans from our home state of Missouri.Our nation’s veterans represent the best of us. It’s critical that the government do its part to honor their sacrifices by making these trips run as smoothly as possible. With this in mind, we urge you in the strongest possible terms to resume U.S. Park Police escorts for veterans traveling to our nation’s capital with the Honor Flight Network. We ask further for your responses to the following questions no later than Tuesday, May 3, 2022:1. How many police escorts has the Department of theInterior provided annually for Honor Flight Network trips to Washington, DC?Please provide all relevant data annualized for the years 2005 to 2022.2. When did the Department of the Interior formally decide to suspend police escorts for Honor Flight trips to Washington, D.C., and why was this decision made?3. Why does the Department now claim its “policy on escorts”prohibits vehicular services to the Honor Flight Network, when these same services were provided in years past?4. Were the President of the United States, Secretary ofDefense, or Secretary of Veterans Affairs informed of any decision by theDepartment of the Interior to end police escorts for Honor Flight trips, and if so, when were they informed, and did they support that decision?5. Will you commit to provide police escorts for all futureHonor Flight trips to our nation’s capital? If so, when will those escorts become available and who should the Honor Flight Network contact in order to coordinate trip escorts?Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

announced that the Senate has unanimously passed their bipartisan resolution
marking the 200th anniversary of the birth of Ulysses S. Grant.“Ulysses S. Grant is one of our nation’s greatest presidents,” said
Blunt. “When Ulysses S. Grant was called to serve, he did so with courage,
integrity, and determination that led his troops – and our nation –  to
victory. As we celebrate the bicentennial of Grant’s birth, we should all
reflect on his fight for a more perfect Union, and honor his legacy and the
legacy of all of the service members who have fought for this nation and the
values we stand for.”“President Ulysses S. Grant, a
son of Ohio, served his nation with honor and distinction,” said Brown. “Grant’s
exemplary leadership on the battlefield could only be overshadowed by his
commitment to a more just nation for all Americans during the Reconstruction
Era. I’m proud to recognize President Grant’s many accomplishments with this
resolution as we plan a bicentennial celebration honoring his service 200 years
after his birth in Point Pleasant, Ohio.”“Ulysses S. Grant was an incredible leader who
proved himself to be one of the most influential military commanders America
has ever seen,” said U.S. Representative Ann Wagner (Mo.). “His
leadership held our nation together at a perilous time in history, and I am
grateful the Senate passed a resolution to commemorate his unwavering
dedication to our country. I urge the House to pass our companion legislation
commemorating Grant’s bicentennial, and I will continue to fight for passage of
the Ulysses S. Grant Bicentennial Recognition Act to properly honor Grant by
promoting him to General of the Armies of the United States.”In 2021, Blunt and Brown introduced
the bipartisan Ulysses S. Grant Bicentennial Recognition Act which, in addition
to marking the 200th anniversary of Grant’s birth, requests
President Biden posthumously promote Grant to General of the Armies of the
United States, the highest rank in the U.S. Army. Wagner introduced
similar legislation in the House.The lawmakers recently sent
a letter to
the Department of Defense urging Secretary Lloyd Austin to review Grant’s

https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-colleagues-demand-answers-on-changes-to-border-security-policies,"April 13, 2022WASHINGTON – This week, U.S.
Senators Roy Blunt (Mo.), Co-Chair of the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus, Jerry
Moran (Kan.), and 11 of their colleagues sent a letter to Department of
Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas seeking answers on recent
changes to how the department enforces border security and processes migrants
at the southern border. “In Fiscal Year (FY)
2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 1.7 million encounters
with individuals attempting to cross the border illegally, the highest single
year total ever recorded,” the senators wrote. “Even more troubling is
the fact that this year is on pace to far exceed the record-breaking numbers
from last year.” “The Biden
administration’s decision to terminate the Title 42 public health order that
provided border agents the authority to perform expedited removals is the
latest example of troubling policy moves,” the senators continued. “Last
year, Title 42 was used more than 1 million times to quickly expel individuals
who crossed the border illegally. Such a move will undoubtedly leave CBP and
law enforcement along the border vulnerable to being overwhelmed in the face of
sustained record levels of illegal crossings.” In addition to Blunt
and Moran, the letter was signed by U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (N.C.), James
Inhofe (Okla.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Mike Braun (Ind.), John Boozman (Ark.),
Rand Paul (Ky.), Susan Collins (Maine), John Hoeven (N.D.), Roger Wicker
(Miss.), Joni Ernst (Iowa), and James Risch (Idaho).   The full letter can
be found HERE
and below.  Dear Secretary
Mayorkas: We write today to
express our grave concerns with actions taken by the Biden administration and
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the effect they will have on our
ability to secure our southern border. These concerns are exacerbated as it
becomes more likely every day that this year we will surpass the record-breaking
number of encounters at the southern border experienced last year.  In Fiscal Year (FY)
2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 1.7 million encounters
with individuals attempting to cross the border illegally, the highest single
year total ever recorded. Even more troubling is the fact that this year is on
pace to far exceed the record-breaking numbers from last year. In February, CBP
recorded nearly 165,000 encounters, setting a record for that particular month
and marking the twelfth month in a row in which encounters exceeded 150,000. Securing the southern
border and deterring the sustained, record-breaking flow of illegal and
irregular migration should be a top priority for DHS. Unfortunately, the Biden
administration has done the opposite by instituting policies that encourage
individuals to make the dangerous trek north and entrust their safety to
dangerous drug cartels at the risk of being murdered, assaulted or trafficked. In September of last
year, you issued new guidance to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for
its enforcement and removal operations which dramatically limited the scope of
individuals ICE prioritizes for enforcement. With the publication of the ICE Annual
Report last month, we learned the results of this policy and, as expected, they
are extremely disconcerting as both arrests and removals reached the lowest
levels ever recorded. Even more troubling is the fact that arrests and removals
of those convicted of a crime were down 48% and 63%, respectively. More recently, your
department has moved to dramatically alter America’s system for granting asylum
by striping immigration judges of decision-making authority and giving it to
United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) asylum officers.
Such a move raises serious red flags, given that 85% of determinations of
credible fear by a USCIS asylum officers are later overturned by an immigration
judge. Finally, the Biden
administration’s decision to terminate the Title 42 public health order that
provided border agents the authority to perform expedited removals is the
latest example of troubling policy moves. Last year, Title 42 was used more
than 1 million times to quickly expel individuals who crossed the border
illegally. Such a move will undoubtedly leave CBP and law enforcement along the
border vulnerable to being overwhelmed in the face of sustained record levels
of illegal crossings. It has been reported that there are some 25,000 individuals
already waiting in Mexico for Title 42 to be lifted and US intelligence
estimates an influx of more than 170,000 total. It’s clear that the
humanitarian and national security crisis at our southern border will not slow
in the coming months and is on pace to be even worse. We understand DHS is
actively preparing to respond to the increased illegal and irregular migration,
but more details of the plans are needed. We ask that you answer the following
questions by April 27, 2022. Addressing the
problems facing our broken immigration system in order to provide an effective
and efficient legal pathway for those who wish to share in and contribute to
the success of our great nation is, as it should be, a priority. However, this
cannot be accomplished until we are able to properly secure our borders. Thank
you for your attention to this request, and we look forward to your reply.

Full text of the letter HERE

Dear Director Haines:

We write with regard to the brutal Russian invasion and crimes in Ukraine and
the need for the U.S. Intelligence Community to ensure that Ukrainian forces
have the resources to counter Putin’s military. We remain deeply concerned that
not enough is being done to share critical intelligence that would assist the
Ukrainians as Russian forces move to secure territory in the southern and
eastern parts of the country. 

In recent weeks, Ukrainian forces have carried out heroic efforts to retake
territory from the Russian invaders. As we watch Russia turn its focus to
southern and eastern Ukraine, we urge you to ensure that our intelligence
agencies proactively share intelligence with the Ukrainians to help them
protect, defend, and retake every inch of Ukraine’s sovereign territory, which
includes Crimea and the Donbas. 

The people of Ukraine are inspiring the world by their bravery and courage in
the face of increasing cruelty and mounting evidence of atrocities and crimes
against humanity committed by Putin’s military. We must stand with them in
their darkest hour and provide them with as much information as quickly as
possible.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. 

Sincerely,

Today, U.S. Senators Roy Blunt (Mo.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Ranking Member
and Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration with
oversight over federal elections, announced that they have requested an update
from the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) on its efforts to support state
and local election officials with administering the 2022 midterm elections.“As election
officials administer the 2022 primary elections and prepare for the 2022
general election, we have heard about a number of challenges that they face,”
the senators wrote. “The EAC plays a critical role in ensuring that election
officials have the necessary information and resources to administer secure and
successful elections, and it is important for the EAC to be prepared to support
election officials as they work to address these obstacles.”Based on
issues raised by state and local election officials, the senators highlighted
the need for the EAC to work with state and local election officials as they
strengthen the cybersecurity of election systems, counter election-related
disinformation campaigns, protect election officials against threats, and
reliably procure election supplies including ballot paper and envelopes.In November,
Blunt and Klobuchar urged the EAC to provide state and local officials with
information and guidance as they combat threats against election workers and
administrators. In October, the senators held a Rules Committee hearing focused
on the increasing threats directed at election officials and the ability of
states and local governments to retain election officials and recruit workers
to administer future elections.The full
letter is available HERE and below:Dear
Commissioners:We write to
request information about the support provided by the Election Assistance
Commission (EAC) to state and local governments in the administration of
federal elections during the 2022 election cycle. As election officials
administer the 2022 primary elections and prepare for the 2022 general
election, we have heard about a number of challenges that they face. The EAC
plays a critical role in ensuring that election officials have the necessary
information and resources to administer secure and successful elections, and it
is important for the EAC to be prepared to support election officials as they
work to address these obstacles.First,
bolstering the cybersecurity of election systems remains a key challenge for
state and local officials. The intelligence community has continued to warn that
our elections remain a target for foreign adversaries seeking to compromise our
election systems and conduct influence campaigns. While state and local
election officials have made significant progress in improving election
cybersecurity in recent years, challenges remain as many states are planning to
upgrade their voter registration databases, update election software, and
conduct vulnerability assessments ahead of the general election.Second,
election officials are continuing to institute measures to counter
election-related misinformation and disinformation to help ensure voters
understand and trust the election process. Effective voter education materials
can serve as a constructive way not only to counter misinformation about voting
and elections but to provide voters with accurate information so that they can
better understand and fully participate in the election process.Third, as we
highlighted in a letter to you in November 2021, election officials continue to
experience threats and abusive conduct. At a Rules Committee hearing last
October, Kentucky’s Secretary of State warned that if we do not act, state and
local governments will struggle to retain or recruit people to administer
future elections.Finally, in
addition to concerns regarding election worker and volunteer recruitment, we
have heard that some election officials are facing challenges in procuring
election supplies like ballot paper and envelopes. Recently, the Election
Infrastructure Subsector Coordinating Council established a working group to
analyze reports of potential election supply shortages, including paper
supplies, and make recommendations to vendors and election officials on ways to
mitigate any challenges.To ensure
the EAC is successfully fulfilling its mission to assist state and local
election officials with the challenges they are facing during this year’s
election cycle, we request that you provide us with answers to the questions
below by April 22, 2022:Thank you
for your attention to these important issues and for your efforts to ensure the
safe and successful administration of our elections. We look forward to your
response.

https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-thune-raise-alarm-on-biden-administration-using-financial-system-to-advance-extreme-environmental-agenda-putting-ag-industry-at-risk,"April 08, 2022WASHINGTON – This week, U.S. Senators Roy Blunt (Mo.)
and John Thune (S.D.) led 9 of their Senate Republican colleagues in sending a
letter to President Biden to raise concerns over the administration’s use of
the financial regulatory system to advance its extreme environmental agenda
under the guise of mitigating banks’ and credit unions’ exposure to climate
risks.“The viability of farms and ranches across the nation are
essential to the viability of rural America and our nation’s food security,” the
senators wrote. “That is why the rhetoric and actions taken by your
administration to use the financial regulatory system as a back-door approach
to set agriculture policy and advance such overreach is so concerning, as this
downward pressure from Washington bureaucrats is not only felt by Wall Street
firms, but by our nation’s smallest banks and credit unions as well.”The senators emphasized that the administration’s current
efforts could harm farmers’ and ranchers’ access to capital and compromise our
nation’s food security.The senators continued, “We believe banks and credit
unions are well positioned to continue responsibly serving their farm and ranch
clients, many of which they have served for decades. Any reduction in lending
by banks and credit unions to the agriculture sector – or to any sector that is
disliked by its political opponents – would not only harm the businesses themselves,
but directly harm consumers due to increased costs of food and energy that
would inevitably occur as a result of reduced supply. Further, increasingly
onerous federal policies will undercut the agriculture industry’s voluntary
investments to deepen their ongoing stewardship of natural resources.”In addition to Blunt and Thune, the letter was signed by
U.S. Senators Richard Burr (N.C.), John Cornyn (Texas), Ted Cruz (Texas), Deb
Fischer (Neb.), Josh Hawley (Mo.), John Hoeven (N.D.), Roger Marshall (Kan.),
Mike Rounds (S.D.), and Marco Rubio (Fla.).

https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-heinrichs-recovering-americas-wildlife-act-passes-out-of-senate-committee,"April 07, 2022WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Roy Blunt (Mo.) and Martin
Heinrich (N.M.) today announced that their bipartisan Recovering
America’s Wildlife Act is one step closer to becoming law.Today,
the landmark conservation legislation was voted out of the U.S. Senate
Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW) with bipartisan support. The
legislation now heads to the Senate floor for consideration. The House bill
advanced out of the House Natural Resources Committee in January.Blunt
and Heinrich held a conference call for reporters to discuss the progress. A
recording of their remarks can be found HERE.“Protecting
habitats and wildlife is not only important to states like Missouri – with some
of the best hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation in the country – it’s
important to communities all across the nation,” said Blunt. “By
encouraging states, territories, and Tribes to make significant contributions
to voluntary conservation efforts, we can preserve our nation’s wildlife for
future generations. I would like to thank the Environment and Public Works
Committee for advancing RAWA, and I will continue working with my friend
Senator Heinrich to get this landmark legislation to the president’s desk.”“The
outdoors have once again proven to be a real uniting force. I’m so proud of the
bipartisan leadership and widespread support that is moving the Recovering
America’s Wildlife Act forward. Senator Blunt has been a great partner and EPW
Chairman Tom Carper and Ranking Member Shelley Moore Capito helped us advance
this landmark conservation legislation. I am confident that if we can keep up
our momentum, we will pass this bill through the full Senate with broad,
bipartisan support,” 















said
Heinrich, member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.  “Without enough resources, state,
and Tribal wildlife agencies have been forced to pick and choose which species
are worth saving. Instead of doing the proactive work that is necessary to
maintain healthy wildlife populations on the front end, they have been forced
into using reactive measures to rescue species after they are listed as
threatened or endangered. We urgently need to change this paradigm and save
thousands of species with a solution that matches the magnitude of the
challenge. The Recovering America’s Wildlife Act offers us a constructive path
forward. Passing RAWA into law will mean our grandchildren will be able to
experience the same rich and abundant American wildlife—from bumblebees to
bison—that we have been so lucky to grow up with.”“Today,
our committee took a step forward in advancing impactful, bipartisan
conservation legislation,” said EPW Chairman Tom Carper (Del.). “The
Recovering America’s Wildlife Act seeks to address the pervasive and growing
threat of biodiversity loss, which scientists warn could dramatically worsen in
the years ahead without action. I appreciate the strong leadership that
Senators Heinrich, Blunt, and Capito demonstrated as our committee contemplated
this legislation, and I look forward to working with them, and other
proponents, to find a way to pay for this important investment and to take
additional action to stem our biodiversity loss crisis. Much like successful
species conservation, legislating is a shared responsibility.""“An integral part of West Virginia is our natural landscape and native
wildlife,” said EPW Ranking Member Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.). “I was
proud to support the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act, which will provide a
historic investment to help states with their species recovery efforts. I thank
my colleagues, Senators Blunt and Heinrich, for leading this legislation to
provide our state fish and wildlife agencies with more resources to conserve
at-risk species.”
Blunt and Heinrich’s legislation invests in proactive, on-the-ground
conservation work led by states, territories, and Tribal nations to support the
long-term health of fish and wildlife and their habitat all across America.
These locally-driven, science-based strategies would restore populations of
species with the greatest conservation need.Since
introduction in July 2021, the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act has gained
significant momentum with 32 bipartisan sponsors and cosponsors, and is backed
by over 60 Tribes and 1,500 organizations representing state fish and wildlife
agencies, sportsmen and women, conservation groups, and industry associations
and businesses.Additional

joined a bipartisan group of his colleagues in introducing legislation to help
police, fire, emergency medical, and 911 personnel cope with the stresses of
responding to crisis situations. The Fighting Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
Act of 2022 would establish mental health programs for America’s first
responders who often face long-term effects from providing life-saving services
in moments of crisis.“First responders face incredibly dangerous and stressful
situations every day,” said Blunt. “As a mental health advocate and
co-chair of the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus, I’m proud to introduce this
legislation to establish mental health programs tailored to the unique needs of
first responders. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill
to ensure the men and women who risk their lives to save others are able to get
the care they need.”“In times of crisis, we count on first responders and
dispatchers to deliver life-saving aid – often at their own exposure to
tremendous risk,” said U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (Iowa). “Beyond the
physical scars, this essential service can also take a mental and emotional
toll. This bill takes an essential step toward ensuring that the brave
individuals who respond in critical situations have access to mental health
services needed to manage stress, stay healthy and continue to serve our
communities.”Police officers, firefighters, emergency medical
technicians, and 911 dispatchers routinely encounter high-stress situations,
putting them at risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which
increases the risk of suicide. The Fighting Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Act
would require the Justice Department to establish evidence-based treatment
programs for first responders across the country, similar to services available
to military personnel who develop PTSD or acute stress disorders. The bill requires
the Justice Department to consult with stakeholders, including public safety
officer organizations, in developing the program, which would be available to
serve first responders in communities of all sizes across the country.The Fighting Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Act is supported
by the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the International
Association of Fire Chiefs, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the Major
County Sheriffs of America, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, and the
Sergeants Benevolent Association NYPD.In addition to Blunt and Grassley, the bill was introduced
by U.S. Senators Chris Coons (Del.), Todd Young (Ind.), Maggie Hassan (N.H.),
Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), and Sherrod Brown (Ohio).

https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-klobuchar-peters-portman-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-ensure-congressional-cybersecurity-defenders-receive-timely-cybersecurity-information,"April 06, 2022WASHINGTON – Yesterday, U.S. Senators Roy Blunt (Mo.) and Amy
Klobuchar (Minn.), Ranking Member and Chairwoman of the Committee on Rules and
Administration, and Gary Peters (Mich.) and Rob Portman (Ohio), Chairman and
Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee,
introduced the bipartisan Intragovernmental Cybersecurity Information Sharing
Act to ensure sharing of cybersecurity information between operational
cybersecurity staff in the Executive Branch and the Senate and House of
Representatives. This legislation will ensure that cybersecurity defenders in
Congress are able to work collaboratively and directly with cybersecurity
defenders in the Executive Branch and will require regular reporting to
Congress on the status of implementation. The legislation would ensure the
Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate and the Chief Administrative
Officer of the House of Representatives receive direct, timely, and actionable
cybersecurity information from the Executive Branch. “The
federal government faces more cyberattacks from more directions than ever
before,” said Blunt. “This legislation will help ensure Congress’s
cybersecurity professionals have access to the timely and sensitive information
they need to better protect the House and Senate from the alarming rise in
cyberattacks.”“Cybersecurity
threats against our government require a timely, coordinated response. Yet too
often a lack of communication between the Department of Homeland Security and
Congress leaves us vulnerable to damaging cyberattacks,” said Klobuchar.
“This bipartisan legislation will better protect us against cyberattacks by
requiring the Department of Homeland Security to increase cybersecurity
information sharing with Congress.”“Foreign
adversaries, like the Russian government, and cybercriminals continue to target
our nation’s most essential public and private networks. That is why our
different branches of government must work together to bolster the security of
all federal systems, including those in Congress, that store a considerable
amount of sensitive information,” said Peters. “This commonsense,
bipartisan bill will make sure that professionals in charge of securing House
and Senate networks are working closely with our nation’s lead cybersecurity
agencies to address online threats.”“As
we have recently seen, cyberattacks are increasing against our critical
infrastructure as well as the federal government. Unfortunately, some of the
cybersecurity professionals in Congress have faced lengthy delays in getting
information on cybersecurity threats from the Executive Branch. That should not
be the case,” said Portman. “Our cyber adversaries move quickly and do
not distinguish between branches of government—we need a unified and
coordinated defense. That is why we have introduced this bipartisan legislation
requiring the Department of Homeland Security to enter cybersecurity
information-sharing agreements with the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate and
Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives.”

https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-coons-introduce-bill-to-renew-protections-for-child-abuse-victims,"March 31, 2022WASHINGTON –
Today, U.S. Senators Roy Blunt (Mo.) and Chris Coons (Del.), co-chairs of the
Senate Law Enforcement Caucus, introduced bipartisan legislation to reauthorize
the Victims of Child Abuse Act (VOCAA). The law, first enacted in 1990,
provides the only dedicated source of funding for Children’s Advocacy Centers,
which bring together teams of law enforcement, medical personnel, and service
providers to ensure the best outcome for child victims and help hold
perpetrators responsible for their crimes. Companion legislation will soon be
introduced in the House by U.S. Representatives Jim Costa (Calif.), Brian
Fitzpatrick (Pa.), and Ann Wagner (Mo.).“In 2021, Children’s Advocacy Centers served nearly 10,000
of Missouri’s most vulnerable children,” said
Blunt. “Reauthorizing this program will provide much-needed resources to
help Children’s Advocacy Centers and law enforcement coordinate the investigation,
treatment, and prosecution of child abuse cases. I urge all of my colleagues to
support this bipartisan bill to help keep kids safe and bring perpetrators to
justice.”“The Victims of Child Abuse Act protects children who have
been abused and brings their abusers to justice,” said Coons. “The law provides resources for Children’s Advocacy
Centers that provide a safe and supportive space for these children and help
law enforcement conduct investigations faster, more efficiently, and at lower
cost. I hope Republicans and Democrats can come together once again to extend
and expand this critical program.”“National Children’s Alliance not only thanks Senators Coons
and Blunt for their leadership in introducing the Victims of Child Abuse Act
Reauthorization Act of 2022, but also in leading the charge for Children’s
Advocacy Centers on Capitol Hill,” said
Teresa Huizar, Chief Executive Officer of National Children’s Alliance. “By
reauthorizing and updating the Act to help better provide for the needs of the
kids and families we serve in our centers, Congress once again demonstrates it
believes and values the effectiveness of the Children’s Advocacy Center model
in helping abused children find healing and justice when they need it most.”Senators Blunt and Coons have previously succeeded in
reauthorizing the Victims of Child Abuse Act, first in 2014 and again in 2018.
VOCAA programs are now set to expire next year without reauthorization, so it
must again be extended by Congress.One of VOCAA’s key components is to fund Children’s Advocacy
Centers, which provide a skilled team of trained professionals to conduct
forensic interviews of children who have been victims of abuse. Such interviews
are intended to be used as evidence in court while also preventing children
from being required to repeat their accounts multiple times. Children’s
Advocacy Centers allow for faster criminal charging decisions in sexual abuse
cases, increased felony prosecutions of child sexual abuse, and lower average
case costs.In addition to Blunt and Coons, cosponsors include U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (Ill.), Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), John
Cornyn (Texas), Mazie Hirono (Hawaii), Todd Young (Ind.), Dianne Feinstein
(Calif.), Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), and Roger Wicker (Miss.). The bill has garnered widespread support from law
enforcement groups, including the Fraternal Order of Police, National District
Attorneys Association, National Association of Police Organizations, Major
County Sheriffs of America, Major Cities Chiefs Association, and Sergeants
Benevolent Association NYPD. The bill is also endorsed by child advocacy groups,
including the National Children’s Alliance, National Children’s Advocacy
Center, Northeast Regional Children’s Advocacy Center, Midwest Regional
Children’s Advocacy Center, Western Regional Children’s Advocacy Center, and
Southern Regional Children’s Advocacy Center.

Roy Blunt (Mo.) helped introduce the Baltic Defense and Deterrence Act,
bipartisan and bicameral legislation to effectively codify the Baltic Security
Initiative effort and create a complementary initiative at the U.S. Department
of State. Jointly, these two efforts will enhance and strengthen U.S. security
and economic cooperation with the Baltic countries - Latvia, Estonia and
Lithuania - amid Russia’s continued aggression in Eastern Europe and heightened
tensions with China.“Vladimir
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is an assault against democracy in Europe and
across the globe,” said Blunt. “This bipartisan bill will enhance our
nation’s military and economic ties with the Baltics, strengthening our
steadfast defensive military commitment to them at this critical moment. As a
strong advocate for NATO and the Baltics, I urge my colleagues to support this
bill and other efforts to further unify the U.S. and our allies against
authoritarian nations that seek to undermine democracy around the world.”The
FY22 government funding bill, which Blunt supported and was signed into law
this month, provided $180 million for the Baltic Security Initiative. In
addition, the legislation included $13.6 billion in humanitarian, military, and
economic support for Ukraine:Blunt
previously joined 31 of his Senate Republican colleagues in introducing
the Never Yielding Europe's Territory (NYET) Act to
provide critical support to Ukraine while imposing real costs on the Kremlin
for its aggression. Earlier
this month, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution condemning Vladimir
Putin as a war criminal.During
a congressional delegation trip to Estonia in 2015, Blunt met
with Air Force Reservists from the 442nd Fighter Wing, based at Whiteman Air
Force Base in Missouri, who were training with NATO allies as part of Operation
Atlantic Resolve.
The
Baltic Defense and Deterrence Act was led by U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (Ill.)
and Chuck Grassley (Iowa). U.S. Representatives Ruben Gallego (Ariz.) and Don
Bacon (Neb.) introduced companion legislation in the House."

Senators Roy Blunt (Mo.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), along with U.S.
Representatives Robert Aderholt (Ala.) and Adam Smith (Wash.), co-chairs of the
bipartisan Congressional Adoption Caucus, led a bipartisan, bicameral group of
73 colleagues in urging the Biden administration to take immediate action to
unite Ukrainian children going through the adoption process with American
adoptive or host families.The lawmakers specifically called
on the Biden administration to identify the approximately 300 Ukrainian
children waiting to join American adoptive or host families and work with the
Ukrainian government to find a way forward to allow children with in-process
adoptions to travel to stay with host families in the United States instead of
requiring these children to remain in other locations for displaced persons in
Europe or in Ukraine.“We write to advocate for
immediately uniting American host families with Ukrainian children who are
engaged in the adoption process, based on the shared belief that every child
deserves a safe, stable, and loving place to call home,” the lawmakers wrote to
Secretary of State Antony Blinken. “Regardless of where children are within the
adoption process, protecting vulnerable children should remain a top priority
for Ukraine and the United States.”“American families seeking to
adopt or be host families for a Ukrainian child are eager to welcome these
children into their home and provide the affection, stability, and safety all
children deserve,” the lawmakers continued. “As you continue to lead the United
States’ diplomatic response to the invasion of Ukraine, we request that you
raise our concerns regarding these children in institutionalized care to the
highest levels of our diplomatic engagement, so that they are prioritized in
protection and response measures.”As chairs of the Congressional
Adoption Caucus, Blunt and Klobuchar have long worked to help American families
looking to adopt children from overseas. Last May, they reintroduced bipartisan
legislation to improve the intercountry adoption process. In 2020, Blunt and
Klobuchar urged the Trump administration to use all available resources to
ensure that intercountry adoptions proceed in a safe and timely manner during
the coronavirus pandemic.In addition to Blunt and
Klobuchar, the letter was signed by U.S. Senators John Thune (S.D.), Chuck

immediately uniting American host families with Ukrainian children who are
already engaged in the adoption process, based on the shared belief that every
child deserves a safe, stable, and loving place to call home.There are approximately 300
Ukrainian children who are waiting to join their American adoptive families or
host families. Regardless of where children are within the adoption process,
protecting vulnerable children should remain a top priority for Ukraine and the
United States.We urge the State Department to
take the following actions to protect these children from harm and trauma,
including trafficking:Many of these children may be
appropriately given refuge in neighboring countries. However, we believe that
in the unique circumstances where children already have established
relationships with families in the United States, it is appropriate to
prioritize allowing these children to stay with host families to ensure the
child’s safety and stability.While we recognize that the
adoption process should only be advanced where it is safe, ethical, and
appropriate to do so, American families seeking to adopt or be host families
for a Ukrainian child are eager to welcome these children into their home and provide
the affection, stability, and safety all children deserve. As you continue to
lead the United States’ diplomatic response to the invasion of Ukraine, we
request that you raise our concerns regarding these children in
institutionalized care to the highest levels of our diplomatic engagement, so
that they are prioritized in protection and response measures.We appreciate the efforts of your
Department and those of our allies in working to protect those that flee
violence. Thank you for your consideration of these important objectives and
for the Office of Children's Issues commitment to supporting vulnerable
children in Ukraine. We look forward to working with you on this urgent issue.

Madeleine Albright:“Secretary Albright broke barriers and made a difference.
After serving as Secretary of State, she continued to be an important voice in
our foreign policy discussions. Only a couple of years ago, I was able to see
how much she was respected by her former foreign minister colleagues when I
spoke to them at a meeting they had at the Truman Library in Kansas City. She
was incredibly involved in the Truman Scholarship Program and that sometimes
led to a discussion of her working at the Rolla Daily News when her husband was
stationed at Fort Leonard Wood. I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to
hear her insight and perspective over the years.”

https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-wyden-bill-to-strengthen-protections-for-small-rural-tv-stations-clears-committee,"March 23, 2022WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Roy Blunt (Mo.) and Ron
Wyden (Ore.) today announced that their bipartisan Low Power Protection Act has
passed the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The
bill would strengthen spectrum rights for certain low power television (LPTV)
stations, which fill important gaps in broadcast service, particularly in those
rural communities outside the reach of a full power signal.“Local
television stations play a unique and valuable role in their communities, from
broadcasting life-saving weather alerts to providing a wide range of
entertainment options,” said Blunt. “This legislation would help make
sure smaller stations, especially those in rural Missouri, can continue
providing coverage that people depend on. I’m encouraged by the bipartisan
support we have for the bill and hope to see it considered by the Senate soon.”“Yesterday’s
advancement of the Low Power Protection Act was an important step towards
providing diverse, locally oriented broadcasting in rural and remote
communities in Oregon and across the country,"" said Wyden.
""I’ll continue to work alongside my friend, Senator Roy Blunt, to empower
LPTV stations that serve their communities by getting this bill across the
finish line.”LPTV
stations usually provide locally-oriented or specialized service in their
communities. However, LPTV is currently considered a secondary broadcast
service by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). As such, LPTV licensees
are not granted protections from harmful interference or displacement, and must
accept harmful interference or displacement from full power television
stations.In
1999, in an effort to protect LPTV stations from harmful interference or
displacement during the transition from analog to digital broadcasting,
Congress passed the Community Broadcaster Protection Act (CBPA). The law
created the “Class A” station status, and opened a one-time filing window for
stations to apply. CBPA directed that Class A licensees be subject to the same
license terms and renewal standards as full power television licensees, and
that Class A licensees be accorded primary status as television broadcasters as
long as they continue to meet the requirements set forth in the statute.
Blunt
and Wyden’s Low Power Protection Act would require the FCC to open a new filing
window during which qualifying LPTV stations could apply for and receive Class
A status. Class A status will protect LPTV stations from being bumped off-air
by harmful interference. That, in turn, will help ensure they are able to
continue providing local coverage, and allow them to better protect existing
investment and incentivize further investment in their stations and
communities."
https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-commends-4-million-grant-for-st-louis-area-transit-services,"March 21, 2022WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.), a member of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, commended the U.S. Department of Transportation's announcement that
$4.1 million in FY2021 Grants for Buses and Bus Facilities Program funds have
been awarded to the Bi-State Development Agency of the Missouri-Illinois
Metropolitan District. The grant funding was included in the Blunt-backed Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.""Maintaining
a safe, reliable, and efficient bus system in the St. Louis area is essential
for people to get where they need to go -- whether it's work, a doctor's
appointment, or the grocery store,"" said Blunt. ""It's also an
important factor in deciding where to start or grow a business. Investing in
critical transportation needs, as this targeted grant funding does, will help
create more economic opportunities and improve the quality of life for local
families.""""Everyone
in St. Louis deserves access to reliable, healthy, and safe public
transportation,"" said U.S. Representative Cori Bush (Mo.). ""When I
worked in child care, I would begin my bus journey at 6AM to arrive at work by
9 AM. I wasn't alone -- we know that Black workers are 3-times more likely to
not own a car and depend on public transit. By investing in comprehensive
public transportation, we can connect our communities, cut down on traffic, and
tackle the climate crisis -- all at once. I'm thrilled to see St. Louis receive
this funding, and look forward to riding one of the new buses as soon as they
hit our roads.""
The Grants for Buses and Bus Facilities Competitive Program makes federal resources
available to states and direct recipients to replace, rehabilitate, and
purchase buses and related equipment, or to construct bus-related facilities,
including technological changes or innovations to modify low or no emission
vehicles or facilities. Funding is provided through formula allocations and
competitive grants.

https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-klobuchar-bipartisan-bill-to-restore-brand-usa-signed-into-law,"March 17, 2022WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators Roy Blunt (Mo.) and
Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) announced that their bipartisan legislation to provide
support for Brand USA, a public-private partnership that promotes international
travel to the United States, was signed into law. The legislation will
help Brand USA promote the U.S. to international visitors by allowing the
program to access $250 million in critical resources. The law passed the House
and Senate last week as part of the omnibus government funding package. “The
last two years have been incredibly tough for the hundreds of thousands of
Missourians whose livelihoods depend on the travel and tourism industry,” said
Blunt. “As the industry bounces back from the pandemic, restoring support
for Brand USA will help bring more international travelers to attractions,
restaurants, and hotels across our state. I’m proud of all Missouri has to
offer business and leisure travelers alike, and I’ll continue advocating for
policies and programs that will boost travel and tourism in our state and
across the nation.”“Travel
and tourism powers economic growth in communities in Minnesota and across our
country,” said Klobuchar. “Now that the Restoring Brand USA Act has been
signed into law,  Brand USA will have the resources it needs to continue
attracting international visitors and supporting local tourism
businesses.” As
co-chairs of the Senate Travel and Tourism Caucus, Blunt and Klobuchar have
long championed efforts to support tourism as a key to driving economic growth.
Along with Senators Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.) and Kevin Cramer (N.D.), they
led
the Sustaining Tourism Enterprises During the COVID–19 Pandemic Act, which was
signed into law. This bipartisan bill provides economic support for
organizations involved in promoting and hosting tourism and travel.
Additionally, in 2019, Blunt and Klobuchar led successful efforts to
reauthorize Brand USA through 2027. 
Brand
USA, which is funded by international visitors and private contributions, has
generated $56 billion to the U.S. economy since 2013 and has historically
supported more than 45,000 jobs each year. However, the partnership has lost
significant funding as a result of the drop in international visitors due to
pandemic travel restrictions. "

rest of their lives, I hope this plaque lets them know that his courage and
dedicated service will never be forgotten.” “Officer
Evans gave his life to defend our nation’s Capitol – the heart of our
democracy,” said Klobuchar. “Billy Evans was a patriot and we are
forever grateful for his 18 years of service on the Capitol Police force. May
his legacy continue to inspire all who visit the Capitol he protected and
cherished for years to come.” Officer
Evans, an 18-year veteran of the Capitol Police and member of the First

U.S. Senators Roy Blunt (Mo.), a member of the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence, Jim Risch (Idaho), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, and Jim Inhofe (Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, along with 46 of their Senate Republican colleagues, released the
following statement informing the Biden administration that they will not
support the revived Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran, which,
according to public reports, will weaken sanctions and lessen restrictions on
Iran’s nuclear program:“According to press reports, the Biden Administration may
soon conclude an agreement with Iran to provide substantial sanctions relief in
exchange for merely short-term limitations on Iran’s nuclear program.“By every indication, the Biden Administration appears to
have given away the store. The administration appears to have agreed to lift
sanctions that were not even placed on Iran for its nuclear activities in the
first place, but instead because of its ongoing support for terrorism and its
gross abuses of human rights. The nuclear limitations in this new deal appear
to be significantly less restrictive than the 2015 nuclear deal, which was
itself too weak, and will sharply undermine U.S. leverage to secure an actually
‘longer and stronger’ deal. What is more, the deal appears likely to deepen
Iran’s financial and security relationship with Moscow and Beijing, including
through arms sales.“The administration has thus far refused to commit to submit
a new Iran deal to the Senate for ratification as a treaty, as per its
constitutional obligation, or for review under statutory requirements that
passed on a bipartisan basis in response to the 2015 deal. Additionally,
despite earlier promises to the contrary, the administration has failed to
adequately consult with Congress.“Republicans have made it clear: We would be willing and
eager to support an Iran policy that completely blocks Iran’s path to a nuclear
weapons capability, constrains Iran’s ballistic missile program, and confronts
Iran’s support for terrorism. But if the administration agrees to a deal that
fails to achieve these objectives or makes achieving them more difficult,
Republicans will do everything in our power to reverse it. Unless Iran ceases
its support for terrorism, we will oppose removing and seek to reimpose any
terrorism-related sanctions. And we will force the Senate to vote on any
Administration effort to do so.“We strongly urge the administration, our Democrat
colleagues, and the international community to learn the lessons of the very
recent past. A major agreement that does not have strong bipartisan support in
Congress will not survive.”In addition to Blunt, Risch, and Inhofe, the statement was
signed by U.S. Senators Mitch McConnell (Ky.), John Thune (S.D.), John Barrasso
(Wyo.), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Rick Scott (Fla.), Marco Rubio (Fla.), Pat Toomey

Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and
Related Agencies, and Richard Burr (N.C.), Ranking Member of the Senate Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, sent a letter calling on U.S.
Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to provide a detailed plan on
how the administration is utilizing the billions of dollars Congress provided
to help keep schools open. Despite the high vaccination rate among teachers,
ample federal funding, and CDC-backed prevention strategies, a growing number
of universities and K-12 schools have unnecessarily shifted to remote learning
in light of the omicron variant.

“Over the past several weeks, numerous colleges and universities have gone back
to remote learning, including Georgetown University, Yale University, and Duke University.
Further, more than 5,400 K-12 schools across the country have closed their
physical building for one day or more in the first week of 2022, including
districts in Chicago, the third largest school system in the country,
Cleveland, Newark, Detroit, and Milwaukee. These preemptive school closures are
unnecessary, especially given the high vaccination rate of teachers and the
layered prevention strategies recommended by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), including the test-to-stay program,” the senators
wrote.

The senators note that funding isn’t an obstacle to keeping schools open as
Congress has provided more than $266 billion for K-12 schools and institutions
of higher education over the last two years. 

The senators continued, “What concerns us is that, as of December 30,
2021, 86 percent of funding remains unspent by K-12 school districts and 36
percent remains unspent by colleges and universities. With more than $266
billion specifically appropriated for K-12 schools, colleges, and universities
to ensure the continuity of learning during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and
more than $191 billion currently available, where is the disconnect between the
Department and schools? … We have appreciated your past efforts to keep schools
open, but clearly more must be done. It is important for Congress, and the
American people, to have a clear understanding of the administration’s strategy
and a full accounting of how the Department of Education is using taxpayer
funding.”

Merkley (Ore.) sent a letter requesting more information from U.S. Customs and
Border Protection (CBP) on the use of facial recognition technology to collect
biometric data from U.S. citizens for entry-exit programs at airports,
seaports, and land borders.In a letter sent to CBP Commissioner Chris Magnus, Blunt and
Merkley urged the agency for more transparency surrounding this program to help
ensure American travelers understand the process and their right to opt out of
the use of biometric facial recognition technology during reentry to the
country. CBP uses the technology to capture biometric data in all but 40
airports, impacting thousands of travelers a day. Blunt and Merkley are urging
the CBP to be more transparent in the way it informs citizens about their right
to opt out of the use of biometric facial recognition technology when collecting
identification information at our borders to ensure a safe, equitable, and
accurate process for Americans.“While it is now common for American citizens to be told
their photo will be taken in order to proceed through the customs process,
countless Americans are not adequately informed about their ability to opt out
of this step,” the senators wrote. “Every U.S. citizen should have the
opportunity to make an informed decision whether to have their passport photo
manually verified by a CBP officer instead of having their biometric data
collected and stored in a manner with which they are not familiar.”
“Further, as you know, facial recognition technology is not
perfect. There have been reports that people of color and women are more likely
to be misidentified by this technology,” they continued. “While we understand
that CBP uses a distinct methodology that only compares biometric data against
manifest data, we would like more information about the process for individuals
who are flagged by this system. Every American deserves the same right to
privacy and should not undergo drastically different airport processing
experiences. Any use of biometric facial recognition technology by CBP should
come with policies to ensure that flagged individuals are treated in a safe,
fair, and noninvasive manner given the imperfection of facial recognition
software.”Blunt and Merkley have asked the following questions for
clarification, requesting answers by February 11, 2022:

https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-moran-demand-hhs-reverse-flawed-liver-allocation-policy,"December 21, 2021
WASHINGTON ­– Today, U.S. Senators Roy Blunt
(Mo.) and Jerry Moran (Kan.) issued the following statement in response to
the release of documents, including emails between the United Network for Organ
Sharing (UNOS) and organ procurement organizations,
regarding the national liver allocation policy. The emails released are
in response to a November 17, 2021, United States Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit ruling against UNOS, the Department of Health and Human
Services’ contractor for organ procurement and transplantation. The Court
found that UNOS “repeatedly failed to live up to its production obligations” to
release documents in ongoing litigation and the Court acknowledged these
documents show “personal opinions about the relative merits of living in
different regions of the United States.” 

 

“These newly-released emails are disgusting and absolutely
unacceptable. They show clear collusion by UNOS and several organ procurement
organizations prior to the liver allocation policy being announced, leaving no
doubt that the liver allocation policy must be overturned,” the senators said.
“From the time the changes to the national liver allocation policy were first
announced three years ago, we raised the alarm about the major flaws in the
policymaking process. UNOS
overruled the expert Liver and Intestine Committee, excluded certain
public comments in the deliberations, and arrived at an outcome that was
radically different from the decision previously reached. What we learned today
is that the process was not simply flawed, it was deliberately designed to deny
patients in the South and Midwest their fair chance at a lifesaving liver
transplant.

 


The emails show a pattern of collusion between UNOS, a New
England-area organ procurement organization, and others prior to the changes in the liver
allocation policy being announced. The changes favored certain states at the
expense of states in the South and Midwest, which are predicted to see a
substantial decrease in organ availability. The emails further include profane
and disparaging comments about people living in the South, demonstrating a
clear bias against these areas in the policymaking process. 

 


The senators continued, “UNOS tried to use the legal system to cover their tracks.
Thankfully they were unsuccessful and their callous arrogance has now been laid
bare. We have repeatedly said the process and policy for determining liver
allocations needs to be made fairly and transparently. Neither UNOS nor
the Department of Health and Human Services have lived up to this
standard. These emails perfectly illustrate our biggest fears
and what we’ve known all along – that the process is totally biased and
fundamentally flawed. We demand that the Department of Health and Human
Services immediately reverse its implementation of the misguided liver
allocation policy.”

 
Since the initial allocation decision was made in December
2018, Blunt and Moran have repeatedly pressed HHS to review the liver
allocation policymaking process and HHS’ oversight of the program and its
contractor, UNOS:

https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-wyden-introduce-bill-to-strengthen-protections-for-small-rural-tv-stations,"December 20, 2021WASHINGTON –
U.S. Senators Roy Blunt (Mo.) and Ron Wyden (Ore.) today announced that they
have introduced the Low Power Protection Act. The bill would strengthen
spectrum rights for certain low power television (LPTV) stations, which fill
important gaps in broadcast service, particularly in those rural communities
outside the reach of a full power signal.“Local television
stations play a unique and critical role in their communities, keeping viewers
informed, entertained, and alerted in an emergency,” said Blunt. “The Low Power
Protection Act would help ensure smaller stations, especially those in
Missouri’s rural areas, are able to continue providing coverage that people
depend on. I appreciate Senator Wyden’s partnership in this effort and the
strong support the bill has received from local, state, and national
broadcasters. I look forward to continuing to work together to advance the
bill.”“Low power
television stations provide diverse, locally-oriented broadcasting in small
communities across Oregon, especially in rural and remote areas of our
state,"" said Wyden. ""I’m proud to join my colleague Senator Blunt in introducing
this common-sense, bipartisan bill to empower LPTV stations that serve their
communities.”LPTV
stations usually provide locally-oriented or specialized service in their
communities. However, LPTV is currently considered a secondary broadcast service
by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). As such, LPTV licensees are not
granted protections from harmful interference or displacement, and must accept
harmful interference or displacement from full power television stations.In 1999, in an
effort to protect LPTV stations from harmful interference or displacement
during the transition from analog to digital broadcasting, Congress passed the
Community Broadcaster Protection Act (CBPA). The law created the “Class A”
station status, and opened a one-time filing window for stations to apply. CBPA
directed that Class A licensees be subject to the same license terms and
renewal standards as full power television licensees, and that Class A
licensees be accorded primary status as television broadcasters as long as they
continue to meet the requirements set forth in the statute.Blunt and
Wyden’s Low Power Protection Act would require the FCC to open a new filing
window during which qualifying LPTV stations could apply for and receive Class
A status. Class A status will protect LPTV stations from being bumped off-air
by harmful interference. That, in turn, will help ensure they are able to
continue providing local coverage, and allow them to better protect existing
investment and incentivize further investment in their stations and
communities.The bill has
garnered widespread support from numerous broadcast organizations and advocacy
groups:“The LPTV
Broadcasters Association is grateful to Senators Blunt and Wyden for
introducing The Low Power Protection Act. The LPTV Broadcaster’s Association
strongly endorses the bill. It is an essential, meaningful initiative to serve
the public interest. The Act is cited as “The Low Power Protection Act” and a
key word is ‘protection.’ Much attention has been given to encouraging support
for local journalism and jobs, and protecting television stations for the
viewers they serve. Secure, trusted local news and culturally diverse content
is the foundation of the programming that our members uniquely broadcast on a
daily basis. Simply stated, this bill allows LPTV stations to grow to the next
level in serving the public interest with both protection of broadcast coverage
area and the ability to secure crucial small business financing. The LPTV
Broadcasters Association on behalf of its members around the country is
committed to seeing this legislation be passed.” – Frank Copsidas, Founder and
President, LPTV Broadcasters Association“NAB
applauds the introduction of the Low Power Protection Act, which would offer
some community-oriented low power television stations a long-overdue
opportunity to gain important interference protections. Millions of viewers
across the country rely on LPTVs for local news, weather, community affairs and
emergency information, particularly in rural areas and smaller markets. This
legislation would ensure Americans’ access to these vital stations and provide
assurance that their signals can remain on the air. Broadcasters thank Sens.
Wyden and Blunt for their efforts to help LPTVs and their viewers, and we
support swift passage of this bill.” – National Association of Broadcasters“Thanks to
Senator Blunt and Senator Wyden for introducing the Low Power Protection Act in
order for select low power television stations to be granted ‘Class A’ status.
This bill is necessary in states like Missouri that have a large rural
population in order to assure all viewers over the air access to local news,
weather, alerts, sports and network entertainment no matter where they live.” –
Missouri Association of Broadcasters“The Oregon
Association of Broadcasters would like to thank Senator Wyden and Senator Blunt
as co-leaders of the Low Power Protection Act. This legislation will allow many
low power television stations in rural areas to be granted ‘Class A’ status.
This bill will assure countless viewers over the air access to local news,
weather, emergency alerts, sports and network entertainment no matter where
they live. Senator Wyden continues to support local broadcasters in their quest
to provide quality service to the viewers in which they serve, keeping
communities informed and safe.” – Oregon Association of Broadcasters“Negative
portrayals of the Latinx community and the perceptions that come from them are
often due to the appallingly low levels of Latinx broadcast and media
ownership. Low power television (LPTV) broadcasters tend to provide more unique
and diverse programming directly to Latinx and marginalized communities, but
often find their frequencies assigned to larger operators that disregard
diversity. NHMC is proud to support the Low Power Protection Act–a solution
that promotes media diversity by empowering LPTV broadcasters as Class-A
licensees.” – Brenda Victoria Castillo, President and CEO, National Hispanic
Media Coalition“Low-Power
TV licensees contribute to diverse, local programming throughout the country -
from crowded urban areas to otherwise unserved rural communities. It is high
time that LPTV stations that serve their communities have the opportunity to
receive the benefits of Class A designation. This bill is long overdue, and
Public Knowledge is happy to endorse it.” – Harold Feld, Senior Vice President,

the following statement after the Bureau of Labor Statistics
released data showing that inflation has surged to a near 40-year high at 6.8%:


“The inflation data released today backs up what any
hardworking American will tell you: it is getting harder and harder to make
ends meet in the Biden economy. Missouri families are paying more for the
things they need every day – food on the table, clothes for their kids, gas to
get to work, and energy to heat their homes. Higher costs are hitting
low-income families the hardest. The last thing they can afford is more
reckless spending that will push inflation up even further, but that’s exactly
what Democrats are determined to do. 

“As Democrats continue pressing forward with their reckless
tax-and-spend spree, the Congressional Budget Office is out with a new report that shows the real
the cost of the bill could add $3 trillion to the debt over the next 10 years –
a far cry from the $0 Democrats repeatedly claimed it would cost. What’s worse,
the bill’s estimated
$4.9 trillion price tag includes tax cuts for the wealthy in places like New York and California. 

“The Biden administration inherited an economy that was already well on its way
to recovery. Despite warnings that pouring more money into the economy would fuel
inflation, they moved forward with a $1.9 trillion spending bill in March

Bustos (Ill.) and Ashley Hinson (Iowa), led a bicameral, bipartisan letter to
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to prioritize funding for construction of the
Navigation and Ecosystem Sustainability Program (NESP) on the Upper Mississippi
River System with the $2.5 billion for inland waterways provided in the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.NESP
would modernize and expand seven outdated locks at the most congested lock
locations along the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers as well as fund more
than $1 billion in ecosystem restoration. A 2019 study released by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture showed that rebuilding NESP locks would inject $72
billion additional dollars into the nation’s GDP.  “The
regional and national economic benefits of NESP are significant, which is why
the project was included in the December 2020 Inland and Intracoastal Waterways
Twenty-Year Capital Investment Strategy (CIS) developed by the Corps and the
Inland Waterways User Board (IWUB),” the lawmakers wrote. “Following the
2020 CIS including NESP construction will bring immediate financial and

https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-hawley-smith-introduce-bill-to-expand-ste-genevieve-national-historical-park-to-include-nearby-welcome-center,"December 09, 2021WASHINGTON – Today,
U.S. Senators Roy Blunt (Mo.) and Josh Hawley (Mo.), along with U.S.
Representative Jason Smith (Mo.), announced that they have introduced
legislation that would expand the boundaries of Ste. Genevieve National
Historical Park to include the Ste. Genevieve Welcome Center. Expanding the
boundaries of the park will allow the City of Ste. Genevieve to transfer
ownership of the facility to the National Park Service (NPS).

“Ste. Genevieve National Historical Park captures an early and
remarkable moment in the history of our state and nation,” said Blunt.
“This legislation supports Ste. Genevieve’s goal of expanding the boundaries of
the park to include the nearby welcome center, transferring ownership to the
National Park Service. This has been a priority for local officials and
stakeholders, and I’ll keep working to get our legislation through Congress and
to the president’s desk.”

“Ste.
Genevieve National Historical Park is a great place for Missourians, and all
Americans, to visit as a way to learn more about our state and nation’s
history,” said Hawley. “Expanding Ste. Genevieve National Historical
Park would be beneficial for our local community and add tremendous value to
the National Park Service.”

“As
the oldest settlement west of the Mississippi, Ste. Genevieve is not only a
treasure to us here in Southeast Missouri, but also part of our Missouri
heritage and early American identity,” said Smith. “By including the
nearby Welcome Center, this legislation will help the National Park Service
promote our unique history for generations to come.”

“The National Park Service has become a major asset in our community bringing
people together and highlighting our history,” said Ste. Genevieve Mayor
Paul Hassler. “Expanding the Historical District  to include the
Welcome Center continues the cooperative work between the city and NPS to
promote the amazing history we can share with the public.”

The Ste. Genevieve National Historical Park was established in November
2020. Blunt and Smith’s legislation
establishing the Ste. Genevieve National Historical Park and designating it as
a unit of the NPS was signed into law in 2018.

The village of Ste. Genevieve dates back to the early 1700s, making it
Missouri’s oldest town. It was designated as a National Historic Landmark in
1960, also making it one of the oldest National Historic Landmark districts in
the country. It is known for its centuries-old homes featuring unique French
vertical log architecture."

member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Josh Hawley (Mo.) sent a
letter to the General Services Administration (GSA) regarding oversight
failures of the Goodfellow Federal Center, in St. Louis, Mo., which exposed
workers and a childcare facility to “widespread, longstanding” contaminants
including asbestos, lead, mercury, arsenic and explosive materials. A report from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch found that GSA
officials “deliberately misled tenants about the well-documented health risks
at the Goodfellow Federal Center in north St. Louis.” As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Blunt secured
$45.8 million in FY2021 funding legislation to support the Goodfellow facility
relocation in St. Louis. In June 2020, Blunt welcomed the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
decision to relocate more than 1,000 employees to downtown St. Louis from the
Goodfellow facility.“In a letter from the U.S. Office of Special Council (OSC)
to President Biden, that office reported that officials knew about these
contaminations since at least 2002,” the senators wrote. “The OSC letter
also states that officials did not take substantial action to notify workers or
tenant agencies of the dangers and that officials issued overtly misleading
communications to employees that exhibited a ‘pattern of suppressing or
downplaying risks.’”“Federal officials should be providing proper oversight and
protection for workers, not ignoring worker safety. At a bare minimum, Missouri
workers deserve a safe work environment and honest stewardship from supervisors
and their government officials,” the senators continued.In addition to requesting proper federal oversight, Blunt
and Hawley requested answers to the following questions:

https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-stop-ghost-votes-from-impacting-ftc-rules,"December 06, 2021WASHINGTON – Last
week, U.S. Senators Roy Blunt (Mo.), Jerry Moran (Kan.), John Thune (S.D.),
Mike Lee (Utah), Ted Cruz (Texas), Cynthia Lummis (Wyo.) and Ron Johnson (Wis.)
introduced legislation that would stop votes cast by Federal Trade
Commissioners (FTC) from being counted after the commissioners have left their
post.Politico recently reported
that former Commissioner Rohit Chopra cast 20 votes on his final day on the
commission on pending motions before the FTC. According to the FTC’s
interpretation of a rule, any of the five commissioners can introduce a motion
for a vote. If no one responds, the motion fails after 30 days. However, if
another commissioner seconds it, the motion can live on for another 30 days.
This allows the votes of commissioners who have left the commission to remain
active up to 60 days after their departure.Therefore, this rule allows Chopra’s votes to be live for up
to 60 days from his last day on October 8 despite him no longer being a
commissioner.“To a cast a vote in the Federal Trade Commission, you ought
to actually be on the commission,” said
Blunt. “This zombie voting completely ignores the important role of the
Senate in the confirmation process, and it’s totally inconsistent with how
federal agencies should operate. I’m proud to join my colleagues in supporting
this bill to eliminate this unacceptable practice.”“Your last day in office is the last day your vote should
count – whether you serve on the school board or the FTC,” said Moran. “It’s absurd that votes cast by commissioners on
outstanding issues can be counted up to 60 days past their departure. This
needs to stop to protect the integrity of the commission and because it’s just
plain common sense.”“The FTC plays a critical role in ensuring there’s both
consumer protection and fair competition in the marketplace—issues of great
importance to many Americans,” said
Thune. “As the agency continues its focus on these issues, it’s imperative
that the FTC works to increase transparency and end its practice of using
‘zombie votes’ on matters before the agency.”“It’s highly disturbing and legally dubious that the Federal
Trade Commission would even use the votes of non-Commissioners in any matter
before the Commission let alone as a means to press forward on controversial
agenda items,” said Lee. “The
practice of ‘zombie voting’ is unacceptable and must be stopped.”“It defies logic that former Commissioners can keep ‘voting’
even after they’ve left the job,"" said
Cruz. ""These ‘zombie’ or ‘ghost’ votes undermine the Senate’s
constitutional advice and consent process and are a gross abuse of power, and
it is long past time we end the arcane rule that makes it possible. Sen.
Moran’s bill does just that, and I am proud to cosponsor the FTC Integrity
Act.”“It seems like common sense, but once a term has expired,
commissioners should no longer be able to cast a vote on an issue before the
Federal Trade Commission,” said Lummis.
“However, we have seen a strange phenomenon where an outgoing commissioner cast
proxy votes on future issues that came before the Commission after his term has
expired. This makes no sense. We don’t allow judges to rule on future decisions
after they have left the bench, and we should not allow FTC commissioners to
pre-cast their votes. I joined Senator Moran and my colleagues to make sure
that only those who are actively sitting on the Commission are voting on
matters before the FTC.”The senators’ bill, the FTC Integrity Act, would amend the
FTC Act to prohibit votes cast by former Commissioners from having any effect
after they leave the Commission. This would retroactively apply to any vote
taken after January 1, 2021.

https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-long-introduce-bill-to-add-elements-of-newtonia-battlefield-to-wilsons-creek-national-battlefield,"December 02, 2021WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Roy
Blunt (Mo.) and U.S. Representative Billy Long (Mo.)
introduced legislation to add elements of Newtonia
Battlefield to Wilson’s Creek National Battlefield, a unit of the National Park
Service (NPS). The bill would expand the boundaries of Wilson’s Creek National
Battlefield to include acres that are relevant to the Newtonia Battlefield
site. U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (Mo.) is an original cosponsor of the
bill.

“Newtonia Battlefield would be a valuable addition to
the National Park System,” said Blunt. “As the site of two Civil War
battles, including the last major engagement fought in Missouri, the history of
Newtonia is important to gaining a better understanding of the deadliest war in
U.S. history and how it impacted our state and nation. Making Newtonia
Battlefield a part of the National Park Service has long been a priority for
the local community, which has spent years – and significant resources – to
preserve the site. As a former history teacher, I’m proud to support efforts to
help ensure future generations can visit the battlefield and learn more about
its unique history.”

“Today,
I introduced in the House a bill that would allow the Department of Interior to
increase the size of Wilson’s Creek National Battlefield,” said Long. “These
additional 624 acres contain historical relevance to the Battle of Newtonia and
should be included in the battlefield. The American people deserve to know the
history of our Civil War and visiting the battlefields that helped shape our
nation is an important way to learn our history firsthand. I am proud to be
introducing this bill with Senators Blunt and Hawley in an effort to give the
American people the chance to see their history for themselves.”

The
bill is backed by the American Battlefield Trust and Newtonia Battlefields
Protection Association.

“To understand the full scope of American history, we must consider out
past collectively, rather than as disconnected events. Similarly, we often find
that landscapes critical to imparting the narratives central to our current
parks extend well beyond their borders. In such instances, it’s important that
strong advocates for parks and for history pursue the legislative process to
expand a park’s authorized boundary. Doing so incurs no immediate cost to the
federal government, but paves the way for opportunities that arise,” said
David Duncan, President, American Battlefield Trust. “The American
Battlefield Trust, its board and its members, are deeply appreciative for the
leadership shown by Senators Blunt and Hawley, together with Representative
Long, for taking that critical broader view of Missouri’s Civil War history and
calling for the expansion of Wilson's Creek National Battlefield to include
land associated with the two battles fought at nearby Newtonia, ensuring that a
more complete and nuanced understanding of the state’s role in that conflict
can be shared with residents and visitors alike.”

“Since
2002 Newtonia Battlefields Protection Association has been working diligently
to preserve 25 acres and the Ritchey Mansion at Newtonia. The Ritchey Mansion
served as headquarters and hospital during the 1862 and 1864 battles, which
occurred at Newtonia. There 1862 battle saw the involvement of several Native
American tribes, while the 1864 battle was one of the last battles fought west
of the Mississippi River,” said Larry A James, President, Newtonia
Battlefields Protection Association. “It has been the desire of NBPA that
this property be preserved for future generations. Becoming a part of the
National Park Service will guarantee preservation for many years to come.”

Two significant Civil War engagements were fought on
the Newtonia Battlefield. The 1862 battle was among the very few Civil War
engagements that included Native Americans fighting on both sides. The battle
at Newtonia in 1864 was the last major engagement of the Civil War in Missouri.

https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-klobuchar-introduce-children-in-family-security-act,"December 02, 2021WASHINGTON
– Today,
U.S. Senators Roy Blunt (Mo.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), co-chairs of the
Congressional Coalition on Adoption, announced that they have reintroduced the
Children in Family Security Act. The measure would help children living in
institutional care by enhancing diplomatic efforts to keep children in
families.

“Every child deserves a permanent, safe, loving home no matter where they are
born,” said Blunt. “Unfortunately, there are millions of children across the
world who are growing up without the security and stability of a family. This
bill will help children in need by enhancing diplomacy dedicated to
strengthening the family, child welfare systems abroad, and intercountry
adoption.”

“As the co-chair of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption and a senator from
Minnesota, a state with one of the highest rates of international adoption in
the country, I have seen the power of adoption firsthand,” said Klobuchar. “We
must continue to strengthen opportunities for international adoption. I’m proud
to reintroduce this legislation alongside Senator Blunt to ensure our
government is working in partnership with other countries to find children safe
and loving homes.”

Millions of children around the world are growing up in institutional care not
because it is in their best interests but because there is little or no support
system in place to help them stay in families. This bill supports diplomatic
efforts to keep children in loving families by promoting diplomacy with child
welfare systems abroad and addressing unnecessary hurdles to international
adoptions to the United States, which have drastically decreased since their
peak in the early 2000s.

The legislation is supported by the National Council for Adoption, American
Academy of Adoption Attorneys, Bethany Christian Services, Nourished Hearts,
Center for Adoption Policy, and Gladney Center for Adoption.

Hawley today sent a letter to the Veterans Administration demanding answers on
how veterans in long-term care facilities will be impacted by the COVID-19
federal vaccination mandate and what is being done to protect them.“We are concerned that implementation of these federal
vaccine mandates will cause Missouri’s long-term care facilities to lose their
status as federal contractors with the VA and jeopardize the well-being of our
veterans,” the senators wrote. “Additionally, we are concerned that
federal vaccine mandates will create staffing shortages in long-term care
facilities in Missouri, and that there will not be an open, compliant facility
with sufficient staff capacity to accept veteran patients.”In the letter, the senators cite reports that veterans could
be removed from facilities that are not compliant with vaccination mandates and
press the VA for answers on what, if any, plan is in place to ensure their
access to care.The full text of the letter is below and HERE.November 23, 2021Secretary McDonough:We write to you with concerns about the impacts of COVID-19
federal vaccine mandates on our Missouri veterans in long-term care facilities.The federal government has required COVID-19 vaccination
under Executive Order 14042, which requires federal contractors to receive the
vaccine by January 18, 2022, in addition to a mandate issued by the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requiring staff at health care facilities
to be vaccinated by January 4, 2022. Of Missouri’s 1,183 long-term care facilities,
522 participate in CMS programs, and 45 facilities contract with the Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide care for veterans who receive VA benefits.We are concerned that implementation of these federal
vaccine mandates will cause Missouri’s long-term care facilities to lose their
status as federal contractors with the VA and jeopardize the well-being of our
veterans.  Additionally, we are concerned
that federal vaccine mandates will create staffing shortages in long-term care
facilities in Missouri, and that there will not be an open, compliant facility
with sufficient staff capacity to accept veteran patients. The Missouri
Department of Health and Senior Services issued an emergency rule effective
November 5 providing for the temporary emergency closure of skilled nursing and
immediate care facilities experiencing staffing shortages as a result of
COVID-19 vaccine mandates.Our specific concerns regarding veterans in long-term care
facilities stem from VA communication with long-term care facilities on this
matter. According to news reports, email communications from the VA indicated
veterans could be removed from facilities that are not compliant with
vaccination mandates. The email notes that all federal contractors are covered
under Executive Order 14042, and that long-term care facilities are also
required to comply with the CMS vaccine mandate.In light of this information, we request the following
information by December 8th, 2021:1.    
Has the VA established a contract termination
process for facilities that are not compliant with the federal contractor
vaccine mandate in Executive Order 14042, or with the CMS vaccine mandate?
Please provide details on the nature of this process.2.    
Has the VA made a determination that veterans
will be removed from facilities that lose VA contractor status? Alternatively,
could veterans at noncompliant facilities be forced to pay out-of-pocket
expenses for services previously provided through the VA?3.    
Should veterans be removed from noncompliant
facilities by the VA, is there a plan to transition veterans to different
facilities, and has this possibility been communicated to veterans and their
families? What is the plan?4.    
As previously mentioned, the VA only contracts
with 45 long-term care facilities in the State of Missouri. Would the VA seek
contracts with additional long-term care facilities in the area to ensure that
veterans are not relocated to facilities far from their families?
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-klobuchar-introduce-bipartisan-resolution-marking-national-adoption-month,"November 17, 2021WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators Roy Blunt (Mo.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.),
co-chairs of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, announced that they have
introduced a resolution marking November as National Adoption Month and
November 20 as National Adoption Day. This is the seventh consecutive year that
Blunt and Klobuchar have led legislation to recognize National Adoption Month
and National Adoption Day.

“Every child deserves a stable, loving home and the foundation for a successful
future that it provides,” said Blunt. “As an adoptive parent myself, I’m
proud to introduce this resolution recognizing November as National Adoption
Month, and I hope it will encourage more Americans to consider expanding their
families through the gift of adoption. In the Senate, I remain committed to
working with parents, advocates, and colleagues to promote adoption and raise
awareness for the 400,000 children in our foster care system who are in need of
families.”“National Adoption Month is an opportunity to
support adoptive families who open their hearts and homes to children,” said
Klobuchar. “As Senate co-chairs of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption,
Senator Blunt and I continue to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle
to help make the adoption process better for children and families across our
country. I’ll keep working to increase awareness about the importance of
adoption and honor the dedication and commitment of adoptive families.”

For years, Blunt and Klobuchar have been leaders in the fight to give every
child a permanent home.

Provisions of Blunt and Klobuchar’s legislation to protect adopted children
from unregulated custody transfers, also known as rehoming, passed
the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions in June as
part of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act Reauthorization of 2021. 

In May, Blunt and Klobuchar reintroduced
the Intercountry Adoption Advisory Committee Act to provide the Secretary of
State with the authority to establish an Intercountry Adoption Advisory Committee
to focus on coordinating the development, refinement, and implementation of
policy and programs on intercountry adoption.

That same month, Blunt and Klobuchar led a bipartisan letter
calling on U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to engage in efforts to
resume intercountry adoptions with China, which have been indefinitely paused
due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The Intercountry Adoption Information Act, which Blunt and Klobuchar
cosponsored, was signed
into law in November 2020. The legislation helps ensure that Americans who
are trying to adopt children from other countries are provided with updated,
quality information as they navigate the intercountry adoption process.

During that same month, Blunt and Klobuchar encouraged
the Department of State and the Department of Health and Human Services to
raise awareness for National Adoption Month and for the importance of domestic
and intercountry adoption.

In October 2020, they sent a letter
urging the Department of State to prioritize policies to promote intercountry
adoption and to look specifically at the fee schedule for prospective
accrediting entities to ensure they do not impose undue financial burdens on
families seeking to adopt internationally.

In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Blunt and Klobuchar sent a letter
in April 2020 asking the Department of State to use all available resources to
ensure that intercountry adoptions proceed in a safe and timely manner during
the pandemic and that American families stranded abroad while completing these
adoptions return home safely.

Blunt and Klobuchar in May 2019 reintroduced the Supporting
Adoptive Families Act to help provide pre- and post-adoption support
services, including mental health treatment, to help adoptive families stay
strong.

Blunt and Klobuchar also partnered
on the Accuracy for Adoptees Act, which became law in early 2014. This
legislation cuts red tape for adoptive families and ensures that corrections
made to adoptees’ state vital records would be recognized by the federal
government.

of Transportation and Norfolk Southern a $17 million grant to replace the main
channel crossing of the Grand River Bridge near Brunswick.“Missouri’s
railways are an integral part of our transportation network, generating more
than $50 billion in direct economic output each year,” said Blunt. “That’s why
I’m focused on making sure our rail networks are a safe, affordable, and
reliable option for farmers and businesses to get their goods to market. This
new bridge will provide a significantly more effective crossing for a major
transportation route that has faced service disruptions. I appreciate the
Department of Transportation for making this project a priority, and I’ll
continue to working to help our state get the resources it needs to modernize
our infrastructure system.”Blunt sent a

St. Louis area have received a total of more than $33 million in RAISE grant
funding, including $18.2 million for the West Florissant Avenue Great Streets
Project and $15 million for the Brickline Greenway Project. Blunt advocated for
funding for both projects.“Investing in transportation infrastructure is one of the
most important things we can do to create a stronger foundation for economic
growth and improve the quality of life in local communities,” said Blunt.
“The West Florissant Avenue Great Streets Project and the Brickline Greenway
Project are great examples of how public-private partnerships can be leveraged
to support improvements that will have a significant, long-term impact. From
making St. Louis a more attractive place to start and grow a business, to
connecting people with career and education opportunities and promoting travel
and tourism, these investments will go a long way toward making St. Louis an
even better place to live, work, and raise a family. I was proud to advocate
for these projects and will continue working to secure federal support for
critical infrastructure priorities in our state.”Blunt’s letter of support for the Brickline Greenway project

responsiveness and accessibility across the federal government on account of
current agency work plans,” which have kept workers out of the office and have
contributed to huge delays for government services.“Businesses have now reopened, children and teachers have
returned to in-person learning, and health care and public safety workers
continue to show up for work,” the senators wrote. “Yet we continue to
hear from constituents in our states about a lack of responsiveness from
federal agencies.”The letter follows months of delays from the Biden
administration on implementing plans for agencies to return their workforce to
the office and to address the mounting backlog of cases that arose while
workers were working from home.The senators cite several examples of the impact this
extended absence has had on government services:·      • Department of Veterans Affairs - As of
August 30, 2021, there were almost 182,000 claims at the Department of Veterans
Affairs that were backlogged because of a pause of in-person compensation and
pension examinations last year.·      • Internal Revenue Service - As of October
2, 2021, the IRS had 6.8 million unprocessed individual 2020 tax year returns.·      • State Department - The wait time to get a
new passport is now 12 to 18 weeks.·      • Social Security Administration - Social
Security offices throughout the country have been closed except for those
beneficiaries who make an appointment and are deemed to be in “dire need.”
Social Security recipients have been forced to use unreliable mail services to
send personal identifying information or paperwork to local field offices as
most offices will not accept these documents in person.On June 10, 2021, GSA, OMB, and OPM issued a memo regarding
the return of federal employees and contractors to physical workplaces. The
deadline to submit their plans was July 19, 2021. However, given President
Biden’s new vaccine mandate and the spread of the Delta variant, many agencies
have had to produce new plans, which are currently still unavailable to the
general public and to Congress despite ongoing requests. As the senators write,
only one agency out of 20 that were recently contacted was able to provide a
plan for its employees.“We understand the unique challenges that COVID-19 has
presented, but Americans continue to face unprecedented delays in accessing
their federal government. This is unacceptable,” the senators said.The senators also expressed their view that the federal
government should consider the costs to taxpayers of paying for office space
that is not used, saying it is a “drain on taxpayers who are ultimately paying
the price for empty offices.”“It is now time to bring back our federal workers and
deliver the service that the American people have been promised and expect of
their government,” the senators concluded.In addition to Blunt and Wicker, the letter is signed by
U.S. Senators John Barrasso (Wyo.), Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.), John Boozman
(Ark.), Mike Braun (Ind.), Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), Bill Cassidy (La.),
Susan Collins (Maine), John Cornyn (Texas), Kevin Cramer (N.D.), Mike Crapo
(Idaho), Ted Cruz (Texas), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Chuck
Grassley (Iowa), Bill Hagerty (Tenn.), Josh Hawley (Mo.), John Hoeven (N.D.),
Cindy Hyde-Smith (Miss.), James Inhofe (Okla.), John Kennedy (La.), James
Lankford (Okla.), Mike Lee (Utah), Cynthia Lummis (Wyo.), Roger Marshall

https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-backs-resolution-to-block-biden-vaccine-mandate-on-private-sector-employers,"November 04, 2021WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.)
cosponsored a resolution of disapproval filed by U.S. Senator Mike Braun (Ind.)
to stop President Biden’s vaccine mandate on private-sector employers.“I have been vaccinated and I have encouraged everyone who
is eligible to receive a vaccine to consider doing so,” said Blunt. “However, I
also believe it is an individual choice and I am opposed to President Biden’s
vaccine mandate. I have heard from private-sector employers all around our
state who are having huge challenges hiring and retaining workers. Given the
significant labor force and supply chain problems we’re facing, the last thing
our economy needs is to lose more workers because of this misguided, costly,
and unworkable mandate. It is the absolute wrong approach to getting more
people vaccinated and I will continue working with my colleagues to stop
it.”  The Biden administration today issued a rule mandating
vaccination requirements for employees at private businesses with more than 100
employees. The rule, which will affect
more than 80 million Americans, imposes a $14,000 fine per violation. 
The Congressional Review Act (CRA) can be used by Congress
to overturn certain federal agency regulations and actions through a joint
resolution of disapproval. If a CRA joint resolution of disapproval is approved
by both houses of Congress and signed by the president, or if Congress
successfully overrides a presidential veto, the rule at issue is invalidated.

U.S. Senators Jerry Moran (Kan.) and Deb Fischer (Neb.) in introducing the
Kelsey Smith Act. The bill, named for 18-year-old Kelsey Smith who was abducted
and murdered in 2007, would strengthen law enforcement’s ability to lawfully
and quickly access cell phone location information, or ping information, when a
person is abducted and their life is threatened.“The Smith family experienced a terrible tragedy that was
made even more agonizing by the delay in finding their daughter, Kelsey,” said
Blunt. “The Kelsey Smith Act will provide law enforcement an important tool in
their efforts to find and save the lives of kidnapping victims. This bill,
which takes a narrowly crafted approach to balancing law enforcement needs and
privacy concerns, will bring federal law in line with the laws that are already
on the books in Missouri and many other states. I urge my Senate colleagues to
support us in honoring Kelsey by getting this bill to the president’s desk.”“Kelsey Smith’s tragic abduction sent shockwaves through the
Overland Park community and the country,” said Moran. “In honor of their
daughter and to aid law enforcement in rescuing kidnap victims, Greg and Missey
Smith have worked tirelessly to support the passage of the Kelsey Smith Act in
state legislatures around the country and here in Washington D.C. This
legislation will make certain first responders have the tools they need to
quickly locate people who have been abducted, and I urge my colleagues to
support this sensible bill to help save lives.” 
“When someone’s life is at risk, it is critical that law
enforcement has the tools to respond as quickly as possible,” said Fischer. “By
rapidly providing law enforcement with victims’ call location information, the
Kelsey Smith Act will save the lives of innocent people while ensuring there is
accountability for such requests.”The Kelsey Smith Act would expedite the search for missing
persons by requiring cell phone carriers to provide limited cell phone data to
law enforcement in the case of an emergency. The bill creates a very limited
exception that protects individuals’ privacy rights and addresses carriers’ liability
concerns. Law enforcement agencies were unable to locate Kelsey Smith for four
days following her abduction due to red tape that prevented them from accessing
her cell phone location data. After they obtained the data, Kelsey’s body was
found within 45 minutes.
In 2012, Missouri became the eighth state to enact Kelsey’s
Law. A total of 27 states have enacted similar laws. The Kelsey Smith Act would
create a uniform law across the country."
https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-backs-resolution-opposing-lifting-of-iran-sanctions,"February 25, 2021WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.), a member
of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, joined U.S. Senator Tom Cotton
(Ark.), U.S. Representative Mike Gallagher (Wis.), and 43 other members of
Congress in introducing a resolution opposing the lifting of sanctions on Iran.
The members released the following statement after introduction:""The U.S. must maintain sanctions on the Iranian regime
until it abandons its nuclear ambitions and ends its support for violence and
terror around the region. Iran took advantage of weak policies during the Obama
Administration, and President Biden must not repeat those same mistakes.""Blunt has previously supported legislation to extend and
expand sanctions on the Iranian regime. He opposed the Obama administration's
nuclear deal with Iran, which provided $100 billion in sanctions relief while
the Iranian regime continued pursuing a nuclear capability, violating multiple
legally-binding arms embargoes, and supporting terrorist activities targeting
the United States and our allies.   Cosigners of the resolution include: U.S. Senators John
Barrasso (Wyo.), Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.), John Boozman (Ark.), John Cornyn
(Texas), Kevin Cramer (N.D.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Ted Cruz (Texas), Steve
Daines (Mont.), Bill Hagerty (Tenn.), Josh Hawley (Mo.), John Hoeven (N.D.),

Representatives.
