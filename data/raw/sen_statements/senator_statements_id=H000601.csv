https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2022/09/16/hagerty-blackburn-introduce-the-restoring-law-and-order-act/,"September 16, 2022NASHVILLE, TN—United States Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) introduced the Restoring Law and Order Act in response to the violence plaguing communities across America. Compared to mid-2019, America’s largest cities have seen a 50% increase in homicides and a 36% increase in aggravated assaults. In Tennessee, Memphis has experienced a series of shockingly violent crimes.“Violent crime has become an epidemic in this country. As a direct consequence, American communities need more police officers and prosecutors—not more IRS agents,” said Senator Hagerty.” President Biden, Vice-President Harris and congressional Democrats encouraged the defund-the-police movement, which predictably led to less policing and soft-on-crime policies across America. Now the tragic results of this approach are on full display, with American cities and towns far less safe. Yet, instead of addressing this obvious crisis in order to save lives, President Biden and Democrats just spent $80 billion to hire 87,000 new IRS agents to target hard-working Americans. Our legislation will rescind this wasteful, intrusive spending and give it to state and local law enforcement agencies to protect Americans from violent crime. Government’s basic job is to keep its citizens safe—not snoop on them—and this bill addresses this urgent need.”“We need to increase funding for law enforcement, root out weak on crime prosecutors and judges, and keep violent criminals locked up,” said Senator Blackburn. “Senator Hagerty and I are introducing the Restoring Law and Order Act to ensure state and local law enforcement agencies have the resources needed to combat violent crime and improve the processing of DNA evidence such as rape kits. It is sad that in Washington, Democrats have made heroes out of criminals and turned police officers into villains. The defund the police movement is demanding compassion for criminals, but not their innocent victims. Senator Hagerty and I believe we must fund, not defund, the police and are proud to Back the Blue. This legislation will provide much-needed resources to our brave law enforcement officers so they can hunt down violent criminals and keep Tennesseans safe.”The Restoring Law and Order Act Will Increase Resources for Law Enforcement by Establishing a Federal Grant Program To:The Restoring Law and Order Act Will Improve the Processing of Rape Kits By:Senators Hagerty and Blackburn recently sent President Biden a letter demanding he take swift action to eliminate soft-on-crime policies that have emboldened criminals.Senators Hagerty and Blackburn also held a press conference to discuss the need to keep violent criminals in jail and support law enforcement.Click here for the bill text.###"
https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2022/09/15/hagerty-rails-against-sec-chairs-overregulation-of-the-american-economy/,"September 15, 2022WASHINGTON—United States Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), a member of the Senate Banking Committee, today in a heated exchange pressed U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler on his overregulation stifling the American economy and his incredulous argument that increasing regulatory costs will promote innovation and competition.“Increased regulatory cost promotes greater competition in the sophisticated market? I don’t buy that one bit… This is damaging to the marketplace. I’ve been on the other side of the table. Small companies that need to access capital to grow are going to be deprived of that capital because of this type of overreach,” Hagerty said.###"

That’s two years too long for Matthew, it’s two years too long for his family, and certainly it’s two years too long for me. Assistant Secretary Nichols, the Maduro regime should immediately and unconditionally release my fellow Tennessean, Matthew Heath,” Hagerty said.In response, Assistant Secretary Nichols assured Hagerty that he shares his concerns about Heath’s detainment and is utilizing all State Department resources to secure his safe return to the United States. “Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs, Roger Carstens, has, as well as our ambassador, have raised this issue on multiple occasions with the Maduro regime. We’ve sought to do all that we can to secure his immediate and unconditional release. And in the meantime, we have insisted that the regime should ensure his safety and his health by improving the conditions of his confinement. We will continue to work tirelessly to secure the release of all wrongfully detained Americans in Venezuela.”Hagerty has consistently raised his concern about Heath’s wrongful detainment and called for the Maduro regime to immediately release Heath, most recently drawing attention to Heath’s 500th day in detainment. “You know how concerned I am about the situation, and I appreciate your continued attention and focus on the issue. It is tragic. It’s certainly something Tennesseans all have their eye on,” Hagerty concluded.###"
https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2022/09/14/hagerty-the-american-public-has-had-enough-of-violent-crime/,"September 14, 2022WASHINGTON—United States Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) today led members of the Senate Republican Conference in a press conference at the U.S. Capitol to discuss ending the violent crime epidemic across America and to implore the Biden Administration to address this critical and worsening threat.Partial TranscriptHagerty: “The American public has had enough. The crime wave that’s rolling across our country is tragic. As Senator Blackburn mentioned, we’re seeing record high levels of crime in every major city. Memphis saw a record high this past year alone. We’ve got to step up and do something about this, and we’ve had an Administration that prioritizes anything but dealing with crime. In fact, as many of the members of this Administration were running for office—I think about Vice President Kamala Harris; she actually raised funds to bail out criminals early. One of those criminals that her fund bailed out just a few weeks ago murdered somebody three weeks after being released on bail that now-Vice President Harris’s fund provided. We’ve got to turn away from this weak-on-crime sort of environment. It starts at the top. The tone at the top right now has got to be much more stringent and much stronger. As Senator Blackburn mentioned, we are working on legislation right now that will address this, but we’re moving more urgently. The letter that we sent this week to President Biden encourages him—and we’re ready to work with him—to step up, to address this problem, to use some of the tried-and-true principles that have already worked. You think back to the Trump Administration, Operation Legend was a process that worked, that helped address this sort of crime, and helped address it in our state alone. So, we need to properly resource law enforcement now. We’ll work on it through legislation, but the President has the ability to step up right now and help us address this. We’re calling on him to do that, and I look forward to my colleagues and I working together to make certain we get this problem addressed.”A copy of the letter Hagerty and Blackburn sent today to President Biden can be found here.###"
https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2022/09/14/hagerty-blackburn-call-on-biden-to-address-rampant-violent-crime/,"September 14, 2022WASHINGTON—United States Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) today sent a letter to President Joe Biden following the recent tragic episodes of violent crime in Memphis, urging him to take immediate action to address the nationwide epidemic of violent crime and send the clear message—through Administration policies and funding—that Americans stand with law enforcement and that criminal activity will be swiftly and severely punished to remove dangerous offenders from our communities.“We write regarding the recent shocking and tragic episodes of violent crime in Memphis, which are symptomatic of a rise in violent crime across the country that demands decisive federal law enforcement action. The most basic, important duty of government is to protect the life and liberty of its citizens, and substantially more resources must be put toward protecting innocent life,” the Senators wrote.The Senators recounted the recent kidnapping and murder of Eliza Fletcher and the shooting rampage across Memphis just days later that killed three and injured three others. They noted that these acts—both of which were committed by individuals with violent criminal histories—are indicative of the larger violent crime wave across America and clearly demonstrate that more must be done to make communities safer and strengthen and support law enforcement.Hagerty and Blackburn explained that this unquestionable deterioration of public safety has been fueled by “the anti-law-enforcement movement that has wrought soft-on-crime policies—from the eradication of bail and pretrial detention to prosecutors declining to prosecute or seek jail time for serious crimes—as well as emboldened criminals who are often quickly returned to the streets.”To stem this crisis and bolster public safety across the country, the Senators outlined specific, obvious steps the Biden Administration should immediately take, adding that: “Rampant crime is not inevitable—tough law enforcement can stop it.  But that requires a commitment to law enforcement.” To this end, the Senators specifically urged President Biden to: (1) fund law enforcement and prosecutors—without anti-police strings attached—including by maximizing use of the Armed Career Criminal Act and federal laws against felons possessing firearms to get dangerous, repeat offenders off the streets and by providing federal grant dollars to hire and retain more officers to fight violent crime; (2) revive highly successful Trump Administration initiatives like Operation Legend, which deployed federal law enforcement in American cities to combat crime and saved countless lives through over 6,000 arrests, including approximately 467 for homicide, and seizure of more than 2,600 illegal firearms and over 17 kilos of fentanyl during the second half of 2020 alone; (3) stop wasting federal dollars on jurisdictions that refuse to enforce the law or use basic public-safety tools like bail; and (4) detain and deport all illegal aliens who commit crimes in the United States.“We must do whatever it takes to stop the escalation of violent crime across our nation. The cost of failing to do so has become tragically clear in our state. We would welcome the opportunity to work together to address this critical and worsening threat,” the Senators concluded.A copy of the letter can be found here.###"

Since January 2022, Kim Jong Un’s regime has conducted 13 ballistic missile tests, at least three of which were intercontinental ballistic missiles in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions. In the strongest statement about Kim Jong Un’s nuclear doctrine, North Korea last week enacted a new law declaring itself an “irreversible” nuclear weapons state and outlining additional circumstances for deploying weapons of mass destruction.“At a dangerous time when the threat of North Korea continues to mount, this important bipartisan legislation will impose additional sanctions on North Korea’s ability to generate revenue to fund its unlawful WMD programs, bolster support for denuclearization of North Korea, and provide additional Congressional oversight of U.S.-DPRK negotiations,” said Senator Hagerty.  “As the international community continues to rally around a common cause in support of the people of Ukraine and against violent dictators writ large, the continuing danger of further conventional military provocation from North Korea that could reignite a serious military clash between North and South remains high, as does the potential for unintended escalation that could draw in the United States in a deadly and dangerous confrontation on the Peninsula,” said Chairman Menendez. “Adding insult to injury, we now know Vladimir Putin is so isolated that he is turning to pariah states like North Korea and Iran to try to continue his campaign of killing Ukrainians. But Russia’s desperation and lawlessness should not provide fertile ground to embolden Kim Jong Un by filling his coffers for nuclear weapons and missile programs. This bipartisan bill will go a long way in advancing peace and security in the Indo-Pacific by expanding and tightening enforcement of sanctions for North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile development and other destructive activities of the Kim regime.”A copy of the North Korea Policy Oversight Act of 2022 can be found here.A copy of the section-by-section summary can be found here. ###"

While the Biden Administration tries to distract and deflect, the American people know the pain of inflation is anything but alleviated after enduring yet another month of feeling the brutal pinch of inflation, seeing their savings depleted, and having their wages eroded by this unprecedented bout of inflation. In the 19 months since President Biden came into office, inflation has now risen by 13.2 percent, and our economy has officially entered a recession. Try as they might, no baseless victory lap or out-of-touch press release from the Biden Administration will change the stark reality that financial hardships are greater and wallets are emptier since Joe Biden stepped into office.”###"

It’s about the November elections. It’s a blatant vote buy attempt, but I think it’s going to backfire, Neil, for the reasons that you’ve been talking about. It’s going be a massive overreach… 600 billion to a trillion dollars—that more than doubles the entire amount of deficit savings that supposedly came out of the Inflation Reduction Act—I call it the Income Reduction Act, by the way. This is incredibly unfair to the American people. The majority of Americans never went to college. They certainly shouldn’t be put in a place where they’re subsidizing, you know, as was said, subsidizing the lawyer driving the BMW, subsidizing the person who just graduated from a fine Northeastern school that’s now got a great job working on Wall Street. That’s not fairness in America. I think it feels like to most people who actually did work their way through school and didn’t take on loans, or who worked hard to pay their loans back, or those that didn’t go to school at all—those that didn’t go to college at all—they’re being played for chumps by [President] Joe Biden. This is not going to wear well.”Hagerty on Biden’s desperation: “If you look at Joe Biden’s ratings, they’re in the low forties. They’re in the tank. Their desperation is being revealed by the fact that he would go in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia and claim that 75 million Americans are, you know, deplorable, you know, enemies of the state. I mean, they are desperate right now. We need to stay focused on the message. We need to stay focused on what’s ailing America right now that’s been brought by the Democrats.”###"

But what’s happening is obviously [President] Joe Biden’s attempt to change the narrative and to buy votes for the upcoming midterm elections. In fact, when I was in my home state of Tennessee, I spent the last month doing an Economic Development Tour of the state. When this news broke, it was met very, very sourly by the people of Tennessee. Think about the people that did not go to college—it’s up to them to somehow support those that decide to do that? What about the people that worked their way through college? Those that didn’t take out loans but worked hard to make certain that they were able to do this responsibly? They’re all chumps, too, in Joe Biden’s world. So, I think this is going to be very, very poorly received by America. It’s the wrong move, and Joe Manchin could have been far stronger than he was in terms of criticizing it. […] Clearly, the Constitution and the law does not matter to the Biden Administration or the Democrats. This is all about the midterm elections in November. They don’t care whether it turns out to be legal or not. In fact, this probably will be struck down by the courts. And when we take control of the Congress after the November elections, I think that we’ll be in a position to come back—I serve in the Appropriations Committee—and address this and take it down. But in the meantime, what Joe Biden has done is make it very obvious he’s willing to do anything—anything—to try to buy votes, try to shift the narrative, try to distract the American public from the disaster that his Administration has been managing this country leading up to the 2022 elections. If you think about the economy, the state that we’re in right now, inflation at record high rates, gas prices at record high rates because we’ve lost our energy independence. You know, from a national security standpoint, we’ve never been in worse shape, you know, you think about a year ago and what happened in Afghanistan and everything that’s followed. Joe Biden has been a complete disaster—just look at our southern border. But they’re trying to distract the American public’s attention from that and talk about matters that frankly are going to change after November.”Hagerty on Democrats’ attempt to distract Americans from their record of failures: “What you see is the Democrats’ attempt to distract, to take attention away from what should be, you know, a sharp focus on the disaster that their policies have delivered for America. I think if you look at Joe Biden’s overall approval ratings, the answer is very, very clear. He is in the tank, and what this is, is an attempt to distract, deflect, and to, you know, make this election about Donald Trump, to make this election about the Republicans, make this election about anything but the record that the Democrats have amassed as they put our economy in the tank, they put our nation in a far more dangerous place. You know, crime is rampant, defund the police has not worked, collapsing the border has not worked, and making America the greatest apologist in the world clearly hasn’t worked overseas.”Hagerty on his annual Economic Development Tour of Tennessee: “Every business owner told me that all of their input costs have gone up, certainly far beyond what’s being reported. And if you think about wage costs, those are very, very sticky coming back down. They’re not coming back down. As we look at wage increases, those are permanently inflationary increases. Now the public is hurting, and I think the wage increases have been necessary to attract people back to the workforce, but also to help them earn a living because every cost that they have, every cost that the American public [has], certainly Tennesseans, has gone up. Joe Biden has set off the most pernicious tax in the world, and that is inflation, and he’s stealing it from the people of Tennessee, the people of America who can least afford it. […] In Tennessee, we drive to our jobs. And what Joe Biden has done, what the Democrats have done, is wage war on energy independence here in America. From the day they took office, they’ve driven the cost of fuel through the roof. Diesel fuel, gasoline, heating oil in the Northeast—you think about the inflationary impacts—that could be changed overnight if they would just cease this war on the fossil fuel industry here in America. That would take costs down for fuel. Everything that we buy has to be transported. That would be immediately deflationary, [and] they will not do it.”###"

This equipment is important not only for keeping up with economic growth, but for restoring power after storms and other extreme weather events. In the past months, costs are skyrocketing, and lead times for some manufacturers are up to two years – while others are not taking orders at all,” the members of Congress continued.To address this urgent matter, the members of Congress urged President Biden to “direct the Department of Energy (DOE) to temporarily suspend its most recent conservation standards for transformers, which require manufacturers to use more steel than previously required,” and to “engage the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to engage with suppliers and utilities to determine whether stockpiles of transformers, particularly those that may have been purchased with federal funds, may exist that can be called upon in emergency situations.”Joining Hagerty in the letter are Senators Roger Wicker (R-MS), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), and Representatives David Kustoff (R-TN-08), Diana Harshbarger (R-TN-01), John Rose (R-TN-06), Scott DesJarlais (R-TN-04), Tim Burchett (R-TN-02), Morgan Griffith (R-VA-09), and Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN-03).A copy of the letter can be found here and below.Dear Mr. President:We are writing to encourage you to take further action to address the urgent supply chain shortages threatening our region’s electric infrastructure. Beyond the current invocation of the Defense Production Act for certain energy infrastructure components, more must be done to ensure electric reliability heading into storm season.We have heard from Local Power Companies serving our region that the availability of transformers is particularly dire. Transformers are a crucial component of electricity delivery at substations and utility poles. This equipment is important not only for keeping up with economic growth, but for restoring power after storms and other extreme weather events. In the past months, costs are skyrocketing, and lead times for some manufacturers are up to two years – while others are not taking orders at all.At issue is the availability of raw materials like steel. Your Capstone report on America’s Supply Chains notes that there is only one domestic manufacturer of the steel used to produce transformers, and this company is unable to meet demand. The Department of Energy’s (DOE) February 2022 report which informed that conclusion recommends, among other things, lowering manufacturing costs of large power transformers.At a minimum, we request that you direct DOE to temporarily suspend its most recent conservation standards for transformers, which require manufacturers to use more steel than previously required. According to a letter sent to DOE Secretary Jennifer Granholm by the American Public Power Association and National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, this would allow manufacturers to increase transformer availability by allowing less steel to be used for each device.Further, we request you engage the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to engage with suppliers and utilities to determine whether stockpiles of transformers, particularly those that may have been purchased with federal funds, may exist that can be called upon in emergency situations.Thank you for your attention to this matter.Sincerely,###"
https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2022/08/23/hagerty-colleagues-raise-concern-about-biden-administration-permitting-individuals-who-have-supported-terrorism-to-immigrate-to-the-u-s/,"August 23, 2022NASHVILLE, TN—United States Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN) led his colleagues in a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressing serious concern over their Departments’ June 8 determination, which makes individuals who provided “insignificant material support” or “limited material support” to terrorist organizations eligible for immigration to the United States, thereby altering U.S. immigration policy and affecting the security of the United States.“We write because the American people deserve an explanation regarding the broad, open-ended nature of this authority for exempting individuals who would otherwise be barred from immigration to the United States for supporting a terrorist organization,” the Senators wrote. While the authority has previously been used by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of State, prior determinations have typically been narrowly tailored and limited to specific groups of immigrants, geographic regions, or conflicts, such as the Lebanese Civil War or revolution against Saddam Hussein in Iraq.In contrast, the June 8 determination is not limited to certain conflicts, terrorist organizations, geographic regions, or time periods. Instead, it “broadly permits the admission of foreign individuals who provided material support to terrorist organizations that the Biden Administration deems insignificant or limited. This could include, for example, current or former members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and IRGC-linked entities, which are responsible for the deaths of hundreds of U.S. service members in Iraq and Afghanistan. It could include individuals seeking asylum at the southern border,” the Senators continued.The Senators requested that the Secretaries provide a timely explanation and justification for this broad new authority, which substantially changes U.S. immigration policy.Joining Hagerty in the letter are Senators Rick Scott (R-FL), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), John Hoeven (R-ND), and Steve Daines (R-MT).A copy of the letter can be found here and below.Dear Secretary Mayorkas and Secretary Blinken:On June 8, 2022, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of State determined that they will no longer bar individuals who provide “insignificant material support” or “limited material support” to terrorist organizations from admission into the United States (“June 8 Determination”). We write because the American people deserve an explanation regarding the broad, open-ended nature of this authority for exempting individuals who would otherwise be barred from immigration to the United States for supporting a terrorist organization.Under federal law, persons who have engaged or assisted in terrorist activities are generally ineligible to immigrate to the United States. The Secretaries of Homeland Security and State can exempt certain persons from this prohibition, however. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(3)(B)(i). Usually, such an exemption is limited to specific groups or conflicts for obvious reasons.For example, in 2019, this authority was applied to visa or other immigration-related applications for an activity or association relating to the Lebanese Forces militias (“2019 Determination”). The 2019 Determination is narrowly tailored and does not apply outside the context of the Lebanese civil war that occurred between 1975 and 1990. It also clearly states that it does not apply to any alien that engaged in terrorist activity or knowingly provided any level of material support to terrorist activities that targeted noncombatants or U.S. interests.Similarly, in 2012, this exemption authority was applied with respect to aliens in the context of activities or associations relating to the uprisings against Saddam Hussein’s government in Iraq (“2012 Determination”). Like the 2019 Determination, the 2012 Determination is confined to a specific group of aliens from a certain geographic area during a specified period of time.In contrast, your June 8 Determination widely exempts persons who provided “insignificant material support” or “limited material support under circumstances” to a designated terrorist organization. According to a DHS press release, the intent of this determination is to help “vulnerable Afghans.” Yet, the June 8 Determination makes no mention of Afghanistan or Afghan refugees and is not limited to the categories of Afghan individuals described in your press release or persons connected with the war in Afghanistan. Indeed, it is not limited to certain conflicts, terrorist organizations, geographic regions, or time periods at all.In contrast, on the same day that you issued the June 8 Determination, you issued a separate determination that was specifically limited to individuals who were employed as civil servants in Afghanistan during a specific time frame. The geographic, circumstantial, and temporal specificity in this second determination highlights and calls into question the broad, open-ended nature of the June 8 Determination, which is not in any way limited to vulnerable Afghans or persons involved with the conflict in Afghanistan.Instead, the June 8 Determination broadly permits the admission of foreign individuals who provided material support to terrorist organizations that the Biden Administration deems insignificant or limited. This could include, for example, current or former members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and IRGC-linked entities, which are responsible for the deaths of hundreds of U.S. service members in Iraq and Afghanistan. It could include individuals seeking asylum at the southern border.The timing of the June 8 Determination, nearly a year after the Administration’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, also raises questions. If its intent is to ensure that Afghan refugees are able to gain asylum in the United States, there is no explanation regarding why this decision was not made months ago with prudent restrictions limiting its application to Afghan refugees.The June 8 Determination alters U.S. immigration policy and for obvious reasons affects the security of the United States by making individuals who provided material support to terrorist organizations eligible to enter the United States and receive “immigration benefits or other status[es]” at the expense of American taxpayers. This sort of substantial, inadequately explained change to U.S. immigration policy implicating obvious U.S. national security interests merits further explanation and congressional scrutiny.Therefore, we request that you provide answers to the following questions regarding the June 8 Determination:In addition to providing written responses to these questions, we also request a briefing from the appropriate officials to discuss any outstanding questions.Further, we write to confirm that you will comply with the requirements of the CRA in taking this action.Under the CRA, an agency action that falls within the definition of a “rule” must be submitted to Congress for review before it can take effect. 5 U.S.C. § 801(a)(1)(A). “The definition of a rule under the CRA is very broad.” Government Accountability Office B-323772, at 3 (Sept. 4, 2012), available at https://www.gao.gov/assets/b-323772.pdf.

Semiconductors are essential to nearly every sector of the economy, especially automobiles. Demand for semiconductors has outstripped supply, creating a global chip shortage resulting in a loss of growth and jobs. Onshoring semiconductor production is a critical part of strengthening the U.S. economy and national security. The Tennessee Chamber of Commerce & Industry and Tennessee Manufacturers Association applaud Senator Hagerty for his commonsense approach that will strengthen the domestic semiconductor industry and address shortages we have seen across the economy.”Former President and CEO of Manufacturers Alliance Dr. Thomas J. Duesterberg: “Senator Hagerty’s important piece of legislation is just what is needed to make sure new legislation to rebuild U.S. semiconductor manufacturing capabilities is implemented in a timely way. We only need to point to the recent threatening behavior of China toward the advanced chip-making hub of Taiwan to understand that we must move quickly to regain semiconductor leadership and self-sufficiency.”Former Associate Director for Regulatory Reform of the White House Council on Environmental Quality Mario Loyola: “There is only one reason that manufacturing goes offshore, and that is the stifling levels of regulation and taxation here at home. Overregulation puts America at a grave competitive disadvantage to countries like China and leave us dependent on vulnerable sources of supply, like Taiwan. So streamlining the permitting process for manufacturing infrastructure in strategic sectors is of paramount importance. Including the high-tech sector—in particular semiconductor manufacturing—among the covered project sectors of FAST-41, along with other measures to strengthen FAST-41 and the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, is a vital and welcome step.”President and CEO of the Conservative Partnership Institute Ed Corrigan: “Since arriving in D.C., Senator Hagerty has shown a commitment to reducing Federal bureaucracy. Enactment of this law expanding FAST-41 is a good step toward beating China and creating more jobs here at home.”President and CEO of the Beacon Center of Tennessee Justin Owen: “We applaud the effort led by Senator Hagerty to cut government red tape for key industries necessary for America to remain competitive and secure on the global stage. We believe this can serve as a common-sense model for future regulatory reforms at both the federal and state level.”###"
https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2022/08/18/hagerty-annual-economic-development-tour-of-tennessee-launches-this-week/,"August 18, 2022NASHVILLE, TN—United States Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), a member of the Senate Appropriations and Banking Committees and former state Commissioner of Economic and Community Development, will again initiate his annual Economic Development Tour across Tennessee that takes place each August when the Senate is in recess. The tour will again take him to counties and cities across west, middle, and east Tennessee, providing the opportunity to meet with businesses—large and small— entrepreneurs, workers, and farmers about the economy and the harmful big-government, tax-and-spend policies coming from Washington. “The strength of our economy, and the security of our nation, are derived from the innovation, ingenuity, and grit of hardworking Americans—not from government regulation or stipulation,” said Senator Hagerty. “As a life-long businessman and Tennessee’s former commissioner of economic development, I have a deep appreciation for hardworking Tennesseans—from the farmer, to the factory worker, to the executive, to the store clerk—and a steadfast dedication to increasing opportunity and prosperity for Tennessee families and preserving the American Dream for our children and grandchildren. My time spent last August with Tennessee business leaders and workers has proven invaluable over the last 12 months as I’ve continued working for Tennesseans in Washington through the lens of a former businessperson and with the men and women who serve as the backbone of our economy top of mind. The value of my 2021 Economic Development Tour was most recently demonstrated by the passage and signing into law of my legislation that dramatically cuts bureaucratic red tape for strategic manufacturing industries—specifically semiconductor chip manufacturing facilities, among others—and creates more American jobs. I look forward to this year’s tour across the state listening to Tennessee workers’ and communities’ concerns and ideas that will foster economic growth, increase investment, and spur recovery across companies, industries, counties, and the entire Volunteer State.”Hagerty is a life-long businessman who started his business career with the Boston Consulting Group. He later became a venture capital and private equity investor, where he invested in and served as an executive and board member of a wide range of companies, including those listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ. From 2011 to 2014, Hagerty served as a member of Governor Bill Haslam’s (R-TN) Cabinet and Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development. During his tenure as commissioner, Hagerty reorganized the department, eliminating over 40 percent of the positions and saving millions of taxpayer dollars. At the same time, the new approach helped spur the strongest economic transformation seen—taking Tennessee from an unemployment rate higher than the national average when he arrived to become the number one state in the nation for jobs created through foreign investment and being named State of the Year for Economic Development an unprecedented two years in a row during his tenure.Hagerty’s office will announce details of his public appearances ahead of time.###"
https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2022/08/17/hagerty-legislation-cutting-government-red-tape-and-creating-american-jobs-signed-into-law/,"August 17, 2022NASHVILLE, TN—United States Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today applauded President Joe Biden signing into law bipartisan legislation, authored by Hagerty and co-sponsored by Senators Angus King (I-ME) and Rob Portman (R-OH), to cut bureaucratic red tape for key national-security manufacturing operations, like semiconductors, by granting them access to an improved federal permitting program that will accelerate American development of these critical projects. “I came to Washington to create jobs for the American people and bolster our national security to beat the Chinese Communist Party in the competition that will define the century, and my first piece of legislation signed into law advances both of these important goals,” said Senator Hagerty. “I thank Senators King and Portman for their steadfast partnership and my colleagues in both houses of Congress for their support in working to end our reliance upon Communist China, reinvigorate our manufacturing independence, and reduce government red tape to unleash American competitiveness and innovation. The enactment of this legislation is a win for American security and prosperity, American industries, American jobs, and the American people.”“From basic household appliances to advanced defense systems, almost every piece of modern life relies on semiconductors. As supply chains struggle and tensions with China rise, it’s abundantly clear America can no longer afford to be dependent on competitors for these critical technologies,” said Senator King. “Our bipartisan FAST-41 reforms will encourage a rapid expansion of the domestic semiconductor production critical to the nation’s long-term economic success and security. This is a commonsense step to support innovation – and, partnered with the historic investments of the CHIPS Act, will be a major boost to American competitiveness in the 21st century. I’m grateful to Senators Hagerty and Portman for their partnership on this bill and to President Biden for signing it into law.”“Expanding the FAST-41 permitting process improvements to more projects—especially projects involving semiconductors, technology, and other matters of national security—is common sense,” said Senator Portman. “Over the past six years, the FAST-41 process has substantially reduced the permitting process timeline for covered projects by increasing agency communication and accountability. I’m pleased this bipartisan legislation to leverage that process to make America more competitive and secure is now law.” Background:The Hagerty-King-Portman legislation, which passed the U.S. Senate by unanimous consent in January and passed the House of Representatives in July, will reduce dramatically the time it takes to obtain the permitting necessary to build semiconductor and other key manufacturing facilities in the United States, encouraging these projects to locate in the United States. This will not only create American jobs, but it will also help to re-shore supply chains that are essential to U.S. national security and reduce dependence on Communist China and other foreign sources for key products, advancing American leadership in the industries at the heart of the competition with the Chinese Communist Party.Previous permitting reform efforts have often focused on public infrastructure projects led by state and local governments. Conversely, Hagerty’s watershed bill enacts regulatory reform that benefits private-sector companies building products that are essential to American national and economic security. This will allow strategic industries, like semiconductor fabrication facilities, to build in America more quickly, increasing America’s competitiveness and leveling the playing field with adversaries like Communist China. ###"

They’ve been going on for decades, and I think they’ll continue to go on. But what we’ve seen is a very different response from China. I think part of it is the fact that the Chinese Communist Party feels emboldened in the face of weakness from the Biden Administration. I’ll remind you today is the one year anniversary [of] the collapse of Afghanistan. And since that collapse, I think our enemies have been emboldened around the globe; China’s no exception to that. But the other thing that you mentioned, I think is absolutely true as well. We need to actually follow up our words with deeds. We need to strengthen foreign military sales acquisitions. I’d like to see more exercises in the region. I’d like to see more presence from the United States and our allies. That’s how we demonstrate real strength. That’s what China respects.”Hagerty on bipartisan legislation to aid Taiwan: “They pushed it off the calendar before we left for the August recess. I think they were so focused on getting this, you know, massive tax and spend package through they couldn’t think about anything else. But the good news is this: they have already scheduled it now for markup in September; this has just come out. So, we will be getting onto this legislation once we get back to Washington. I expect it to happen sometime in the middle part of September.”Hagerty on the need to strengthen U.S. posture in the Asia-Pacific region: “Well, again, I think this legislation that we’re going to talk about in September will get in that direction, particularly it’s going to help us strengthen Taiwan’s military position. It’ll be more foreign military sales, [and] it’ll be an expedited process to do that, Aishah, plus it’ll be more foreign military financing. Again, I’d like to see this, more exercises in the region, not only between the United States and our allies, but also to have our allies there on their own in the region. And frankly, we need to see a lot more U.S. military strength build-up. As you know, I was Ambassador to Japan at a time when we had massive tensions with North Korea and with China. We need to continue to build our presence and our posture because the Asia-Pacific region is where the action is going to be in the years to come.”###"

With Iran continuing to pursue a nuclear weapon and carrying out malign activity in the Middle East, our sanctions regime is our best tool to restrain Iran’s ability to fund operations that endanger Israel, Arab partners, and even U.S. military personal.“I’m pleased to be an original co-sponsor of the Solidify Iran Sanctions Act of 2022, a bill that will make permanent the Iran Sanctions Act, a cornerstone law in America’s broader sanctions program against Iran’s terror-sponsoring regime,” said Senator Hagerty. “As Iran increases its nuclear and ballistic missile threats and its support for terrorism and militancy in the Middle East, the United States should not ease sanctions and make it easier for the regime to continue its malign behavior.”“The United States, Israel, and our Arab partners remain concerned about the looming threat that a nuclear Iran poses to the stability of the region,” said Senator Scott. “U.S. sanctions are a necessary deterrent for this dangerous and unstable regime, which is why my bill will make the cornerstone of sanctions on Iran permanent.”The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and FDD Action have expressed support for this legislation.Background:In 1996, Congress passed the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA), which allowed the president to impose secondary sanctions on Iran’s energy sector. Throughout the years, ISA provisions were expanded to include other Iranian industries. ISA consists of “triggers” that place sanctions on firms or entities that violate U.S. sanctions under this law. With looming uncertainty about Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon, it is essential that the United States solidifies its pivotal sanctions to apply pressure towards a rogue regime.Click here to read the bill.###"

This Administration is celebrating while the American people suffer. Insulting is an understatement.”###"
https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2022/08/07/democrats-vote-against-removing-illegal-aliens-convicted-of-criminal-offenses/,"August 7, 2022WASHINGTON—United States Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today spoke on the Senate floor and urged his colleagues to support his motion to direct the Judiciary Committee to reprioritize funding in the Democrats’ tax-increase legislation to ensure that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has sufficient resources to detain and deport a greater number of illegal aliens who have been convicted of a criminal offense in the United States. The motion was not adopted because all 50 Senate Democrats voted against the measure, despite that during the budget resolution process last August, this same amendment was supported by four Democrats and adopted by the Senate, 53-46. Now—with a worse crisis at the border, a rising nationwide crime wave, and with a real opportunity to provide critical funding to address this public safety and national security crisis—Democrats abandoned their prior support for deportation of illegal aliens who have been convicted of a criminal offense.Remarks as prepared for delivery: Mr. President,In fiscal year 2021, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested more than 12,000 illegal aliens with aggravated felony convictions. An all-time record number of illegal border crossers entered our country last year. This is an unprecedented national security crisis.Before we spend billions of dollars on Green New Deal programs, the department should first do its core job of securing the Homeland.This same policy was adopted 53 to 46 during the budget resolution process last August with four of my Democrat colleagues joining me. Now, one year later, we have a worse crisis and an opportunity to provide real funding to protect our citizens from individuals who endanger our communities.I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will maintain their previous support for this commonsense approach to fund law enforcement and put public safety and national security over partisan politics.We have a chance to address this in a real manner right now. Solving a major crisis like this is worth taking a little more time. I urge my colleagues to support this motion.###"

Yet rather than do something to address any of these pressing crises, Democrats have instead chosen to ignore them and make matters worse by raising taxes—the burden of which will fall predominantly on the backs of middle-class Americans—amid an economic recession. Today, Democrats made defining choices that showed the American people that their radicalism has no bounds, choosing green energy fantasies and big government socialism over the needs of American families, workers, and businesses. Democrats will amble on to their next partisan proposal, but the American people will not soon forget the economic mess they have created.”###"
https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2022/08/07/hagerty-files-amendment-to-reverse-irs-snooping-on-third-party-payment-platforms/,"August 7, 2022WASHINGTON—United States Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), a member of the Senate Banking Committee, today filed an amendment to Democrats’ tax-increase legislation to strike the provision inserted by the Biden Administration in the American Rescue Plan (ARP) that requires third-party payment platforms to report businesses’ gross transaction volumes totaling more than $600 to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).“In a completely Orwellian fashion, under this new small-transaction reporting requirement, Big Government will have access to almost any small business or entrepreneur’s transaction records,” said Senator Hagerty. “The Biden Administration has been relentless in its attempt to invade the privacy of Americans’ lives and finances since the day it took office—and now it wants to double down. Democrats are rushing to give an agency with a scandal-plagued track record more than six times its annual budget to investigate American taxpayers and small businesses, despite that it can’t effectively investigate its own illegal leaks of taxpayer information. This is just another weapon in the Administration’s war on American businesses, and it is past time we put an end to its egregious and unwarranted overreach.”Democrats’ tax-increase legislation includes an additional $80 billion in funding for the IRS, despite that the agency’s annual budget for Fiscal Year 2022 was only $12.6 billion. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this would allow the IRS to collect an additional $204 billion in taxes. Based upon a nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation analysis, between 65 and 78 percent of this $204 billion would likely come from Americans earning less than $100,000.Over the past year, Democrats have used the IRS to target conservative political organizations and wealthy Americans to further their political agenda, and earlier this year, the Washington Examiner reported that, under this new ARP small-transaction reporting requirement, third-party payment processors like Venmo and PayPal will be required to report business transaction volumes totaling more than $600 to the IRS.In February, Hagerty introduced the Stop the Nosy Obsession with Online Payments, or SNOOP Act, to remove this invasive requirement from the American Rescue Plan. This amendment would include the SNOOP Act in Democrats’ tax-increase legislation currently being debated on the Senate floor to stop the new IRS funding from being used to increase enforcement of this new small-transaction reporting requirement against taxpayers and small businesses.###"

This has zero positive impact on inflation. In fact, it’s more likely than not to increase inflation. I call it the Income Reduction Act—that’s exactly what’s going to happen because they’re talking about massive tax increases. When you increase taxes on American corporations, where do you think those costs get passed on? It comes through in prices on the American public. They continue to wage war on the oil and gas industry here in America, making us less competitive as a nation, making it harder and harder for the average person to make ends meet. You think about the pain we’re feeling at the pump, there’s been minor relief, but still, we are [at] record high gas prices since [President] Joe Biden took office. You look at people in my home state of Tennessee, we drive to work. We are feeling the pain every day. This will not address inflation, but it’s going to add a lot more pain. And when you think about this $80 billion that they’re adding to IRS enforcement, Griff, come on, the people over $400,000 a year have an army of accountants and lawyers already working for them. They’re [Democrats] coming after the middle class here in America, that’s exactly what they’ve got to do. They’ve got a spending problem, and where are they going to get their revenue? They’re coming after the middle class in America for it.”Hagerty on how the middle class will bear the burden of Democrats’ reckless spending: “All [of] the analysis shows that taxes will go up, prices will go up, and everyone is going to be impacted throughout the chain. And I think the burden of the pain, the vast majority of the pain, is going be felt on the middle class here.”Hagerty on Republicans’ plan to fight against Democrats’ Income Reduction Act: “As the evening goes on here into the weekend, you’re going to see Republicans fighting tooth and nail with the Democrats because every policy embedded in this reconciliation process is going to weaken America, drive inflation up, and make opportunity less for our children and grandchildren.”Hagerty on strengthening America’s posture toward Communist China: “With respect to our position regarding China, we need to be strong. That’s what China understands. It’s not words, it’s not press releases, it’s actual strength and presence in the region. But I’ll tell you what’s going on there, Griff. What you’ve got going on in China is a domestic problem. Their economy is weak. What Xi Jinping is trying to do is divert the attention of domestic voters. He’s got the Chinese Communist Party Congress coming up this fall. He’s got to get reelected, so he’s trying to burnish his image as a strong man right now. His audience is domestic. He’s doing this to make himself appear strong. He’s using [Speaker] Nancy Pelosi’s visit as an excuse. But make no mistake, this is really aimed at a domestic audience there so that Xi Jinping can stay in power. What we need to be doing as Americans is continuing to posture ourselves in the right direction there, strengthening our position in that region and make sure that we are building our defense capabilities, not weakening them. If you look at the Biden Administration’s proposed budget, the Senate had to step in and step it up because the Biden Administration wanted to actually defund the military in the face of this.”Hagerty on the need for American strength: “We hear talk coming out of the Biden Administration that they want to release the tariffs now to remove pressure on China. For what? For nothing. I was U.S. Ambassador to Japan when we imposed the tariffs. That did not cause inflation—inflation was at 1.4 percent. When Biden came into office, it’s taken off since then because of domestic policies, not because of our tariff policies. We need to keep the pressure on China at every turn. And again, I’d say this, we’ve got to continue to build our strength, build our posture, and our momentum. It’s not just words and press releases, it’s deeds that matter to the Chinese.”###"

But at the same time, we don’t need to ask for a hall pass from the Chinese Communist Party if we want to make a visit to Taiwan. [During] the Trump Administration, we sent senior officials there; we never asked for permission. I think with the unfortunate unveiling of this debate in the media here between the White House and Nancy Pelosi created an open door for President Xi to come in and beat his chest and really create a bunch of domestic noise that will be very helpful to him domestically to create a sense that somehow the United States is an invader. That’s not the case, but this is helpful for them from a domestic standpoint, and that opening was created by the fact that we had a back and forth in the media between the White House and Nancy Pelosi. If she wanted to go, she should have just done it. The White House should be supportive of it and she should have moved on.”Hagerty on China’s threats: “Well, as you know, I was Ambassador to Japan. We used the term, ‘Kabuki Theater.’ I think that’s what’s going on here. You’re going to see a lot of theater, but I don’t expect this to turn into anything that’s kinetic. I think what you’re seeing and what we will witness is really an audience in mainland China that President Xi is playing to. And in the same time, again, trying to exert his authority in a more broad basis, but these are threats. This is not action in my view.”Hagerty on the importance of maintaining a strong U.S. posture against China: “I completely agree. We should be carrying a bigger stick, and look at the malign behavior of China. We saw what happened when China had tariffs imposed upon it. They really stepped back. I was Ambassador at the time that we moved into the region with a very forceful posture. From a military standpoint, we need to be present. We need to make certain that China knows that we understand their predatory practices from an economic standpoint, from a diplomatic standpoint, from a military standpoint, we’re not going to allow it. Again, China’s trying to close the military competence gap with us right now. We need to continue to make certain that the U.S. possesses the strongest military, and that we have a real force there in the region.”Hagerty on President Xi’s broader goals: “I think a large part of the audience for this, and a large part of theatrics that we’re seeing from China, is Xi’s audience, and that’s the National Congress; he’s playing to that as well. But if you look longer term, Xi’s articulated his goal, and that’s to bring Taiwan into the fold with China, and he’s talking about getting that done. It would be, again, after his next term begins, but we’ve got to be ever cognizant of that threat, and we need to be continuing to support Taiwan. We need to continue to be very present in the region.”###"

They want to be able to snoop and look into every aspect of our life, Maria. And that amount of data creates a tremendous amount of reporting overhead. It’s going to increase costs for businesses that have to make all these reports. It’s going to make it next to impossible for small businesses and entrepreneurs to deal with. They don’t care. They’re so out of touch with the economy and out of touch with reality that they’re just going to continue to plow through because this generates fictitious numbers that they use here in the Congress to justify even more massive spending.”Hagerty on tax increases in Democrats’ spending bill: “They should call this the Income Reduction Act, not the Inflation Reduction Act. It’s absolutely going to cause prices to go up because when you increase prices on manufacturers, those prices are going to have to be—or when you increase cost on manufacturers by increasing their taxes—those costs are going to have to be passed on to consumers. That will be borne by the middle class, the lower class, it’s going to be inherently inflationary, and that’s the most pernicious tax of all. The Biden Administration seems to be more than happy to create [and] precipitate more and more inflation. We’re also going to have something happen that is the last thing you do when you enter a recession. And, you know, you’ve seen [Senator] Joe Manchin say this in the past, you’ve seen [Senator] Chuck Schumer say this in the past: the last thing you do is raise taxes as you go into a recession. What they want to do is increase the tax burden on manufacturers. That will have the impact of reducing capital investment. That means economic growth slows or reverses. That means fewer jobs. Again, the last thing you do as you enter into a recession.”Hagerty on the CHIPS bill and his semiconductor permitting legislation bolstering America’s national security: “I voted for [CHIPS] because my eye has been on China and the threat that China possesses for the United States. If you think back to what’s happened here in the United States, over the past year and a half with chip shortages right here, we need to get our supply chains back to America, and this bill is aimed at doing just that. It’s got to level the playing field because China and Europe are playing by a different set of rules. That’s the major thrust of this. The plus part of it, those are funds that are authorized, but not yet appropriated. I serve in the Appropriations Committee and I aim to do everything I can to make certain that as those funds are appropriated, they’re done in a manner that’s measurable, that generates a return on investment for taxpayers. I think that’s where we need to be focused, not for short-term political wins or losses, but we’ve got to get—from a national security standpoint—we’ve got to get these supply chains back. We are far too dependent on other nations that don’t have our best interest at heart for critical industries like semiconductor manufacturing. And I’ll add this, Maria, an important piece of legislation came along beside that that I authored, and it makes the investments that we’re talking about actually makes sense. When I called the CEOs of semiconductor manufacturers around the world and asked them, why don’t they make the chips here in America, they had a variety of reasons, but every one of them told me this: It takes five to six years to permit a chip fabrication facility here in America. These are multi-billion dollar plants, a lot of water, a lot of electricity, and many permits—five to six years to permit these facilities. That means that the chips are obsolete by the time they’re ready to be put together and produced. So what this legislation does, that I passed separately, completely compresses that timeline from five to six years down to something closer to 18 months. It forces the bureaucrats to process in parallel rather than in series. This makes sense for America and it will make us competitive again.”###"

Just last month, Argentine authorities allowed a Venezuelan-flagged plane operated by a U.S.-sanctioned Iranian entity to land in Argentina.”“Given the Argentine government’s troubling pattern of association with pariah regimes around the world, your administration should fully support IADB efforts to adhere to strong oversight and due diligence of any new lending to Argentina,” the Senators concluded.A copy of the letter can be found here and below.Dear President Biden:U.S.-funded international financial institutions and multilateral development banks are responsible for ensuring effective developmental aid. The gold standard they provide is the result of decades of congressional and administration efforts to enhance oversight of U.S.-backed lending that may put the American taxpayer at risk.It is our understanding that the government of Argentina is seeking a $500 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), despite ongoing concerns over program funding risks. Given the Argentine government’s long record of defaults and anti-growth economic policies, including under the Fernandez government, the U.S. Treasury should exercise extreme due diligence of any lending to Argentina.In addition to questionable economic and fiscal policies, the government of President Fernandez has engaged in actions that call into question its medium and long-term commitments to transparency, democratic values, and regional security.Just days ahead of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, President Fernandez offered to Vladimir Putin to turn his country into “a gateway for Russia to decisively enter Latin America.” A few days later, Mr. Fernandez signed several agreements to deepen Chinese involvement in Argentina’s economy and national finances. Just last month, Argentine authorities allowed a Venezuelan-flagged plane operated by a U.S.-sanctioned Iranian entity to land in Argentina. The plane carried at least five Iranians, at least one of whom has been identified as a senior member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization.Given the Argentine government’s troubling pattern of association with pariah regimes around the world, your administration should fully support IADB efforts to adhere to strong oversight and due diligence of any new lending to Argentina, and U.S. departments and agencies must make clear that efforts to undermine the necessary standards and conditions will not be tolerated.Sincerely, ###"

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), with co-sponsors Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Angus King (I-Maine). The “yea” votes in the House included 175 Republicans (29 didn’t vote) and 121 Democrats, with only 10 of the latter not voting. All 89 votes in opposition were cast by Democrats.The Senate unanimously approved the measure on Jan. 14. House approval was temporarily delayed by environmental groups that sought to kill it by protesting its consideration under a suspension of the rules.The House started its August recess on July 31, and when it returns in September, the 2022 midterm congressional election campaigns will be in full swing. Congress rarely passes major bills between August and November of election years.The bill amends the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act of 2015 to include in its Section 41 permitting provisions to cut federal red tape in approving new projects for the production of a host of critical digital national security and consumer products, most notably covering construction of new U.S. factories to make semiconductors.Hagerty estimates that his bill will reduce the time frame of the regulatory approval process, which currently can take up to five years, to about 18 months.“I ran for the Senate to increase opportunity and prosperity for American families and to ensure that America wins the competition with the Chinese Communist Party that will define this century,” Hagerty told The Epoch Times following the House vote.“We must end our reliance upon China and reassert our manufacturing independence; our national security depends upon it.“Reducing government red tape will unleash American competitiveness and innovation by promoting faster construction and operation of manufacturing facilities for critical products that we must make in America.”China currently produces 24 percent of all semiconductors, followed by Taiwan at 21 percent, and South Korea at 19 percent. U.S.-based firms such as Intel and Texas Instruments account for 10 percent of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.An estimated 90 percent of the most advanced semiconductors are manufactured by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.In addition to semiconductors, the measure also covers products related to “artificial intelligence and machine learning, high-performance computing and advanced computer hardware and software, quantum information science and technology, data storage and data management, [and] cybersecurity.”If, as expected, Biden signs Hagerty’s bill, it will be the first instance during the current presidency of a freshman Republican senator succeeding in gaining passage of a measure through both the Democratic-controlled Senate and House and then becoming law.Before the House vote, Hagerty’s office circulated a fact sheet containing supportive quotes from a former Donald Trump administration trade expert and top automotive industry executives.“Reducing our economic reliance on China and other foreign nations is critical as America faces strategic economic and national security threats due to this dependence,” said Robert Lighthizer, who was the U.S. trade representative during the Trump administration. “I applaud Senator Hagerty’s leadership and efforts to strengthen our national security, create American jobs, and make our nation competitive again.”The automotive industry executives represent foreign firms that have established major manufacturing facilities in the United States.“Nissan is committed to supporting measures that will help to ease supply chain disruptions and the semiconductor chip shortage, and we appreciate Senator Hagerty’s leadership on national and economic security issues that will address these challenges,” said Andrew Tavi, Nissan Americas’ senior vice president for external affairs. “Senator Hagerty’s support will help ensure the Tennessee and US economies remain strong and grow more independent through investments in semiconductor plants and advanced technology in the U.S.”Anna-Maria Schneider, Volkswagen Group of America’s senior vice president of industry-government relations, said Hagerty’s bill will aid her company’s “success in this market, bringing new state-of-the-art products assembled in Tennessee to U.S. consumers,” which “requires a robust and secure domestic supply chain.”###"

America’s economy and national security cannot afford to be dependent on competitors like China for these critical technologies,” said Senator King. “That is why our bipartisan reforms to encourage the rapid expansion of the domestic semiconductor industry are critical to the nation’s long-term success and stability. This is a commonsense step to support innovation – and, partnered with the historic investments of the CHIPS Act, will make a major impact on American competitiveness in the 21st century economy. I’m grateful to Senator Hagerty for his partnership on this bill and for the overwhelming support it received in both the House and Senate.”“Expanding the FAST-41 permitting process improvements to more projects—especially projects involving semiconductors, technology, and other matters of national security—is common sense,” said Senator Portman. “Over the past six years, the FAST-41 process has substantially reduced the permitting process timeline for covered projects by increasing agency communication and accountability. I’m pleased the House of Representatives has passed this bipartisan legislation to leverage that process to make America more competitive and secure.”The Hagerty-King-Portman legislation will reduce the time it takes to obtain the permitting necessary to build semiconductor and other key manufacturing facilities in the United States, encouraging these projects to locate in the United States. This will not only create American jobs, but shore up supply chains that are essential to U.S. national security and reduce dependence on China and other foreign sources for key products, advancing American leadership in the industries at the heart of the competition with the Chinese Communist Party.Having been passed by both houses of Congress, the bipartisan legislation now heads to the President’s desk.###"

The last thing you do is raise taxes as we enter into a recession. And… I don’t know how the logic changed overnight, but certainly this is a big difference from where we thought Joe was.”Hagerty on the consequences of Democrats’ reckless spending during a recession: “I think it’s going to be very challenging. Again, if you just think about what’s good for America right now, we are not in this place, we’re not ready to absorb this, and I think that there’s a great deal of concern that raising taxes on the people that we need to rely upon to invest more capital and create more jobs at a time that we’ve entered a recession is not the correct path to follow. They’re also talking about their aspects of this plan that’ll basically be government price controls on pharmaceuticals. Again, more of this green energy spending, which you’ve seen what the Biden Administration energy policy has done to the United States of America’s economy. It’s crushed our economy. Gas prices at the pump [are] killing people in Tennessee right now. We commute in Tennessee, and that inflationary spiral has rolled through everything that has to be transported. It’s also had global impact. Global energy prices have risen, and we’ve talked about this before—it’s inadvertently funded Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine. So the energy policies here [have] got to be completely reexamined, and I am very surprised that we see this on the table again.”###"

The Biden Administration has fueled this belief by failing to secure our border and by taking actions to limit interior enforcement. It is clear that the current 10-year penalty is not enough to deter absconders and ensure they comply with their court hearings. “President Biden’s refusal to enforce our immigration laws and support for radical, far-left immigration policies has emboldened lawlessness from day one,” said Senator Hagerty. “I’m pleased to join my colleagues in proposing the commonsense rule that, if you don’t show up for your immigration hearings, you can’t later take advantage of the same immigration system. Record-breaking illegal immigration will not stop until the Biden Administration stops rewarding it.”“Illegal immigrants are abusing current asylum law, living in the country for years before having to appear in immigration court, and then failing to show up,” said Senator Tillis. “The Biden Administration’s failed policies have caused the unprecedented crisis at the southern border, and it’s only getting worse. This legislation cracks down on any illegal immigrant who tries to skirt the law and implements a commonsense bar on obtaining benefits for anyone who fails to show up for their court hearing. This policy is long overdue and it is time we regain control of our border.”Background:Under current law, an illegal immigrant who fails to appear for their immigration court hearing will be deportable and banned from entering the United States for 10 years. Because of the Biden Administration’s failed catch and release policies, the current wait time for an asylum case to be completed is 4 ½ years. Illegal immigrants are taking advantage of our asylum system by making an asylum claim then running out the clock and never showing up for their immigration court hearing. According to a recent Government Accountability Office study, 9 percent of all illegal immigrants enrolled in Alternatives to Detention ultimately absconded. There are over 667,000 asylum seekers in the backlog, meaning potentially tens of thousands of illegal immigrants will continue to break the law and disappear into our communities. ###"

We all know what we’ve been through with the chip shortage here in America over the past 18 months. We need to reshore that supply chain back from China. We’ve become far too dependent on a country that does not have our best interest at heart, and getting these critical semiconductor manufacturing capabilities back in America is my overarching concern. I was also able to negotiate a significant improvement in this bill, and if you think about it, it takes far too long to permit a chip fabrication facility here in America. When I called CEOs and asked them, why weren’t they manufacturing the chips here in America? They told me that it takes up to five years to obtain a permit for chip manufacturing facility here in the United States. The permitting process that I’ve passed, that I’ve got an agreement, a hundred percent agreement here in the Senate, and now House leadership has agreed to pass it, if not this week, as soon as they’re back. This will significantly compress the timeline for permitting, making us far more competitive. My hope is to get that timeline down to about 18 months. That’s going to actually allow us to speed up the implementation of this expansion of supply. It’s going to make this far more effective. And frankly, this is one of the most significant improvements in regulatory process and in permitting process that we’ve seen in years.”Hagerty on reshoring supply chains through his permitting legislation: “My hope is that this process will actually help us incentivize and properly get these supply chains moved back. The manufacturers that I talk to don’t like the strategic position that they are in either. And if you think about what’s happening to industry right here in America, I mean, I was just visiting the GM plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, [there were] long lines of cars there that are waiting [for] the chips. The clients of chip manufacturing firms are not happy with this. We need to reshore this capacity now. The chip manufacturers understand this, and what we’re doing is facilitating that process again, getting these plant facilities in place and vertical much faster with my legislation and the larger legislation that brings certain targeted subsidies to bear, to try to help facilitate that as well […] So I think over time, and this is a mid to long-term fix, but we will be able to put a significant improvement in terms of our own national security and our economic security as we begin to reshore these supply chains.”###"

She’s made her statement clear and frankly, the Congress has stepped up and backed this. We actually increased our defense expenditures above what the White House has asked for. So I think she’s certainly entitled to do this and I don’t think the White House should be finding themselves in an area where they are disagreeing with her just because they have received some complaint from Beijing.”Hagerty on the White House’s lack of a consistent message on Taiwan and confronting the Chinese Communist Party: “[Speaker Nancy] Pelosi makes her plans and then [President] Joe Biden walks it back. Joe Biden three times has said he is going to support Taiwan in the event of an incursion [of] the Taiwan Strait, the White House walks it back. Since Afghanistan, we’ve been sending terrible messages to the Chinese Communist Party. There’s no consistency. I’ll compare this to the Trump Administration who… didn’t ask for permission slip to send my friend Alex Azar there when he was Secretary of Health and Human Services. So this administration needs to be on the same page. They need to get coordinated and we need to have a unified message… we need to be wholly coordinated as we think about an adversary, like the Chinese Communist Party, which in my view is the biggest threat that we face.”Hagerty on the Biden Administration operating from a position of weakness: “We need to be on firm ground [as we deal with China]. I wish that our economy was in a stronger position. I mean, the Biden Administration’s taken every step it can to weaken us from the standpoint of our energy security. Our economic security is in great threat, now partially related to the energy crisis that has been precipitated here. But we have an economy that is not strong. We’re speaking from a position of weakness when it comes to what happened in Afghanistan. We need to get back on our game. We need to be pushing a strong America agenda.”Hagerty on the need for the U.S. to reshore our supply chains and reduce China’s strategic leverage over us: “The amount of funds that we’ve sent from the United States to China have been more than adequate to fund a great expansion in their military. If you think about our dependence and our strategic concerns, there’s chip legislation right now in the Senate that we’re working on right now. We need to reshore these supply chains that are so critical to our high technology industries, to our defense industries and international security and our overall economy. So we’re working on relieving the issue right now. I think corporate America’s had the opportunity to wake up to this as well, because they’ve been the victim of predatory practices by China, whether it’s stealing intellectual property, subsidizing industry, or other means of unfair competition. We need to get these supply chains back to make our nation stronger and give China much less strategic leverage over us.”###"

Together, these two bills promote American leadership in essential industries at the heart of America’s strategic competition with the Chinese Communist Party, and therefore Hagerty intends to support the CHIPS legislation. “I ran for the Senate to advance constructive policy solutions that create jobs for the American people and bolster our national security,” said Senator Hagerty. “My semiconductor legislation to reduce government red tape and unleash American competitiveness, which will be adopted by the House of Representatives in the coming days, will augment the CHIPS package by facilitating faster construction and operation of critical American manufacturing facilities. This will not only create American jobs, but make our Nation more competitive by strengthening the American semiconductor industry and accelerating America’s efforts to win the strategic competition with the Chinese Communist Party that will define the century. This will provide significant regulatory relief for critical American industries during this era of predatory behavior by the CCP.”By reducing the time it takes to obtain the permitting necessary to build chip facilities in the United States, Hagerty’s legislation will create American jobs, improve our supply chains, and fortify our national security by increasing domestic development of these critical sectors. The bipartisan bill complements the CHIPS legislation by improving the permitting process for these new projects so that they will be built in the United States more quickly. A companion bill to Hagerty’s legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives in May and is being led by a bipartisan group that includes Representatives Michael McCaul (R-TX-10), Deborah Ross (D-NC-02), Jake Ellzey (R-TX-06), Steve Cohen (D-TN-09), and Bryan Steil (R-WI-01).###"

I think you look at the estimates of what’s going to happen on Thursday, we’re going to probably read a negative 1.5 percent [Gross Domestic Product] growth. That’s another straight consecutive quarter to quarter decline. That is the technical answer for when we’ve hit a recession, but we have been on the precipice of a recession under [President] Joe Biden, and I cannot imagine that they’re going to have the gall to try to redefine things technically. When you go to people in Tennessee, in my home state, and ask them what they’re feeling, look, the prices at the pump [are] like they’ve never experienced before, going to the grocery store with record high prices there as well. You’ve got massive margin compression for corporate America, you’ve seen the consumer price index, you know, at one level you’ve seen the producer price index much higher. Again, that means margin compression companies [are] going to begin to go bankrupt at a much higher rate. They have thrown us into a recession and the Biden Administration is just trying to get out of this.”Hagerty on the consequences of Biden’s green energy fantasies: “This is their green, new energy theology. This is some sort of non-existent world where the technology is not yet there. It’s not working today, obviously. Yet, they want to go ahead and kill an existing industry that gave us a huge competitive advantage here in America. They’d like to go ahead and kill that. They’d like to enrich our opponents. You think about Russia, Iran, Venezuela, who benefits from all of this. And then longer term, they want to throw the benefit to China because that’s who makes the solar panels and the windmills and the electric batteries that they dream about. But we aren’t there yet. Yet they’re willing to force this ‘transition,’ destroy our economy, and you know who feels it the most, Liz? It’s the most unfortunate in our economy. Joe Biden conducted the biggest bait and switch in American political history. He campaigned as a moderate, somebody that was never going to put a tax on the people that made below $400,000 a year. Who do you think is feeling the pain of this massive inflation, which is the greatest and most pernicious tax of all? It’s the lower and middle classes […] they’re just clinging to something that’s a pipe dream at this point. I’m not against any source of energy, Liz, but it needs to be economically viable. It needs [to] not put our economy into a tailspin. If you think about where we were just two years ago, we were net energy exporters. Now we’re not able to come to the aid of any one of our allies in Europe. Russia has a stranglehold over Germany’s economy and others. We really have put ourselves in a weaker position in every point, and every one of our industries that uses energy as an input factor is now less advantaged. He’s weakened the economy, and this has got to stop.”###"

U.S. alliances and partnerships are essential not only for the defense of the U.S. homeland, but also to our efforts to build and sustain a rules-based international order. In order to keep this balance, the U.S. must prioritize the development and deployment of GLBMs and GLCMs in the Indo-Pacific. The permanent, forward deployment of these weapons would demonstrate a strong commitment to our allies and partners that the U.S. is indeed committed to upholding a free and open Indo-Pacific,” the Senators wrote.A copy of the letter can be found here and below.Dear Secretary Austin:For years, while the United States abided by the terms of arms control agreements from a bygone era, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which is not bound by these agreements, significantly increased its arsenal of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles. According to the 2020 China Military Power Reports produced by your department, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), the CCP’s armed wing, possesses “more than 1,250 ground-launched ballistic missiles (GLBMs) and ground-launched cruise missiles (GLCMs) with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers.” Left unchallenged, the CCP can use its growing missile arsenal to coerce American allies and threaten American interests in the region.The U.S. withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in 2019 provides an opportunity for us to adequately protect our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific from future CCP attempts at nuclear aggression. U.S. alliances and partnerships are essential not only for the defense of the U.S. homeland, but also to our efforts to build and sustain a rules-based international order. In order to keep this balance, the U.S. must prioritize the development and deployment of GLBMs and GLCMs in the Indo-Pacific. The permanent, forward deployment of these weapons would demonstrate a strong commitment to our allies and partners that the U.S. is indeed committed to upholding a free and open Indo-Pacific.The U.S. Department of Defense’s (DoD) Fiscal Year 2023 budget specifically cites more than 100 new intercontinental ballistic missile silos recently built by China and highlights CCP’s growing military power as “the most serious potential threat to the U.S. and its allies.” According to a 2020 assessment submitted by U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) to Congress, INDOPACOM made clear that GLBMs and GLCMS will be critical in breaking through the PLA’s defense systems. According to the report, INDOPACOM needs “highly survivable, precision-strike networks along the first island chain, featuring increased quantities of ground-based weapons.” These capabilities would allow INDOPACOM, in the event of an attack, to ensure that the U.S. and allies maintain freedom of movement in the region by denying an adversary’s efforts to restrict operations in a contested environment.Despite the opportunity afforded by the withdrawal from the INF Treaty, the stated need of INDOPACOM, and the PLA’s growing arsenal of weapons, there has yet to be a serious effort to work with our allies to develop and deploy ground-based ballistic missiles in the Indo-Pacific. Given this glaring lack of action by your department, we request the answers to the following questions:Thank you for your attention to this important matter.Sincerely,"

https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2022/07/20/hagerty-delivers-opening-statement-at-rules-committee-hearing-on-the-disclose-act/,"July 20, 2022WASHINGTON— United States Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), a member of the Senate Rules Committee, today delivered opening remarks at a hearing on the DISCLOSE Act, which would place additional constraints on Americans’ First Amendment rights.Remarks as prepared for delivery:Thank you, Chairwoman Klobuchar.And thank you to all of the witnesses for joining us today.I think we all share the goals of ensuring that our elections are transparent and fair.  But these goals aren’t served by limiting Americans’ First Amendment rights, which is what the DISCLOSE Act would do.First, this bill would require virtually any entity that engages in political speech, including non-profits, to publicly disclose the names and addresses of its significant contributors.  This is a thinly veiled attempt to send the message that, if you support an organization that happens to support causes with which some disagree, you become a target for criticism, harassment, and intimidation—even if your support has nothing to do with the organization’s position on a certain issue.  It would fuel new frontiers of cancel culture and personalization of politics.This tactic is not new.  In 1957, in unanimously striking down an attempt to compel the NAACP to disclose its members, the Supreme Court stated that government-compelled disclosure of group affiliation violates the First Amendment.  The Court recognized the “vital relationship between freedom to associate and privacy in one’s associations.”Just last year, the Supreme Court reaffirmed this principle by holding that California’s attempt to compel non-profits to disclose donor names and addresses was unconstitutional.  Noting that advocacy groups from the ACLU to Americans for Prosperity opposed California’s compelled-disclosure requirement, the Court found that it chilled speech and created a real risk of threats, violence, and harassment. In recent weeks, we’ve seen how personal information can be weaponized, with groups organizing protests at the homes of Supreme Court justices, and even their children’s schools.  One group is even offering bounties to anyone who sights a Justice and reports it, so that protestors can swarm that location.For those who choose to engage in political advocacy, the DISCLOSE Act would open the floodgates to this sort of dangerous behavior. It would require a choice between silence and harassment, and as a result, many would choose not to speak. The First Amendment is expressly intended to prevent this sort of silencing.The bill also creates new, unworkable, and subjective constraints on speech. It would subject virtually any communication—by virtually any entity—that even mentions a candidate or public official, to FEC regulations and donor-disclosure requirements. This legislation would also require speakers to declare whether communications that simply mention a federal official are made in support or opposition to the official, even if the communication is not made in support or opposition to that official.  This would force inaccurate and unconstitutional declarations of allegiance.The bill also includes oppressive new disclosure requirements in order to communicate.  These include requiring non-profit entities and other groups to name in each political communication their top donors and how much money each donated to the organization.  And unbelievably, it requires showing a full-screen image of the person who leads the entity that is making the communication.All of this would infringe upon and discourage free speech.  As a 2021 op-ed from two ACLU lawyers put it, “We know from history that people engaged in politically charged issues become political targets and are often subject to threats of harassment or even violence.”The First Amendment is based on the principle that the remedy for speech with which you disagree is more speech, not forced silence.  Our Constitution creates a free market of ideas—if you disagree with someone’s views, the remedy is to express your own views, not to silence theirs.  Because the DISCLOSE Act promotes intimidation, rather than free speech, I cannot support this legislation.I look forward to hearing the testimony from the witnesses joining us today. Thank you, Chairwoman Klobuchar.###"
https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2022/07/18/icymi-hagerty-joins-maria-bartiromos-wall-street-to-discuss-inflation-bidens-middle-east-visit/,"July 18, 2022NASHVILLE, TN—United States Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Appropriations Committees, joined Maria Bartiromo’s Wall Street on Fox Business to discuss the Democrats’ attempt to tax the American people with their reckless spending amid record inflation and President Joe Biden’s trip to the Middle East.Partial TranscriptHagerty on Democrats’ push to tax Americans facing historic inflation: “It’s amazing how the far left of the Democrat party continues to push and push us toward the cliff of a recession. And [Senator] Chuck Schumer seems to be completely tone deaf in this regard. The Consumer Price Index that came out 9.1 percent this week—I mean, inflation is out of control right now and it’s accelerating, Maria. Then if you think about where we are in terms of our economy, we’re at the precipice of a recession, and this package would’ve just done everything to push it over. Thankfully, [Senator] Joe Manchin has been sober enough within the Democrat party to say, ‘Look, we’ve got to step back, this will be suicidal.’ Does that mean that Chuck Schumer will stop? Probably not, but they’re going to have to trim it down. They’re going to have to find something that Senator Manchin will agree to. But the last thing you would do, Maria, as you head into a recession, when the economy is in this bad of shape, is raise taxes on job creators. And certainly, we don’t need to see any more of this green new energy investment going on, and more regulations that are constraining oil supply and making our economy far worse. The pain at the pump is enormous.”Hagerty on how Democrats want to pay for reconciliation at the expense of the American people: “[The Democrats’] desire to pay for it is to lump more taxes on the backs of Americans, on corporations—who do they think pays these taxes? It’s higher prices, more inflation that they’re going to precipitate through all of this. Less investment is going to occur as well, so the supply chain problems we’re experiencing are not going to get addressed. It’s extremely troubling that they are so detached from reality as they continue to push this stuff forward. It’s a blessing, I think, that if we can get this proposal to raise taxes off the table right now, if we can actually begin to refocus on what’s driving the inflation, which largely has to do with constraining the supply of oil and gas. But I tell you, I was very disappointed this week. I had Interior Secretary Deb Haaland in front of me, and the new Consumer Price Index numbers just came out 9.1 percent. I asked her, how high do gas prices have to get? How much pain does the American public have to feel before they will take their foot off the throat of the oil and gas industry here in America, and begin to allow capacity to expand, to begin to give us some relief? She would not commit at any level to do that. The Administration here is completely out to lunch.”Hagerty on unspent COVID relief money further fueling inflation: “Maria, you are very perceptive to focus on this because you’re exactly right. There’s inflation baked into the pipeline because these state and local governments have not yet deployed the funds that—the massive amount of funds—that have been shoved into their coffers. Again, this all started back in March of 2021 with the Biden Administration and the Democrats, on a wholly partisan basis, shoved through this massive 2 trillion-dollar package. And there is still a great deal of inflation baked in because of the money that still lies in the coffers of these state and local governments that has not yet been put into the economy. When it does come in, it can only do one thing: more upward pressure on prices, more inflation.”Hagerty on Biden’s trip to the Middle East: “My expectations have not been high from the outset. When President Biden ran for office, he said he wanted to make Saudi a pariah state. The conversation that you heard about him insulting the leadership there, I did not think that was a great way to set the ground with important allies in the Middle East. You don’t see that kind of conversation taking place with respect to China with far worse human rights issues there. But suddenly, you’ve got a Biden Administration waking up to the reality that we do have to deal with our allies. The problem is that the Biden Administration has continued to press this Iran deal that makes no sense for America, that is going to be devastating to our allies. And I think that creates an environment and circumstance that makes it very hard for him to make progress. We also are coming from a position of great weakness. If you think about where we were under President Trump, when we thought about America first, rather than leading from behind, we were in a far stronger position to work with our allies and with our adversaries. Now he’s going hat in hand with a terrible economy with gas prices through the roof. We’re not going to do anything domestically to relieve that problem, but he’s going to go and ask them to start pumping more? I think we’re in a very tough situation there. So again, my expectations have not been high about this trip.” ###"

Despite the obvious need to increase American production to address the energy crisis, Haaland refused to commit to taking action.“If you look at gas prices at the pump, they’re at all-time record highs. American families are suffering tremendously right now. Secretary Haaland, you’re responsible for granting oil and gas leases on federal land … Yet on July 1, despite the fact that American families are facing record-high prices, your department announced that it might not issue any new offshore oil and gas leases for the next five years […] At what point will you commit—and I’m asking you to commit—to increase oil and gas production to address the pain that American families are feeling?” Hagerty asked.Haaland evaded Hagerty’s question about whether the Department will encourage more production and instead stated that there are certain existing oil-and-gas leases that are not being used.Hagerty followed up and asked her, “What we need to see to address the pain at the pump right now is an expansion of supply. You have many tools at your disposal, and as the Secretary of the Interior, I’m asking you: Will you commit to use every tool at your disposal to expand oil and gas production at this point given the pain that we’re suffering right now?”Haaland again refused to commit and instead replied: “My job as Interior Secretary is to conserve and manage the natural resources and cultural heritage for every single American, and I said from day one that we would do that in a balanced approach. I feel very confident that our team is looking at every issue. And we’re working to make sure that this is a balanced approach.”After the Secretary refused several more times to commit to helping American families by reducing gas prices and expanding production, Hagerty expressed his incredulity. “I am very disappointed that you’re not able to commit to the simple notion that you should use the authority that you have, Madam Secretary, to expand production now to alleviate the pain for the American public. We are suffering dramatically. Our economy is in tough shape—9.1 percent inflation right now and record high prices,” Hagerty concluded.###"

And while the White House and Democrats are sure to promise this bill will reduce inflation, the obvious truth is that their reckless spending is what catapulted us off the cliff into this abyss of inflation in the first place. For the sake of the people and the country they serve, this Administration needs to put an end to their partisan blame game and stop throwing fuel on the inflationary fire.” ###"

Partial TranscriptHagerty on former Prime Minister Abe’s legacy: “Shinzo Abe was a man that I deeply respected and someone whose friendship I enjoyed. My condolences, my family’s condolences go to his wife, Akie, to his mother, Mrs. Kishi. It’s a tragedy of epic proportions when you think about it, because we’ve lost not only a friend, but a great leader in the region. It was his vision that started the entire Indo-Pacific strategy that we’ve seen both Republican and Democratic administrations follow. The Quad was born from his vision and he has done a great deal in terms of building and strengthening the Alliance between the United States and Japan. I found him to be a terrific partner and without his help, we would’ve never been able to execute our strategy versus North Korea in terms of putting a maximum pressure campaign in place that did a great deal to bring down the temperature eventually and put North Korea into a better place. You think about the loss that we’ve incurred here, it’s beyond just affecting Japan; it’s going to affect the entire region.”Hagerty on the global impact of former Prime Minister Abe’s death: “Japan is the third largest economy in the world after the United States and China. Importantly too, Japan is our strongest military partner. We have more U.S. military troops stationed in Japan than any place else in the world, so they play a consequential role in terms of the geography there, our strategic posture, and the economy. I think that Shinzo Abe’s passing, I hope will not embolden China to become even more aggressive, but you knew with Shinzo Abe and his vision and his leadership that he was going to stand strong against the aggressive posture that Communist China has taken in the region. It was again, his vision that talked about the free and open Indo-Pacific. But I think that the current Prime Minister of Japan, Prime Minister Kishida, is going to continue to press that vision forward. The people of Japan support the vision that Prime Minister Abe laid out. And certainly it’s consistent with the United States’ national security interests.”Hagerty on strengthening the U.S.-Japan Alliance: “We’ve seen consecutive leaders from Prime Minister Suga to Prime Minister Kishida who have continued to follow that vision. And in fact, Japan has stepped up its desire to essentially double its military expenditures. I was just there in April and, in fact, met with Prime Minister Abe, former Prime Minister Abe at that point, along with Senator [Ben] Cardin and Senator [John] Cornyn. We encouraged them not to make it just a spending exercise, but to use those additional funds to work on interoperability with the United States, to make the best of the technology that’s available between our nations, and to do more joint training so that we have the most effective and the most capable force possible to be present in that area so that we can make certain that the whole region remains free and open and push back against the aggression of Communist China.”Hagerty on his Senate-passed semiconductor legislation: “What I’ve been in favor of is something far simpler and something that costs the American public far less [than USICA], and that’s the legislation that I put forward that has passed the Senate. It’s in the House right now. What it does is it dramatically compresses the timeline to permit a semiconductor manufacturing facility here in America. Today, it takes about five years to permit a fabrication facility here. That’s why we don’t have chip plants in America. With my legislation, it takes that timeline down to about 18 months. Does it cost the taxpayers anything? No. Does it require any subsidies? No. Does it have a bunch of Green New Deal things attached to it? Absolutely not. And my hope is that this will pass the House, President Biden will sign it, and this will make America competitive again. It’ll put us in a position to attract the capital that we need to see semiconductor investment happen on a broad-scale basis right here in America.”Hagerty on how to ease inflation and lower energy costs: “The one thing we could do is get back into the energy business, Dave. If you look at what’s driving this inflation, there are a number of factors, but the biggest factor of all is the fact that the current Administration has decided to wage war on the fossil fuel industry right here in America. We went from a position of energy independence where the United States was actually a net exporter of energy, just 18 months ago, to a position now where we are in deep trouble. We’ve seen prices rise across the board. We’re at record highs in terms of gas prices at the pump. Diesel is a real issue here and that’s permeating every aspect of the economy. Goods have to be transported. This is so inflationary, and the answer is right before us: get back into the energy business.”###"

As a result of these shortened windows for critical feedback, market participants are not being provided adequate time to provide effective and meaningful input,” the Senators wrote.The Senators recalled Chair Gensler’s recent testimony before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government in which he claimed that the agency provides the public “always at least two months” to respond to rule proposals. This statement has been proven inaccurate.“Despite your testimony to the contrary, since you became Chair, the SEC has issued at least three rule proposals where the public was given less than two months to respond. The first and most egregious example of the SEC’s failure to provide adequate time to comment was the SEC’s Proxy Voting Advice proposal. The Commission voted to propose that rule (by a 3 to 2 vote) on November 17, 2021, and the comment period closed on December 27, 2021… In addition to the Proxy Voting Advice proposal, the public was also given less than two months to comment on the SEC’s Electronic Recordkeeping Requirements for Broker-Dealers, Security-Based Swap Dealers, and Major Security-Based Swap Participants proposal and the Commission’s Form PF proposal. Despite providing less than two months to comment on the Form PF proposal, you recently declined a request from a bipartisan group of forty-seven Members of Congress to reopen the comment period on that proposal,” the Senators continued.In light of these facts and the agency’s attempt to evade public comment, the Senators are requesting that Gensler reopen the comment period on each of the listed proposals to ensure that the public has adequate time to comment.“If you choose not to reopen the comment periods for these three proposals, we request that you reply to this letter with an explanation of the basis for your decision and an explanation for why your testimony included inaccurate statements about the SEC’s track record during your tenure for providing the public with adequate notice and a reasonable opportunity to comment on the agency’s proposed rulemaking,” the Senators concluded.A copy of the letter to Chair Gensler can be found here and below.Chair Gensler,In recent months, both Republican and Democrat Members of Congress have repeatedly raised concerns about the length of comment periods the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is providing for a number of SEC rule proposals.  As a result of these shortened windows for critical feedback, market participants are not being provided adequate time to provide effective and meaningful input.During your recent appearance before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government, you received several questions on this topic and stated that “we put out things on our website and say there will be a minimum of two months, 60 days, from when we put them on the website, or because there’s a delay often getting in the Federal Register, 30 days from when it’s in the Federal Register, the longer of that. So it’s always at least two months.”  Unfortunately, this is not accurate.Despite your testimony to the contrary, since you became Chair, the SEC has issued at least three rule proposals where the public was given less than two months to respond.  The first and most egregious example of the SEC’s failure to provide adequate time to comment was the SEC’s Proxy Voting Advice proposal. The Commission voted to propose that rule (by a 3 to 2 vote) on November 17, 2021, and the comment period closed on December 27, 2021.  Not only was this forty-day comment period far short of the two months you testified had been given, but the forty days encompassed both the Thanksgiving and December holiday periods.In addition to the Proxy Voting Advice proposal, the public was also given less than two months to comment on the SEC’s Electronic Recordkeeping Requirements for Broker-Dealers, Security-Based Swap Dealers, and Major Security-Based Swap Participants proposal and the Commission’s Form PF proposal. Despite providing less than two months to comment on the Form PF proposal, you recently declined a request from a bipartisan group of forty-seven Members of Congress to reopen the comment period on that proposal.In your aforementioned testimony, you also indicated that by giving the public at least 60 days to comment, the SEC was “giving adequate time for the public to comment.”  Given that the SEC failed to give the public 60 days to comment on the three proposals referenced above despite your testimony to the contrary, we urge you to reopen the comment period on each of these proposals to ensure that the public has adequate time to comment and that your testimony is accurate.  If you choose not to reopen the comment periods for these three proposals, we request that you reply to this letter with an explanation of the basis for your decision and an explanation for why your testimony included inaccurate statements about the SEC’s track record during your tenure for providing the public with adequate notice and a reasonable opportunity to comment on the agency’s proposed rulemaking.Sincerely,###"

Will this finally be enough to get Congress to act to better protect the Justices and their families?The Senate returns Monday after a two-week recess, and the first order of business should be passing legislation that funds security to protect the Justices’ families. House Democrats waylaid the bill before the break in what seemed to be an act of spite for the decision overturning Roe v. Wade.House Democrats begrudgingly passed a Senate bill in June to extend police protection to the Justices’ immediate families, though only after a man with a gun, knife and burglary tools was arrested outside Justice Kavanaugh’s Maryland home. Twenty-seven Democrats voted against the bill.But Congress also must provide the resources to fund the expanded protection. The Senate by unanimous consent passed a bill that provides the U.S. Marshals Service and Supreme Court an additional $19.4 million to cover increased security costs. Democratic Sen. Mark Warner (Va.) and Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty (Tenn.) beseeched House leaders to pass the bill before adjourning last month. “The need for and urgency of this security funding is plain,” they wrote. Speaker Nancy Pelosi apparently disagreed. Rather than send a clean bill straight to Mr. Biden’s desk, House Democrats added two unrelated amendments that require the legislation to go back to the Senate for another vote. Yet the Senate had adjourned for two weeks, so the soonest it can vote on the legislation is July 11, which is Monday.One amendment imposes a 75-cent excise tax on Covid-19 vaccines to fund the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which is in no imminent danger of going broke. The other declares that it is the “sense of Congress” that the cost of insulin is “often prohibitive” and can “lower medication use.” Both measures enjoy bipartisan support, but they’re extraneous to the security bill. Perhaps Democrats were trying to spite the Justices while dodging accusations of partisanship. As a friend once advised, when you’re trying to figure out political motives, think lower.###"

https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2022/06/26/icymi-hagerty-joins-sunday-morning-futures-to-discuss-bidens-energy-crisis/,"June 26, 2022NASHVILLE, TN—United States Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), a member of the Senate Banking Committee, today joined Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News to discuss the ramifications of President Joe Biden’s anti-American-energy policies here at home and around the globe.Partial TranscriptHagerty on Germany’s reversal of green energy policies and Biden’s energy crisis in America: “It doesn’t surprise me at all that Germany is taking this posture. Look, they foolheartedly went in and they killed their nuclear energy. They got way over their skis in this green agenda, and they’ve realized that it doesn’t work. They’re going back to reopening coal fire plants right now. And by the way, Maria, Germany never met its obligations under the Paris Climate Accord. America exceeded our obligations, even though we pulled out of it. So, I think Germany is acknowledging the harsh reality that these green policies do not work. The technology isn’t there, and it’s inherently inflationary, and it’s made a huge national security issue for Germany, for all of Europe, and it’s happening right here at home as well. When [President Joe] Biden talks about inflation here and he’s doing all he can, what he’s done is wage a regulatory war on American industry, particularly on the oil and gas industry. And by suppressing supply with all of these regulations, by killing any incentive to invest, at the same time massive stimulus spending that we saw come through in that March 2021 bill, you know, you’re compressing supply, you’re increasing demand—there’s only one way to go: that’s prices have to go up. And this has been unprecedented 40-year highs in terms of inflation right now. And if you look beneath those numbers, Maria, it’s accelerating.”Hagerty on the consequences of Biden’s war on American energy: “Inflation is still in the pipeline because these [COVID-19 relief] funds have not yet been spent. So, there’s more stimulus dollars sitting in these state coffers that are getting ready to pile into the economy again. And the Biden Administration will not take its foot off of American industry—more regulations, more constraints. And particularly when it comes to our energy policy, Maria, you and I’ve talked about this before; Biden waged war on the American industry—energy industry—from the day he came into office. That’s had the effect not only to drive energy prices through the roof; you think about what’s going to happen this 4th of July—empty tanks, empty wallets, largely due to the increase in energy costs here in America. But it’s had a broader effect on energy prices on a global basis, and that’s had the impact of benefiting Vladimir Putin. We’re inadvertently funding his war on Ukraine. This has got to stop.”Hagerty on Biden’s anti-American-energy policies funding Putin’s war machine: “I’m pleased to see more and more people coming out and talking about this harsh reality. Again, Biden is pursuing this theology of green energy, and he’s doing this without any regard to the real consequences. And again, he’s causing massive inflation here at home, and he’s putting us in a position where we’ve got war happening in Europe thanks to these backward-looking policies.”Hagerty on how the Biden Administration’s policies have precipitated America’s energy crisis: “You think about the investments that have to be put in place to continue to maintain supply here in America. These are 10-year investments, multi-billion-dollar investments, and CEOs and boards of these large energy companies can’t follow their fiduciary duty if they know that the Biden Administration has declared that by 2030, in eight years, they want to see an end to the fossil fuel industry. So, this is a terrible environment for investing in continued capacity. You look at what Biden’s EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] has recently done with the small refinery exemptions. They’ve gone back and retroactively withdrawn 2018 small refinery exemptions and imposed retroactive billion-dollar fines on these small refineries. They’re going to go out of business. So, we’re constraining supply at every point. It’s no surprise that prices are going through the roof, and we’re making ourselves far more vulnerable. So now, Joe Biden’s talking about going to the Middle East to genuflect, to, before the UAE [United Arab Emirates] and Saudi Arabia, to get them to pump more. He’s even sent a team down to Venezuela to deal with [Nicolás] Maduro, an international terrorist and a killer. He’s working on the Iran deal again. And you look at Biden; he’s looking at these international killers and terrorists. He’s looking to other countries that may not have our best interest at heart. He’d rather make us more dependent on them than look right here in our own backyard, where we could launch a resurgent domestic energy production. We could actually come to the aid of our allies, increase our own national security, and make us better allies for them as well.”###"

I worked very often with then-Prime Minister Abe on this topic. I support our current Ambassador [Rahm] Emanuel as he works with current Prime Minister Kishida in the same arena—it’s very important.”“As the United States advances its NATO policy in the 21st century, I believe it’s going to be important to get back to the basics,” Hagerty stressed. “And there, I mean, in the very first instance, NATO is a military Alliance that needs to focus on deterring military threats with real military capabilities. And if the last year has demonstrated anything, it’s that the NATO Alliance must stand stronger to better deter Russia’s military threat to us and to our Allies.”In response to Hagerty’s question on when Finland and Sweden respectively would meet the goals of spending two percent of GDP on defense, Assistant Secretary Wallander confirmed that Finland is already meeting the two-percent goal, and Sweden has committed to meeting the two-percent pledge no later than 2028.Hagerty also sought clarity from Assistant Secretary Wallander about future capabilities Finland and Sweden would bring to NATO. “Certainly one of the, one of the hopes would be that both countries would contribute, and I believe will contribute, to the battle groups on the Eastern flank, the eight Eastern front countries of NATO. Finland and Sweden both have very strong bilateral relations with the Baltic countries in particular. And they, Sweden and Finland, can become not just strong defense partners of, or allies of the Alliance, but strong contributors as those countries face Russian aggression right on their borders,” Wallander responded.Hagerty also challenged these officials to defund Vladimir Putin’s war machine.“The Biden Administration’s energy policies have perversely helped to fund Putin’s war machine in Ukraine,” Hagerty told Assistant Secretary Donfried.“Russia has actually had a massive increase in its revenues from oil sales—just in the first five months of this year, its oil sales are up close to 100 billion dollars” despite massive international sanctions, Hagerty added. “That’s more than enough—in fact, almost one-and-a-half times Russia’s annual military budget.“So, in effect, we are inadvertently funding Vladimir Putin’s war machine,” Hagerty warned. “And I want to encourage you to please take the message back home that when President Biden decided to wage the war on fossil fuels here in America, it has a global impact—and that global impact not only hurts American consumers here at home, but it also is hurting the brave Ukrainians that are trying to fight right now because they’re also a casualty of President Biden’s anti-energy policies.”###"

The Hagerty-Warner emergency funding bill, which provides an additional $10.3 million to the U.S. Marshals Service and $9.1 million to the U.S. Supreme Court, passed unanimously yesterday in the Senate. Remarks as PreparedMr. President, I rise today to highlight and speak in support of the Supreme Court Security Funding Act of 2022, which I introduced with Senator Warner last week.  Last evening, the Senate approved by unanimous consent this bipartisan legislation, which provides emergency security resources to the Supreme Court of the United States and to the U.S. Marshals Service.  The House of Representatives must approve this bill without amendment or delay and send it to the President’s desk—before adjourning this week.  The need and urgency is obvious.There is no question that the Supreme Court, its justices, their families, and court employees are under unprecedented and unexpected threat.  This includes recent highly publicized threats against Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Sotomayor.  These threats may very well become more acute in the coming weeks, as the Court concludes its term. There is no question that protecting the Court from these threats requires additional resources in Fiscal Year 2022 because unexpected resources are being deployed.  This legislation provides those necessary resources.  More specifically, the U.S. Marshals Service has been providing around-the-clock security for the nine Justices at their homes and needs $10.3 million in emergency funding to cover these costs for the remainder of this fiscal year.  The Supreme Court needs $9.1 million to cover its increased security costs for this fiscal year.  These include overtime pay for Supreme Court Police officers, mutual-aid payments to assisting law enforcement agencies, and increased physical security around the Supreme Court Building.If Congress does not immediately provide this funding, the Court and Marshals Service may be forced to transfer funds from other critical functions and entities, like the U.S. District Courts and U.S. Courts of Appeals.  That is an unacceptable outcome given the obvious and urgent need for this security funding and the gravity of the threat against one of our three constitutional branches of government.Congress recently passed—and the President signed into law—legislation by Senators Cornyn and Coons to increase the scope of authorized Supreme Court Police protection to include the justices’ immediate family members.  Congress rightly provided this additional security authorization to protect the Court. These expanded authorities are important, but there should be no question regarding whether Congress will separately provide the resources necessary to protect the Supreme Court during this hour of need.  I thank my colleague from Virginia, Senator Warner, for working with me on this legislation.  I also want to thank the Senior Senator from Alabama, Vice Chairman Shelby and his staff, as well as the Senior Senator from Vermont, Chairman Leahy, for their help and guidance.  Finally, I thank my Senate colleagues for their cooperation in ensuring the swift passage of this legislation in the Senate.  Now, I urge the House of Representatives to promptly send this bill to the President’s desk before it adjourns later this week. Mr. President, I yield the floor.  ###"

This decision is wholly inconsistent with the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995that Congress passed into law and has repeatedly reaffirmed with overwhelming bipartisan support over the years. We strongly supported the Trump Administration’s decision to fully and faithfully implement the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 by formally recognizing Jerusalem as the eternal and undivided capital of Israel, by moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and by closing the U.S. Consulate General for the Palestinians in Jerusalem and merging its functions into the U.S. Embassy’s ‘Palestinian Affairs Unit’ within one diplomatic mission under the authority the U.S. Ambassador to Israel. The Biden Administration’s disregard for that law, however, undermines our nation’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and signals support for dividing Jerusalem.“Let there be no misunderstanding: this unprecedented arrangement—to turn the Palestinian Affairs Unit into a ‘U.S. Office of Palestinian Affairs’ that will no longer report to the U.S. Ambassador to Israel but instead report directly to the State Department in Washington, D.C., and to appoint a Special Envoy to the Palestinians—is an effort to open an unofficial and de facto U.S. consulate to the Palestinians in Jerusalem. In fact, the Biden Administration admits this decision is one step closer to opening an official U.S. consulate, a plan it refuses to stop pushing despite the Government of Israel’s adamant opposition and Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Brian McKeon’s admission to Congress in October 2021 that the United States, under international law, would ‘need to get the consent of the host government to open any diplomatic facility.’“The Biden Administration’s decision is wrong and not how America should treat Israel, one of our closest allies in the world. As sponsors of the Upholding the 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Law Act of 2021 to withhold funding for a U.S. consulate to the Palestinians in Israel’s capital, we unequivocally oppose the Biden Administration’s decision and will use every tool at our disposal to stop it in the 117th Congress and afterwards.”Led by Hagerty, 34 senators signed the joint statement: Thom Tillis (NC), Marco Rubio (FL), Bill Cassidy (LA), Ted Cruz (TX), Mike Lee (UT), John Hoeven (ND), Chuck Grassley (IA), Tim Scott (SC), Cindy Hyde-Smith (MS), Roger Marshall, M.D. (KS), John Cornyn (TX), Roger F.

And what that, in fact, does, is it puts the American taxpayer in the hook because we get a long position on these securities. Every time rates go up, the value of those bonds go down. That’s the position we find ourselves in now. Again, the 330 billion number back in March is probably half a trillion at this point in time. So, we have a substantial loss in the balance sheet. When I questioned the Fed chairman [Jay Powell], he told me that they are not at a point yet to be selling these mortgage-backed securities, but he did not eliminate the possibility that he may sell them and sell them at a loss. I think he’s been put in a very difficult situation. I wish that they’d gone back and started easing the quantitative, you know, started easing this pressure on the balance sheet much, much earlier than they did. And we find ourselves in a very tough situation right now. I think it shows the dangers of quantitative easing when you find the taxpayers in this situation, where we’ve got, at this point, I think more than half a billion dollars or half a trillion dollars’ worth of exposure in the negative.”Hagerty on Powell debunking the Administration’s “Putin’s price hike” misinformation: “I think that’s the tight rope that the Fed chairman and his federal open market committee are trying to walk right now, is to bring inflation down, at the same time, not push us over the precipice into recession, but let’s be clear about what’s causing this: I think Jay Powell’s job has been made far more difficult by the policies of the Biden Administration. The fiscal policies are creating a tremendously inflationary environment. And when I asked the Fed chair point blank whether [Vladimir] Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was the primary cause of this—which is what the White House continues to say: it’s Putin’s price hike—the Fed chair could have been no more clear: it’s not the primary cause. In fact, if you look at where we were in January of last year when Biden took office, inflation was at 1.4 percent. By the time we got to December of 2021, it was already at 7 percent as more stimulus money went into the economy. More regulations came into constrained supply. And if you think about it, only an additional 1.6 percent increase has occurred since Putin invaded Ukraine. So now we’re at 8.6 percent versus 7 percent in January before the invasion took place. Clearly this is a falsehood that’s being perpetuated by the Biden Administration. The real root cause of the inflation are these policies, particularly the war that the Biden Administration is waging on American energy right now.”Hagerty on unspent stimulus money worsening inflation: “I’ll remind you of this: a number of states still have unspent stimulus money in their accounts. So, the chamber is still loaded with stimulus money that’s going to continue to pour into the economy. This is not going to stop anytime soon. I’d like to see those funds be reverted to the Treasury [Department]. It will not happen. The Democrats won’t support that. So, we’ve still got more stimulus spending loaded in the chamber thanks to the fact that these funds are still unspent and are on the state’s balance sheets.”Hagerty on Biden’s call for a federal gas tax holiday: “I don’t [favor a gas tax moratorium]. I find myself in the odd position of actually agreeing with former President Barack Obama. President Obama called this type of move a gimmick. This is an election year gimmick, clearly. This is probably a moratorium that, you know, the Biden Administration hopes will ease the pain leading into the midterm elections. The American public is too smart for this. What are we going to do about the lost funding for infrastructure that occurs in the meantime? I’m not supportive of this, and I think that it’s going to create, you know, just yet another knock-on problem down the road for us.”Hagerty on how to end the energy crisis: “I think if you look at the letter that the CEO of Chevron just sent back to the White House after the White House attacked the CEOs of oil companies here in America, that basically states the case. We’ve got to create the environment here in America where capital will actually be rewarded to make the type of multi-billion-dollar long-term investments required to expand refinery capacity, drilling capacity. We need more pipelines. That should be the goal of the Biden Administration, is to create the right environment for all of the above sorts of energy. Whether it’s oil and gas, whether it’s alternate energy sources, whether it’s nuclear from my home state of Tennessee, we need to be looking at all of the above and creating the right environment for capital investment there. Instead, the Biden Administration is doing everything to signal the market that any investment in oil and gas is going to be punished severely. And from a regulatory standpoint, they’re not granting permits. They’ve gone back and retroactively removed exemptions and imposed punitive fines on refineries. I mean, they’ve made it very, very difficult to be in the oil and gas business here in America today. And the results are showing. I mean, we were in a position where we were actually net exporters of energy in the previous Administration. And now we are far weaker from a national security standpoint. We cannot come to the aid of our allies, and we find ourselves with rampant inflation driven, as you mentioned, by a rapid increase in oil prices and gasoline prices at the pump […] This needs to be a wholesale, you know, review of the entire regulatory clamp down that the Biden Administration has imposed. And if you think about it, just recently, they shut down a million-acre lease in Alaska. They shut down leases in the Gulf. So, they’re talking on one side about some sort of gimmick to, you know, lower taxes on gasoline. But at the same time, they’re imposing policies that are constraining supply, and again, inherently inflationary, driving those prices up.”Hagerty on the Senate gun control legislation: “I think when you get into the way the language is worded, particularly vague around some of the red flag law provisions, what it does is it provides, you know, unelected bureaucrats and judges a great deal of autonomy to determine how they’re going to restrict Americans’ Second Amendment rights. That’s a problem for me. And I think it’ll be a problem for many of my colleagues. As you said, there are parts of the bill, whether it has to do with mental health, behavioral health, hardening schools that I think we can address, but the red flag law component of it, I think has got some real issues […] I haven’t seen the type [of red flag law] that I would support at this point. You think about it—New York had a red flag law in place and it didn’t do anything to stop that shooting there either […] I think the key question for me, and I think it is for many of us here, is it needs to be done in a way that it does not constrain our fundamental, constitutional rights. And that’s the concern that I have.”###"

The Biden Administration is reportedly considering removing the tariffs as a misguided way of responding to historic inflation that its policies and spending have inflicted.“I’d like to talk about the negotiating leverage that those tariffs provide. I can tell you from personal experience that when those tariffs were imposed on China, that it was felt around the world… Ambassador Tai, I understand that China’s not living up to the commitments that it’s made under phase one. You’ve talked about that at length. My question for you is, wouldn’t removing these tariffs simply encourage more bad behavior? What kind of message would it send to China?” Hagerty asked.Hagerty went on to note that the tariffs, when imposed, did not lead to inflation, and removing them would unlikely affect current inflation, but would weaken our negotiating leverage against China, which could be disastrous. Tai agreed.“The China tariffs are, in my view, a significant piece of leverage—and a trade negotiator never walks away from leverage,” Tai said. ###"
https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2022/06/22/fed-chair-to-hagerty-inflation-was-high-before-certainly-before-the-war-in-ukraine-broke-out/,"June 22, 2022WASHINGTON—United States Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), a member of the Senate Banking Committee, today secured an answer from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that debunks the misinformation messaging coming from President Joe Biden and his Administration that Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is the cause of historic inflation—the so-called “Putin Price Hike.”Hagerty acknowledged to Powell that a number of factors have led to this historic inflation, including supply chain disruptions, overregulation, rising inflation expectations, and excessive fiscal spending, but no one can dispute the rate with which inflation has risen.“In January of 2021, inflation was at 1.4 percent. By December of 2021, it had risen to 7 percent—a fivefold increase. Now, since the war in Ukraine began in late February, the rate of inflation has risen incrementally another 1.6 percent to a current level of 8.6 percent…Given how inflation has escalated over the past 18 months, would you say that the war in Ukraine is the primary driver of inflation in America?” Hagerty asked.Powell responded, “No, inflation was high before, certainly before the war in Ukraine broke out.” Hagerty praised Powell for acknowledging the truth and helping expose this misinformation coming from the Biden Administration.“I’m glad to hear you say that. The Biden Administration seems to be intent on deflecting blame and, as recently as just this past Sunday, spread the misinformation that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is the ‘biggest single driver of inflation.’ I’m glad you agree with me that that is not the truth,” Hagerty said.###"

He’s got to find a way to thread the needle to deal with a challenging set of fiscal policies here in America, a challenging set of constraints around the globe, and the fact that the Fed [Federal Reserve] has gotten behind the curve. I was asking Chair Powell more than a year ago to begin the process of unwinding this balance sheet. I want to understand how that’s going now that they’ve finally gotten around to doing it a year later, but he’s got to move carefully. We’re at the precipice of a recession right now. I think he finds himself at a very challenging point, and I’m very interested to hear about the tools that he’s going to use, the pace that he’s going to deploy them, and again, how he’s going to navigate a very challenging set of fiscal challenges presented by this Administration, primarily with respect to their war on oil and gas here in America.”Hagerty on Biden’s anti-American-energy policies fueling inflation: “I think [Senator] Joe Manchin is correct. The stimulus came—the most recent stimulus in March of 2021—came at a time when the economy was already reacting in a very positive manner. It was moving in the right direction. That [stimulus] caused an immediate overheating. I warned about this at that point in time. It was inherently inflationary. That stimulus was not needed at that point in time, and it was like throwing fuel on the fire. But I think the deeper cause right here are the policies that the Biden Administration has put in place that essentially has waged war on the oil and gas industry. If you think about it—whether it’s gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel—every aspect of that economy—the oil and gas economy—has been driven upward, and that’s had a very devastating impact on inflation here in America because every good has to be transported. You think about what’s happened with diesel fuel. Everybody in my home state of Tennessee’s got to drive to work. This is extraordinarily painful, and every American right now looks at the pain they’re feeling at the pump, and whether it’s the tourism industry, which is very big in my state, people have got to fly in with much more expensive jet fuel, or drive, it’s extraordinarily painful right now.”Hagerty on Biden’s reported call for a gas tax holiday: “To be fair, before the Biden Administration came into office, we were looking at gas prices that were just above $2 a gallon. If you think about our own domestic economy, we were energy independent, were actually at a point where we were exporting energy from America. So, this has been self-inflicted. And the gas tax holiday that’s being discussed right now may have a short-term impact—I’m sure it’s been poll tested—but this is a political gimmick. Even Barack Obama described a play like this as a political gimmick designed for the midterm elections. It’s not going to have a long-term impact.”Hagerty on what could be done to bring down gas prices and curtail inflation: “There is a lot that can be done, but again, you have to set aside the rhetoric of this Administration and go back to what’s happened. The small refinery exemptions that were taken away back from… several years ago under the Trump Administration, retroactive penalties were imposed on small refineries. It’s going to put those refineries out of business. We are very tight on refinery capacity right now. There’s simple things that we can do in terms of changing the blending rules that will have a dramatic impact on our capacity. But we also need to send a strong message to the capital markets that this Administration is not going to attack any return on investment. Again, this very clear message has been sent from the Biden Administration that they’re going to deny any sort of long-term investment in the oil and gas industry, a return on that investment. So, we need to get back and send a very clear and strong message that oil and gas production is going to be supported. It should be an all of the above approach to energy here in America. I’m not against alternate energy. Certainly, we’ve got a lot of activity and a lot of innovation that’s taking place there, but we should not be killing oil and gas in the meantime.”###"

We cannot make it without fossil fuels as a nation. They’re trying to push us into more dependency on countries like China who make the solar panels and who make the windmills. What about the lithium that we need if we go to electronic vehicles? And by the way, we don’t have the infrastructure to do that, even if we wanted to. Again, this is an alternate reality that Joe Biden lives in. It will not work, but in the meantime, America is suffering greatly. As you mentioned, it takes away our energy independence—that’s our national security, Larry. We’re becoming more and more dependent every day on other nations that don’t have our best interest at heart, every day that Joe Biden continues to wage this war on American energy.”Hagerty on reports that Biden is considering a gas tax holiday: “This is nothing but a midterm election gimmick. They’re trying to buy votes right now with this. And you know, I think it’ll give perhaps some very-near-term relief to the people at the pump, but it doesn’t fix the inherent problem. The inherent problem is that Biden is doing everything he can to crush supply in the demand-supply equation. That’s what’s driven prices through the roof. It’s not Vladimir Putin. It’s not anything else. It’s Joe Biden’s policies, a deep regulatory state that’s attacking the industry—the oil and gas industry—whether it be financial regs, whether it be the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] regs, you name it; they’re depressing supply with a regulatory construct. They’re killing any capital inflow that comes into the industry. And you know, a short-term gimmick like this is just nothing but that. Very shortsighted. It will not fix the inherent problem. If they go to a tax, particularly if they go to an excess tax on a problem that they’ve created, it’s as you said, as Art Laffer always says: you want less of something, tax it more. That’s not going to be a fix either […] And if you get down to the root cause of anything that they might denominate as an excess profit, it’s the fact that they are starving any incentive to reinvest capital in the American oil and gas industry. If you’re not reinvesting, your depreciation line’s going to inherently, you know, by definition, go down. So, you may have a short-term increase, but they don’t have an outlet to invest their profits right now. That’s what we should be doing is reinvesting in American energy. Biden is creating every disincentive to do that.”Hagerty on Biden’s reported gas rebate card plan: “I’ve still heard about this, this rebate idea. Again, it’s just another form of stimulus. Again, more inflation. It also doesn’t get at the root problem of fixing the supply. So, they’re looking at every way they can to buy votes ahead of the midterm election. I think that’s the only signal we can take from this, Larry.”Hagerty on the repercussions of the Biden Administration’s green energy pursuit: “You’re spot on, Larry… they talked about this on his trip to Asia—[Biden said] we’re going to go through this terrible transformation. […] But this [green energy] transformation is going to be very painful in the short to medium term. What he leaves out is the fact that we are going to wind up in a much deeper strategic pit than we already are in with his leadership. This transformation isn’t working, and it’s not going to work because the technology isn’t there, the infrastructure is not there, and again, it makes us more dependent on countries like China that do have the capacity to produce the solar panels, to produce the wind turbines, and to produce the lithium that we don’t have present here in America. You know, it just makes us long for the day… when you were our national economic advisor, when our national security was much stronger, when gas prices were less than half of what they are today. I mean, you talk about a gas tax holiday today, I guess every day under President Trump’s leadership was a tax holiday—a gas tax holiday—because we enjoyed far lower prices then.”Hagerty on what could be done to lower gas prices and reduce inflation: “Well, the answer’s right at our doorstep: if we could just stop waging war on the American energy industry. Biden has the tools to do that, but he will not do it. That’s the most inflationary component of all of his backwards-looking policies is the fact that he continues to wage this war on energy. Energy is an input factor for so many things in our economy. That’s what’s the driving force behind this inflation, as you’ve mentioned, you know, many times before, this is funding Putin’s war machine against Ukraine, it is weakening us from a national security standpoint, and Biden continues and persists at pursuing this blind green new deal policy again, to the great detriment to the American public.”Hagerty on the reported revival of Democrats’ so-called Build Back Better: “I’ve heard the rumors that you have, Larry. But again, only rumors. I’ve seen no text, but it’s very hard for me to believe that [Senator] Joe Manchin, who actually held the line before, would look at doing something like this at this point. He was concerned about inflation earlier when he turned down the $3.5 trillion package that probably would’ve been five or six trillion. Now we’ve seen these policies manifest themselves and we’re looking at record levels of inflation right now, and that inflation is accelerating. So, I have a hard time believing that Senator Manchin would go to a policy that would again, raise corporate taxes that’ll be just passed through to the consumers again, more inflation, and any stimulus spending that they’re talking about in terms of this green new deal policy, again, inherently inflationary, and particularly if it constrains supply of energy, it’s going to drive prices up even further. I can’t believe that Joe Manchin would want to do that.”###"

The president’s decision also undermines an ongoing investigation by the Department of Commerce into efforts by Chinese solar companies to circumvent our Antidumping and Countervailing Duty (AD/CVD) orders against Chinese-made solar cells and modules by moving manufacturing to countries like Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.“Already the United States is over-reliant on China for solar power. Currently, 80 percent of our solar panels come from China or Chinese companies, and this reliance is not market-based. China has used a variety of anti-free market practices, such as industrial subsidies, to come to dominate the solar sector. This is why the United States imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) orders on unfairly traded solar panel imports from China as early as 2012. It is also why the Department of Commerce is actively investigating circumvention of those AD/CVD orders by solar panel producers and exporters in Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. The unprecedented and sweeping tariff moratorium prioritizes foreign solar panels over those made in the United States. We cannot afford to trade dependence on Russian energy for that of Chinese solar panels. It is counter to the national interest to rely on our adversaries for our energy needs,” the Senators wrote.“…we are disappointed that the climate change agenda has proven to be an effective means to pre-empt and nullify the legitimate claims of U.S. workers and industry before they can be fully considered through the ongoing investigation by your Department of Commerce. To honor those claims, we urge you to end the self-imposed emergency declaration and let the Commerce Department investigation proceed unimpeded so as not to further increase our economic reliance on China,” the Senators continued.A copy of the letter can be found here and below.Dear President Biden:We write to express our concern about your emergency declaration, which imposes a two-year tariff moratorium on imported solar panels. We believe this decision increases our dependence on China, rewards unfair trade practices, including labor and human rights violations, undermines American jobs, and represents executive branch overreach.Already the United States is over-reliant on China for solar power. Currently, 80 percent of our solar panels come from China or Chinese companies, and this reliance is not market-based. China has used a variety of anti-free market practices, such as industrial subsidies, to come to dominate the solar sector. This is why the United States imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) orders on unfairly traded solar panel imports from China as early as 2012. It is also why the Department of Commerce is actively investigating circumvention of those AD/CVD orders by solar panel producers and exporters in Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. The unprecedented and sweeping tariff moratorium prioritizes foreign solar panels over those made in the United States. We cannot afford to trade dependence on Russian energy for that of Chinese solar panels. It is counter to the national interest to rely on our adversaries for our energy needs.The tariff moratorium also rewards unfair trade practices which costs U.S. jobs. Fundamentally, the ongoing anti-circumvention investigation is about upholding U.S. law. The Department of Commerce is engaged in a serious, quasi-judicial process to determine whether U.S. law has been violated. To disfigure that process as the result of outside political pressure and climate activism signals to China that our laws are malleable for the right price. The fact that it was considered necessary to preempt the results of the Commerce investigation—which may reach a preliminary determination as soon as August 30, 2022—suggests that the facts of this investigation favor the domestic solar manufacturing industry and not the Chinese companies alleged to have circumvented U.S. law. Our duty is to workers making products in America. A giveaway like this only serves to undermine jobs here in the United States while giving a pass to those using forced Uyghur labor to make these products.Finally, the use of an emergency declaration to effectuate the moratorium is an overreach. Where the statute speaks of waiving tariffs on “food, clothing, and medical, surgical, and other supplies for use in emergency relief work”, the emergency declaration translates those words into the language of climate catastrophe. The declaration transforms a solar panel into something to be eaten, worn, or used in a hospital to treat the sick. Importantly, official import data show no shortage of solar panels with official data showing a year-over-year increase in imports from the circumventing country sources. And solar projects have been announced since the investigation began, demonstrating that reliable supply exists. In closing, we are disappointed that the climate change agenda has proven to be an effective means to pre-empt and nullify the legitimate claims of U.S. workers and industry before they can be fully considered through the ongoing investigation by your Department of Commerce. To honor those claims, we urge you to end the self-imposed emergency declaration and let the Commerce Department investigation proceed unimpeded so as not to further increase our economic reliance on China.Sincerely,###"

The vehicles aren’t available; the infrastructure’s not available. And what he’s trying to do is make it so painful for us to buy oil and gas here in America that somehow, we’re going to transition over. What he wants to do, I think, is make us more dependent on China, where we’re going to go for the lithium, where we’re going to go for the solar panels. It really is a backwards-looking policy, and he’s blindly pursuing it at the expense of our economy, at the expense of, you know, the wellbeing of every family right here in America.”Hagerty on his pushback against the SEC’s proposed climate rule: “You’ve got the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission], a bureau full of faceless bureaucrats—lawyers, mainly—putting out a 500-page rule on climate change. These aren’t scientists. This is the type of debate that should be happening amongst elected officials who represent the people because there are serious tradeoffs that we’re talking about. Yet, these faceless bureaucrats want to go ahead and make this decision for us. What they’re really trying to do, Maria, is they’re trying to starve capital from industries that are critical to America. And the result of this is going to be more inflation, higher prices, and it’s going to make our nation less competitive as a whole. Farmers are suffering tremendously right now, and this will roll through to food shortages. It’s going to roll through to diesel shortages. It’s going to be devastating to our economy if we’re to allow this to go through.”Hagerty on his questioning of Chair Powell this week: “Chairman [Jerome] Powell’s got a tremendously difficult job before him, Maria. I mean, we’re looking at unprecedented levels of inflation, and he’s trying to deal with very blunt instruments. The monetary policy tools that he has are limited in what they can affect. He’s got to deal with this inflation but at the same time, not push us over the precipice into a recession. The problem that he’s got—in fact, the very biggest problem that he’s got—is the fact that the Biden Administration wants to use either the tool of more taxpayer spending—you know, spending taxpayer money—or they want to add more regulation, or both, which is constraining supply, which is driving up costs and inflation. And in fact, they’re working against every aspect of the inflationary-fighting tools that Jerome Powell has. So, I think he’s got a very difficult job. We will talk about that tomorrow. This 500-page rule is part-and-parcel, again, of constraining supply of capital, of starving capital from industries that we absolutely need to be flourishing right now, making our nation less competitive and driving inflation again through the roof.”Hagerty on unspent COVID relief money further fueling inflation: “Absolutely, to the extent that those states are going to release that money into the economy, again, you know, more dollars chasing fewer goods. On the regulatory side, you know, the Biden Administration is choking off supply and then adding more and more stimulus. These states are not going to be inclined to give this money back. The Democrats in Congress are not going to allow that to happen. We’ve already seen that. So, this again is going to have more inflation in the pipeline yet to come.”###"

The Bulletin provides interpretive staff guidance from the Division of Corporation Finance and the Office of the Chief Accountant regarding the accounting of, and associated disclosures relating to, a platform holding digital assets on behalf of consumers,” the Senators wrote.Out of linewith the intent of Staff Accounting Bulletins, which is to clarify accounting interpretations, the SAB 121 establishes regulation disguised as guidance, evading legal requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act that are designed to ensure transparency and allow for input from those affected by federal rulemaking.“Agencies must conduct rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act, which incorporates process and transparency designed to ensure that the public and all affected by a proposed rule have the opportunity to provide comment, resulting in sound, well-designed regulations. The SEC’s approach to the emerging crypto market has not promoted process, transparency, or public engagement,” the Senators continued.The Senators went on to call out the SEC’s history of targeting the cryptocurrency industry and sidestepping agency procedures. “The Commission has led with enforcement and relied on staff guidance, citing purported ‘increased risks’ presented by crypto. The SEC’s job is to mitigate these risks first by developing a knowledge base through engagement with the industry and market participants, then by proposing rules, and, once the risks and rules are clear, only then ensure compliance through enforcement… Investor protection is a core obligation of the Commission and should not be left to a back-door staff-led approach that creates more questions than answers.”The Senators are requesting a withdrawal of SAB 121 and for the SEC to provide any economic analysis done on the potential impact of the Bulletin.“We hope you will withdraw SAB 121 and follow the proper procedure for such a significant accounting change… Regardless of your next steps, please provide any economic analysis done on the potential impact of this bulletin – including the effect on capital requirements and retail investor protections – as well as a description of any stakeholder feedback and interagency review,” the Senators concluded.A copy of the letter to Chair Gensler can be found here and below.Dear Chair Gensler, We write to express concerns regarding the Securities and Exchange Commission’s issuance of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (“SAB 121” or “Bulletin”). The Bulletin provides interpretive staff guidance from the Division of Corporation Finance and the Office of the Chief Accountant regarding the accounting of, and associated disclosures relating to, a platform holding digital assets on behalf of consumers.Although the underlying interpretation may or may not be appropriate, as currently drafted, the SAB 121 is regulation disguised as staff guidance. As you know, staff typically only provide interpretive guidance on existing regulations. Here, there is no underlying regulation being interpreted. Moreover, the Bulletin leaves no doubt that staff expects regulated entities to comply – indicating the Bulletin is enforceable. Staff guidance cannot create enforceable obligations. The SEC should not be taking steps that could invite litigation, which undermines the American people’s confidence in the agency, and in our shared desire to promote strong protections for investors.Agencies must conduct rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act, which incorporates process and transparency designed to ensure that the public and all affected by a proposed rule have the opportunity to provide comment, resulting in sound, well-designed regulations. The SEC’s approach to the emerging crypto market has not promoted process, transparency, or public engagement. Instead, the Commission has led with enforcement and relied on staff guidance, citing purported “increased risks” presented by crypto.1 The SEC’s job is to mitigate these risks first by developing a knowledge base through engagement with the industry and market participants, then by proposing rules, and, once the risks and rules are clear, only then ensure compliance through enforcement. A comprehensive custody regime, tailored to the unique properties of digital assets, could provide a clear regulatory framework and legal protections for investors. Investor protection is a core obligation of the Commission and should not be left to a back-door staff-led approach that creates more questions than answers.Staff should not make policy. We hope you will withdraw SAB 121 and follow the proper procedure for such a significant accounting change. If the Commission agrees the goals of SAB 121 are appropriate, we welcome a rulemaking to be issued through the proper notice and comment regime to allow for proper stakeholder engagement.Regardless of your next steps, please provide any economic analysis done on the potential impact of this bulletin – including the effect on capital requirements and retail investor protections – as well as a description of any stakeholder feedback and interagency review. Sincerely,###"

Similarly, the Supreme Court needs $9.1 million to cover its unexpected, increased security costs.“An assassination attempt on one of our Supreme Court Justices is unthinkable, but sadly has become reality,” said Senator Hagerty. “We must protect our most sacred American institutions, which is why my updated legislation provides the specific amounts requested by the Supreme Court and the U.S. Marshals Service to cover their current security needs. If we, as a Congress, are willing to send tens of billions of dollars for security needs overseas, then surely we can provide a tiny fraction of that amount to protect the men and women of one of the three branches of our federal government. The cost of failing to act is incalculable, as last week’s news made chillingly clear.”“Our government institutions are dealing with a record number of threats,” said Senator Warner. “We saw on January 6 what can happen when we are unprepared for those threats. This legislation will provide the level of funding the Supreme Court needs to protect the justices and court employees.”Officials at the Court and the Marshals Service recently provided specific security funding needs to the Appropriations Committee.Last month, before receiving this updated information, Hagerty introduced legislation that appropriated $10 million in additional resources to the Court.###"

The GAO has previously decided that similar agency documents constitute rules requiring congressional review, regardless of the label given to the documents by an agency.The Senators also noted that the denial is not limited to small refineries with pending petitions and has general, future applicability, suggesting that it constitutes a rule. “As it set forth an approach to evaluate SRE petitions, this has future effect, with EPA noting in the Federal Register the proposal would apply to 65 ‘pending/undecided’ petitions… The Denial is also of general applicability since it applies to all small refineries, whether they had a pending hardship petition or not. Therefore, this decision not only applies to all small refineries, but as a practical matter would affect all obligated parties under the national RFS program. The Denial is not limited in scope and would apply nationwide.”Last month in a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing, Hagerty criticized EPA Administrator Michael Regan for EPA’s denial of all small refinery exemptions and called out the agency for forging ahead with regulatory actions that will further increase fuel prices for consumers who are already facing record-high gas prices.“[The Denial] substantially affects the rights and obligations of small refineries and related parties. For the reasons above, we seek expedited determination as to whether the Denial constitutes a rule pursuant to the Congressional Review Act,” the Senators concluded.A copy of the letter to General Dodaro can be found here and below.Dear Mr. Dodaro: On June 3, 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced its decision to deny 69 small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions through the “June 2022 Denial of Petitions for RFS Small Refinery Exemptions” (hereinafter “Denial”). We are writing to seek your review of whether this Denial constitutes a rule for purposes of the Congressional Review Act.While EPA asserts its Denial is “not a rulemaking,” the Denial appears to be an agency statement of future effect that is designed to implement, interpret, and prescribe law and policy. The U.S. Government Accountability Office has previously found that agency documents may constitute a “rule” under the Congressional Review Act irrespective of the label given by an agency. The proposed Denial was issued by EPA and made available for public comment in the Federal Register, a process generally required under the Administrative Procedure Act. As it set forth an approach to evaluate SRE petitions, this has future effect, with EPA noting in the Federal Register the proposal would apply to 65 “pending/undecided” petitions. The Denial establishes criteria for hardship petitions that would apply to all small refineries, including the recently denied SRE petitions and refineries that wish to submit a petition in the future. EPA also acknowledges in its proposal that the Agency has altered “its statutory interpretation of the Clean Air Act small refinery provisions” and has established a policy that “there can be no disproportionate economic hardship pursuant to the statute” for small refineries, precluding any refinery from being granted relief — now or in the future. This new statutory interpretation and the preclusion of any refinery receiving hardship relief was affirmed in the Denial.The Denial is also of general applicability since it applies to all small refineries, whether they had a pending hardship petition or not. Therefore, this decision not only applies to all small refineries, but as a practical matter would affect all obligated parties under the national RFS program. The Denial is not limited in scope and would apply nationwide.Finally, the Denial does not fit within any of the three exceptions set forth in 5 U.S.C. § 804(3)(A)-(C). As noted, it applies generally to parties that fall within its scope and is therefore not a rule of particular applicability. It does not relate to agency management or personnel. And finally, it is not a rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties; rather, as noted, it substantially affects the rights and obligations of small refineries and related parties.For the reasons above, we seek expedited determination as to whether the Denial constitutes a rule pursuant to the Congressional Review Act.Thank you for your consideration.Sincerely,###"
https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2022/06/10/hagerty-statement-on-another-month-of-historic-inflation-4/,"June 10, 2022NASHVILLE, TN—United States Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), a member of the Senate Banking Committee, today released the following statement in response to the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), showing an 8.6 percent annualized rate of inflation for May:“Empty wallets and empty tanks—it’s the sad reality that far too many Americans are experiencing in Biden’s America. Tennesseans on fixed incomes, those trying to plan a vacation, and people who must drive to work daily — all are being forced to make life-altering choices because of these spiraling costs. The national average for a gallon of gas has hit $5—once unthinkable—and diesel is even higher, putting more stress on already strained supply chains. The Biden Administration is lost in an alternate reality where they continue to deflect and scapegoat others while ignoring the inflationary impact of their devastating war on American energy, regulatory attacks on American business, and collapsing of our Southern border. Rather the Biden Administration argues that more legislation targeting American job creators and more government stimulus is the answer, all while the American worker suffers.”###"

The FENTANYL Results Act, sponsored by Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Rob Portman (R-OH), which increases U.S. capacity to track illicit drugs like fentanyl, includes a specific provision authored by Hagerty, Cardin, and John Cornyn (R-TX) that identifies countries that produce precursor chemicals needed to manufacture such narcotics. Currently, the Foreign Assistance Act definition of “major illicit drug producing country” includes only those who cultivate and produce illicit drugs, but it excludes countries like China that are a significant source of the precursor chemicals needed for “the illicit production of narcotics and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances.”The Centers for Disease Control reported last month that deaths from overdoses topped 100,000 for 2021, the largest number recorded. According to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, China is the world’s largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients used to manufacture illegal narcotics.“As record deaths from overdoses—most from fentanyl—have become the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18 to 45, Congress must do more to stop the flow of this dangerous drug into our country,” said Senator Hagerty. “While securing our southern border is a critical step in stopping the entry of fentanyl into the United States, we must also confront the source of this shockingly lethal drug—the precursor chemicals needed to manufacture it, much of which are sourced from Communist China. I applaud the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s support of this bipartisan bill, including our bipartisan amendment, and I thank my colleagues for their partnership in making every effort to counter the flow of fentanyl and precursors—the narcotic equivalents of weapons of mass destruction—from China into the United States.”“China must stop facilitating the flow of deadly, illicit drugs to the U.S. and around the world. They cannot continue providing the chemicals used by others to make fentanyl and other drugs that are killing Americans,” said Senator Cardin. “We have a responsibility to pursue all means possible to stop this fatal epidemic of overdoses. In addition to reducing demand, in part by increasing access to treatment, we must cut off the flow of these illicit drugs at all stages of production. I appreciate the partnership of Senators Cornyn and Hagerty in recognizing the impact we can have by calling out China and other countries for their role enabling the flow of illegal narcotics. I thank fellow Marylander, Congressman David Trone, for leading the fight in the House of Representatives to stop the flow of fentanyl into this country.”###"

I unequivocally oppose this plan for what appears to be a new unofficial U.S. diplomatic mission in Israel’s capital. This plan is inconsistent with the full and faithful implementation of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 and suggests that the Administration is once again trying to undermine America’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s eternal and undivided capital.”BACKGROUND:In October, under questioning from Hagerty, Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Brian McKeon told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the United States would “need to get the consent of the host government to open any diplomatic facility” in Jerusalem. The Government of Israel opposes the re-opening of a U.S. consulate for the Palestinians in Jerusalem after the consulate was closed and merged into the U.S. Embassy to Israel under the Trump Administration’s full and faithful implementation of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995.Also in October, Hagerty introduced the Upholding the 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Law Act of 2021 (S.3063), a bill to protect the full and faithful implementation of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 and block the Biden Administration’s efforts to subvert that law. 41 senators have co-sponsored this legislation. ###"

In his alternate universe, he can just crush supply on the energy side. He can do that in a way that increases energy prices around the globe. That enriches Vladimir Putin so he can wage war on Ukraine with the profits that he’s making. And at the same time, he’s got some wishful thinking that somehow, we’re going to be able to get the alternative energy sources that we need. We don’t have them yet. And frankly, when you think about where they’re going to come from, he’s going to be going to China to get his batteries, to get his solar panels, to get his windmills. I mean, this is just preposterous, and you’re right: he’s going to drive us straight into recession if he stays with this.”Hagerty on Biden pursuing green energy goals to the detriment of the American people: “We absolutely are. And it’s going to continue. If you think about Joe Biden killing a million-acre lease in Alaska, killing more leases in the Gulf, and the message that the Biden Administration sends to the capital markets is that we’re going to not support any project with respect to fossil fuel in America. There is a war on fossil fuel and energy here in America. And again, that’s driving up prices around the globe. They seem to be content with that. I think this is what Biden is saying. We’re going to go through this massive transition. The American economy’s going to suffer a tremendous amount of pain. And I guess everybody’s going to be driving electric vehicles that batteries come from China, making us dependent again on yet another country that doesn’t have our best interest at heart.”Hagerty on partnering with Indo-Pacific allies to counter Communist China: “I think this has happened on multiple occasions, Larry. This is the third time on this particular instance regarding Taiwan that they’ve [the Administration] tried to walk back what he [Biden] said. But I think I would really, you know, subscribe to Teddy Roosevelt’s philosophy, and that is to ‘speak softly, but carry a big stick.’ We need to be building our capability in the region. That’s what China will appreciate. We should take advantage of the fact that Japan has now decided to double their defense budget. The Biden Administration, rather than sending us a DOD [Department of Defense] budget that actually defunds the military when you net it out of inflation, we need to be stepping up our posture, stepping up our presence there—more interoperability, more lethality, more joint exercises—we can do that with Japan, with South Korea. That’s what we need to be doing. That’s how we need to be posturing ourselves. There was some good news coming out of the Quad, and that is that the Quad partners all agreed that they’re going to begin to monitor closely China’s illegal fishing activities in their waters. If you can monitor that, you can also monitor China’s military vessels, too. That’s a step in the right direction, but we need to keep building in that direction.”Hagerty on the need for fiscal responsibility in aiding Ukraine: “Well, I think the Ukrainian people have demonstrated their willingness to fight. I respect that. I heard some good news just recently that they have more Ukrainian people reentering the country than departing right now. I think the spirit of the Ukrainian people are admirable, and they’re fighting back hard. We have supported that. Look, Larry, we sent over a $40 billion sum—that’s more than my entire state’s budget in Tennessee—to support the Ukrainians as they wage this war. And I think the problem that we’ve got right now is we need to define an endpoint. We need to define gates. We need to have our European allies walking shoulder to shoulder with us. We leaped way ahead of them. And frankly, let’s go back to the beginning of this conversation. If we would just stop the domestic war on energy that Joe Biden is waging here in America on our own companies, we’d lower prices of energy overall around the globe. We would defund Putin’s war machine. We should have a comprehensive strategic posture on this and think clearly about what message we send to China because if China thinks that might makes right, and all they have to do is step up and engage and that there’ll be a concession, I think that would be a very bad outcome for Taiwan.”###"

We have a great many things to talk about, a great many things to stand for that the American public needs, but we need to take control of the Senate and as many state houses as we can.”Hagerty on inflation precipitated by Biden Administration policies: “Look, we had a negative 1.4 percent [gross domestic product] print last quarter. Things are very challenging right now, as we look going ahead, certainly in the next couple of quarters. Their forward guidance is a tool that they’re using to try to keep the economy from the brink of recession. But the policies that this Administration is putting forward is making the [Federal Reserve’s] job very, very difficult. You remember it was the Biden Administration that shoved through on a completely-partisan basis the spending plan that came through last March of 2021 at a time when, as you said, I was saying this inflation is not transitory. They dumped $2 trillion into the economy. It’s like putting fuel on the fire, and they continue to wage war on American industry, which as you know, has driven prices up all over the country, over $4 a gallon everywhere in America. I’m hearing reports that it could be as high as $8 a gallon by the end of the summer. This is crushing on the economy. Every one of the people in my home state of Tennessee that has to drive to work is feeling this every day. And every good that we buy that has to be transported is feeling the effects of inflation dramatically. The sad thing is the answer is right in front of us: get back into the energy business.”Hagerty on repercussions of lifting tariffs on China: “I served as Ambassador to Japan while the China tariffs were put in place. I was negotiating at the same time with Bob Lighthizer and his team with the Japanese to put in place a free trade agreement there. Those tariffs were put in place during the Trump Administration, and our inflation rate was below 2 percent. I don’t think that we’re going to see any sort of immediate impact on inflation [by lifting the tariffs], but what we’re going to do is lose our negotiating posture with China. Why would we give up something with China that was worked so hard to obtain for nothing? Again, that’s the typical policy of the Biden Administration, though, just to appease and to capitulate and get nothing in return for America.”###"

We still have a massive crisis at the southern border. This past month saw the greatest number of illegal immigrants come into the country that we’ve ever seen. In my home state of Tennessee, we still have each month more overdoses and more deaths from fentanyl coming across that border than we’ve ever had before. It gets worse by the month. The Biden Administration is doing everything they can to transform America, and Title 42 is the last tool left for our border patrol agents to actually push back. Again, it’s a public health usage; I think the biggest public health crisis, frankly, is the deaths from overdoses that are being created here. Again, the biggest killer of young Americans between the ages of 18 and 45 right now in America is overdose deaths. The Biden Administration will not acknowledge it.”Hagerty on Biden and Democrats’ refusal to address the crisis at the southern border: “I’m willing to work with the Democrats; I’m willing to work with anybody to get this problem fixed, but no one on the Democrat side will step up. I put forward legislation to actually expand Title 42 and to include among the public health crises that was trying to combat, drug overdose deaths and the concern of that. I couldn’t get a single Democrat to join me in that conversation. We’re going to continue to push on this, but as you say, Congress is ready to act at least on our side of the aisle to make Title 42 permanent, but also, we need to put the Migrant Protection Protocols back in place—that was actually working. Biden won’t even go to the border and address this crisis, and it’s really just crushing America.”Hagerty on the need to reimplement successful Trump-era immigration policies: “That’s exactly what President Trump did when he implemented the Migrant Protection Protocols. He put a tremendous amount of pressure on the Mexican government. They actually began to patrol the border again. Now that border’s been ceded to the cartels. I think it’s going to be very difficult for Mexico to do anything without us putting pressure on them, but they should. They should do a lot more. And I think what we’ll see is, if we would go back to the policies that were working, we would have a tremendous impact on reducing this crisis. But instead, people are just piling up on the other side of the border. They are being turned away under Title 42, but the Biden Administration keeps sending signals that they’re going to do away with it. Again, if they do away with it, we’re going to see a tsunami of people coming in. It’s a crisis that will turn into a massive disaster.”Hagerty on addressing crises in America first: “Ukraine can win the war, and we need to come up with a fully strategic approach to this. The best thing that we could do would be actually end the war on American energy here—that would defund Vladimir Putin’s war machine. That’s what we need to do first and foremost. The $40 billion that we’re sending over there right now—that’s the size of my state of Tennessee’s entire annual budget. There have to be limits to this. You know, the Biden Administration is willing to spend on things like this with very little oversight; very little details is involved in this. There isn’t an end game in sight. We should be walking side by side, marching side by side with our colleagues in Europe. They’re not stepping up to this level. Right now, we’re at parody with them, but with this $40 billion, we’re jumping way ahead of them—4X of what the Europeans are spending, and they’re more proximate to the problem. We need to be bringing them along. We need to be looking at this holistically. We need to be solving the energy crisis at the same time, and that would address inflation here at home.”###"

In your role as chair of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), we urge you to investigate the circumstances and national security implications of this proposed acquisition.China’s deliberately vague patchwork of intelligence, national security, and cybersecurity laws compel companies to support and cooperate with the government’s intelligence work. Not only is Magnum Opus domiciled within the jurisdiction of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), but the seed money for Magnum Opus came directly from China’s sovereign wealth fund, the Chinese Investment Corporation (CIC). The CCP’s intent to wield the Forbes brand for its own purposes is clear. The purchasing entity’s April 8, 2022 proxy statement admits that, if this deal is allowed to proceed, Forbes “could be subject to oversight and discretion of PRC governmental authorities, which could seek to intervene or influence its business operations at any time that the government deems appropriate to further their regulatory, political, and societal goals.”  Forbes is a recognizable American brand with immense propaganda value to the CCP.

Expanding NATO to include Finland and Sweden will send a clear message to Vladimir Putin, and any leader that attempts to follow in his path, that the free world stands ready to defend its values and sovereignty. We will also continue to support NATO’s open-door policy, which affirms that new members are welcome to the alliance,” the Senators wrote.The Senators also affirmed their support for Sweden and Finland’s applications as part of the Senate’s constitutional role to provide advice and consent for NATO enlargement. During this pivotal moment to our global security, they noted this expansion will further strengthen NATO’s military and diplomatic capabilities to address emerging threats, and mutual security assurances will extend to these two governments under the alliance.“Members of the U.S. Senate take seriously our role in advising and consenting to NATO enlargement, a process that must be approved by all NATO member states. We affirm our support for Sweden and Finland’s applications for membership. In addition, we pledge to work closely with you and with our Senate colleagues to ensure that their applications are swiftly considered and approved by the Senate,” the Senators concluded. “The transatlantic alliance has never been more crucial to global security and stability. The addition of these two important allies to NATO will ensure the alliance’s resilience and readiness, and we look forward to welcoming Sweden and Finland to NATO.”A copy of the letter can be found here.###"

https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2022/05/24/hagerty-colleagues-call-on-biden-to-address-mexican-governments-aggression-toward-u-s-companies/,"May 24, 2022WASHINGTON—United States Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, along with nine Senate colleagues whose states’ businesses and supply chains have been threatened by recent aggression from Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, are urging President Joe Biden to take action concerning this aggression by the Mexican government toward U.S. companies with investments and operations in Mexico.“For over two centuries, the United States and Mexico have developed deep cultural, economic, and diplomatic relations that have been instrumental in creating prosperity in North America. A central component of this relationship is the economic integration that encourages American investment in and trade with Mexico […] However, recent actions by President López Obrador and officials in his government threaten to undermine the confidence of U.S. businesses in Mexico as a viable, predictable marketplace and destination for investment,” the senators wrote.The senators pointed to a particularly influential company that has facilitated decades-long economic ties between the two countries, Vulcan Materials Company. Vulcan has been frequently targeted by the Mexican government’s arbitrary actions and was recently presented with orders to shut down quarrying and extraction operations on one of its three active mining parcels, despite its full ownership of this property and its possession of all the necessary permitting needed to operate. “A continued shutdown of Vulcan’s operations in Mexico will have a direct and negative impact on the United States, as Vulcan’s Mexico facility is a critical component of the construction aggregates supply chain for the southeast United States. This facility provides construction aggregates for infrastructure projects in coastal markets that do not have the geology necessary to produce quality construction aggregates locally,” the senators continued.Both Republican and Democratic members of Congress have previously sounded the alarm to the Biden Administration regarding President López Obrador’s deviation from the economic and legal norms that govern U.S.-Mexican relations and his retaliation against the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USCMA). If these violations persist, they will undermine mutually-beneficial economic cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico and push businesses to pursue more predictable and suitable markets elsewhere. “Therefore, we respectfully request that you take immediate action with respect to the Government of Mexico to reverse the harmful measures it has already taken and to prevent further damage to the economic relationship between the United States and Mexico,” the senators concluded.Other signers include U.S. Senators Richard Shelby (R-AL), Rick Scott (R-FL), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and John Cornyn (R-TX).A copy of the letter can be found here and below.Dear President Biden, We write urging you to prioritize and address the recent aggression by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and his Administration toward American companies with investments and operations in Mexico. For over two centuries, the United States and Mexico have developed deep cultural, economic, and diplomatic relations that have been instrumental in creating prosperity in North America. A central component of this relationship is the economic integration that encourages American investment in and trade with Mexico—which, in 2021, generated over $661.1 billion in total trade. As the world emerges from the pandemic and reassesses the global rebalancing of supply chains, North America is uniquely positioned to bolster its leadership as a manufacturing powerhouse as companies look to near-shore their supply chains from Asia and the rest of the world. However, recent actions by President López Obrador and officials in his government threaten to undermine the confidence of U.S. businesses in Mexico as a viable, predictable marketplace and destination for investment. For over thirty years, Vulcan Materials Company has operated a limestone quarry on three contiguous parcels of land in Quintana Roo, Mexico. This facility has brought investment and well-paying jobs to the region. However, under the leadership of President López Obrador, the Mexican government has taken numerous arbitrary and punitive actions against Vulcan, illustrating increasingly protectionist and anti-competitive policies that disregard the rule of law. In 2018, Vulcan initiated NAFTA arbitration proceedings against Mexico due to arbitrary and capricious actions that prohibited Vulcan from operating on two of the three parcels it owns in Quintana Roo. In January of this year, President López Obrador began escalating hostilities, directly interfering with Vulcan’s ability to export materials and making numerous public statements advocating for Vulcan to stop quarrying. On May 5, the Mexican Government presented Vulcan with shutdown orders to immediately cease all quarrying and extraction operations on its one active mining parcel, despite Vulcan’s full ownership of this property and its possession of all the necessary permitting needed to operate. A continued shutdown of Vulcan’s operations in Mexico will have a direct and negative impact on the United States, as Vulcan’s Mexico facility is a critical component of the construction aggregates supply chain for the southeast United States. This facility provides construction aggregates for infrastructure projects in coastal markets that do not have the geology necessary to produce quality construction aggregates locally. Further, Vulcan Materials Company is not the only American entity to experience harassment from the Mexican government and raise concerns over President López Obrador’s anti-business rhetoric. There have been a number of stunning cases, particularly in the energy and power sectors, where multiple U.S.-owned facilities have been forced to close. The Natural Resources Defense Council, the Alliance for Trade Enforcement, the United States Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of Manufacturers have all cited numerous instances in which protectionist policies threaten the predictability of Mexico’s business climate. This is further underscored by the Mexican Senate’s recent passage of a bill to nationalize lithium mining and extraction. Under this protectionist measure, Mexican state-run companies will have exclusive rights to mine lithium, which is a critical mineral used in the production of electric car batteries and other next-generation technologies. Both Republican and Democratic Members of Congress have raised concerns to your Administration regarding President López Obrador’s departures from the economic and legal norms that govern U.S.-Mexican relations and his assault against the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USCMA). If these violations are allowed to continue, they will undermine crucial, mutually beneficial economic cooperation between our nations and encourage businesses to seek more predictable and suitable markets elsewhere. Therefore, we respectfully request that you take immediate action with respect to the Government of Mexico to reverse the harmful measures it has already taken and to prevent further damage to the economic relationship between the United States and Mexico. Sincerely,###"

Thankfully, despite the Biden Administration’s best efforts, a judge has ensured that Title 42 will remain in place for now. But Congress should take more permanent action by enacting my legislation to expand Title 42 authority as necessary to stop the enormous illegal drug trafficking happening at the border, which killed more than 100,000 Americans last year—also a record.”###"
https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2022/05/19/under-questioning-from-hagerty-so-called-election-experts-unable-to-defend-voter-suppression-claims/,"May 19, 2022WASHINGTON—United States Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), a member of the Senate Rules Committee, today pressed Damon Hewitt, President and Executive Director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and Tammy Patrick, Senior Advisor at the Democracy Fund, on past statements that 2021 changes to Georgia’s election laws restricted voter access, which have proven inaccurate.Following passage of the 2021 Georgia election laws, Hewitt characterized the law as “limiting access to early voting,” despite that the law expanded early voting access. Hagerty contrasted Hewitt’s past claim with actual data from primary elections transpiring in the state today. “We’re currently in the third week of early voting in Georgia, and they’re seeing record early voting. In fact, early voting is up 217 percent from the last midterm election, and it’s even up 155 percent from the 2020 Presidential primary,” Hagerty said.In response to Hagerty’s inquiry regarding whether he still believes his initial claim to be true, Hewitt evaded the question, saying they are “still analyzing numbers that are coming in” and inaptly claiming that voters are “restricted from being able to do what they once did.”Pressed by Hagerty, Hewitt again dodged the question, refusing to abandon his stance that the new law “was designed to clamp down on a particular means of voting,” despite current primary election data showing that the laws are having the opposite effect.Following testimony from Patrick describing “misinformation” as being unintentionally false information, “disinformation” as deliberately misleading information, and “malinformation” as information that’s used out of context, Hagerty asked if saying that the Georgia voting laws—which indisputably expanded early voting to require 17 days of early voting, at least two Saturdays of early voting instead of one, and a county option to offer Sunday early voting—reduced access to early voting would be considered misinformation or disinformation.Like Hewitt, Patrick evasively responded, only repeating definitions to the terms, suddenly seeming unable to analyze these concepts, and saying the statement would need to be reviewed. When asked by Hagerty a second time, despite discussing these concepts in her testimony, Patrick stated she is not “qualified to make such a statement.”Hagerty then questioned Patrick on a statement made by President Biden regarding the same Georgia election law, which allows counties to have polls open between 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. “President Biden claimed that… ‘It’s sick, deciding that you’re going to end voting at five o’clock. Among the outrageous parts of this new state law, it ends voting hours early so working people can’t cast their vote after their shift is over.’ […] So, Ms. Patrick, would you characterize this statement by President Biden as misinformation or disinformation or malinformation?” Hagerty asked.Patrick admitted that the statement was not accurate, but avoided discussing whether the inaccurate statement was “misinformation” or “disinformation”, stating that she doesn’t “ascribe motivations to individual statements by anyone” and is “not a specialist in Georgia’s law.”“The doublespeak here is shocking, but the motivation, I think, is clear: it’s to inflame. I think it’s shameful,” Hagerty concluded.###"
https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2022/05/18/ahead-of-bidens-first-visit-to-asia-hagerty-urges-president-to-seize-opportunities-to-advance-u-s-interests-and-counter-communist-china/,"May 18, 2022WASHINGTON—United States Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and former U.S. Ambassador to Japan, today delivered remarks on the Senate floor, imploring President Joe Biden to capitalize on opportunities in the Indo-Pacific region to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance and confront the China Challenge when he takes his first trip to Asia as President this weekend. Hagerty’s call comes after leading the first bipartisan congressional delegation trip to Japan since the pandemic began last month.Remarks as PreparedMr. President,With the President of the United States soon departing on his first Asia trip, I rise to speak today about U.S. policy in the Indo-Pacific—an area of the world that I know well, having served as the U.S. Ambassador to Japan prior to joining the United States Senate.While U.S. foreign policy in recent months has focused largely on Eastern Europe, we cannot take our attention away from our nation’s greatest strategic adversary:  namely, the Chinese Communist Party. Confronting Communist China is the essential responsibility of our time, as the China Challenge—and how the U.S. and our allies respond to it—will determine whether freedom or autocracy defines the 21st century. That is why I am pleased to see President Joe Biden investing the time and energy to travel to South Korea and Japan this weekend. I can tell you just how critical I believe this trip is, because I made a similar trip just last month. In April, I led the first congressional delegation to visit Japan since the pandemic began.I was joined by my colleagues, Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland and Senator John Cornyn of Texas.During our six days in Japan, our bipartisan delegation met with the country’s top leaders, including the prime minister, his Cabinet members, parliamentarians, and top leaders from Japanese industry.I think it’s fair to say that our delegation returned with a great sense of optimism—optimism about the opportunities that lie before our two nations to increase our cooperation diplomatically, militarily, economically, and technologically and, by so doing, to strengthen our alliance. While I certainly have policy disagreements with the current Administration, I am hopeful that this is one area in which we can find common ground. The fate of our nation, and the world, depends on it. This challenge, quite frankly, is too important to get wrong. And so I am hopeful that President Biden will seize upon the opportunities presented to him in the Indo-Pacific region to confront the China Challenge head on—and that this trip will provide him with greater perspective to do so. I am pleased to see this Administration maintain a focus on the Indo-Pacific region—a focus that President Trump began, and that I personally was proud to help lead from my diplomatic post in Tokyo. I also applaud President Biden for the actions that he’s taken to engage the Quad at the Leader level. Much more can be done.In terms of strengthening our diplomatic cooperation, the United States should warmly welcome Japan’s proactive leadership in response to recent international crises.Japan is the world’s third biggest economy and a major financial player on the world stage.Japan is also a member of the G7.In the days after Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine, the Kishida government joined in imposing strong multilateral sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s war machine.Japan’s support on sanctions is as important as it is necessary.I saw this firsthand when, as U.S. Ambassador to Japan, I worked with then-Prime Minister Abe and his administration to comply fully with U.S. secondary sanctions and end Japan’s purchases of Iranian oil in 2018. With Japan’s help, we dramatically reduced Iran’s revenue stream and its ability to fund terror at that time.And we see Japan’s importance today with regard to multilateral sanctions against Russia.Going forward, the United States must do its utmost to ensure that Japan always has a seat at the table on major international issues.Indeed, I was very pleased to see Foreign Minister Hayashi become the first Japanese cabinet member to attend a NATO ministerial when he traveled to Brussels in early April. And I’m even more please to learn that Prime Minister Kishida is considering attending the NATO Summit in Spain next month.Here, I see an opportunity for the United States to engage further with Japan and NATO by exploring new ways to expand high-level diplomatic interactions and information sharing.When I made this suggestion to Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in early May, I was glad to see my suggestion well received.The second opportunity that I see is in the area of improving defense and deterrence in the Indo-Pacific.The United States and Japan must further increase coordination on defense planning and procurement as Japan looks to significantly boost its spending on defense.Japan has already begun the process of rewriting its national security strategy and its related national defense strategy.At the same time, leaders in Tokyo see growing support from the Japanese people to roughly double Japan’s defense spending to two-percent of GDP.These developments come at a critical moment.Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party have their eyes set on Taiwan, and they are surely learning lessons from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.At the same time, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un continues to develop nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, as he poses grave and gathering threats to the United States and our allies in the region.Our nations therefore must act with great urgency to strengthen defense and deterrence in the Indo-Pacific.In particular, the United States must encourage Japan to use their increased spending to field—as rapidly as possible—new defense capabilities that are mobile, lethal, and interoperable.  Japan must also significantly improve its cybersecurity capabilities and its ability to share intelligence and information with allies.And it’s critical that the American and Japanese militaries expand joint training exercises with each other. I’ve had the honor of witnessing firsthand the success of our joint training exercises and I encourage our nations to expand this invaluable training.The third area where I see opportunity is on energy security—an area in which we should be working together. This was a message that I heard last month in Japan as leaders expressed concern with America’s current energy policies. I worked hard to encourage Japan to make significant investments in LNG infrastructure to allow greater LNG exports from the U.S. in order to strengthen our two nations’ energy security and national security. I hope President Biden’s visit will underscore the significance of American strength as an energy exporter to enhance the security of our allies.But all members of the Quad must engage on the critical topic of energy security.India is the world’s biggest democracy and now has an opportunity to decrease its energy and military reliance on Russia, and Australia is a significant energy exporter.When Secretary Blinken recently testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I pointed out to him that the Quad already has high-level working groups on COVID-19 vaccines, infrastructure, critical and emerging technologies, space, cybersecurity, and environmental matters.But my argument to him was that adding a new working group in the Quad—one focused specifically on energy security—makes strong strategic sense, as energy security is inextricably linked to economic security and national security.Frankly, it is surprising to me that the Quad hasn’t already made this issue a primary focus.Secretary Blinken appeared to appreciate the suggestion, and I emphatically urge the Administration to take this idea to heart and dedicate time and energy to discussing energy security in our Quad strategic grouping.We cannot afford further delay on this.The fourth area of opportunity that I see is in technology.The United States and Japan already cooperate closely in this space.That was a point that I sought to underscore in many of our meetings with Japan’s private sector leaders.I see growing opportunities for our Quad partners to ensure our respective technology sectors continue to work together—and to generate trusted alternatives in 5G, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and other strategic technologies.When I served as U.S. Ambassador to Japan, I helped the U.S. and Japanese governments coordinate closely to counter Huawei and China’s other heavily-subsidized companies, and to clear them from the 5G markets of our respective economies.This was important because Chinese companies like Huawei pose grave and growing national security and espionage risks. Our U.S.-Japan strategy prevented Huawei and other Chinese Communist Party-directed technology firms from obtaining the global scale that they sought in their effort dominate international markets.It also created openings for firms in the United States, Japan, and partner countries to pursue trusted 5G alternatives and supply chains, including software-defined networks and ORAN technologies.With each passing year, the technology competition with China is only intensifying.It is therefore imperative the U.S-Japan alliance and the Quad increase coordination and innovation in response to technological competition.The fifth opportunity is in economic leadership in the Indo-Pacific.When President Biden visits the region, I expect him to speak more about the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.It’s clear that many of our Allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific are eager to see more U.S. economic leadership.A shortcoming of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, however, is that it lacks provisions for increasing market access.As a next step, the U.S. should take the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework’s data provisions and turn them into a standalone, sector-specific free trade agreement.The Executive Branch should look at the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement of 2019 as a good starting point.This is the most comprehensive and high-standards agreement addressing digital trade barriers.I was proud to help then-U.S. Trade Representative Bob Lighthizer negotiate this and other bilateral trade agreements with Japan. Our efforts brought about a more fair and reciprocal trading relationship between our two nations, helping not only our economies but also our workers.The Biden Administration has rightly maintained the Trump Administration’s tariffs on China as important leverage to uphold fair and reciprocal trade. This is a critical tool in our arsenal, and I hope the current Administration continues to use it. There certainly are other areas where the Administration must hold the line against China. The Administration needs to do more to hold Communist China accountable for unleashing the COVID-19 pandemic upon the world.It also needs to press Beijing to stop the deadly flow of Chinese-origin fentanyl and fentanyl precursors from pouring across the Southern Border and killing more than 100,000 Americans annually through overdoses. And we all know what’s at stake when it comes to China’s growing military threats against Taiwan.I personally believe the last Administration set a high standard on countering China, and I hope the current Administration builds on that success.I believe there is strong bipartisan consensus in Congress when it comes to the Indo-Pacific—and when it comes to the rising opportunities that we see before us to further strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance and the Quad. So I urge President Biden to seize these growing opportunities that I have outlined when he travels to the Indo-Pacific.As the only former American Ambassador serving in this body and as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I stand ready to work with him if he does.Thank you, Madam President, I yield the floor.###"

In addition to recognizing Taiwan’s importance to the United States as an important trading partner, the senators underscored that failing to include Taiwan in IPEF runs counter to U.S. economic interests in the region.“IPEF can be a meaningful first step for the United States to assure its allies and partners that we are economically engaged in the region, which accounts for sixty percent of the world economy and two-thirds of all economic growth over the last five years. For IPEF to be a useful vehicle to advance a free and open Indo-Pacific, however, we must make sure that all of America’s regional allies and partners are included,” the senators wrote. “This is just one necessary aspect to ensuring the framework is competitive in a region already saturated with economic treaties and agendas.”In addition to requesting that the Biden administration engage with the Committee on the issue and provide a briefing on economic security policy toward Taiwan, the senators also underscored that excluding Taiwan would significantly distort both regional and global economic architecture.“The more economic engagement U.S. and allies and partners have with Taiwan, the stronger our collective resilience against coercion,” the senators added. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shows the value of tangible economic support by the United States and like-minded allies and partners, and the same is true for Taiwan.

https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2022/05/18/hagerty-criticizes-epa-for-burdening-small-refineries-despite-energy-crisis/,"May 18, 2022WASHINGTON—United States Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today criticized Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Michael Regan for EPA’s denial of all small refinery exemptions from the renewable fuel standard, which unnecessarily drives up regulatory costs and therefore fuel prices.EPA has already issued 31 retroactive denials for petitions that were awarded in 2019 that covered the 2018 compliance years. And it is anticipated that EPA will deny all 60-plus SRE petitions that are pending for 2019, 2020, and the 2021 compliance years.Despite the Biden Administration’s contention that it is trying to reduce gas prices, Hagerty noted to Regan that EPA’s decision will have the opposite effect. Specifically, Hagerty pointed out that denying these small-refinery petitions for exemption will increase their compliance costs, which in turn increases fuel costs for consumers, noting that compliance costs have already risen 69 percent since the agency first published its plan to eliminate these exemptions in December. “That moves what was a 13 cent per gallon compliance cost up to 22 cents per gallon,” Hagerty said.Hagerty expressed his disbelief that, despite record-high gas prices, the agency is forging ahead with regulatory actions that will increase fuel prices even more for consumers.“I would just encourage you strongly, given the fact that we are hitting record-high gas prices at the pump every day, families are having to make decisions between groceries that they buy or filling up their tank, and anything that would increase compliance cost, I think we should look at very carefully right now, and having blanket exceptions, you know, retroactive withdrawals of exemptions, I think, you know, obviously puts upward pressure on prices when you have an opportunity right before you to put downward pressure by granting the exemptions. So, I’m going to encourage you, please, to consider reversing course here in this blanket exemption denial, and please take into account the impact on, you know, hardworking families that are trying to make things work at home at the pump. Not doing it, I think, implicates not only the economics of an American family, making it harder for them to get by it, it has upward pressure on inflation. It also impacts our national security, and all of this, I think, is something that is extremely challenging in my mind to understand why we would be pursuing a policy like this at this point in time, when we see the type of inflation and energy costs that we’ve got,” Hagerty said.###"

The Senator also weighed in on the latest reports surrounding the Biden family’s corruption and the historic inflation hurting Americans created by the Biden Administration’s policies.Partial TranscriptHagerty on the Biden Administration’s consideration of lifting China tariffs: “Again, it’s another misguided policy. If you think about what the Chinese Communist Party has seen with [President] Joe Biden, it’s been a gift from day one: re-entering the Paris Climate Accord; China laughs all the way to the bank on that. If you look at our energy policies here in America, just broadly speaking, it’s a huge benefit to China. Now they’re talking about lifting the only leverage that we’ve got in place right now to bring China to more normalized trade relations with us? Look, I was Ambassador to Japan, working hard on our trade deal with Japan at the same time Bob Lighthizer and his team was working on putting these tariffs in place on China. We didn’t have rampant inflation after the tariffs were installed, but we did have leverage. What the Biden Administration wants to do is give away that leverage and get nothing for it in return. I can understand why [U.S. Trade Representative] Katherine Tai, the current trade representative, doesn’t want to do this. It’s just another gimmick that the Biden Administration is pursuing. And again, a net benefit to China.”Hagerty on establishment media’s refusal to cover Biden family corruption: “Look, it certainly appears that there is a massive crime syndicate underway within the Biden family. After three years of Russia, Russia, Russia, every channel that you turned on could talk about nothing but that. And now we had barely hear barely a word out of this Administration and hardly any coverage except for yourself, Maria, and a few others on this. It’s extremely concerning. And you’ve got Joe Biden again, making policy [that] could benefit China dramatically at the same time that it looks very obvious that his son, his family have taken millions of dollars from China in the process.”Hagerty on what Republicans stand for: “It’s very easy. We’re running on a Strong America: bring our energy security back, bring inflation down, bring our borders back intact, protect the people here in America, make our nation stronger, and by doing that, we’ll make our allies stronger, we’ll make our adversaries a lot more concerned about the actions that they’re taking right now. It’s American strength that we’re running on. We have the most exceptional nation in the world. We should absolutely work to our advantage to make it clear to the rest of the world.”Hagerty on the Biden Administration’s policies precipitating historic inflation: “The inflation is just rampant right now, and it’s so obvious what’s causing it: it’s the policies of the Biden Administration. Again, they brought about an absolute war on the fossil fuel industry here in America from the day they came into office. He criticizes [Vladimir] Putin on the one hand, then turns around and cancels a million-acre lease in Alaska, kills projects in the Gulf of Mexico. You can’t get a permit. You can’t do anything here in America because they’ve sent a very clear message to the capital markets: we’re not going to support the oil and gas industry here. But they’ll turn around and deal with [President Nicolás] Maduro and villains like that. They’ll allow, you know, Putin to have a massive windfall that he’s using to fund this war on Ukraine, all of this because of this blind pursuit of some energy policy that’s not working […] I think it’s very possible [layoffs are coming next] if the Biden Administration doesn’t wake up. As you said, the tin ear syndrome has got to go away, or they’re going to see this economy in the tank, and they’re going to see consequences in November.”###"

It is critical that Washington ensures Japan — as a top economic and financial power — always has a seat at the table on international issues.In April, Yoshimasa Hayashi became the first Japanese foreign minister to attend a NATO ministerial when he traveled to Brussels. The United States should explore opportunities for Japan and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to further expand high-level diplomatic interactions and information sharing.Second, we must further increase planning coordination as Japan looks to significantly boost defense.Japan is revising its national security and national defense strategies. At the same time, Tokyo sees growing support from the Japanese people to increase defense spending to 2 percent of gross domestic product.Washington should encourage Tokyo to use increased spending to field — as rapidly as possible — new defense capabilities that are mobile, lethal and interoperable. Japan must also significantly improve intelligence, information sharing and cybersecurity capabilities, and expand joint training exercises with American and partner forces.Our nations must urgently act to strengthen defense and deterrence because China, with its eye on Taiwan, is surely learning lessons from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Third, we must elevate engagement with Japan and the Quad on energy security.After Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Japan joined other nations in re-evaluating the use of Russian energy sources. Decreasing dependence on Russia energy, however, will be most successful when nations have reliable access to cost-effective alternatives.The United States and Japan — as the world’s largest and third-largest economies — will benefit from candid conversations on energy security. The Quad, too, must engage on this critical topic given India is the world’s biggest democracy and has an opportunity to decrease its energy and military reliance on Russia, and Australia is a significant energy exporter.The Quad already has high-level working groups on COVID-19 vaccines, infrastructure, critical and emerging technologies, space, cybersecurity and environmental matters. Adding one on energy security makes strategic sense. Indeed, energy security is inextricably linked to economic security and national security.Fourth, Quad members must ensure their technology sectors continue to partner and generate trusted alternatives in 5G, artificial intelligence and other strategic technologies.In recent years, the United States and Japan closely coordinated to counter Huawei — and China’s other heavily subsidized “national champion” companies that pose national security and espionage risks — and to clear them from the 5G markets of our respective economies.This strategy prevented Huawei and other Chinese Communist Party-directed telecoms from obtaining global scale and dominating international markets. It also created openings for firms in the United States, Japan and partner countries to pursue trusted 5G alternatives and supply chains, including software-defined networks and open radio architecture network approaches.As the tech competition with China intensifies, it is imperative the U.S-Japan alliance and the Quad increase coordination and innovation in response.Fifth, the United States must further advance economic leadership in the Indo-Pacific.The region is eager to see how Washington will realize its proposed Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. It is a positive step in the right direction toward a comprehensive free trade agreement in the region, but it needs approval by Congress and provisions to increase market access.We could take IPEF’s data provisions and turn them into a stand-alone, sector-specific free trade agreement. The U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement of 2019 — the most comprehensive and high-standard agreement addressing digital trade barriers — provides a good starting point.The Biden administration should consult early and often with Congress on a regional trade agenda. Congress will have to renew Trade Promotion Authority if it pursues any new meaningful FTAs.Although Washington may not agree on much right now, our bipartisan group strongly agrees on the growing opportunities for strengthening the U.S.-Japan alliance and the Quad. We stand ready to work with President Biden in seizing these opportunities.###"
https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2022/05/16/hagerty-hirono-cotton-introduce-bill-to-expand-u-s-diplomatic-presence-in-the-pacific-islands/,"May 16, 2022WASHINGTON—United States Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and former U.S. Ambassador to Japan, has joined Senators Mazie Hirono (D-HI) and Tom Cotton (R-AR) in introducing the Expanding America’s Pacific Diplomatic Presence Act of 2022. This bipartisan legislation would enhance the United States’ presence in the Pacific Island region by studying the feasibility of creating new U.S. diplomatic posts in Pacific Island nations and territories that do not currently have U.S. embassies. Expanding our presence would enable U.S. diplomats to build lasting relationships with the people and governments of the Pacific Islands and make it easier for U.S. nationals living in and visiting the region to access diplomatic services and assistance. A stronger U.S. diplomatic commitment to the region would simultaneously help to counter China’s growing presence there.“Expanding U.S. diplomatic presence in the Pacific Islands will strengthen our ability to engage with our regional partners and counter Communist China’s malign influence while advancing freedom, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific,” said Senator Hagerty. “As former U.S. Ambassador to Japan and as U.S. Senator, I strongly support this important bipartisan effort to improve U.S. diplomatic engagement with the strategically important Pacific Islands.”“The United States has long had important partnerships with many nations in the Pacific region,” said Senator Hirono.“But for various reasons, the U.S. still does not have a permanent diplomatic presence in many of these nations. Expanding our diplomatic presence in the Pacific would benefit the United States, host countries, partners and allies, and U.S. citizens living and traveling in the region. By commissioning a study to understand the opportunities and challenges of potential expansion, this bill would mark a critical first step toward expanding our presence in a strategic and efficient way.”“Bolstering the United States’ presence in the Pacific islands is critical to countering Chinese aggression and expansion,” said Senator Cotton. “Establishing additional diplomatic posts in the region will allow the United States to better follow events on the ground, engage with local leaders, coordinate regional efforts with allies and partners, and counter Chinese influence.”Specifically, the Expanding America’s Pacific Diplomatic Presence Act directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a feasibility study on establishing new diplomatic posts in Pacific Island nations and territories that currently do not have a U.S. Embassy or other U.S. diplomatic post. These nations and territories include Tonga, Kiribati, Nauru, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, the Cook Islands, Niue, French Polynesia, and New Caledonia. The results of this study would inform lawmakers and national security decision makers as they seek opportunities to bolster the U.S.’s diplomatic engagement in the region.             The United States enjoys strong historical ties, economic relationships, and cultural links with many Pacific Island nations. Establishing new U.S. diplomatic posts in the Pacific Islands would support efforts to strengthen those ties and build lasting relationships in the region by enabling U.S. diplomats to have more regular interactions with the governments of the Pacific Islands and learn more about the challenges and opportunities facing each nation. Additionally, the year-round presence of more U.S. diplomats would improve the United States’ ability to compete with China’s growing presence in the region and would enhance coordination with Australia, New Zealand, and Japan on economic development assistance and humanitarian aid. An expanded diplomatic presence in the region would also improve oversight of U.S. government funded programs in the region.###"

It’s, as Senator [Rand] Paul said, we’ve got crises erupting across the nation. In my home state, mothers can’t get baby formula in Knoxville. You’ve got grandmothers and mothers that have sons and grandsons that won’t come home because of fentanyl overdoses because of the illegal drugs that are flowing across our southern border that President Biden will not protect. You’ve got crime running rampant across America, and people need to look at our nation and think we’ve got to look at… our own national security first, as Senator Paul has said. Other nations are watching us, too. China is seeing us not behave like a serious nation, rushing to put more aid into a country, who, again, I certainly don’t have anything against the Ukrainians. We want to see them win, but pumping more aid into that country when we’re not taking care of our own country—the best thing that Biden could do is stop the war that he’s waged on American industry. That would lower prices overall, that would take the funding away from Putin’s war machine against Ukraine. It would make our economy do better here. Biden will not do that. Biden will not be serious, and it’s taken us into a very bad direction. So, he just wants to throw another 40 billion dollars of American money into this when you’ve got other nations more approximate—the European nations that have sort of stayed with us, but they haven’t done this level of investment […] I know that there are other senators that are thinking very hard about this right now, as I have done. And I think it’s going to be up to each one’s conscience. We’ve already committed a great deal of money to this effort area. And I know that people are concerned that that money is being well spent, and we should certainly take effort to oversee that very carefully. At the same time, we have got to take care of things here at home first. That’s our primary duty.”Hagerty on Biden’s refusal to take responsibility for historic inflation: “No one is taking responsibility for this in the Biden Administration. In fact, he’s waging war on Americans, you know, calling us every name in the book, you know, looking for scapegoats here in America with the previous president or trying to blame this on Vladimir Putin, as you said, this was well underway before Putin, you know, waged his war on the Ukraine. It wouldn’t be happening if Joe Biden had not waged war on American energy in the first place. We’ve got to get our hands around this and throwing more money at the problem is not the way to do it. Just the stimulus package that he created back in March of 2021 was just like pouring gas onto the inflationary fire. And then the continued talk about five trillion, six trillion, seven trillion-dollar packages just creates an expectation of inflation, which, again, is a self-fulfilling prophecy. This, every step this Administration has taken has been toward more inflation.”Hagerty on Biden-Administration-precipitated crises at home and abroad: “I think it’s got to be the only strategy they have is deflection. They certainly aren’t taking responsibility for what they’ve done, but the American public see right through this. Again, when you can’t get baby formula right here in Tennessee, when you’ve got policies that are creating crime across America, and a border that’s completely unprotected, people see through this Administration, and Biden has one failure after the other—to point to the failure of Afghanistan has precipitated, you know, global concern about America’s posture, our adversaries obviously emboldened. That’s stepped up Putin’s activity in Ukraine. China’s stepped up its activity in the South China Sea and the East China Sea. North Korea is back at it again. The world is a more dangerous place, thanks to Joe Biden. And what does he do? Blame Americans.”Hagerty on leading a bipartisan congressional delegation to Japan: “A great deal of concern about America’s strength and posture toward China. That’s why I led a congressional delegation with two senior senators—Senator [John] Cornyn from Texas, Senator [Ben] Cardin from Maryland—a bipartisan delegation to basically demonstrate to that part of the world that China still is our number one concern. They’re our longest, mid-term, long-term strategy, strategic adversary. They’re the most critical adversary that we’ve got right now. We’re not going to let what’s happening in Ukraine take our eye off that ball. What we need to see is a strong America right now. That’s what the world needs to see. Certainly, that region needs to see it. And we were there to show that we’re standing shoulder to shoulder with Japan, who is our strongest ally there. It’s important to convey that message to China. It’s also important to convey that message to North Korea. Standing together, we’ll do far better. We also were looking for economic opportunities to work together, you know, more semiconductor manufacturing opportunities to work with Japan, with South Korea, to manufacture semiconductors right here in America. That’s absolutely critical. We also have to stand strong together, though, against China. And the thought of taking away the tariffs while getting nothing for it—that’s just ridiculous.”Hagerty on Biden’s failed China strategy: “China is a threat at every turn, whether it’s militarily, diplomatically, or economically. If you look at the technology, we’ve got great opportunity right now because we were able to block Huawei from U.S. and Japan, the first and the third largest markets in the world. We need to take that opportunity. We need to work together to seize it. There was a lot of pressure put on China with the tariffs that were put in place in the last Administration; very painful putting those tariffs in place. And the Biden Administration is talking about taking them away as if that’s going to have some sort of impact on inflation right here in America. The biggest impact that Biden could have on American inflation is to stop his war on American energy; get us back in the energy business. Not only would it help us here in America, but it would help around the world.”Hagerty on Democrats using the Supreme Court opinion leak to distract Americans: “Look, the focus of this is clear: it’s intimidation, Maria. They leak this draft opinion to hopefully—I think their view is that that would allow people to get out and intimidate and change the opinion of these justices that are in the process of deliberation. There is U.S. code against this. They’re standing by and watching the law be violated by these protestors. This intimidation, I pray doesn’t get any worse, but it is very, very disheartening. It’s against the law. And again, it’s part of the Democrat strategy, I think, to deflect from the real issues that Americans are worried about, the real issues that have most of the country understanding that we’re going the wrong direction. And this is yet another deflection by the Democrats to try to get the American public to look the other way.”###"

Hagerty urged President López Obrador to change course on his actions that threaten to undermine the confidence of U.S. businesses in Mexico as a viable, predictable marketplace and to instead work with the U.S. to strengthen economic and diplomatic ties and counter Communist China by attracting mutually-beneficial economic investment. Remarks as PreparedThank you, Madam President.I am here today to discuss worrying developments in Mexico, one of the United States’ most important international partners and our neighbor to the south.The nearly 2,000-mile border that our nations share, both binds us together, and presents a series of challenges, including illegal migration, drug control, and human trafficking.  As we work through those difficult issues, our robust economic relationship has provided a firm foundation to strengthen and stabilize our efforts with an eye towards the future.The innovative U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, deepened the connections between our economies such that Mexico is now one of our largest and most strategic trading partners.  However, actions over the past year by the government of Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, better known as AMLO, have weakened that bond and are threatening the economic and diplomatic ties of our two nations. Through increasingly arbitrary and aggressive moves against companies based here in the United States and their lawfully owned assets in Mexico, the Mexican government has abused its permitting and regulatory powers in ways that violate the letter and the spirit of our trade agreements, and the special relationship between our two countries. These decisions directly impact critical sectors of the U.S. economy, from agriculture to energy and mining, from transportation to tourism.These capricious actions, which are falsely labeled as “reforms,” risk substantially undermining confidence in the commercial rule-of-law in Mexico and these actions also risk jeopardizing the essential economic relations in North America.  Further, these actions likely violate our trade agreements by abrogating contracts, stripping investors of value, and eliminating private competition and oversight, thereby sending a clear message to U.S. capital markets that Mexico is no longer safe or profitable for investing.Earlier this month, AMLO even threatened to jail political opponents and investors who stand in his way, desperately attempting to impose a state-centered, anti-free-market agenda.If not quickly corrected, these actions risk choking off the economic relationship between our two nations. Many important supply chains stretch across the U.S.-Mexico border, supporting millions of good jobs, and making both countries more attractive for capital investment. This is certainly true for my home state of Tennessee. Because of that success, I have advocated for further expanding the integrated North American supply chain for critical industries as a better, more stable alternative to manufacturing and exporting from Communist China.  Utilizing the successes of USMCA as the backbone for a renewed vision of North American competitiveness would benefit both American and Mexican prosperity as well as both our nations’ national security.It would also better align the economic strategies and national interests of our countries.But without a basic respect for private property and the rule of law, that mutually beneficial progress will not happen.  In fact, failing to protect private property and the rule of law will inevitably lead to the disintegration of economic ties.Therefore, I urge President López Obrador to reverse course before more damage is done.  Instead, we should be looking for opportunities to work together to attract investment and unlock the economic opportunity presented by the global rebalancing of supply chains away from Communist China. Let’s seize the opportunity together – rather than damage our shared interests for short-term political gains. I yield the floor.###"
https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2022/05/12/hagerty-introduces-emergency-funding-bill-to-protect-u-s-supreme-court-justices%ef%bf%bc/,"May 12, 2022WASHINGTON—United States Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today introduced legislation that appropriates $10 million in additional resources to the U.S. Supreme Court to address unprecedented security threats to the justices and their families. “No one could have predicted that a draft opinion would be leaked from the Court, resulting in vile rhetoric, intimidation, and threats against the justices and their families,” said Senator Hagerty. “These are uncharted waters, and we must ensure that one of our most sacred American institutions has the security it needs. The Senate took an important step earlier this week by authorizing additional protection for family members of the justices, but this must be coupled with appropriate emergency funding to provide more security resources. Failing to act in this hour of obvious need would be shameful and could be disastrous.”Officials at the Court have indicated to Hagerty that additional resources are needed now to ensure the justices are protected.The proposal from Hagerty is fully paid for by moving previous appropriations for federal-government-related security over to the Supreme Court. This funding will provide a critical bridge that gives the Court liquidity and flexibility to immediately procure necessary security personnel and other resources.Earlier this week, the Senate adopted the Supreme Court Police Parity Act, introduced by Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Chris Coons (D-DE), which extends security protection to Supreme Court Justices’ families in line with what is provided to certain Article I and Article II officers and their families.###"

The NSPK has a card brand known as Mir. Since Mir is interoperable with international payment brands, it poses the potential for sanctions circumvention through its ability to process transactions from other payment networks over the NSPK rails,” the Senators wrote.The Senators note that currently, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam accept Mir payments and that Mir is also accepted in the Russian-occupied Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.“In response, the administration should both apply sanctions or other restrictive measures to the Russian central bank’s NSPK payment system, and review whether UnionPay’s or any other bank or network is helping Russia evade sanctions, so that sanctions may be applied,” the Senators concluded.A copy of the letter can be found here and below:Dear Mr. Adeyemo:We are writing to respectfully request that the administration extend the application of sanctions against the Central Bank of the Russian Federation to target the National Card Payment System (NSPK) operated by that central bank.  In early March, credit card networks Visa, Mastercard, and American Express suspended operations in Russia in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.  The Russian government established NSPK in 2014 after Russian forces seized Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, amidst Moscow’s concern that it would be cut off from international payment systems. The NSPK has a card brand known as Mir.  Since Mir is interoperable with international payment brands, it poses the potential for sanctions circumvention through its ability to process transactions from other payment networks over the NSPK rails.While Mir has mostly been used for bank transfers related to welfare or pension payments, it does have an international footprint, and Russia has been eager to bring other countries into the Mir system since its inception.  Currently, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam accept Mir payments.  Mir payments are also accepted in the Russian-occupied Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.China’s UnionPay – an international payment system that received international status in 2005 and can be used for payments worldwide – may be providing Mir a lifeline. Numerous Russian banks, including Sberbank and Alfa-Bank, have indicated they may issue Mir-UnionPay co-badged cards.  Other Russian banks already work with the Chinese UnionPay payment system, including Gazprombank, Bank St. Petersburg, Promsvyazbank, and others. In response, the administration should both apply sanctions or other restrictive measures to the Russian central bank’s NSPK payment system, and review whether UnionPay’s or any other bank or network is helping Russia evade sanctions, so that sanctions may be applied. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. We look forward to receiving your response. Sincerely,###"
