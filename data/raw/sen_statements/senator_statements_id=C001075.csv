https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-cornyn-31-senate-republicans-call-for-hunter-biden-prosecutor-to-be-given-special-counsel-authority,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) joined Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) and more than 30 other colleagues to send a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland demanding that U.S. Attorney David Weiss be extended special counsel protections and authorities to conduct the investigation into Hunter Biden. “There is no way of knowing the entire scope of the investigation, but evidence seems to be mounting that Hunter Biden committed numerous federal crimes, including, but not limited to, tax fraud, money laundering, and foreign-lobbying violations,” wrote the senators.“Given that the investigation involves the President’s son, we believe it is important to provide U.S. Attorney Weiss with special counsel authorities and protections to allow him to investigate an appropriate scope of potentially criminal conduct, avoid the appearance of impropriety, and provide additional assurances to the American people that the Hunter Biden investigation is free from political influence,” continued the senators.“Given the politicization of the DOJ under your watch and the importance of avoiding any appearance of impropriety, the undersigned request that you provide U.S. Attorney Weiss the full protections and authorities of a special counsel.  This is one important action that you can take that will go a long way in restoring faith in our governmental institutions,” concluded the senators. In addition to Cassidy and Cornyn, the letter was signed by Senators Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Charles Grassley (R-IA), John Thune (R-SD), John Barrasso (R-WY), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Rick Scott (R-FL), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), James Lankford (R-OK), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Mike Lee (R-UT), Steve Daines (R-MT), Ted Cruz (R-TX), James Risch (R-ID), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Cynthia Hyde-Smith (R-MS), James Inhofe (R-OK), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), John Kennedy (R-LA), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Shelley Moore-Capito (R-WV), Tim Scott (R-SC), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), John Hoeven (R-ND), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Ben Sasse (R-NE).Read the full letter here or below.Dear Attorney General Garland:We the undersigned write to request that United States Attorney David C. Weiss be extended special counsel protections and authorities to conduct the Hunter Biden investigation.  During your confirmation hearing, you promised to keep politics out of the Department of Justice (“DOJ”). This promise has not been kept.  On October 4, 2021, you unleashed DOJ’s National Security Division and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), among other criminal components, on millions of concerned parents across the country, who were exercising their First Amendment rights to be involved in decisions about their children’s education, including mask mandates, school closures, and the inclusion of critical race theory in school curricula. We have received hundreds of pieces of correspondence detailing how your memorandum chilled constitutionally protected speech.  To date, you have failed to rescind this memorandum despite the fact that it was primarily based on a false predicate: the now disavowed National School Board Association Letter.You have also taken numerous other steps that have shown the unfortunate politicization of the DOJ under your charge, including targeting conservative states and legislatures for common-sense ballot integrity measures, championing radical pieces of legislation that would federalize elections, and authorizing an unprecedented search warrant on a former President’s home and current political rival shortly before a critical election without providing sufficient transparency to better understand the justification.  Inexplicably, DOJ has neglected to take measurable efforts to protect Supreme Court Justices, pro-life advocates, and pregnancy resource centers, particularly in the wake of the leak of the draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.  For months, radical abortion groups coordinated outside the homes of Supreme Court Justices to intimidate and influence the Justices in the discharge of their duties, a clear violation of federal law.  Violent extremist groups like Jane’s Revenge and Ruth Sent Us have incited violence in our communities, including taking credit for bombings of pregnancy resource centers in Wisconsin, New York, and Oregon. And, on June 8, 2022, an armed man, influenced by the leak of the Dobbs’ draft opinion, attempted to murder Justice Kavanaugh outside of his home.  Instead of taking measurable efforts to prevent and deter violence against Supreme Court Justices, pro-life advocates, and pregnancy resource centers, you opted to fan the flames of liberal outrage.  Following the release of Dobbs, you claimed that the Supreme Court had ignored the Constitution and acted discriminately.  Certainly, unhinged comments like this from our nation’s top law enforcement official contribute to political division in our country.     As you know, the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Delaware—led by U.S. Attorney Weiss—has been investigating Hunter Biden. There is no way of knowing the entire scope of the investigation, but evidence seems to be mounting that Hunter Biden committed numerous federal crimes, including, but not limited to, tax fraud, money laundering, and foreign-lobbying violations.  Indeed, Senators Grassley and Johnson have conducted an investigation for several years that has resulted in the public disclosure of facts that support those criminal concerns, including the disclosure of financial records showing the Biden family’s close financial connections to the communist Chinese government and questionable foreign nationals.  It is clear that Hunter Biden thrived off of a “pay to play” culture of access to his father, then Vice President Joe Biden in exchange for financial compensation.Under Department of Justice regulations and federal law, you have the power to provide special counsel authorities and protections to U.S. Attorney Weiss. Given that the investigation involves the President’s son, we believe it is important to provide U.S. Attorney Weiss with special counsel authorities and protections to allow him to investigate an appropriate scope of potentially criminal conduct, avoid the appearance of impropriety, and provide additional assurances to the American people that the Hunter Biden investigation is free from political influence. Recent news reports paint a concerning picture of the handling of the Hunter Biden investigation.  As detailed by Senator Grassley, “highly credible” whistleblowers have come forward to detail a “widespread effort within the FBI to downplay or discredit negative information about” Hunter Biden.  Senator Grassley has also detailed allegations that the FBI shut down investigative activity and avenues of information relating to potentially criminal information on Hunter Biden before the 2020 presidential election.  Instead of encouraging FBI and DOJ whistleblowers to report crimes and promote government transparency, you took the inexplicable step of chilling lawful whistleblower activity.  Indeed, on August 30, 2022, on the heels of whistleblowers approaching Members of Congress, you issued a memorandum prohibiting DOJ and FBI employees from communicating with “Senators, Representatives, congressional committees, or congressional staff without advance coordination, consultation, and approval by OLA.”  Such a restriction is contrary to law and undermines the constitutional responsibility of Members of Congress to provide congressional oversight of the Executive Branch. Clearly, this memorandum will discourage and deter whistleblowers from sharing information to report potentially criminal activity and fraud, waste, and abuse by the government.Given the politicization of the DOJ under your watch and the importance of avoiding any appearance of impropriety, the undersigned request that you provide U.S. Attorney Weiss the full protections and authorities of a special counsel.  This is one important action that you can take that will go a long way in restoring faith in our governmental institutions.###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-announces-16-million-for-alexandria-international-airport-from-his-bipartisan-infrastructure-law,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) today announced the Department of Transportation (DOT) will grant Alexandria International Airport a total of $1,616,469 from his bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Specifically, the funding will go towards runway rehabilitation to establish safe airfield operations at the airport. With this grant, Louisiana airports have received a total of $45,705,479 in IIJA funding, with more expected over the next five years.“Investment in our airports means jobs and economic growth for communities across Louisiana,” said Dr. Cassidy. “This funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes Alexandria more attractive for businesses and creates opportunity.”###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-peters-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-cut-bureaucratic-waste-save-taxpayer-dollars,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) and Senator Gary Peters (D-MI) introduced bipartisan legislation to save taxpayer dollars by improving management of how the federal government purchases and uses software. The legislation builds on a law written by Cassidy to reduce duplicative software purchases called the MEGABYTE Act. Since being signed into law, this legislation has saved taxpayers more than $450 million.“By requiring the federal government to keep track of its software licenses, we saved taxpayers $450 million,” said Dr. Cassidy. “That’s a win for the taxpayer and a win for government efficiency. This bill builds on this effort to make government work better and save money.""“Requiring federal agencies to conduct in depth assessments of how they buy and use software will ensure they are making better informed decisions about how they purchase these technologies,” said Senator Peters. “The federal government spends nearly $100 billion a year on federal information technology. By streamlining how federal agencies acquire and utilize software, this legislation will modernize government operations and save taxpayer dollars.”BackgroundThe bill would require agencies to conduct an independent, comprehensive assessment of their software licensing practices. This would be used by Congress, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the General Services Administration (GSA) to increase federal oversight of software contracts in order to streamline operations and reduce wasteful spending. Billions of dollars are spent on software purchases and license modifications every year. The current manner in which vendors sell software leaves agencies in the dark about what they are already using, causing them to purchase duplicative products.This bill will reduce costs, improve governance, and enhance agency performance. It will also allow agencies to receive fairer, more cost competitive deals on their software assets and achieve important IT modernization goals. ###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-daines-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-protect-use-of-traditional-ammo-and-tackle,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), Steve Daines (R-MT), and 21 colleagues today introduced the Protecting Access for Hunters and Anglers Act, which stops federal agencies from banning the use of traditional ammo or tackle on public lands without approval from scientific institutions and state wildlife agencies. Last week, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service passed a rule that bans the use of lead ammunition and fishing tackle on federal land.“Every Louisianan knows how important outdoor recreation and conservation is to our state’s way of life,” said Dr. Cassidy. “A federal bureaucrat who has never cast a line or shot a rifle has no place telling Louisiana sportsmen how they can hunt and fish.”“Sportsmen are the original conservationists and play an important role in wildlife management—the last thing we should do is limit their access to public lands by implementing a blanket-ban on traditional ammo and tackle. Not only would this affect our state agencies’ revenue but it’s also unfair to sportsmen who can’t access or afford lead alternatives and depend on hunting and fishing,” Senator Daines said. “Outdoor recreation is part of our Montana way of life—I’ll keep fighting to protect our hunting and fishing legacy and ensuring these decisions are guided by science, not politics.”Cassidy and Daines are joined by Senators Jim Risch (R-ID), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Rick Scott (R-FL), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Mike Braun (R-IN), John Barrasso (R-WY), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), John Thune (R-SD), Tom Cotton (R-AR), John Hoeven (R-ND), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Todd Young (R-IN).The legislation is supported by MT Outfitters and Guides Association, Boone and Crockett Club, American Sportfishing Association, National Rifle Association, The Bass Federation, The Walleye Federation, Safari Club International, Wildlife Mississippi, Dallas Safari Club, Congressional Sportsmen Foundation, Sportsmen’s Alliance, National Shooting Sports Foundation, Conservation Force, and Marine Retailers Association of the Americas.Read the full text of the bill here.###"

Further, Secretary McDonough had no answer regarding reports that since the introduction of the VA’s Opioid Safety Initiative, suicide among veterans in rural areas increased by 75%. “My staff requested information regarding veterans’ health care in the community…and we were told to submit a Freedom of Information Act. This is Congress. This is the [Senate] VA Committee which is supposed to be providing oversight and we were told to submit a FOIA. It kind of took things to a new level…it just blows my mind. I am representing people. And when those people feel as if the VA is doing nothing but hiding, it’s not me—it’s the people I represent, the veterans I represent—who are really being offended,” said Dr. Cassidy. On reports that there was a 75% increase in veteran suicide in rural areas since the introduction of the VA’s Opioid Safety Initiative…Cassidy: “On April 12th, our office sent a letter to you regarding the ineffectiveness of the VA’s Opioid Safety Initiative and asked what barriers Congress should remove in order to better public-private partnerships to increase veterans' access to testing and treatment. There was an August 2021 report in The Washington Post which kind of motivated this which showed after the introduction of the Opioid Safety Initiative, suicides among veterans in rural areas increased by 75 percent and increased in the urban areas by 35 percent. We have not heard back from the letter we sent on April 12th about a program which The Washington Post is reporting was at least associated temporally, we don’t know causally, with a 75% increase in veteran suicide in rural areas. Any comment?"" McDonough: “No, I will get to the bottom of it.”Senate VA Committee Chairman Jon Tester (D-MT) shared Cassidy’s frustrations over the lack of transparency from Secretary McDonough saying to Cassidy, “…I just want to say that I would be just as frustrated as you with the FOIA request back. I would hope that because I have done this with everybody from Wilkie to this secretary that if there was something that came up like that that you could get ahold of them immediately and say ‘hey this is unacceptable.’ I don’t know what the rules around FOIA are, but I get your point. And when we ask questions, we need to get answers.”Cassidy, as a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, has a congressional oversight role over the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure the agency is providing accessible, quality health care for our nation’s veterans and their families. Timeline of Cassidy’s staff attempting to get data on the VA’s health care efficiency for our nation’s veterans and their families from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs: ###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-finance-committee-republicans-urge-irs-to-use-massive-funding-boost-to-fix-numerous-existing-problems,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) and Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID) today led a group of senators urging the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner to spend the massive $80 billion injection of mandatory funding recently granted to it under Democrats’ latest reckless spending spree. The senators requested a detailed plan on how the IRS will fix existing problems while satisfying the critical need for improved customer service, transparency and accountability.“With an infusion of $80 billion of new funding, the IRS must be accountable, and accountability requires transparency and timely communication with its authorizing Committees,” wrote the senators.Rather than vague plans outlined by Treasury to date, the senators request detailed information on how the IRS will: In additional to Cassidy and Crapo, the letter was signed by Senators Crapo (R-ID), Grassley (R-IA), Cornyn (R-TX), Thune (R-SD), Burr (R-NC), Portman (R-OH), Toomey (R-PA), Scott (R-SC), Lankford (R-OK), Daines (R-MT) , Young (R-IN), Sasse (R-NE), and Barrasso (R-WY).Read the full letter here or below. From the letter:On Prioritizing Taxpayer Services:“…In 2021, taxpayers waited at length for their refunds and approximately 250 million calls to the IRS went unanswered.  Millions of taxpayers should not wait well over a year for their refund or spend days trying to connect with the IRS.  The situation is particularly dire for millions faced with 40-year high inflation and in need of their tax refund to support their families. . . . The IRS should use its additional funding to prioritize clearing the backlog of returns and correspondence, and expediently pay taxpayers who are owed a refund,”wrote the senators.On Guarding Taxpayers Against Partisan Targeting:“Americans should be able to trust that the government will enforce the law without regard to political beliefs, religion, or party affiliation.  Compared to other government agencies, the IRS has a broad and powerful reach into Americans’ daily lives.  The American people have a right to expect the IRS will exercise its power in a fair, neutral, and impartial manner.  There should be no hint of religious or political bias or partisanship; the IRS must take this responsibility seriously,” wrote the senators.On Protecting Taxpayer’s Privacy:“The IRS must hold taxpayer information securely in order to preserve its confidentiality.  The law protecting taxpayer information rests on sound principles that evolved from adverse experiences with the misuse of tax information. …“Regarding the ProPublica leak, the American people remain in the dark about who was responsible and how it was allowed to happen.  Although we understand TIGTA is investigating the leak to ProPublica, the IRS is not a bystander in this ‘very damaging’ event,” wrote the senators.On Modernizing Technology:“Modernizing the IRS’s technology infrastructure must be a top priority.  With an additional $4.75 billion of the supersized IRS funding allocated to technological improvements, and with the IRS’s Integrated Modernization Business Plan providing loose sketches of what the IRS wants to do and how it plans on doing it, there is room for realizing productivity gains and accompanying improved taxpayer service.…“Refinement and clear articulation of metrics and milestones that independent overseers can objectively use for monitoring any IRS IT and/or business plan modernization are required,” wrote the senators.On Transparency and Accountability:“The IRS needs to report to Congress and the American people clear, reliable metrics for monitoring productivity improvements and related customer service improvements facilitated by its supersized budget.  …“With an infusion of $80 billion of new funding, the IRS must be accountable, and accountability requires transparency and timely communication with its authorizing Committees,” wrote the senators.###"

https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-murphy-van-hollen-introduce-legislation-to-improve-neurological-health-research,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), Chris Murphy (D-CT), and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) today introduced legislation to reauthorize the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System (NNCSS) program, which collects data which collects privacy-protected data on neurological conditions to inform research and help advance better treatments and cures. Specifically, the legislation would reauthorize the NNCSS for another five years and increase funding to $10 million starting in FY23 and up to $20 million by FY26. Reauthorization would allow the program to complete its current work on Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson’s and expand to other neurological conditions.“Hope for cures comes through advances in knowledge. Let’s create that hope,” said Dr. Cassidy. “This bill supports research into treatments and cures while protecting patients’ privacy.”“The NNCSS is a critical program that helps us better understand neurological conditions like Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson’s Disease, which each impact more than a million Americans and their families. Their research is key to developing more effective treatments and ultimately finding a cure for these horrific diseases. We must continue to support their lifesaving work,” said Senator Murphy. “For Americans living with neurological conditions, like Parkinson’s and MS, good data holds the key to advancing innovative treatments and cures. That’s why it’s crucial that we fully fund the NNCSS program for another five years to expand data collection and research capabilities. This legislation will help millions of patients – and families – who are impacted by these conditions each year, as we seek to strengthen our responses to and treatments available for neurological conditions,” said Senator Van Hollen.  This legislation is endorsed by the American Academy of Neurology, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the Michael J. Fox Foundation. “Curing and preventing Parkinson’s means providing researchers with the most robust information about how the disease originates and what potential triggers exist here in the United States. The National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System is a world-class engine that is integral to curing Parkinson’s and other neurological conditions,” said Ted Thompson, JD, senior vice president of The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research.“On behalf of the Parkinson’s community, we call on Congress to reauthorize the NNCSS so that the world’s best and brightest can have access to the data and information they need to cure and, one day, prevent Parkinson’s.  Parkinson’s costs the United States more than $52 billion every year, and that will grow to at least $80 billion in the next 15 years. Investing $10 million in FY 2023 in the NNCSS to be able to eventually offset billions of dollars in the cost for care is a smart investment I hope Congress will support."" “Brain health is crucial to individual health. A key way policymakers can improve brain health is through gathering more data about the incidence and prevalence of neurologic disease,” said Orly Avitzur, MD, MBA, FAAN, President of the American Academy of Neurology. “The National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System has begun to provide critical insights into Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis.  This legislation will ensure this important project continues and has the resources to expand to more neurologic conditions over time. Neurologic diseases cost the United States more than $600 billion each year – we need investments like the NNCSS to provide essential data to researchers to help improve brain health.”“With a new study identifying the annual economic burden of multiple sclerosis (MS) at $85.4 billion, it is more important than ever to provide researchers with accurate and up-to-date data to lead to answers and a cure for MS,” said Bari Talente, executive vice president of advocacy and healthcare access at the National MS Society. “The National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System is positioned to provide crucial information to researchers working to end MS and other neurological diseases. MS activists urge Congress to support the reauthorization and $10 million in federal funding for FY23 of the NNCSS.”###"

https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-marshall-colleagues-to-fda-commissioner-quit-ignoring-baby-formula-applications,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-KS), and 11 of their Senate Republican colleagues sent a letter to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the agency’s ongoing strategy to replenish the supply of baby formula across the country.“Despite the numerous flexibilities and resources provided by Congress and temporary import flexibilities outlined in your letter, the infant formula crisis persists nationwide… American families need permanent long-term solutions, and that includes increasing capacity and competition in the U.S. market…Given the delicate nature of the infant formula supply chain, it’s become even more apparent that we need to diversify our commercial capacity by providing other industry manufacturers the opportunity to compete,” wrote the senators.“Under the enforcement discretion authorized by President Biden’s May Executive Orders to address the formula crisis, the FDA approved only 23 infant formula products, or base powder, from 10 unique manufacturers out of dozens of ex-U.S. based formula and milk companies that have applied for short-term FDA approval to provide infant formula to the U.S. marketplace… The last application granted by FDA for enforcement discretion was August 10, over a month ago… it is unclear why the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition has chosen to ignore so many applications for more manufacturers to market infant formula products for interstate commerce,” continued the senators.The Senators concluded their letter with questions about the FDA’s approval process for formula applications, how many applications have not been answered and why, and if applications for specialty formulas had been considered, among others.Joining Senators Cassidy and Marshall were Senators John Thune (R-SD), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), John Boozman, O.D. (R-AR), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Rick Scott (R-FL), John Barrasso, M.D. (WY), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN).Read the full letter here or below.Commissioner Califf:Thank you for responding to our letter regarding the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) investigation of Abbott Nutrition’s facility and the infant formula shortage crisis. Despite the numerous flexibilities and resources provided by Congress and temporary import flexibilities outlined in your letter, the infant formula crisis persists nationwide.1, 2, 3 Some of the FDA’s flexibilities are set to expire at the end of this month and Operation Fly-Formula, while alleviating some issues, cannot run indefinitely. American families need permanent long-term solutions, and that includes increasing capacity and competition in the U.S. market.The infant formula market has consolidated over the years due to manufacturing-related issues and consumer demand so any disruption in an oligopoly will undoubtedly lead to supply chain shortages. Over 80 percent of the market is largely comprised of three manufacturers including Abbott Nutrition, Mead Johnson, and Perrigo. Abbott Laboratories lead with 49.5 percent, followed by Mead Johnson at 20.6 percent, and Perrigo with 11.9 percent.4 Abbott Nutrition recently announced it will restart its Similac® infant formula production at its facility in Sturgis, Michigan.5 We understand FDA did not establish or rule out a direct link between the deaths and the formula produced at the plant. But we now know that any disruption from one manufacturer – including one that makes up almost half of the infant formula market – can devastate families and cascade into a whole-of-government approach to resolve. Given the delicate nature of the infant formula supply chain, it’s become even more apparent that we need to diversify our commercial capacity by providing other industry manufacturers the opportunity to compete. This is especially necessary for manufacturers of infant formula products that cannot be reasonably substituted by currently available products.Despite this significant crisis, to date, under the enforcement discretion authorized by President Biden’s May Executive Orders to address the formula crisis, the FDA approved only 23 infant formula products, or base powder, from 10 unique manufacturers out of dozens of ex-U.S. based formula and milk companies that have applied for short-term FDA approval to provide infant formula to the U.S. marketplace. Of the products approved, 13 were approved for infants who rely on “regular” formula products, and only three are for special nutrition needs. In addition to these products intended for infants who rely on “regular” formula, the agency has approved just 6 specialty products, or bases, from 5 unique manufacturers. The last application granted by FDA for enforcement discretion was August 10, over a month ago.What’s most concerning is FDA’s decision last month to defer further review of pending applications after taking over a month to respond.6, 7 We understand from several manufacturers that FDA has still not indicated any attempt to review or prioritize increasing domestic production through competition.Given the above, it is unclear why the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition has chosen to ignore so many applications for more manufacturers to market infant formula products for interstate commerce. Therefore, we respectfully request your responses to the following questions:1. Over the last several months, how many applications for infant formula products has the FDA received, and what were the committed quantities in these applications?2. For the 16 products approved, what is the current status of manufacturers’ production capacity and committed quantities?3. Of the 10 unique manufacturers applications that FDA approved, which manufacturers delivered on committed quantities?4. For manufacturers the FDA approved, have any of their authorizations been withdrawn? If so, please describe the reason.5. How many applications are currently pending? Starting from the submission dates, what is the timeline of each application’s status based on FDA’s classification of its stages for approval?6. Are there applications pending, deferred, or denied that aimed to bring to market specialty infant formula?7. Has the FDA provided reasonable flexibilities in its communications with applicants?8. Can you provide a clear explanation as to why no additional applications for regular infant formula have been approved since August?The FDA has the opportunity to learn from this crisis and ensure this does not happen again. We would appreciate a reply no later than Wednesday, October 5, 2022. Thank you for your attention to this matter and please do not hesitate to reach out to us or our staff should the agency require resources or cooperation from other agencies to fulfill its obligations. ###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-releases-statement-on-decrease-in-veteran-suicides,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) released a statement after the Department of Veterans Affairs announced the veteran suicide rate fell 9.7 percent from 2018 to 2020.“Veteran suicide is still too high, but we are making progress,” said Dr. Cassidy. “There is still work to do so that one day we are speaking of veteran suicide in the past tense.”In 2020, there were 6,146 veteran suicide deaths, down 343 deaths than in 2019.BackgroundEarlier this month, the Senate unanimously passed Cassidy’s Solid Start Act to strengthen the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Solid Start program to contact every veteran three times by phone in the first year after they leave active duty. The program helps connect veterans with VA programs and benefits, including mental health resources.In May, Cassidy also introduced the Mental Health Reform Reauthorization Act of 2022 to reauthorize and improve Cassidy’s historic 2016 mental health reform package.After the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan last summer, Cassidy led a bipartisan group of senators calling on the VA to conduct outreach to veterans who served in Afghanistan to provide mental health resources in response to an uptick in veteran suicide hotline calls.Veterans in crisis can dial 9-8-8 and then press 1 to be connected with the Veterans Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-crapo-senate-finance-committee-republicans-demand-accountability-for-continued-late-release-of-medicare-social-security-trustees-reports,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), Mike Crapo (R-ID), and Senate Finance Committee Republicans sent a letter to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) requesting the agency monitor the Managing Trustee’s flagrant disregard for statutory deadlines.  Required by law, the Medicare and Social Security Trustees reports are to be issued no later than April 1, yet the 2021 and 2022 reports were issued August 31 and June 2, respectively. “With respect to reporting on the financial conditions of trust funds, once again this year the reports were issued well beyond the statutory deadline, and there was no process followed by the Managing Trustee for informing the public or members of Congress about the delay or reasons for the delay,” wrote the senators.“Late reporting on financial conditions of important trust funds that support multi-trillion-dollar Social Security and Medicare programs does not seem important to the administration, even in light of the striking decision by the President to politicize the Social Security Administration,” continued the senators.The Biden Administration has repeatedly ignored Congressional inquiries as to why the trustees reports have not been submitted in a timely manner.  Neither Treasury Secretary Yellen nor the Board of Trustees have signaled any intent to modify internal procedure regulating management of the report schedule, nor have they adopted previous GAO recommendations to improve communication with Congress.  It is the responsibility of the Treasury Secretary to provide these reports to Congress in a timely manner, as required by law, or provide Congress and the American people with explanations for late work. Read the full letter here or below. Dear Comptroller Dodaro: The Social Security Act requires that the Boards of Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, as one of their duties, “Report to the Congress not later than the first day of April of each year on the operation and status of the Trust Funds….”  Disregarding the law, the 2021 trustees report was not issued until August 31 of last year, the latest issuance date relative to the statutory deadline since at least 1995.  Subsequently, the 2022 report was once again issued, on June 2, beyond the statutory deadline.  In both instances, the Managing Trustee, who also serves as the Treasury Secretary, provided no meaningful communication to either the public or Congress explaining the delay. The Biden Administration has ignored repeated Congressional inquiries demanding to know why the trustees reports have not been submitted on schedule.  Neither the Managing Trustee nor the Boards as a whole have signaled any intent to modify internal processes and procedures, and perhaps even update Board bylaws, to improve (1) the timeliness of the reports’ delivery and (2) the communication with the public and Congress about the status of the reports’ due date. Of note, the Social Security Administration has unfortunately become politicized, as the President chose to remove without cause a Commissioner who had been duly appointed with the advice and consent of the Congress.  In addition, there have not been the requisite public trustees to represent the public and help avoid a purely partisan Board composition since the 2015 reports were issued.  Because of actions by the current administration, it unfortunately cannot now be said that management and oversight of the Social Security Administration or Medicare has representation from a significant share of the voting population who are not members of one political party.With respect to reporting on the financial conditions of trust funds, once again this year the reports were issued well beyond the statutory deadline, and there was no process followed by the Managing Trustee for informing the public or members of Congress about the delay or reasons for the delay.   Your useful report (GAO-21-105413 Timeliness of Trust Fund Reports) of September 30, 2021, reiterated prior GAO recommendations, including that the Secretary of the Treasury, in the secretary’s capacity as the chairperson of the boards, “work with the other trustees to establish a policy to inform congressional committees of jurisdiction when the reports are expected to miss this deadline; we recommend that this outreach include the factors contributing to the delay and the updated expected issuance dates.”  While your letter of September 30, 2021 identifies that “Treasury concurred” with GAO recommendations,” there is no evidence of concurrence in practice.    For this year’s reports, the Managing Trustee, or her designee, failed to keep the congressional committees of jurisdiction regularly informed of the anticipated report delivery dates.  There was no indication that the Boards anticipated missing the statutorily set report due date, nor was there any communication by the Managing Trustee or the boards about delays, let alone reasons for delays.  Late reporting on financial conditions of important trust funds that support multi-trillion-dollar Social Security and Medicare programs does not seem important to the administration, even in light of the striking decision by the President to politicize the Social Security Administration. As Congress is increasingly compelled to rely on the Congressional Budget Office’s estimated projections of the financial condition of both the Social Security and Medicare trust funds as a source of nonpartisan, timely analysis, we recommend that GAO continue to monitor the Managing Trustee’s lack of adherence to statutory deadlines and urge significant improvements in transparency and communication with the public and Congress. Sincerely,###"

The Felony Murder for Deadly Fentanyl Distribution Act would add the distribution of fentanyl, resulting in death, to the list of crimes that are eligible to be charged as felony murder.“Criminals poisoning Americans with fentanyl should be treated the same as someone pulling the trigger of a gun,” said Dr. Cassidy. “If drug dealers and cartels push this deadly substance, they will face justice.”Felony murder is equivalent to first-degree, premediated murder and requires a minimum of life and is also eligible for capital punishment if convicted.Later, Cassidy joined another group of colleagues to hold the CEOs of Instagram, TikTok, Snap Inc., and YouTube accountable for their failure to adequately prevent the sale of fentanyl-laced pills to teenagers and young adults on their platforms. “Social media platforms like yours provide a convenient venue for dealers to anonymously and discreetly peddle these counterfeit pills to a young audience,” wrote the senators.“With 4 in 10 of these pills containing a lethal dose of fentanyl, more and more of these online transactions are ending in tragedy,” continued the senators.In addition to Cassidy, the letter was signed by Senators Daines (R-MT), Lee (R-UT), Blackburn (R-TN), Sullivan (R-AK), Marshall (R-KS), Lankford (R-OK), and Hyde-Smith (R-MS). Read the full letter here.BackgroundFentanyl is now the leading cause of death among adults age 18-45. According to the CDC, illicitly manufactured fentanyl was the leading cause of overdose deaths, accounting for 71,328 lost lives in 2021, up from 57,834 in 2020, with an even sharper increase expected in 2022. In July, Cassidy lead a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing on the fentanyl crisis, during which he laid out a strategy to combat the surge in fentanyl and overdose deaths. Cassidy also highlighted his HALT Fentanyl Act which would permanently make fentanyl a Schedule I drug.###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-to-cdc-head-why-should-the-american-people-trust-the-cdc,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) once again demanded answers and transparency from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky during today’s Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing. Cassidy pressed Dr. Walensky over CDC’s own internal reporting from July that 78% of CDC employees are working fully remote or only come into the office part-time, which the CDC only reluctantly revealed after a FOIA request from The Epoch Times. This comes as the Biden administration asks Congress for $22.4 billion additional taxpayer dollars for CDC and our federal health agencies.“Dr. Walensky, part of [a robust response to infectious diseases] has got to be predicated on trust between the American people and the agencies, that the agencies are functioning to the best that they can. I feel like that trust has frankly been dissipated,” said Dr. Cassidy.On The Epoch Times receiving information Cassidy has requested for nearly a year…“I’ve asked you on multiple occasions what percentage of the CDC workforce is actually showing up. Frankly, you’ve always blocked that. You have never given a straight answer. I’d like to enter for the record an article from The Epoch Times in which they did a FOIA request to find out how many folks at the CDC were actually working—showing up…and 2,772 out of roughly 13,000 employees are showing up every day…but 78% are working completely remotely or come in maybe only twice every two months. Why is that important? First, that was a noble fact but it was not shared with Congress, we the representatives of the American people. I think the American people would like to know if the CDC is not functioning well, how many of the people are actually showing up,” continued Dr. Cassidy.On Dr. Walensky teleworking and disfunction within the CDC…“I mention CDC not functioning well because I now reference an article that I will enter to the record, from The New York Times from August 17th…at the end of the article, they quote an acting director [of CDC] under President Obama, Dr. Besser, first pointing out that you are still working remotely, you yourself are still working remotely at least as of August 17th. And then [they write], ‘but he said it was hard to see how Dr. Walensky could execute wholesale changes when she only sees most of her staff at a distance. “I don’t know how you motivate and inspire culture change when people aren’t together,”[he said]’” said Dr. Cassidy. On CDC requesting additional funding…“Now CDC is requesting billions of dollars for public health initiatives in an agency, which by your assessment is not functioning well, in which about only 22% of the people are showing up every day, and in which previous Obama officials are doubtful that you can affect change because you don’t show up every day. I say that, kind of painfully, because I want the CDC to work,” said Dr. Cassidy. “It is incredibly frustrating that a deliberate decision was made to not be transparent with the American people as regards to the amount of people actually showing up for work. It takes a FOIA request from a newspaper, and now you’re asking for billions more. Why should we trust [CDC with billions]?”On pre-pandemic in-person work numbers at the CDC…Cassidy: “What percent of CDC employees before the pandemic actually showed up for work every day, as opposed to the only 22% [coming into the office full-time] now?” Walensky: “I don’t have those numbers for you.” Background:According to a July 20 article from The Epoch Times, a Freedom of Information Act request (FOIA) to the CDC’s record office confirmed that “[o]f the approximately 12,679 full-time workers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 78 percent are either not working in-person at all, or are only doing so part of the time.” The FOIA request “…shows that 5,440 workers remain fully remote, 4,467 spend at least some time working remotely, and just 2,772 workers report to work in-person each day.”On August 17, The New York Times reported that Dr. Walensky continues to work remotely. Timeline of Cassidy pressing CDC Director Walenksy for answers regarding their in-person work statistics:May 2021: Cassidy Demands Federal Bureaucrats to Return to WorkNovember 2021: Cassidy Grills CDC Director Walensky on Returning Federal Workforce to WorkJune 2022: 'How Many Days Have You Personally Been In Your Office This Past Week?': Cassidy Grills Walensky###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-unanimously-passes-cassidy-legislation-to-support-veterans-during-their-transition-to-civilian-life,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) released a statement following the Senate passage of his bipartisan legislation to strengthen the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Solid Start Program, which assists veterans with their transition to civilian life by helping them connect with the VA programs and benefits they earned. Cassidy joined U.S. Senators Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and Kevin Cramer (R-ND) in introducing the Solid Start Act last year.“The transition to civilian life is not always easy. Passing this bill through the Senate is one more step towards giving veterans the support they need to ensure they receive the benefits they earned,” said Dr. Cassidy.“I’ve talked with New Hampshire veterans about the immense challenges that many veterans face when they end their active duty service, and many are not even aware that resources are available from the VA to help with everything from getting mental health care to finding a civilian job,” said Senator Hassan. “Supporting veterans is not a partisan issue, and I am glad to have teamed up with my colleagues across the aisle on this bill to strengthen outreach to veterans. I will continue working to make sure that Granite State veterans receive the support that they need, especially after having sacrificed so much for our freedoms.”“Making sure the brave servicemen and women have access to the benefits, healthcare, and other resources they earned is a crucial part of my role on the Veterans Affairs Committee. The Solid Start program was created by the Trump Administration to help veterans transition to civilian life. Our bill codifies this successful program to ensure veterans will have access to the support services they need. I applaud the Senate’s unanimous support and urge its final passage,” said Senator Cramer.The VA launched the Solid Start program in December 2019 with the goal of reaching out to all newly separated veterans three times within their first year of separation to check in and help connect them to VA programs and benefits, regardless of separation type or characterization of service. The program also prioritizes outreach to veterans who accessed mental health resources prior to separation in order to quickly connect at-risk veterans to services. The bipartisan bill would codify the program and authorize sufficient funding so that it can continue to serve veterans, and also makes improvements such as: Earlier this year, the non-partisan Government Accountability Office started to assess the Solid Start program to ensure that it is efficiently and effectively meeting its goals. Additionally, data released by the VA late last year showed that in the first nine months of the Solid Start program, the VA successfully contacted almost 70,000 newly separated veterans, including over 12,000 veterans who had sought mental health support in their last year of service.###"

People aren’t dumb, they’re still paying 11.4% more for food than last year,” said Dr. Cassidy. “Washington Democrats have no plan to bring prices down.”The CPI rose 8.3% in August 2022 from a year ago. This figure is more than four times higher than the Federal Reserve’s informal goal of 2% inflation.In response to the Biden administration’s assault on domestic energy, a major driver of inflation, Dr. Cassidy released a landmark energy & climate policy outline earlier this year detailing how the U.S. can successfully reset our energy and climate policy. The outline included Cassidy’s plan for an Operation Warp Speed for U.S. energy production to cut permitting red tape and unleash U.S. energy. ###"

This information will then be used to improve treatment and clinical coordination of patient care.“Information sharing is central to the success of recent cancer research. That same approach is needed for sepsis,” said Dr. Cassidy. “Our bill bridges gaps in sepsis treatment in hopes to save more lives.”“The more we know about sepsis infections, the more we can prevent future tragedy. This bill would provide much-needed data, improve patient care and save lives,” said Senator Casey.“The establishment of a national sepsis data trust and the authorization of state-based sepsis pilot programs will give researchers, innovators, clinicians, and public health officials critical insight into a condition that is responsible for 350,000 deaths in the U.S. each year,” said Thomas Heymann, President and CEO of Sepsis Alliance. “We know from existing data repositories, such as the National Program of Cancer Registries, that better information about how a condition progresses, who is most affected, and what treatments are working strengthens our ability to protect our communities. We are eager to see this bill made law in order to help us save lives and limbs from sepsis.” Currently, Louisiana reports the highest death rate for sepsis in the U.S.Background The bill would allow the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a national sepsis data trust and fund state-based pilots and programs. The sepsis data trust would be a voluntary system to aggregate data on different strains of bacteria that contribute to the pathology of sepsis and the analysis of the genetic factors that contribute to the risk of having sepsis.All patient data in the trust will be anonymous, deidentified, and privacy-protected.This bill is the first proposal to establish an interoperable sepsis data trust to allow hospitals and medical research centers to work together and improve disease outcomes.###"

One example is Ville Platte, which will benefit from a grant secured by the Acadiana Planning Commission that will expand broadband service to 22,590 households, 3,723 businesses, 19 schools and 4 hospitals in Evangeline, Acadia and St. Landry Parishes. Cassidy wrote a letter to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration in support of the grant, and visited Ville Platte High School in April to celebrate its approval. The IIJA will make it possible for more communities to have similar access to high-speed Internet.###"

The host for the meeting was West Monroe Mayor Staci Mitchell.“The City of West Monroe sincerely thanks Senator Cassidy for taking time out of his schedule to visit with community leaders,” said Mayor Mitchell.  “Senator Cassidy spoke on several issues impacting our region, and we appreciate the opportunity to visit with him and learn more about these important issues. We look forward to continue working with Senator Cassidy and his team on special projects and opportunities to improve the West Monroe community.”In addition to flood control, Senator Cassidy highlighted other parts of his Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, including money to plug orphan wells, build passenger rail and increase access to high-speed Internet. He also discussed historic tax credits and access to mental health services.“Mayor Staci Mitchell, the police jury and private companies are using the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill and other federal programs to decrease the risk of flooding, restore downtown West Monroe and otherwise make West Monroe a better place to live,” said Dr. Cassidy. “I will continue to bring these resources to Northeast Louisiana to help them achieve their goals.”“Every part of our state needs to be safe from flooding,” said Dr. Cassidy. “That is critical if we want to keep families and businesses in Louisiana. West Monroe is doing a great job preparing for flooding, and the bipartisan infrastructure plan will help more communities do the same.The previous evening, Cassidy visited Tallulah, where he toured the Madison Parish Port and met with regional port directors and elected officials. They spoke about the money available for ports in the infrastructure bill, including for dredging. He also met business leaders whose companies operate at the Madison Port, including RailcarCo, which repairs railway vehicles.“The people in Madison Parish are committed to making it better and more prosperous,” said Dr. Cassidy. “In the town hall meeting in Tallulah we discussed how the bipartisan infrastructure bill helps accomplish that.”Cassidy was escorted through the port by its executive director, Mr. Terry Murphy.“I appreciate Senator Cassidy’s support for our port and everything he’s done to support us since he’s been in office,” said Mr. Murphy.###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-announces-3-million-for-louisiana-broadband-improvements-through-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-first-state-to-receive-funding,"ALEXANDRIA – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) announced that Louisiana is the first state to receive broadband funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) he helped author and pass into law last year. This $2,941,542.28 grant is for the deployment and adoption of affordable and reliable high-speed internet throughout the state.During the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill negotiations, Cassidy pushed for a fair broadband formula that would benefit Louisiana’s needs and ensure the funding was directed to areas that lacked access to high-speed internet. The formula will be based on the number of unserved and underserved broadband recipients in each state as determined by new internet coverage maps expected to be completed by the FCC later this year. Louisiana is expected to receive over a billion dollars in total broadband funding from the infrastructure law over the next five years. “Today’s announcement is just the start of around a billion dollars we can expect from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill to increase broadband access in Louisiana. This will transform our children’s lives and grow our economy,” said Dr. Cassidy. “A student needs internet access at home to study online, the parents to telecommute, a business to reach its customers, and our state to attract new investment.” Every U.S. state and six territories applied for planning grant funding for the Internet for All initiative's Broadband, Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) program and the Digital Equity Act program. Grant awards for all 56 eligible entities will be announced on a rolling basis. The BEAD Program provides $42.45 billion to expand high-speed Internet access by funding planning, infrastructure deployment and adoption programs.###"

The likelihood of this happening has increased thanks to Cassidy’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which includes $66 billion in new funding for passenger and freight rail.“An I-20 corridor passenger rail line, connecting to Atlanta and Dallas, will allow someone to live where they want and easily commute within Louisiana and beyond,” said Dr. Cassidy. “State and local leadership, taking advantage of funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, can make this happen.”If constructed, the project would provide another transportation option for people seeking to commute to Dallas, Atlanta, or somewhere along the I-20 corridor. It would join more than 14 million residents throughout Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. In 2015, an Amtrak feasibility study was conducted that determined a long-distance passenger rail connection could operate profitably over the existing railroad infrastructure. In 2017, a capacity study suggested that a capital expenditure investment of less than $80 million in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi was necessary.Additionally, Canadian Pacific Railway has offered to acquire the Kansas City Southern Railway, a merger pending before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board. Canadian Pacific and Amtrak have announced plans to conduct a study to finalize a cooperative agreement to operate the passenger train for the I-20 corridor along the trackage being acquired by Canadian Pacific.(Insert Photos)Among other stakeholders present was Mr. Knox Ros, Secretary and Treasurer of the Southern Rail Commission, which is coordinating the push to bring passenger rail to North Louisiana.“We have an opportunity to connect North Louisiana to Dallas and Atlanta via rail, bringing visitors and commerce to our region,” said Mr. Ross. “That opportunity is only possible because of Senator Cassidy’s infrastructure plan. We appreciate the Senator’s leadership.”Additionally, Cassidy visited a Super 1 Foods grocery owned by Brookshire’s Food and Pharmacy, at 745 Shreveport-Barksdale Highway. He was given a tour of their store, and learned how they are fighting inflation, managing costs and feeding our community, including through SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and WIC programs. He also learned how federal policy affects the grocery industry.“Grocery stores staying open during the pandemic made us all appreciate how important they and their employees are,” said Dr. Cassidy. “We discussed issues specific to groceries and pharmacies with the goal of lowering the cost of food and medicines.”Cassidy was welcomed by Ms. Alecia Hill, District Vice President and director of the Super 1 Foods store he visited.“We appreciate Senator Cassidy visiting us today to discuss how we are fighting inflation, managing costs and feeding our community while serving our customers and employee-partners through the pandemic. BGC is committed to providing outstanding service to our customers,” said Ms. Hill.###"

This will help keep America and Louisiana safe from overseas threats. We look forward to continuing our relationship with the Senator.”###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-speaks-to-north-rapides-business-and-industry-alliance," ALEXANDRIA – Today, U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) spoke to the North Rapides Business and Industry Alliance, a group of business leaders and other citizens seeking to improve Central Louisiana. Cassidy spoke on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which is yielding great benefits for Central Louisiana.“I enjoyed the conversation with the North Rapides Business and Industry Association,” said Dr. Cassidy. “These are among those that are working to make Central Louisiana more prosperous. I was able to speak about the advantages of the bipartisan infrastructure bill to help them achieve their goals. It is local leadership matching up with federal resources.The IIJA authorized the I-14 corridor, which will run from Georgia to Texas and include stops in Alexandria and Leesville, bringing commuters through the region, and an economic boon for nearby businesses. $65 billion nationwide will be invested in rural broadband, connecting tens of thousands of Louisiana residents to high-speed Internet. Meanwhile, benefits from the IIJA have already come to Central Louisiana. In January, it was announced that the LA 121 over the Calcasieu River bridge project would receive funding from the bill. $700,000 was granted to the Alexandria International Airport for replacing their air traffic control equipment, on top of the $1.6 million they received last December.Cassidy was welcomed by Mr. Michael Johnson, State Representative and President of the North Rapides Business and Industry Alliance. “NRBIA is a non-political organization that brings business and community leaders together to share information and engage in discussions of various issues of interest to our community,” said Rep. Johnson. “We appreciate Senator Cassidy for speaking to our group and allowing us to ask questions and voice our thoughts and opinions to him.”Earlier, Cassidy visited the Central Louisiana Regional Port, to discuss how the IIJA can improve the port’s operations. The Central Louisiana Regional Port is a major hub on the Red River for the shipment of goods to regional, national and international markets. It’s current economic value exceeds over 2,000 indirect and direct jobs.While there, Cassidy was joined by Mr. Ben Russo, the Executive Director for the Central Louisiana Regional Port. “We appreciate Senator Cassidy meeting with us today,” said Mr. Russo. “It is always great when we are able to meet and discuss the opportunities and challenges affecting our port partners, as well as ways to increase the effectiveness of Central Louisiana’s preeminent maritime facility.”Cassidy also met the leadership of Crest Industries and their subsidiary DIS-TRAN Package Substations, one of the businesses based at the port. Crest Industries is a leader in strengthening our electric grid and renewable energy.“Central Louisiana’s future depends upon upgrading infrastructure and having a strategic vision,” said Cassidy. “Speaking with folks at Crest, at the port, and with LSUA, there is this vision. And where there’s vision, there can be optimism.” ###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-op-ed-a-year-after-hurricane-ida,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) published an op-ed in The Advocate marking the one-year anniversary of the landfall of Hurricane Ida. In the op-ed, Cassidy highlights the passage of his Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a multi-billion dollar investment in Louisiana’s infrastructure that will, among other things, make coastal communities more resilient to future storms. Specifically, he discusses investments in stabilizing the power grid, improving roads and bridges, and strengthening our flood mitigation efforts. He also praised the work of the entire Louisiana delegation in securing billions of supplemental disaster relief to expedite the recovery process. He concludes with saying there is much more to be done, including providing critical housing assistance to those affected by the recent disasters.“One year ago today, Hurricane Ida dealt a heavy blow to Louisiana's coast…The destruction from Ida and recent hurricanes was yet another wake-up call that Louisiana needed to upgrade its infrastructure to make us more resilient in the face of future storms.” wrote Dr. Cassidy. “To achieve that goal, I became an author of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to ensure our state would get the resources it needs. Too often, Louisiana has been left out.”“Our communities across South Louisiana have proven their resilience through tough times,” continued Dr. Cassidy. “I will do everything in my power in Washington and will never stop working to ensure that local officials and residents have the tools they need to rebuild and protect their homes for generations to come.”Read the full op-ed here or below. A hurricane like Ida, a year ago today, will require long-term recoveryOne year ago today, Hurricane Ida dealt a heavy blow to Louisiana's coast. Intense flooding overwhelmed communities. The Category 5 storm made landfall in Port Fourchon with maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hour. The storm surge at Grand Isle was recorded at over 10 feet. Many of the families that made it out were forced to relocate across the South.Hurricane-force winds toppled electrical lines, leaving more than a million South Louisiana residents without power. A heat index of over 100 degrees took the lives of nine Louisianans and carbon monoxide poisoning took an additional two.Unfortunately, Hurricane Ida was not the only recent storm to batter our coast and display our state's infrastructure woes. In the fall of 2020, hurricanes Laura and Delta rocked Southwest Louisiana to its core, causing billions of dollars of damage and taking multiple lives. Despite the overwhelming devastation, and tireless work from our delegation in Congress, residents across South Louisiana are still picking up the pieces.The destruction from Ida and recent hurricanes was yet another wake-up call that Louisiana needed to upgrade its infrastructure to make us more resilient in the face of future storms.To achieve that goal, I became an author of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to ensure our state would get the resources it needs. Too often, Louisiana has been left out.During the negotiations for this bipartisan infrastructure bill, I worked to secure three main priorities, among others, to make Louisiana better prepared for the next major disaster. One, the stabilization of our power grid to ensure reliable electricity even during extreme weather events. Two, improvements to our major roads and bridges to expedite future evacuation and relief efforts. And three, investments in flood mitigation and coastal restoration to protect residents from heavy rains and storm surges.The legislation achieved all three objectives, representing a multi-generational investment in our coastal communities. Louisiana can expect to receive hundreds of millions of dollars for electrical grid improvements to reduce the frequency of life-threatening blackouts in the aftermath of a disaster.We will receive $6 billion from the same bipartisan infrastructure bill to improve our roads and bridges. That is 60% more funding for roads and bridges over the next five years than we received over the last five. Not only will this improve daily commutes across the state, but it will also be essential to improve evacuation routes in high-risk areas and reduce bumper-to-bumper traffic when Louisiana families have to escape harm's way.Thankfully, there have already been major developments to improve flood mitigation. Earlier this year, it was announced that over $643 million will be allocated to our state from the bipartisan infrastructure bill to enhance our flood and hurricane protection systems. This included over $378 million for the critical Morganza-to-the-Gulf project to protect Louisiana from dangerous storms, a 3,000% increase in that project's annual funding.In addition to the infrastructure bill funding, I along with members of the Louisiana delegation have worked to secure billions in supplemental disaster assistance for Louisiana to bounce back from the last two years of storms that have battered our state.Even a full year after Hurricane Ida made landfall on our shores, we still have unmet recovery needs including necessary housing assistance. There is still much work to be done.Our communities across South Louisiana have proven their resilience through tough times. I will do everything in my power in Washington and will never stop working to ensure that local officials and residents have the tools they need to rebuild and protect their homes for generations to come.###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-visits-pertt-lab-discusses-louisianas-energy-future-with-lsu-officials-,"BATON ROUGE – Today, U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) visited Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, where among other stops, he toured the LSU Petroleum Engineering Research, Training and Testing (PERTT) Laboratory. The laboratory is an industrial-scale facility with full-scale equipment and instrumentation used for research and to train future petroleum engineers on modern petroleum technologies. “For Louisiana to prosper, we need to adapt to the new economy,” said Dr. Cassidy. “In a variety of ways, we saw today how LSU is seizing the opportunity and developing the potential to help our state transition the way we must.”According to LSU, PERTT is used as an essential asset in the development of petroleum tools used in drilling and production for both land-based and offshore use. It also provides industrial customers the opportunity to demonstrate their tools and technologies at a lower cost rather than using a working rig. As a result, many cutting-edge developments are first tested at the laboratory. Undergraduate students also use PERTT to learn about field operations and blowout prevention.Cassidy himself helped secure $1 million in community funding for LSU’s new Cyber-PERTT initiative in the U.S. Department of Energy’s FY23 Senate Appropriations bill. Together with Radiance Technologies, PERTT is proposing the integration of a flexible and comprehensive cyber physical architecture into their laboratory. The goal is to develop a full-scale, de-risked industrial cybersecurity “sandbox” platform to analyze, test, demonstrate, research and train to defend digital attacks on physical energy infrastructure.During the tour, Cassidy was joined by Dr. William F. Tate, IV, President of the Louisiana State University system, and Dr. Karsten Thompson, Department Chair of Petroleum Engineering.“We welcome Senator Cassidy to campus to examine the impactful research conducted by our outstanding faculty,” said President Tate. “Senator Cassidy champions LSU in the nation’s capital by recognizing our research portfolio and helping to attain federal funds in support of our effort to secure Louisiana’s future. We’re thankful for the Senator’s commitment to his alma mater, and we look forward to his continued partnership in advancing the Scholarship First Agenda.”“We appreciate Senator Cassidy taking the time to visit the PERTT lab today,” said Dr. Thompson. “It was an opportunity to showcase current R&D projects we are conducting for industry sponsors, and to update him on the state and federal investments that will occur over the next two years for CCUS-related infrastructure at the lab.”While at LSU, Senator Cassidy also toured the Louisiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory at the LSU School of Veterinary Medicine, and the Food and Animal Science Laboratory Building in the College of Agriculture. In 2021, Cassidy helped LSU receive an $11 million grant to establish a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence that will be used to create a Center for Preclinical Cancer Research, based at the School of Veterinary Medicine. Finally, Cassidy has been a supporter of federal funding for the College of Agriculture, ranging from money to help address the Roseau Cane scale insect pest infestation, to support for parish-based programs and initiatives out of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture in the Regular Order Yearly Agriculture Appropriations Bill.###"

https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-meets-with-rotary-leaders-in-new-orleans,"METAIRIE – This afternoon, U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) visited the Rotary Club of New Orleans, and discussed issues of importance to their city, including infrastructure and flood insurance.“Everyone in Louisiana wants to see our state be safe, secure, and prosperous,” said Dr. Cassidy. “We talked about how the bipartisan infrastructure bill helps achieve this, to decrease the risk of flooding, help coastal restoration and to create more and better-paying jobs. These Rotarians were in total agreement.”As part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), millions of dollars have already been dedicated to fund bridge improvements across Louisiana, including for the LA-47 Intracoastal Waterway Gulf Outlet Bridge Rehabilitation in New Orleans. Last December, Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport received over $14 million in funding from the IIJA. More money will be available through the IIJA for bridges, airports, ports, flood projects and flood mitigation grants.Cassidy has also worked to help New Orleans fully recover from natural disasters, including Hurricane Katrina. In June, he requested that FEMA extend the August 2023 deadline for the city to use the public assistance it received in the wake of the hurricane. Additionally in June, over $15 million was awarded to the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board for system repairs stemming from Katrina, and over $6 million was awarded in May for Katrina-related expenses.Finally, Cassidy remains committed to fixing Risk Rating 2.0, so Louisiana homeowners do not face crushing flood insurance rates. He has introduced legislation to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program, freeze current flood insurance rates until FEMA meets certain accountability measures, and publish the formulas used to calculate mitigation credits for policyholders under Risk Rating 2.0. He also met with leaders in the River Region Monday on flood insurance.Cassidy was welcomed by Mr. Norman Robinson, President of the Rotary Club of New Orleans.“We thank Senator Cassidy talking with us about the exciting opportunities within his bipartisan infrastructure plan,” said Mr. Robinson. “We wholeheartedly agree with the goal of building roads and bridges, reducing the risk of flooding and helping energy producers compete in the global marketplace. Senator Cassidy and his wife Laura are friends of Rotary and we appreciate their service to our community.”Later, Cassidy met with members of the Vietnamese community in the New Orleans region, to discuss issues of importance impacting the area.“I enjoyed meeting with fellow Americans who are part of the Vietnamese community,” said Dr. Cassidy. “The conversation centered around love of country and the desire for members of their community and other communities to do well. I will work with them to that end.”Cassidy was joined by former U.S. Representative Joseph Cao.“We appreciate Senator Cassidy meeting with us to discuss issues important to our community,” said Congressman Cao. “Senator Cassidy has been a friend of the Vietnamese community and has always paid attention to our concerns and been available to assist us. We look forward to continuing our relationship with him.” ###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-meets-with-industry-leaders-on-infrastructure,"METAIRIE – Today, U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) met with business leaders in the construction industry and related trades, on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the opportunities it provides. Cassidy co-wrote the legislation, which passed the Senate in November of 2021.“The bipartisan infrastructure bill will not only position our state for the modern economy but also create jobs directly and indirectly,” said Dr. Cassidy. “Those direct jobs are related to construction and manufacturing. Today, I was privileged to speak to those companies that are doing that work and creating those jobs.”In January, Cassidy announced that Louisiana will receive approximately $1 billion over five years, including $202.6 million in the current fiscal year, to repair bridges and infrastructure. An additional $82 million over five years was announced in April. Additionally, Cassidy announced this month that $135 million will be allocated to Louisiana over five years to protect roads, bridges and infrastructure from natural disasters. Louisiana has also been allocated money to build flood projects throughout south Louisiana. In January, over $378 million was allocated from the IIJA to the Morganza-to-the-Gulf Hurricane Protection System. $125 million was dedicated to the Southwest Coastal Louisiana Hurricane Protection System. Additional money has been allocated since the IIJA passed for airports, Superfund site clean-up, and orphan well plugging.Cassidy was joined by Mr. Erich Ponti, Executive Director of the Louisiana Asphalt Pavement Association.“Senator Cassidy played a key role in the successful passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill (IIJA),” said Mr. Ponti. “The IIJA is beginning to fund needed improvements to Louisiana’s roads and bridges. Our members appreciated learning more about the opportunities this bill provides to our membership and the State of Louisiana. We will continue to work with the Senator to strengthen Louisiana’s transportation network.”  Later, Cassidy visited ADVANO, which is a leader in clean energy solutions. ADVANO has developed technologies to extend the life of batteries by using silicon in the component production stage. By using silicon for 20% of the battery, there is a 25% gain in the life of the battery. This will be useful for electric vehicles and phones, and ADVANO believes it can create over 500 new, high-quality jobs in Louisiana over the next ten years. “This technology is coming to New Orleans and being brought to scale to create manufacturing jobs here in Louisiana,” said Dr. Cassidy. “It's a huge accomplishment.""Cassidy was led through ADVANO by Mr. Shiva Adireddy, CEO and co-founder of AVANO.“We appreciate that Senator Cassidy visited us at AVANO today,” said Mr. Adireddy. “ADVANO is developing a robust battery supply chain in the Gulf South, leveraging Louisiana’s expertise in specialty chemicals manufacturing and transportation and logistics to manufacture the next generation of battery materials.”“Senator Cassidy’s work to advance energy security, particularly through the passing of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, has unlocked significant support for the commercialization of next-generation battery materials like ADVANO’s REALSi silicon anode technology. We look forward to continuing to work with Senator Cassidy’s office to attract these resources to the State of Louisiana.”###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-statement-on-bidens-unilateral-student-loan-forgiveness-action,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) released a statement following President Biden’s unilateral decision to forgive the student loan debt of some borrowers and extend the pause on payments through December 31, 2022. “President Biden didn’t ‘forgive student debt,’ he chose to shift the burden of the well-off onto the backs of the 87 percent of Americans who chose to not go to college, already paid off their loans, or saved to not take them out in the first place,"" said Dr. Cassidy. ""This decision is a spit in the face of Louisiana families who are struggling to get by. This is spending at least $300 billion we do not have which will make inflation worse. It does nothing to get at the root problem of the high price of education while costing $2,000 per taxpayer.” According to the Penn-Wharton Budget Model, 87 percent of American adults don’t have student loans at all.To bring greater transparency to college costs and post-college earnings, Cassidy is the lead sponsor of the College Transparency Act (CTA), bipartisan legislation to ensure students and families have clear and understandable information as they compare higher education opportunities. The CTA modernizes the college reporting system for postsecondary data by providing accurate reporting on student outcomes such as enrollment, completion, and post-college earnings across colleges and majors, while ensuring the privacy of individual students is securely protected.Earlier this year, Cassidy helped introduced the Student Loan Accountability Act to prohibit the Biden administration from cancelling student loan debt at the expense of millions of Americans who chose to not go to college or worked diligently to pay off any student debt. Cassidy also cosponsored the Stop Reckless Student Loan Actions Act that would end President Biden’s untargeted, budget-busting suspension of repayments on qualifying federal student loans, following 24 months of non-payment and six executive actions extending the payment pause. The bill would still allow the president to temporarily suspend repayment for low- and middle-income borrowers in future national emergencies and would prohibit the president from cancelling outstanding federal student loan obligations due to a national emergency. ###"

They also discussed federal efforts to stop the flow of opioids into the United States.“The United States lost 100,000 people from overdoses last year,” said Dr. Cassidy. ""Southeast Louisiana has been particularly hard hit. This group discussed how federal resources can be used by state and local leaders to better address these issues. There's no one solution, but working together, we can find solutions that will save lives.""  Cassidy has been a leader in securing federal assistance to address opioids. In December of 2016, Cassidy passed into law the Mental Health Reform Act, which expanded federal resources for mental health and substance abuse treatment programs. It also included $1 billion over two years for grants targeting opioid abuse prevention and treatment activities. Later in October of 2018, he helped pass the Opioid Crisis Response Act into law, which took additional measures to help people with addictions, many of which were written by Cassidy. Cassidy has recently introduced legislation that would make permanent the designation of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs as Schedule I substances in the Controlled Substances Act. This year, he also spoke about the fentanyl crisis on the Senate floor and co-led a hearing of the Senate Health, Education Labor and Pensions Committee on the crisis. Cassidy was welcomed by Mr. Ed Carlson, CEO of Odyssey House Louisiana.“Odyssey House Louisiana was honored to have Senator Cassidy visit our facility today for a robust discussion around substance use disorder treatment, current challenges, including the ongoing COVID pandemic and opioid epidemic, and proposed solutions to help improve outcomes for the populations we serve,” said Mr. Carlson. “Senator Cassidy has long been a champion of Louisiana’s most vulnerable citizens. We are appreciative of his leadership in parity efforts so they coverage for substance use and mental health disorders is comparable to coverage for other forms of medical care. As Louisiana and the nation battle multiple crises of addiction and substance use, the conversations we have about overcoming these challenges must be centered around treatment and we are grateful that the policymakers, stakeholders, and fellow providers present today see the importance of this ongoing dialogue and action steps.”Earlier, Cassidy met with members of the St. Tammany Chamber of Commerce and the Northshore Young Professionals group. They discussed the issues facing businesses in the parish.“These leaders know how important it is to improve Louisiana's infrastructure,"" said Dr. Cassidy. ""The bipartisan infrastructure bill will connect the Northshore, including Washington Parish, to high-speed internet. It will also prepare our oil and gas industry for the future. It's a win for Louisiana, and a win for our workers.""Among those present with Cassidy was Ms. Noble-Bates Young, Executive Director at the Northshore Business Council.“As part of the Young Professionals, I value Senator Cassidy's availability to our group and his vision for what our future can be,” said Ms. Young. “He understands the importance of the minor details that shape our community's potential. From his work on mental health and infrastructure, we are grateful for his service!""###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-announces-20-million-to-address-louisiana-health-disparities,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) announced the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will grant Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science (LA CaTS) Center $20 million to address health disparities and improve health outcomes in underserved communities in Louisiana. Specifically, this funding will go towards expanding chronic disease research at LSU’s Pennington Biomedical Research Center. “As a doctor who worked in Louisiana’s charity hospital system, addressing health disparities in underserved communities is a top priority,” said Dr. Cassidy. “This funding will help LA CaTS expand their research and close the health gap in Louisiana.”The Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science (LA CaTS) Center combines 11 major Louisiana academic, research and health care delivery institutions into a unified research infrastructure, collectively “addressing health disparities and improving health outcomes in our underserved population with chronic diseases”. ###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-discusses-risk-rating-20-with-river-region-leaders,"NEW ORLEANS – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) met with Parish Presidents, Mayors, legislators and chamber leaders from across the River Region on Risk Rating 2.0, and its impact on flood insurance policyholders in the region. He discussed his efforts to stop the Biden administration from implementing Risk Rating 2.0.“The only way our workers can keep goods flowing down the Mississippi River is if they can afford to live here,” said Dr. Cassidy. “We will work every day to fix Risk Rating 2.0, so they can build a life in Louisiana.” The Louisiana delegation was successful in pushing the Trump administration to delay Risk rating 2.0 in 2020. But now the Biden administration has chosen to move forward with Risk Rating 2.0, with no input from Congress, despite analysis that it will cause up to 20 percent of policyholders to drop coverage. Congress has not passed any law requiring the administration to implement rate hikes. President Biden can roll back Risk Rating 2.0 with the stoke of a pen.Cassidy has worked with colleagues to make flood insurance affordable. In March, he introduced the Homeowners Flood Insurance Transparency and Protect Act, which would allow National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) policyholders to maintain their current rates until FEMA can meet certain accountability measures. He also introduced bipartisan legislation to require FEMA to publish the formulas used to calculate mitigation credits for policyholders under Risk Rating 2.0. This is all in the wake of FEMA’s acknowledgment that Risk Rating 2.0 could cause 20% of policyholders to drop out of the NFIP due to skyrocketing premiums.Among others, Cassidy was joined by Ms. Chassity McComack, Executive Director of the River Region Chamber.“We are truly grateful for Senator Cassidy and his staff taking the time to talk with our members and parish leaders on this legislation,” said Ms. McComack. “With flood protection being at the top of our priorities list, it’s important to keep in tune with the facts and how this legislation will impact residents and our business communities.”Earlier, Cassidy toured Fletcher Technical Community College, where he learned what they need to fully recover from Hurricane Ida. He also saw that Fletcher is doing to train new workers for the maritime industry. “Fletcher is doing an incredible job training the workers we need to support industry in Louisiana, and even had an increase in enrollment despite Hurricane Ida,” said Dr. Cassidy. “I will continue to help them fulfill their mission.”Cassidy was joined by Ms. Kristine Strickland, Chancellor of Fletcher Technical Community College.“We are excited to welcome Senator Cassidy to Fletcher Technical Community College,” said Chancellor Strickland.“Senator Cassidy has always been a tremendous supporter of community college education and we are honored to be included in his visit to the Bayou Region. We appreciate that Senator Cassidy took time, as we approach the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Ida, to tour our Thibodaux campus and visit with students as we continue our recovery. We were also happy to share our plans to expand maritime education for our state. Senator Cassidy’s support means a great deal in our ability to not only recover but grow economic prosperity in the region.###"

https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-discusses-domestic-energy-development-with-bayou-industrial-group,"NEW ORLEANS – Today, U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) spoke to the Bayou Industrial Group on the need to ramp up energy production and improve infrastructure in Louisiana. The Bayou Industrial Group is comprised of business leaders throughout the Bayou Region, including from the oil and gas sector. “We need to boost energy production at home, and these companies have employees who are trained and ready to go.” said Dr. Cassidy. “We’ve funded infrastructure that will keep them competitive globally. Now let’s start taking advantage of our own energy resources, instead of relying on Russia and Venezuela.”In March, Cassidy released a policy outline on how the United States can reset its energy and climate policy and break our dependence on foreign oil through an “Operation Warp Speed” for energy. His plan would invest in U.S. energy production and cut the bureaucratic red tape which stymies it, built more resilient supply chains, and work with allies and developing countries to reduce their reliance on Russia and China.Last November, Cassidy’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) was also signed into law. Among other provisions, the IIJA invests over $5 billion in carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technology, and $8 billion in clean hydrogen hubs to demonstrate the production, processing, delivery, storage and end-use of clean hydrogen. Cassidy was welcomed by Ms. Jodie Arceneaux.“Bayou Industrial Group is grateful to have Senator Cassidy here to visit the Bayou Region to discuss matters important to our members and visit with our local delegation,” said Ms. Arceneaux. “We’re excited to give Bayou Region business professionals and community leaders the opportunity for this interaction.Earlier, Cassidy met with the leadership of John Deere Thibodaux, Inc., where they manufacture agricultural equipment to support American farmers. They discussed how we can return manufacturing to America and support local businesses. “John Deere Thibodeaux makes products in Lafourche Parish that are shipped around the world. Great products and great jobs,” said Dr. Cassidy. “I will continue to support building things in the U.S.”Cassidy was joined by Mr. Mike Duplantis, factory manager for John Deere Thibodaux.“It was great hosting Senator Cassidy today to showcase our talented workforce, innovative products and manufacturing processes. We appreciated his engagement and support on topics that are important to John Deere and our customers.”###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-addresses-legisgator-luncheon,"LAKE CHARLES – Today, U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) addressed the 2022 LegisGator Luncheon, where he spoke about the importance of helping southwest Louisiana fully recover from Hurricane Laura. “Southwest Louisiana continues to recover from Hurricane Laura, despite enormous challenges,” said Dr. Cassidy. “We will work in Washington to secure the money this region needs to finish that recovery.”Since Hurricane Laura struck Louisiana, Cassidy has aggressively pursued the aid necessary for Southwest Louisiana to recover. In November 2020, Cassidy spoke with President Trump and secured a 100% federal cost share for debris removal. In September of 2021, the White House requested that Congress provide supplemental disaster relief in response to Hurricane Laura and other storms, following his request for such relief that July. That led to a clean continuing resolution that included billions of dollars to aid Louisiana in its recovery from natural disasters in 2020 and 2021. He has continued to urge Congress to provide the disaster relief necessary to finish recovery from Hurricane Laura. Additionally, Cassidy co-wrote the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which was signed into law last November. Included in the IIJA is $109 million to dredge and repair damages caused by Hurricane Laura and other disasters. Cassidy has also called for Risk Rating 2.0 to be rolled back, and recently visited Barbe High School to learn what they need to finish their recovery. While at LegisGator, Cassidy was welcomed by Mr. George Swift, President/CEO of the SWLA Economic Development Alliance.“We were very pleased to have Senator Cassidy address LegisGator,” said Mr. Swift. “We want to thank him for his efforts to secure hurricane recovery funding for our region. We also want to thank him for passing the infrastructure bill, which is providing funding for not only the I-10 bridge, but for ports, airports and broadband, among other priorities.”###"

The money will upgrade LSU-Eunice’s Allied Health laboratory equipment, in order to improve student learning outcomes. “LSUE is doing an essential job training our future doctors and nurses, and this grant will help them enormously,” said Dr. Cassidy. “It’s good for the school, good for the workforce, and good for the students.”The million dollars comes from Congressionally directed spending via the Health Resources and Services Administration. It will be spent on moveable equipment placed in clinical laboratories of nursing, diagnostic medical sonography, radiologic technology, respiratory therapy, surgical technology, anatomy and physiology. As an example, LSUE will acquire an anatomage table, which allows for virtual dissection and physiology simulation.  Cassidy was greeted by Dr. Nancee Sorenson, Chancellor of LSU-Eunice.“We are so grateful for Senator Cassidy’s tireless work and advocacy for education in Louisiana,” said Dr. Sorenson.“This grant will provide state-of-the-art technology to our students and help LSUE to continue to serve as a leader in the state of producing top health care professionals.”###"

Wade ever did. The bill would gut state laws to protect unborn children and the health and safety of their mothers by establishing a sweeping federal mandate to legalize late-term abortion.  “Democrats are endorsing an extreme viewpoint by putting this particular legislation up for a vote,” said Dr. Cassidy. “I voted against this legislation before and proudly voted against it again.” Democrats’ so-called the Women’s Health Protection Act was rejected by the Senate with a bipartisan majority, failing by a vote of 49 to 51. The Abortion on Demand Until Birth Act would ban many popular state laws placing reasonable limitations on abortion.

And it was said to have taken two to ten years for a vaccine to be produced for COVID, and within ten months we were vaccinating folks. What if we have an Operation Warp Speed when it comes to permitting new energy infrastructure? If it weren’t for permitting delays, we would be able to be either producing and/or shipping within twelve months. And instead, the recurring theme is it will take us two, three, five years. You know, to quote Pogo, we have met the enemy and he is us. The administration needs to stop being the enemy of domestic energy production both for our sake, and for the sake of our allies.”On carbon border adjustment…“…in 2005 the EU and the U.S. committed to lowering emissions. Since then, we have, despite higher GDP and higher population growth…The Chinese did not commit to doing so. And there’s a reason for it. The reason they didn’t is that it’s cheaper to manufacture if you don’t have environmental standards…They’re using coal as a cheap form of energy. And so it attracts foreign direct investment…let’s go to a carbon border adjustment. Well, listen, China, if you wish to import to the United States, and if we can work with our allies to the EU as well, Canada and U.K. If you wish to import to some of the largest consuming nations in the world then you are going to have to match our regulations, our standards for lowering carbon intensity. If you don’t, you’re going to pay a fee…I think the better way to approach our trade with China is to say: OK, if you’re kind of manipulating, arbitraging, whatever you want to say, ignoring the international commitments that you theoretically have made to lower carbon intensity, in order to attract foreign direct investment, and then import the same good back to our economy, we’re going to attach a fee to your carbon intensity. Now, that would begin to level the playing field, frankly re-shore or near-shore a lot of industry, and protect American jobs.” On energy security…“…there’s a nexus between national security, the economy of the family—the economy of a family and of a country, between energy and climate. If you ignore any one of those, you lose all four…natural gas, which has about 50 percent of the carbon footprint per unit of energy, has significantly replaced coal as an energy source, and gas has replaced oil as feedstock for chemical industry…we took care of our energy production by expanding the development of cheap natural gas. And we’ve remarkably lowered the price. And because of that, our economy has improved. Because of that, our national security has improved. We’re much less dependent upon the Middle East than we formerly were because we’ve increased our domestic supply. And as I’ve already pointed out, the climate has benefitted because we’ve decreased our emissions, despite larger economy and larger population. So that’s how, if you address all four simultaneously, you do well.” ###"

Cassidy expressed concerned over domestic energy producers being iced out of the financial system and losing access to capital because of the administration’s push to kill all fossil fuel production. “The mom sitting at home who can’t afford her gas, she can’t afford an electric vehicle, her pickup truck is 15 years old—she is frustrated. And she wants answers,” said Dr. Cassidy.  “I think the reason that we’re so frustrated is that if you look at the reality, the context of this administration’s attitude towards fossil, you’ve killed financing,” continued Dr. Cassidy.“Financial markets have picked up on it, so these people can’t get capital,” concluded Dr. Cassidy. In response to the Biden administration’s assault on domestic energy, Cassidy released a landmark energy & climate policy outline earlier this year detailing how the U.S. can successfully reset our energy and climate policy.

Cassidy is joined by Senators Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), John Cornyn (R-TX), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI).""Trade-based money laundering links everything from drug and human trafficking, terrorism, to counterfeits like knock-off toys that put children in danger,” said Dr. Cassidy. “This is a threat to our national security” “I’m pleased to join this bipartisan call to action on trade-based money laundering,” said Senator Whitehouse.  “Kleptocrats, drug traffickers, and others criminals trade everything from vegetables to washing machines to move their dirty money across the globe.  That’s why we need more coordination among key federal agencies involved in overseeing trade, and better information on suspicious financial and trade activity.”“Congress has a duty to work with our international partners and must leverage every available tool at our disposal to tackle trade-based money laundering (TBML) and other activities by transnational criminal organizations that pose a significant threat to the national security and economic interests of the United States and our allies,” said Senator Menendez. “I’m proud to be joining this bipartisan group of Senators committed to tackling TBML. I look forward to working with them to develop comprehensive solutions that will help bolster our economic interests, make it harder for counterfeiters to employ TBML to infiltrate our supply chains, and protect New Jersey businesses who have been affected by these practices.”“Money laundering facilitates a wide-range of crimes that threaten our economy and security, and allow bad actors to destabilize the world. We’ve made significant bipartisan moves in recent years to combat money laundering, but have much more work to do,"" said Senator Wyden. Cassidy recently introduced the Special Russian Sanctions Authority Act of 2022 to create a permanent inter-agency trade-based money laundering task force to coordinate efforts and streamline communication among U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies. In 2019, Cassidy released a white paper addressing trade-based money laundering as a top national security threat.Read the full resolution here or below.Whereas trade-based money laundering is among the most widely used and least understood forms of money laundering, disguising proceeds of crime by moving value through international trade transactions in an attempt to legitimize illicit origins of money or products; Whereas the transnational nature and complexity of trade-based money laundering make detection and investigation exceedingly difficult;Whereas drug trafficking organizations, terrorist organizations, and other transnational criminal organizations have succeeded at trade-based money laundering despite the best efforts of United States law enforcement; Whereas trade-based money laundering includes other offenses such as tax evasion, disruption of markets, profit loss for businesses, and corruption of government officials, and constitutes a persistent threat to the economy and security of the United States;Whereas trade-based money laundering can result in the decreased collection of customs duties as a result of the undervaluation of imports and fraudulent cargo manifests;Whereas trade-based money laundering can decrease tax revenue collected as a result of the sale of underpriced goods in the marketplace;Whereas trade-based money laundering is one mechanism by which counterfeiters infiltrate supply chains, threatening the quality and safety of consumer, industrial, and military products;Whereas drug trafficking organizations collaborate with Chinese criminal networks to launder profits from drug trafficking through Chinese messaging applications;Whereas on March 16, 2021, the Commander of the United States Southern Command, Admiral Faller, testified to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that transnational criminal organizations “market in drugs and people and guns and illegal mining, and one of the prime sources that underwrites their efforts is Chinese money-laundering”;Whereas the deaths and violence associated with drug traffickers, the financing of terrorist organizations and other violent non-state actors, and the adulteration of supply chains with counterfeit goods showcase the danger trade-based money laundering poses to the United States;Whereas trade-based money laundering undermines national security and the rule of law in countries where it takes place;Whereas illicit profits for transnational criminal organizations and other criminal organizations can lead to instability globally;Whereas the United States is facing a drug use and overdose epidemic, as well as an increase in consumption of synthetic drugs, such as methamphetamine and fentanyl, which is often enabled by Chinese money laundering organizations operating in coordination with drug-trafficking organizations and transnational criminal organizations in the Western Hemisphere that use trade-based money laundering to disguise the proceeds of drug trafficking; Whereas the presence of drug traffickers in the United States and their intrinsic connection to international threat networks, as well as the use of licit trade to further their motives, is a national security concern;Whereas drug-trafficking organizations frequently use the trade-based money laundering scheme known as the “Black Market Peso Exchange” to move their ill-gotten gains out of the United States and into Central and South America;Whereas United States ports and U.S. Customs and Border Protection do not have the capacity to properly examine the 60,000,000 shipping containers that pass through United States ports annually, with only 2 to 5 percent of that cargo actively inspected;Whereas trade-based money laundering can only be combated effectively if the intelligence community, law enforcement agencies, the Department of State, the Department of Defense, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the private sector work together;Whereas drug-trafficking organizations, terrorist organizations, and other transnational criminal organizations disguise the proceeds of their illegal activities behind sophisticated mechanisms that operate seamlessly between licit and illicit trade and financial transactions, making it almost impossible to address without international cooperation; andWhereas the United States has established Trade Transparency Units with 18 partner countries, including with major drug-producing and transit countries, to facilitate the increased exchange of import-export data to combat trade-based money laundering: Now, therefore, be itResolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that—(1) the activities of transnational criminal organizations and their networks, and the means by which such organizations and networks move and launder their ill-gotten gains, such as through the use of illicit economies, illicit trade, and trade-based money laundering, pose a threat to the national interests and national security of the United States and allies and partners of the United States around the world;(2) in addition to considering the countering of illicit economies, illicit trade, and trade-based money laundering as a national priority and committing to detect, address, and prevent such activities, the President should—(A) continue to assess, in the periodic national risk assessments on money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing conducted by the Department of the Treasury, the ongoing risks of trade-based money laundering;(B) finalize the assessment described in the Explanatory Statement accompanying the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2020 (division C of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (Public Law 116–93)), which directs the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Department of the Treasury to thoroughly assess the risk that trade-based money laundering and other forms of illicit finance pose to national security;(C) work expeditiously to develop, finalize, and execute a strategy, as described in section 6506 of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (title LXV of division F of Public Law 116–283; 134 Stat. 4631), drawing on the multiple instruments of United States national power available, to counter—(i) the activities of transnational criminal organizations, including illicit trade and trade-based money laundering; and(ii) the illicit economies such organizations operate in;(D) coordinate with international partners to implement that strategy, exhorting those partners to strengthen their approaches to combating transnational criminal organizations; and(E) review that strategy on a biennial basis and improve it as needed in order to most effectively address illicit economies, illicit trade, and trade-based money laundering by exploring the use of emerging technologies and other new avenues for interrupting and putting an end to those activities; and(3) the Trade Transparency Unit program of the Department of Homeland Security should take steps to strengthen its work, including in countries that the Department of State has identified as major money laundering jurisdictions under section 489 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291h).###"

They attempted to thwart the democratic process by suppressing free speech and our First Amendment right to peacefully assemble,” said Dr. Cassidy. “Free speech applies to everyone, not just those who extremists deem worthy.”Reports said that police took over 20 minutes to respond to the incident due to personnel and resource shortages. BackgroundCassidy has opposed Democrats’ “Defund the Police” efforts and introduced the BLUE Act, which funds the police and derail Democrats’ anti-law enforcement agenda. Last month, he also introduced the Law Enforcement De-escalation Training Act, which would give law enforcement the resources to respond more effectively to people with mental or behavioral health issues. ###"

The resolution encourages school districts across the country to help register high school seniors, of voting age, to vote.“Graduation from high school is the advent of adulthood, and with this comes the responsibility to contribute to our community,” said Dr. Cassidy. “This resolution encourages young Americans to engage and to fulfill their civic duty.”“There is nothing more fundamental in a democracy than the right to vote – with a vote, you have the ability to make your voice heard and to shape the future of our country,” said Senator King. “I hope every eligible high school senior will get out and register to vote this week. They are the future leaders of our country, and this is an important step to get them engaged and active as soon as they are of voting age. It’s a healthy habit for them to get into – both for themselves and our system of representative government.”  The resolution is modeled after the National High School Senior's Voter Registration Day program, which was founded by Louisiana native and veteran Robert Jackson.###"

GOMESA requires Louisiana, along with Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas, to use the dollars for coastal restoration and hurricane protection projects as well as for projects important for conservation of fish, wildlife, or other natural resources.“Our state and coastal communities understand the importance of protecting and restoring our coastline,” said Dr. Cassidy. “This funding is important to balance protecting our coastal environment and south Louisiana families with preserving U.S. energy security.”Last year, Cassidy introduced the Reinvesting in Shoreline Economies & Ecosystems (RISEE) Act which would expand GOMESA to create a new dedicated stream of funding from future offshore wind development.

https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-applauds-house-of-representatives-introduction-of-21st-century-dyslexia-act,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), author of the 21st Century Dyslexia Act, applauded Representatives Bruce Westerman (R-AR-04), Larry Bucschon (R-IN-08), Steven Palazzo (R-MS-04), Julia Brownley (D-CA-26), and Jim McGovern (D-MA-02) for introducing the bill in the U.S. House of Representatives. Cassidy’s legislation aims to bring our modern, scientific understanding of dyslexia to federal statute and prevent the harm inflicted on young students when their dyslexia goes unidentified. ""Every child must have the opportunity to reach their full potential,” said Dr. Cassidy. ""Our legislation makes sure that dyslexics are identified before they fall behind in the classroom. We are one step closer to improving the lives of children. I urge Senate and House colleagues to pass this bill.""The 21st Century Dyslexia Act is cosponsored by Senators Tim Scott (R-SC), Mike Braun (R-IN), John Kennedy (R-LA), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and John Hickenlooper (D-CO).Currently, dyslexia is included as one of many disabilities under “Specific Learning Disabilities” (SLD) in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). SLD is the most common disability category for children covered under IDEA, representing more than 33 percent of these students. However, despite dyslexia being the most prevalent disability within SLD, students are rarely diagnosed with dyslexia. This prevents them from getting the services and accommodations necessary to assist dyslexic students learning to read. When children are not identified with dyslexia, evidence shows that lifelong harm is done, resulting in lower career wages, reduced graduation rates, and even increased rates of incarceration. This legislation helps students and solves the problem by pulling dyslexia out of the overly broad definition of SLD and including it in the list of disabilities included in the definition of a “child with a disability,” thus classifying dyslexia as its own category within IDEA. In doing so, the 21st Century Dyslexia Act provides a clear definition of dyslexia, which is the same definition that was adopted in the First Step Act of 2018.###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-thune-burr-braun-marshall-introduce-the-stop-reckless-student-loan-actions-act,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), John Thune (R-SD), Richard Burr (R-NC), Mike Braun (R-IN), and Roger Marshall (R-KS) today introduced the Stop Reckless Student Loan Actions Act, legislation that would end President Biden’s untargeted, budget-busting suspension of repayments on qualifying federal student loans, following 24 months of non-payment and six executive actions extending the payment pause. The bill would still allow the president to temporarily suspend repayment for low- and middle-income borrowers in future national emergencies and would prohibit the president from cancelling outstanding federal student loan obligations due to a national emergency. “If the administration wants to follow the science regarding COVID, we must also follow the facts,” said Dr. Cassidy.“Unemployment is not at pandemic levels and a student loan repayment pause benefits those who are high income and able to pay their bills. The administration is spending without congressional approval. That should be considered unconstitutional.”“As Americans continue to return to the workforce more than two years since the pandemic began, it is time for borrowers to resume repayment of student debt obligations,” said Senator Thune. “Taxpayers and working families should not be responsible for continuing to bear the costs associated with this suspension of repayment. This common-sense legislation would protect taxpayers and prevent President Biden from suspending federal student loan repayments in perpetuity. Any future suspension of federal student loan repayments should be left to Congress, not the Biden administration.”“The Biden Administration continues to call for a return to normalcy from the pandemic, while simultaneously extending emergency relief programs like the student loan repayment freeze,” said Senator Burr. “They can’t have it both ways. Resuming student loan repayments is long overdue, especially in today’s strong job market. That’s why I’m proud to work with my colleagues on this important bill, which will end the repayment moratorium that has exacerbated the existing moral hazard against borrowers and cost taxpayers an estimated $5 billion per month. “The majority of Americans do not have college degrees,” said Senator Braun. “Why should they be forced to pick up the tab for college degrees in the name of pandemic relief? This transfer of wealth is not a move to ‘advance equity,’ but rather a taxpayer handout to appease far-left activists.”“Early in the pandemic when millions were out of work it was understandable to provide temporary relief for borrowers,” said Senator Marshall. “Two years removed, this White House and Democrats in Congress continue to pursue the fiscally unsustainable policy of suspending payment, and ultimately canceling, student loan debt, nearly two trillion dollars owed to the federal government. Following the costly response to the pandemic, we must focus on implementing a fiscal strategy that will address the unsustainable path we’re on, not compound it.”“The moratorium on federal student loan repayments has cost American taxpayers over $100 billion and will cost $5 billion every month it remains in place,” said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.“Continuing this reckless policy will make surging inflation worse, at a time that we have seen it hit a 40-year high. Less than 17 percent of U.S. adults have federal student loans, and that group is disproportionately wealthy, white, and highly educated. It is unsustainable and unfair for working families to fund this indefinite giveaway to progressive elites. Senators Thune, Burr, Braun, Cassidy, and Marshall should be commended for introducing legislation to end this moratorium and protect taxpayers in the future by narrowing the president's authority to defer loan repayments.”“The student debt repayment pause will add $120 billion to the deficit through August, offer a massive handout to doctors and lawyers, and feed more inflation. It’s time to end ongoing COVID relief, or at least fully offset any further extensions,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. “We applaud Senators Thune, Burr, Braun, Cassidy, and Marshall for introducing the Stop Reckless Student Loan Actions Act, which would put an end to the pause and limit a president’s ability to unilaterally cancel student debt.”The current suspension of federal student loan repayments disproportionally benefits higher-earning borrowers and has cost American taxpayers billions of dollars.On April 6, 2022, President Biden announced his fourth extension of the suspension of qualifying federal student loan repayments through August 31, 2022. He also announced that when repayments do resume, all borrowers whose federal student loans are delinquent or in default would be made current. Prior to this extension, the repayment of these federal student loans was scheduled to resume in May 2022. Notably, nothing in this bill would prohibit the U.S. Department of Education from continuing to work with individuals who may be struggling to make timely payments, like helping struggling borrowers enter into income-driven repayment plans.###"

Specifically, the senators asked the Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough about how effective the VA’s Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI) has been at combatting the opioid epidemic among veterans. They also asked the secretary to identify which barriers Congress must remove to enable better public-private partnerships to expand veterans’ access to testing and treatment for opioid use disorder.“Members of the Committee and the VA are equally invested in facilitating timely and high-quality mental health and substance use related care to those that have given so much to ensuring the security of our country,” wrote the senators. “Our collective objective should be to guarantee their safety, by reducing inappropriate opioid prescribing, providing access to a full range of pain therapeutic options when appropriate, and driving down illicit substance use and associated tragedies of overdose deaths and suicides among veterans.”“We trust that you will expeditiously address the questions we have raised here in service of further enhancing the VA’s progress toward this critical mission,” continued the senators.Read the full letter here or below.Dear Secretary McDonough,We appreciated your recent end-of-year report to the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs on the state of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), especially information pertaining to the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).

https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-announces-louisiana-to-receive-an-additional-82-million-for-bridges-from-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill,"ALEXANDRIA – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) today announced that Louisiana will receive an additional $82,095,555 in bridge funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which includes $16,419,111 this fiscal year. This is in addition to the previously announced $202.6 million in bridge funding for this year, bringing the total amount of 2022 bridge funding to more than $219 million from Cassidy’s infrastructure law. Louisiana will receive approximately $1 billion over five years to repair bridges and infrastructure.  “More great news for Louisiana and the future of our infrastructure thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure bill,” said Dr. Cassidy. “This funding makes a huge impact on bridge projects across the state.” ###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-announces-major-economic-development-project-with-cleco,"ALEXANDRIA – Today, U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) joined the leadership of Cleco to announce that they will receive $9 million from the federal government to perform a Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) study for a carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) facility at Cleco’s Brame Energy Center in Lena. Cassidy inserted those funds in the 2022 Omnibus Appropriations bill.The study brings Cleco one step further to completing this project, known as Project Diamond Vault. When finished, it will remove 95% of the CO2 produced by the combustion of fuel in their Madison 3 electric generation unit, compress it, and permanently store it beneath the Brame site. Cleco also expects that they will be able to store CO2 for third parties on a fee basis.  Cleco further estimates that Project Diamond Vault will create an average of 1,100 construction jobs over a 3-year period with 30-40 new permanent jobs. LSU economist Dr. Loren Scott estimates that during the construction period, it will create an average of approximately 2,900 jobs each year, inject approximately $2.7 billion in increased sales and household earnings into the Louisiana economy, and produce approximately $50 million in increased state tax revenues. “This project helps make Louisiana a leader in new energy technologies, and it will create jobs and attract new businesses in central Louisiana,” said Dr. Cassidy.Among others, Cassidy was joined by Mr. Bill Fontenot, President and CEO of Cleco.“It’s an exciting day to be in the power business,” said Mr. Fontenot. “Today we begin Cleco’s journey to support a cleaner Louisiana, another step towards our commitment to a decarbonized Louisiana and our goal of net zero by 2050. We couldn’t have started this journey towards being the leading clean energy company in Louisiana without the support of our state and federal officials.”Additionally, Cassidy included in last year’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) $5.1 billion for CCS technologies, $3.5 billion for direct air capture hubs for carbon removal, and $8 billion for hydrogen hubs. The money is meant to help the oil and gas industry adjust to changing global environmental standards, including for companies in Louisiana.###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-announces-broadband-grant-at-ville-platte-high-school,"LAFAYETTE – Today, U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) informed students at Ville Platte High School that they would benefit from a $29.9 million grant from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) that would connect most Evangeline Parish residents to broadband internet, including Ville Platte High School.  Afterwards, Senator Cassidy joined area officials at the Evangeline Parish Courthouse to celebrate the grant. Last August, Cassidy wrote a letter to the NTIA expressing his support for the grant application, filed by the Acadiana Planning Commission. This grant will expand broadband service to 22,590 households, 3,723 businesses, 19 schools and 4 hospitals in Evangeline, Acadia and St. Landry Parishes. It will provide speeds up to 1 gigabyte per second, with an option of 100 megabytes for $60 month or less.Last year, Cassidy also passed into law the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which will make more money available for communities wishing to expand broadband service. The IIJA provides $65 billion for broadband infrastructure. “Met with students excited about having access to high-speed broadband. These are bright students who need the right tools to achieve their dreams,” said Dr. Cassidy. “This broadband grant will help them enormously, so they can help Ville Platte and Louisiana.”  At both stops, Cassidy was joined by Mayor Jennifer Vidrine of Ville Platte. According to the Mayor, Senator Cassidy is the first sitting U.S. Senator to visit Ville Platte High School.“Bill Cassidy has been an advocate for our community and we greatly appreciate his efforts. Because of his efforts, Ville Platte will go from having some of the worst Internet service in the nation to the BEST,” said Mayor Vidrine.“That will make life easier for our families, schools and businesses. We’re thankful for his work and proud to welcome him as the first U.S. Senator to visit Ville Platte High School! Go Bulldogs!” Additionally, Cassidy was joined at the Evangeline Parish Courthouse by the leadership of the Acadiana Planning Commission, led by Chief Executive Officer Monique Boulet. Their leadership was instrumental in securing the grant. “Our towns are dealing with population declines and job losses that cannot be addressed without first building modern broadband infrastructure. We are thrilled to have Sen. Cassidy in Ville Platte,” said Ms. Boulet. “His ongoing support of our efforts and of broadband investment is a critical link to the survival of rural Acadiana.” ###"

I’m proud to introduce the Brycen Gray and Ben Price COVID-19 Cognitive Research Act with Senators Cassidy and Brown to help expand research into this issue, honor those we’ve lost and work to prevent future tragedies.” “As a result of the pandemic, people have experienced isolation, fear, disruption to routines, and in too many cases, the death of a caregiver or a loved one – as was the case for the family of Brycen Gray, who tragically lost his life to suicide a year ago. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have had on mental health have been stark – but we still have a lot of work to do before we can understand the full scope of long-term, neurological disorders that stem from the virus,” said Senator Brown. “This legislation is an important first step toward understanding, treating, and ultimately preventing those long-term side effects that harm our physical health and our mental health.”U.S. Representative Anthony Gonzalez (R-OH-16) introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives.###"

A well-earned retirement.Robert is a masterful storyteller and critical thinker, always finding the other side of a story. He has been a voice of reason, always looking for the truth.He took his first job in radio while attending LSU Shreveport. As he says “it was indoors and you didn’t have to carry stuff.”He went on to host radio in Philadelphia, Cleveland and Orlando before eventually moving back to Shreveport in 1996. That is when he first teamed up with his longtime cohost Erin McCarty to start their morning show that has been a part of Northwest Louisiana’s morning commute for over 25 years. In 2014, they moved their show to 710 KEEL and have been the ""Townsquare"" of Shreveport ever since.To say he will be missed is an understatement.

https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-defends-school-choice-calls-on-biden-administration-to-rescind-anti-charter-school-policies-on-senate-floor,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) today delivered a speech on the Senate floor calling on the Biden administration to roll back its new proposal that imposes harmful regulations on the Charter School Program (CSP) and makes it harder for charter schools to receive federal grants. On March 14th, the Department of Education (DOE) proposed rules that require new charter schools to show an “unmet demand for the charter school” and an “over-enrollment at existing public schools” in order to be established.“Our country’s charter schools are under threat from the far-Left and Teachers Unions who seek to shut them down because charter school staffs are very difficult to unionize,” said Dr. Cassidy. “At a time when students are falling behind in record numbers, we need new and innovative approaches to our education system, not to just hand the keys over to the Teachers Unions.”“Parents and students should have the ability to choose a learning environment that is best for their child… Not a school board. And certainly not bureaucrats at the Department of Education,” continued Dr. Cassidy.On April 6th, Cassidy led 12 colleagues in urging the Department of Education to reconsider proposed rules redefining the Charter School Program, stripping parents of their ability to choose the best school for their child.Click here to watch Cassidy’s full speech.Cassidy’s speech as prepared for delivery can be found below:Mr. President,Some students learn differently than others.As a parent of a child with Dyslexia, it’s clear a “one-size-fits-all” education system doesn’t work for many students.Parents and students should have the ability to choose a learning environment that is best for their child.Not a school board. And certainly not bureaucrats at the Department of Education.The Charter School Program was created by Congress for that exact purpose—ensuring parents can choose what is best for their children.Giving parents the power is crucial to allowing every student to succeed.Unfortunately, there are groups working to undermine that choice.The Education Department has decided to disregard what is in the best interest of the student with a new proposed rule that would add new requirements for applicants that are entirely unrelated to student outcomes.Applicants would have to demonstrate “unmet demand for the charter school” and provide evidence of “over-enrollment at existing public schools,” to establish a charter school.It seems as if the Department of Education is putting up arbitrary barriers to opening a charter school simply because they have a prejudice against them.Our country’s charter schools are under threat from the far-Left and Teachers Unions who seek to shut them down because charter school staffs are very difficult to unionize.Teachers Unions know it is much harder to spread their influence in charter schools. In some cases, it’s impossible for charter school teachers to unionize.The giant Teachers Unions see this as simple problem. They know the more charter schools there are, the less possible revenue they can take in.So, their solution is equally as simple: take away power from parents with layers of new bureaucracy and government overreach.We can’t let that happen.Since the pandemic began, public charter schools have seen a substantial increase in demand. They opened up sooner and stayed open in larger numbers than public schools.We know open schools were better for our childrenParents want to send their children to a school where they feel like they have a voice—where they know their children can succeed.Let’s be clear who this rule is written for. It's not written to help the student. It was written to help Teachers Unions exercise more control over students’ lives.This rule makes no mention of how any of these new restrictions will improve student achievement or help students who need it most.At a time when students are falling behind in record numbers, we need new and innovative approaches to our education system, not to just hand the keys over to the Teachers Unions.The truth is, these rules will give less choice to families, will hold students back, and will do more harm than good.The Charter School Program has enjoyed bipartisan support for nearly 30 years.Any substantial changes to the program should go through Congress and receive thoughtful consideration.School choice in America should not be gutted by an informal committee of Teachers Union employees and Education Department officials.###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-burr-urge-biden-administration-to-counter-illegal-fentanyl-support-halt-fentanyl-act,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) and Richard Burr (R-NC) urged the Biden administration to support their Halt All Lethal Trafficking (HALT) of Fentanyl Act, which makes permanent the classification of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs as Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Its current Schedule I classification is temporary and set to expire later this year. The HALT Fentanyl Act was introduced by Cassidy and Burr in December of 2021.“Fentanyl is now the number one cause of death for Americans 18 to 45 years of age. Fentanyl poisoning killed more people in the 18 to 45 year age group last year than COVID-19, suicide, car accidents, or gun violence,” wrote the senators. “ Instead of taking swift action to save our nation’s youth, the Biden administration has put forward proposals that do not solve the problem, choosing instead to promote their political wish list.”“The time to enact a strong federal response to fentanyl is now, before another record is broken. We urge the Administration to support the HALT Fentanyl Act,” continued the senators.Cassidy delivered a floor speech on the HALT Fentanyl Act and combatting the opioid crisis in America. Read the full letter here or below.Dear Director Gupta,We write to express our concern that the Biden administration has not supported bipartisan, common sense legislative solutions to permanently schedule fentanyl-related substances as a Schedule I under the Controlled Substances Act, the strongest controls on substances with no accepted medical use and a high abuse potential. Instead, the Democrats in Washington have decided to play political games with a crisis fueled by products created in China and shipped across our southern border with Mexico, costing hundreds of thousands of and American lives. On November 17, 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced a new record of over 100,000 estimated overdose deaths in the United States in a one year span, an increase of nearly 30% from the year before. The Journal of the American Medical Association published a study reporting the staggering figure that over five years, over 1.2 million years of life were lost in adolescents ages 10-19 as a result of drug overdose. Fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances, a class of highly lethal synthetic opioids with high abuse potential, have driven these overdoses to record numbers. Fentanyl is now the number one cause of death for Americans 18 to 45 years of age. Fentanyl poisoning killed more people in the 18 to 45 year age group last year than COVID-19, suicide, car accidents, or gun violence. Instead of taking swift action to save our nation’s youth, the Biden administration has put forward proposals that do not solve the problem, choosing instead to promote their political wish list.In September 2021, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) sent a legislative proposal to Congress to combat illicitly manufactured fentanyl. This proposal was touted as “a long term and consensus approach.” However, this approach was filled with partisan criminal justice goals, doing away with certain mandatory minimum sentences and ignoring the national security and public health issues underpinning this crisis. The Biden administration is driving partisan and precedent-setting policies with proposals that should instead be targeted at saving the lives of the next generation of Americans.Not only is the delay of permanently scheduling fentanyl-related substances contributing to the overdose crisis, but it is also bolstering China and the Mexican cartels. Tens of thousands of pounds of fentanyl are being trafficked into the U.S every year. Since 2013, China has been the principal source of fentanyl, fentanyl-related substances, and the precursor chemicals from which they are produced. Chinese product is commonly shipped to Mexico and smuggled by cartels into the U.S illicit drug market. Traffickers have favored fentanyl-related substances to skirt around committing the crime of trafficking conventional fentanyl, a Schedule I controlled substance. The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) reports that the emergency temporary scheduling of fentanyl-related substances since 2018 has acted as an effective deterrent to traffickers. Permanently scheduling fentanyl-related substances would dramatically reduce the amount of these deadly chemicals from crossing our borders and flooding our streets. Without swift and strong federal action, our foreign adversaries will continue to grow and profit off of fentanyl and the loss of American life. Congress continues to work in a bipartisan fashion to temporarily extend the Department of Justice’s temporary scheduling of fentanyl-related substances, but a short term patch will never solve the long term crisis. It is critical for the federal government to have a straight forward, nonpolitical, policy and strategy to work with Congress to permanently schedule fentanyl and expand access to the research community to combat future overdose deaths. On December 8, 2021, we introduced S.3336, the Halt All Lethal Trafficking (HALT) Fentanyl Act. The bill is a clean legislative solution that would permanently schedule fentanyl- related substance as Schedule I. The HALT Fentanyl Act would also address Democrat concerns about strong controls on Schedule I substances by promoting research on these substances. The bill would streamline the registration of researchers to conduct research on Schedule I substances who already hold Schedule I or II registration. The bill also pares down burdensome regulation that requires authorized research institutions to submit additional registration applications for other research staff who conduct research under the supervision of an existing registrant. The HALT Fentanyl Act is a true long term and consensus approach combatting fentanyl.It is critical that the Biden Administration advance policies that are driven to save lives and keep our nation safe, not achieve political aims. Fentanyl has inundated our communities and will continue to kill our neighbors and loved ones. The time to enact a strong federal response to fentanyl is now, before another record is broken. We urge the Administration to support the HALT Fentanyl Act.  ###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-burr-colleagues-urge-for-extension-of-public-comment-to-save-school-choice,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), Richard Burr (R-NC), Mike Braun (R-IN), Tim Scott (R-SC), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Marco Rubio (R-FL) today urged the Department of Education to extend its 30-day public comment period following its recent decision to discourage Charter School Programs (CSP) from participating in federal grants. “The proposed requirements for the CSP are a blatant reversal of three decades’ worth of bipartisan support for charter schools. In addition to being overly prescriptive and overburdensome, the Department proposes foisting such prescriptions and burdens solely upon charter schools which can only be viewed as an attempt by this Administration to disadvantage charter schools over their traditional public-school peers,” wrote the senators. “Destroying future charter schools harms school choice for parents and students during a time when school choice is more important than ever.” “For these reasons, we, at a minimum, request an extension of the public comment period by 30 days in order for teachers, parents, students, and Congress to have proper time to review these troublesome policy changes and provide comment,” continued the senators. Read the full letter below.Dear Secretary Cardona:On March 14, 2022, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) issued a Notice of Proposed Priorities, Requirements, Definitions, and Selection Criteria for the Charter School Programs (CSP) and opened a 30-day public comment period. We ask that you, at a minimum, extend the public comment period. The proposed requirements for the CSP are a blatant reversal of three decades’ worth of bipartisan support for charter schools. In addition to being overly prescriptive and overburdensome, the Department proposes foisting such prescriptions and burdens solely upon charter schools which can only be viewed as an attempt by this Administration to disadvantage charter schools over their traditional public school peers. Destroying future charter schools harms school choice for parents and students during a time when school choice is more important than ever.In addition to the direct attack on charter schools and school choice, these proposed policies were released immediately after Congress approved Fiscal Year 2022 appropriations. Congress, after determining these proposals were bad policy, intentionally excluded them from the FY 2022 appropriations package. Such blatant disregard is yet another example of this Administration ignoring the will of Congress and acting by executive fiat.Following publication of the Notice, Ranking Member Burr’s staff requested to meet with Department staff, a request the Department has denied on the basis of a specious rule making argument. However, Ranking Member Burr’s staff has also been made aware that the Department is conducting meetings with outside groups on the proposed policies. This refusal to meet with Congressional staff is a new interpretation of procedure by the Biden Administration that seems deliberately designed to avoid Congressional oversight.For these reasons, we, at a minimum, request an extension of the public comment period by 30 days in order for teachers, parents, students, and Congress to have proper time to review these troublesome policy changes and provide comment. However, we ultimately request that the Department does not finalize this proposal, rushing through the most burdensome and robust changes that have been made to the CSP. Please respond by April 8, 2022, to inform us of whether the and valuable engagement from the community. ###"

Rather than overseeing and enforcing existing safeguards intended to ensure that high-quality schools are able to open or expand, the Department of Education is engaging in an aggressive attempt to dictate Federal, one-size-fits-all rules for charter schools. This unprecedented attempt at micromanaging a 28-year-old bipartisan program only serves to discourage charter schools from applying for these grants, effectively harming access to high quality schools for millions of students around the country. This proposed rule would add new requirements for applicants that are entirely unrelated to student outcomes. Applicants would have to demonstrate “unmet demand for the charter school”. This means that having tens of thousands of children on charter waiting lists will not be enough. The Department wants evidence of “over-enrollment at existing public schools,” meaning that charter applicants in areas with shrinking enrollments, which includes most big cities, would most likely be rejected. Demand for charter schools is not just about the availability for any seat, but the demand for a high-quality seat, like those that exist at many of the nation’s premier charter schools. This requirement overrides the will of parents to affirmatively choose charter schools for their children and subjugates parents and students to the bureaucratic priorities set by the Department of Education. Since the pandemic, public charters have seen a substantial increase in demand. A logical approach would be to expand this program and build on what is already working for students and families. Instead, the Department of Education is taking direction from special interest groups, who seem more concerned with union membership rather than what is best for America’s students.This rulemaking makes no mention of how any of these new, burdensome hurdles will improve student achievement or help serve America’s neediest students. In fact, “academic achievement” is only mentioned twice in the text of the rule and not in a manner that shows how any requirement will improve such achievement; rather, an application must only describe the current achievement of students in areas from which it hopes to draw enrollment. At a time when students are falling behind in record numbers, we need new and innovative approaches to our education system. This is the precise reason the CSP exists: to offer innovative teaching models and to increase autonomy for teachers and schools. These proposed rules would take away choice from families and give more power to unelected bureaucrats in Washington.After teachers’ unions spent the pandemic keeping public schools closed while many charter schools stayed open, it is particularly appalling that the Department is working aggressively to limit charter school options for families in need. After teachers’ unions spent the pandemic keeping public schools closed while many charter schools stayed open, it is particularly appalling that the Department is working aggressively to limit charter school options for families in need. Public charter schools currently serve more than 3.4 million students across 42 states. The CSP, which has enjoyed bipartisan support since its inception in 1994, works to support these schools by providing federal funding to create promising new public charter schools, replicate successful public charter schools, and disseminate information about effective practices within charter schools. In fiscal year 2022, the CSP was funded at $440 million. Grants have benefited about half of existing charter schools and hundreds of thousands of predominately low-income students of color across the country.Changes of this magnitude should be thoughtfully considered through the regular legislative process with proper input from relevant community stakeholders and Congress. Instead, the Department seems to be ignoring the will of Congress, through unilateral action. Therefore, we urge you to withdraw the proposed rule and engage with Congress on better ways to serve America’s students.  Thank you for your attention to this important matter.###"

The funding is a reimbursement for costs related to emergency shelters in the wake of Hurricane Ida last summer.“Louisiana’s resilience has shown in the recovery after Ida,” said Dr. Cassidy. “This funding is a large step towards positioning the state to fully recover.”The grant covers a total of 5,097 travel trailers used to shelter 12,084 displaced residents.###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-a-bridge-is-coming-to-a-river-near-you,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) released a statement following the announcement that the Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) plans to provide $26.5 billion to states to repair bridges and infrastructure through the Bridge Formula Program. This funding was made possible by Cassidy’s bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that passed last year. Louisiana will receive approximately $1 billion over five years, including $202.6 million this fiscal year.“Our bridges have been in desperate need of repair for decades. Today we take a giant step to secure the future of Louisiana infrastructure. When we listen to the needs of our state, we can deliver results that benefit all. Thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure bill, a bridge is coming to a river near you,” said Dr. Cassidy. According to the Governor’s office, some of the bridge projects that will advance this year due to this funding include:###"

The Ryan White Program provides a comprehensive system of HIV primary medical care, essential support services, and medications to improve health outcomes and reduce HIV transmission among hard-to-reach populations.“As a doctor treating uninsured HIV patients, you see the effects that HIV has on a community,” said Dr. Cassidy. “This funding is crucial to reducing HIV infection in our state.”###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-parents-who-care-about-their-childrens-education-are-not-domestic-terrorists,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), and 24 Republican colleagues today demanded answers from the U.S. Department of Education on reports that it played a role in creating a letter from the National School Board Association (NSBA) calling concerned parents “domestic terrorists.”“Parents are not ‘domestic terrorists’ and it is appalling that anyone would suggest that exercising the constitutionally protected freedoms of speech and assembly would be characterized as a threat,” wrote the senators. “Parents across the country are outraged that their children’s education has been disrupted, delayed, even denied over the past two years.”“News reports indicate that the letter from the NSBA to President Biden was actually initiated at your request,” continued the senators. “Accountability begins at the top, and as U.S. Secretary of Education you must explain your role, or your staff’s role, in the creation of this letter.”Cassidy and Scott were joined by Senators Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Richard Burr (R-NC), John Thune (R-SD), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Mike Braun (R-IN), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Rand Paul (R-KY), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Jerry Moran (R-KS), James Lankford (R-OK), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Ron Johnson (R-WI), John Boozman (R-AR), John Barrasso (R-WY), Susan Collins (R-ME), Rick Scott (R-FL), John Cornyn (R-TX), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Mike Lee (R-UT), and John Hoeven (R-ND).BackgroundOn September 29, 2021, NSBA sent a letter to President Biden accusing parents expressing concern and frustration with lockdowns, shutdowns, school closures, mandates and more of “domestic terrorism.” On October 4, 2021, Attorney General Merrick Garland issued a memo directing the FBI and U.S. Attorneys to act in response to the NSBA letter. Later that month, NSBA apologized for the language used in the letter after backlash from state school board associations. New reporting earlier this week revealed emails indicating Education Department Secretary Miguel Cardona solicited the letter from NSBA.Read the full letter here or below.Dear Secretary Cardona:Parents are not “domestic terrorists” and it is appalling that anyone would suggest that exercising the constitutionally protected freedoms of speech and assembly would be characterized as a threat. Parents across the country are outraged that their children’s education has been disrupted, delayed, even denied over the past two years.Study after study shows how much educational harm has been done to schoolchildren with shutdowns and closures. It is estimated most students lost between 30 and 50 percent of their learning gains because of school closures. Moreover, minority and low-income students and students with disabilities were among the hardest hit as a result of these disruptions, with many losing as much as a full year of educational progress. Students’ mental health suffered as well. According to the CDC, teen suicide attempts among girls increased by 51 percent, likely due in part to students’ inability to access in-person learning.Yet on September 29, 2021, the National School Boards Association (NSBA) sent a letter to President Biden accusing parents expressing concern and frustration with lockdowns, shutdowns, school closures, mandates and more with “domestic terrorism.” The letter even suggested using the PATRIOT Act against parents who are concerned about months and years of lost educational opportunities due to school closures, shutdowns, and unnecessary restrictions.On October 4, 2021, Attorney General Garland issued a memo at NSBA’s behest, directing the FBI and U.S. Attorneys to act on the contents of the NSBA letter. That evoked the prospects of the FBI using the powers of the PATRIOT Act against peacefully protesting parents frantic to get their children back in school so they don’t fall behind and lose a year of education.On October 22, 2021, the NSBA apologized for the letter, as they should. Many state school board associations have called into question their affiliation with the NSBA, and the NSBA has a lot of work to do to regain the trust of America’s moms and dads without significant reforms.Unfortunately, the Attorney General has not rescinded his memo, as he should.While we knew early on that White House staff were complicit in the creation of this letter, it is only recently that information has surfaced implicating you and your office in this shameful episode. News reports indicate that the letter from the NSBA to President Biden was actually initiated at your request.Accountability begins at the top, and as U.S. Secretary of Education you must explain your role, or your staff’s role, in the creation of this letter.Please respond to the following questions by 4:00 p.m., Friday, January 14, 2022:Thank you for your attention to this matter.###"

The mandate through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) would have required employers with over 100 employees to mandate the COVID-19 vaccine or weekly testing. “Today’s ruling rejects federal government overreach. It is a win for personal liberties and the 80 million Americans affected by this decision,” said Dr. Cassidy. “People should get vaccinated, but President Biden should not be able to force [private businesses] to do it. The Supreme Court agrees.”BackgroundCassidy joined 46 of his Senate colleagues and 132 members of the U.S. House of Representatives in filing an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court in opposition of the Biden administration vaccine mandate on private businesses.   ###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-lujan-trahan-introduce-bill-to-inform-consumers-increase-online-transparency,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) and Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) and U.S. Representative Lori Trahan (D-MA-03) today introduced the Terms-of-service Labeling, Design and Readability (TLDR) Act to require commercial websites and mobile apps to create a simple and readable summary of their terms-of-service agreements. The TLDR Act would increase online transparency and ensure consumers are informed about how their personal data is collected and used. Small businesses are exempt from the law.“Users should not have to comb through pages of legal jargon in a website’s terms of services to know how their data will be used,” said Dr. Cassidy. “Requiring companies to provide an easy-to-understand summary of their terms should be mandatory and is long overdue.”“Consumers deserve the ability to make informed decisions online for themselves and their families,” said Senator Luján. “Rather than inform, too many companies use long and complicated Terms of Service agreements to bury critical details about their data policies and shield themselves from legal liability. The TLDR Act will empower consumers to take their business elsewhere when that happens. Informing consumers is a bipartisan issue, and I look forward to continue working with my colleagues to provide real choice online.”“For far too long, blanket terms of service agreements have forced consumers to either ‘agree’ to all of a company’s conditions or lose access to a website or app entirely. No negotiation, no alternative, and no real choice,” said Representative Trahan. “To further slant the decision in their favor, many companies design unnecessarily long and complicated contracts, knowing that users don’t have the bandwidth to read lengthy legal documents when they’re simply trying to message a loved one or make a quick purchase. The potential for abuse is obvious, and some bad actors have chosen to exploit these agreements to expand their control over users’ personal data and shield themselves from liability. This is a problem that transcends political parties, and it demands solutions like the TLDR Act that do the same by requiring transparency and returning power to consumers.”A 2012 study found that it would take 76 work days for the average American to read the agreements for technology companies they use. Yet, because of the complicated language and length of many terms of service documents, an overwhelming majority of users agree without reading any portion of the contract.The TLDR Act gives consumers transparency by requiring terms-of-service summaries to include:Companies that do not comply or violate the law would be subject to civil suit by State Attorneys General if at least 1,000 residents in their state have been affected. The TLDR Act is supported by key groups and experts, including Common Sense, Open Terms Archive, and French Ambassador for Digital Affairs Henri Verdier.###"

https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/louisiana-chambers-trade-associations-praise-bipartisan-infrastructure-plan,"WASHINGTON – In November, the U.S. House of Representatives passed and the president signed the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) into law. This follows the U.S. Senate passing the legislation in August. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) led efforts to draft and pass this historic investment in Louisiana’s roads, airports, ports, rural broadband and flood mitigation projects. He also ensured the legislation boosts Louisiana’s energy industry by supporting hydrogen hubs and carbon sequestration technologies, among other projects.Chambers and trade associations from across Louisiana have joined Senator Cassidy in praising this legislation. Here’s what they are saying:Louisiana Asphalt Pavement Association: “For decades, there has been a need for a major transportation bill from Congress to improve our roads and bridges. Senator Cassidy has delivered that bill, and Louisiana will benefit enormously from his efforts. We appreciate his advocacy on behalf of our state and its citizens,” – Erich Ponti, Executive DirectorLouisiana Associated General Contractors: “The recently passed Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act means so much to Louisiana’s construction industry. We have been waiting for over 20 years for Congress to act upon the infrastructure needs of the states. Senator Bill Cassidy’s involvement in drafting the IIJA is not a benefit to Louisiana but to the whole country. The IIJA addresses the whole infrastructure needs, highways, bridges, ports, coastal, drainage, clean water, hazardous waste mitigation, and on and on,” – Ken Naquin, Chief Executive OfficerPorts Association of Louisiana: “The money provided for port upgrades by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will benefit every part of our state. This is a big win for Louisiana commerce and industry. We thank Senator Cassidy for his leadership in passing this bill into law,” – Jennifer Marusak, Executive DirectorOne Acadiana: “We appreciate Senator Cassidy’s efforts to keep the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act focused on its intended purpose. This long-term investment will better position our infrastructure networks, like the I-49 South corridor, to meet the needs of the future. Crucial funding for rural broadband and flood mitigation will also help to improve quality of life in Acadiana and attract new businesses and talent to our community. We are grateful to Senator Cassidy for his leadership on behalf of Louisiana,” Troy Wayman, President and Chief Executive OfficerAscension Chamber of Commerce: “The Ascension Chamber would like to commend Senator Bill Cassidy for his leadership in securing transportation infrastructure funding for Louisiana through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Recognizing the direct correlation between enhanced transportation infrastructure and economic development, Senator Cassidy knew how important this increased investment was to our state, specifically, for the production and transportation of global products manufactured here in Ascension. As Ascension Parish continues to be a leader in the state from an economic growth perspective, we ask that the infrastructure needs in our parish be prioritized when allocating this additional funding by ensuring our local road systems are not overburdened by the projected growth in the parish.” Bayou Industrial Group: “Our recovery from Hurricane Ida is only possible if we have the money necessary to build levees, repair our coast, and strengthen our grid. Our energy industry must also remain competitive, including wherever there are policies to reduce emissions. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act addresses all these needs. It’s only possible because of Senator Bill Cassidy, and we appreciate his work on behalf of Louisiana and our workers.”Capital Region Industry for Sustainable Infrastructure Solutions (CRISIS): “CRISIS thanks U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy for his work to pass the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) into law. Our organization advocates for transportation and infrastructure solutions in the Capital Region so Baton Rouge area residents will spend less time in traffic. The $6 billion that the IIJA provides Louisiana for roads and bridges will go a long way toward easing traffic congestion in the region. We appreciate Senator Cassidy’s leadership in Washington,” – Scott Kirkpatrick, Executive DirectorNortheast Louisiana Economic Alliance: “Northeast Louisiana is glad to be the beneficiary of investments recently voted through Congress. Senator Cassidy’s participation in the drafting of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and his hard work on broadband for rural areas will prove to be a dramatic change and upgrade. Rural business can take advantage of Internet trade and advertising. Roads and Bridges are sorely in need of improvements; our ports and airports, will be additional recipients of new or improved infrastructure. But for these new dollars, critical needs in Northeast Louisiana would not be quickly addressed. We appreciate the leadership of this truly bi-partisan bill and the fact that the Senator directed and spread Louisiana’s portion all over the state,” – Tana Trichel, President/Chief Executive OfficerSt. Mary Parish Chamber of Commerce: “The St. Mary Parish Chamber of Commerce would like to thank Senator Bill Cassidy for his bipartisan leadership while working with the Senate in passing the infrastructure bill. St. Mary Parish will benefit from many of the proposed key aspects in rebuilding roads and bridges which are desperately needed throughout the entirety of the parish. Major upgrading of broadband infrastructure will help the connectivity in our rural regions while bolstering connection in our municipalities. Restoration, preservation and protection of coastal St. Mary Parish including storm protection as well as dredging of the Atchafalaya is key to the vitality of our parish. Upgrading water distribution and wastewater treatment plants will ensure our parish will continue to maintain water safety ratings with DHH. We look forward to working with the Senator and his staff to ensure our Parish will receive our fair share of this monumental bill,” – Ed Verdin, Vice ChairpersonWest Baton Rouge Chamber of Commerce: “The West Baton Rouge Chamber of Commerce welcomes the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). This bill brings us one step closer to a new Mississippi River bridge, which will help our residents and support economic development. The money available for port upgrades, hydrogen hubs, carbon capture and other energy projects will also boost industry in our parish. We are grateful for Senator Cassidy’s leadership on this legislation. We feel that the IIJA will make West Baton Rouge Parish a better place to live and work,” – Patrick Hobbins, ChairmanPrevious statements of support made near the Senate passage of the bill in August include:Baton Rouge Round Table (BRAC): “BRAC thanks @SenBillCassidy for his incredible leadership to get a bipartisan infrastructure bill passed through the US Senate this week. Baton Rouge desperately needs more investment in roads and a new bridge. Cassidy played a huge role to help get it done.” – August 12, 2021 Business Roundtable: “Senator Bill Cassidy, thank you for your leadership and for supporting the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which will create jobs, help the economy grow and strengthen America’s global competitiveness.” – August 12, 2021U.S. Chamber of Commerce: “Thank you @SenBillCassidy for voting ‘Yes’ on the historic bipartisan infrastructure legislation. This legislation will grow our economy, create millions of jobs & improve global competitiveness.” – August 12, 2021American Association of Port Authorities: “One of the key authors of the ports section, @SenBillCassidy was on the floor moments ago touting the importance of projects that would be funded by this legislation. Read more about the need for infrastructure upgrades in Louisiana in the Advocate.” – August 3, 2021Speaker Pro Tempore of the Louisiana House of Representatives Tanner Magee: “If you get coastal permitting down to 2 years with the army Corp of engineers that is worth all the tea in China.” – July 28, 2021Associated General Contractors of America: “The new infrastructure measure passed by the Senate today provides much-needed new federal investments in a wide range of infrastructure projects.” – August 10, 2021National Governors Association: “Infrastructure is foundational to every aspect of our lives and Governors have been leading the call for action to fix now and invest in the future. Take a look at how the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act makes a generational investment in America.” – August 11, 2021National Association of Manufactures: “We are pleased with the Senate's progress towards passing this bill and look forward to assisting the Administration and States in bringing its benefits to life.” – August 9, 2021American Trucking Association: “For nearly three decades, our nation and industry have been held hostage by empty promises—all talk, no action. Today, the Senate put America ahead of itself. Passage of this bipartisan infrastructure bill is a groundbreaking step toward revitalizing America’s decaying roads and bridges, supporting our supply chain and economy with the foundation they need to grow, compete globally and lead the world.” – August 10, 2021American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials: “AASHTO is grateful the Senate was able to work in a bipartisan way to pass this historic infrastructure legislation, which provides a robust funding increase for all modes of transportation.” – August 10, 2021American Road & Transportation Builders Association: “The strong bipartisan spirit demonstrated in the Senate approval of the Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act sets the bar high.” – August 10, 2021###"

Smith. “This amendment will take important steps towards slowing the spread of this virus, allowing the United States to improve COVID-19 vaccine access for low- and middle-income countries, and leading the world out of the COVID-19 pandemic.”The bipartisan amendment:The amendment is also cosponsored in the Senate by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).You can read the full text of the amendment here.###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-hassan-legislation-ending-surprise-medical-bills-goes-into-effect-today,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) today announced their legislation to end surprise medical bills has gone into effect. Cassidy and Hassan successfully passed the No Surprises Act into law as part of the December 2020 government funding bill, which required that the Department of Health and Human Services implement the bill starting January 1, 2022.""This is a milestone in our effort to lower health care costs. Too often patients have been blindsided by surprise medical bills, sometimes for tens of thousands of dollars. This is a victory for them,” said Dr. Cassidy. “This solution is pro-patient and benefits everyone.”“After a harrowing emergency, countless Granite Staters and families across the country have returned home only to be saddled with an unfair medical bill – sometimes to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars – because an out-of-network doctor treated them. That’s why I teamed up across the aisle to pass groundbreaking legislation to help ensure that Americans aren’t left on the hook for these outrageous bills, and now these important patient protections for many health care services go into effect,” said Senator Hassan. The legislation protects patients from having to pay out-of-network costs for emergency services, post-emergency stabilization services, and non-emergency services provided by an out-of-network provider at an in-network facility. Patients can only be required to pay in-network costs for these services.If patients receive a higher bill for these covered services, they should contact the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services at 1-800-985-3059 or the Louisiana Department of Insurance at 1-800-259-5300. For more information, visit https://www.cms.gov/nosurprises/consumers. These patient protections follow a two-year effort from Senators Cassidy and Hassan, starting with crafting the STOP Surprise Medical Bills Act to end this practice. In May of 2019, Senators Cassidy and Hassan joined President Trump at a White House event on the need to address this issue. The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee – on which Senators Cassidy and Hassan serve – passed legislation to end surprise medical bills as part of a broader package of legislation to address health care costs called the Lower Health Care Costs Act. Senators Hassan and Cassidy’s efforts culminated in passing into law the No Surprises Act in December of 2020.###"
https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-joins-senate-and-house-gop-colleagues-against-biden-vaccine-mandate-in-upcoming-supreme-court-case,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) joined 46 of his Senate Republican colleagues and 132 other Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives in filing an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court in opposition to the Biden administration’s vaccine mandate on private businesses. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) requires employers with over 100 employees to mandate the COVID-19 vaccine or weekly testing. The members wrote in the brief, “Congressional members have an interest in the powers they delegate to agencies not being abused—the legislative authority vested in the federal government belongs to Congress, not the Executive branch. In this case, the promulgation by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) of a sweeping, nationwide vaccine mandate on businesses intrudes into an area of legislative concern far beyond the authority of the agency. And it does so with a Mandate enacted through OSHA’s seldom-used ‘emergency temporary standard’ (ETS) provision that allows for bypass of notice and comment rulemaking under certain circumstances. That OSHA exceeded its authority in enacting the ETS Mandate is not a ‘particularly hard’ question.”The members continued: “Moreover, congressional members—as representatives of the people of their States and districts—have an interest in the citizens they represent being able to craft local solutions to problems facing their States and districts. Federalism concerns should be addressed before requiring federally-imposed solutions. And this is especially true when the question at issue involves an area typically reserved to the States (such as vaccine mandates). At the least, Congress should be forced to make clear any delegations of authority into areas of State control.”Read the full text of the brief here.The brief was signed by:Senators Bill Cassidy, Mike Braun, John Barrasso, Marsha Blackburn, Roy Blunt, John Boozman, Richard Burr, Shelley Moore Capito, Tom Cotton, John Cornyn, Kevin Cramer, Mike Crapo, Ted Cruz, Steven Daines, Joni Ernst, Deb Fischer, Lindsey O.

https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-marshall-24-colleagues-urge-administration-to-implement-surprise-medical-billing-law-according-to-congressional-intent,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) and Roger Marshall (R-KS) led a group of 24 Senate Republicans in urging the Biden administration to revise the recently released interim final rule (IFR) for the No Surprises Act, legislation that ends the practice of surprise medical billing by taking patients out of the middle and establishing a comprehensive independent dispute resolution process. The text of the legislation requires that all factors listed in the text be given equal weight to ensure a level playing field for all parties. However, the IFR ignores congressional intent and disrupts the level playing field by establishing the median in-network rate as the presumed rate.The No Surprises Act passed as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 last December and is set to go into effect on January 1, 2022. “With the passage of the No Surprises Act, Congress established an [independent dispute resolution] framework that took patients out of the middle while not tilting the scales in favor of one party over the other,” wrote the senators. “In no way does the statute privilege any one rate in the [independent dispute resolution] process, but rather establishes an open and robust dispute resolution process in which each factor is given equal weighting.” “Unfortunately, the [interim final rule] that the departments released in September departs from this carefully crafted approach, putting almost exclusive emphasis on the median in-network rate,” continued the senators.Cassidy and Marshall were joined by Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), John Barrasso (R-WY), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Mike Braun (R-IN), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Rob Portman (R-OH), Mike Rounds (R-SD), John Hoeven (R-ND), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Thom Tillis (R-NC), John Boozman (R-AR), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Rand Paul (R-KY), Jim Risch (R-ID), Mike Crapo (R-ID), James Lankford (R-OK), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), and Todd Young (R-IN).Cassidy also called on the administration to comply with Congressional intent in May.Read the full letter here or below.Dear Secretaries Becerra, Yellen, and Walsh,We worked diligently to find a bipartisan and bicameral solution to end the practice of surprise medical billing, a process which took over 2 years and culminated in the passage of the No Surprises Act in December 2020. We write now to express concern regarding the independent dispute resolution (IDR) framework outlined in the interim final rule (IFR) released on September 30, entitled “Requirements Related to Surprise Billing: Part II” and ask that you amend it to align with the law that Congress passed.According to the statute, in addition to the information brought forth by either party or requested by the arbiter and excluding billed charges and public payor information, these proceedings shall include consideration of:With the passage of the No Surprises Act, Congress established an IDR framework that took patients out of the middle while not tilting the scales in favor of one party over the other. In no way does the statute privilege any one rate in the IDR process, but rather establishes an open and robust dispute resolution process in which each factor is given equal weighting.Unfortunately, the IFR that the departments released in September departs from this carefully crafted approach, putting almost exclusive emphasis on the median in-network rate. The IFR states that the IDR entity is only allowed to deviate from the median in-network rate when there is “credible information about additional circumstances [that] clearly demonstrates that the [median in-network rate] is materially different from the appropriate out-of-network rate.” This was not a threshold established by Congress and is not reflected in statute.We are very concerned that the outcome of this approach will be markedly like that of a benchmark payment in clustering all rates around the median-in network or below, a policy which Congress debated and ultimately rejected because of concerns it created around rural access and narrow networks. We have heard significant pushback from providers, hospitals and physicians alike, that the agencies’ approach gives certain stakeholders too much control over the outcome of IDR in a manner that does not reflect the careful balance that we agreed to last December.We urge you to revise the IFR released on September 30 to better reflect the law that Congress passed in developing a framework that protects patients while being fair to stakeholders. ###"
