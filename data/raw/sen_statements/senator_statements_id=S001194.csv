And this is an emergency. Our water was poisoned. Of course they need to assess, prepare, and drain the tanks in a way that is safe and doesn’t cause more contamination, but anything resembling a delay, intentional or not, is totally unacceptable.

The new money, allocated by U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) from the recent infrastructure law, will provide Hawai‘i residents and visitors with more travel options while cutting air pollution.“This new federal funding will make it easier for people to get to where they need to go while making our roads cleaner and quieter,” said Senator Schatz, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation and Housing. “Improving our public transit system with electric buses means that we can provide affordable transportation while reducing our carbon footprint.”According to DOT, the Hawai‘i Department of Transportation will receive more than $35 million in funding on behalf of Hawai‘i, Kaua‘i, and Maui counties to improve bus stops and facilities and buy a mix of zero-emission buses, battery electric buses, and fuel cell electric buses. The new vehicles will replace diesel buses and retrofitted hydrogen fuel cell cutaways that have exceeded their useful life.The Honolulu Department of Transportation Services will receive $20 million in new funding to buy battery electric buses.

It is high time we move past this notice and consent model and ensure that the Big Tech companies that monetize our personal information are stopped from using our data in ways that harm us. I am glad to see the Commission kickoff a process asking questions about fixing the physical, mental, and reputational harms caused by these data practices, as I and others have called for, and in considering bright line limits on what types of data companies collect and keep. I am also heartened to see the FTC is scrutinizing discrimination in the algorithms that Americans interact with every day and that pose significant risks when used negligently or maliciously.”Senator Schatz has led calls encouraging the FTC to do more on privacy and ensure accountability for use of algorithms. Last year, he reintroduced the Data Care Act, legislation which would require websites, apps, and other online providers to take responsible steps to safeguard personal information and stop the misuse of users’ data, and the Platform Accountability and Consumer Transparency (PACT) Act, which would empower the FTC to make platforms’ manual and automated content moderation practices more transparent and prevent companies from using Section 230 as a defense against government, including the FTC and Department of Justice, civil actions to protect consumers.###"

The senators asked DOJ to restart a rulemaking process under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to establish new rules ensuring that the ADA applies to the Internet.“The United States has invested billions of dollars to develop technology and provide connectivity to all parts of the country, but it is of little value to the Americans who are unable to access the online services that the rest of us so heavily rely on,” the senators wrote to Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who leads DOJ’s Civil Rights Division. “When Congress enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, the Internet and digital technologies were at a nascent stage. More than thirty years later, these technologies are now ubiquitous and we rely on them for daily activities—such as communicating with friends and family, conducting business, accessing government resources, and obtaining health care. New rules are necessary so that individuals with disabilities are provided equal access to the digital world.”In addition to Schatz, the letter was signed by U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Bob Casey (D-Penn.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).In their letter, the senators cited a study analyzing the top one million most-visited websites which found the overwhelming majority of these websites were inaccessible in some way to people with disabilities. More than 4,000 cases were filed in federal and state courts referencing ADA compliance last year, but their verdicts remain uncertain without DOJ regulations.The full text of the letter follows and is available here.Dear Assistant Attorney General Clarke:We are writing to you to urge the Department of Justice to restart the rulemaking process under Titles II and III of the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) and ensure that it includes protections to stop the persistent exclusion of people with disabilities from the Internet. The United States has invested billions of dollars to develop technology and provide connectivity to all parts of the country, but it is of little value to the Americans who are unable to access the online services that the rest of us so heavily rely on.The ADA is landmark civil rights legislation that guarantees people with disabilities have an equal right to employment, commerce, and government services. Unfortunately, the digital world has not granted these protections consistent with the physical world. An analysis of the top one million visited web sites found that the overwhelming majority are inaccessible in some way. Even the largest and most successful online companies have failed to incorporate basic features, such as alt text, to make their products accessible.The Department of Justice has the authority and ability to initiate a rulemaking and establish rules that make it clear that the ADA applies to the Internet. We appreciate the Department’s stated position on the issue and the recently published guidelines on “Web Accessibility and the ADA”. However, without rules from the Department, courts have had differing interpretations on when and how the ADA should apply to the Internet. Over 4,000 cases were filed in federal and state courts referencing ADA compliance in 2021, but their verdicts are uncertain without the Department’s regulations.As you are aware, a similar rulemaking to the one we are urging you to prepare was initiated in 2010 under the Obama administration, but rules were never issued and the Trump administration withdrew the proposed rulemaking. It is critical that the Department restart the rulemaking and include strong protections clarifying the applicability of the ADA to the Internet. Individuals with disabilities cannot afford to wait any longer for the Department to affirm their civil rights.When Congress enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, the Internet and digital technologies were at a nascent stage. More than thirty years later, these technologies are now ubiquitous and we rely on them for daily activities—such as communicating with friends and family, conducting business, accessing government resources, and obtaining health care. New rules are necessary so that individuals with disabilities are provided equal access to the digital world.Thank you for your attention to this important matter.Sincerely,###"

We commend the NIH in taking an important step by hosting its January workshop, “Psychedelics as Therapeutics: Gaps, Challenges and Opportunities,” which highlighted existing research and the regulatory challenges and opportunities to advance psychedelic research. We encourage NIH and FDA to further expand their role in identifying research gaps, potentially promising therapeutic uses of psychedelics, and regulatory hurdles in the field of psychedelic research.The United States previously conducted robust research on psychedelic drugs. In the 20th century, leading researchers in psychiatry and the emerging fields of neuropharmacology and neuropsychopharmacology pursued medical research on psychedelic drugs including LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline.  This research was supported by pharmaceutical companies, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), and other government agencies.  A U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) document reported that from about 1950 to 1965, “research on LSD and hallucinogens generated over 1000 scientific papers, several dozen books, and 6 international conferences, and LSD was prescribed as treatment to over 400,000 patients.”However, in the 1960s, the counterculture movement’s embrace of psychedelics and the illicit manufacture and distribution of LSD contributed to its popular cultural rise and its increased non-medical use.  This created a backlash resulting in its stigmatization and adverse political repercussions by the latter half of the 1960s.  In 1971, some psychedelics were placed in Schedule I of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, cementing its status as having no accepted medical use.  In addition, in 1970 the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) codified harsh penalties for manufacture, possession, and use of many psychedelics, which hindered their research and medicinal development.  Pharmaceutical and federal funding for psychedelic research dried up, while CSA licensure requirements made it more difficult to secure regulatory approval for research.Medication development efforts on psychedelics reignited in the 1990s when researchers rediscovered potential uses of these substances by applying state of the art clinical research development approaches, methods, and procedures.  Following these efforts, the Schedule I substance 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), also known as “ecstasy,” was granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation as an MDMA-assisted psychotherapy Investigational New Drug Application for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Research on psychedelics still faces significant challenges. Many major pharmaceutical companies have withdrawn or scaled back funding in this field because of the high rate of failure to find medications that are acceptable for FDA approval. Research on psilocybin for severe depression and anxiety-related disorders, as well as MDMA for PTSD, is currently being supported primarily by small organizations that do not have adequate funding to develop medications through expensive safety studies and large-scale phase 3 clinical trials. A key challenge now is to design the optimal clinical trial to demonstrate efficacy, ensure safety and compliance with regulatory authorities, and secure the funding needed to support large-scale trials.In response to a request for information on research efforts into the use of psychoactive drugs in treating mental illness, NIH and FDA acknowledged some potential therapeutic uses of these substances, as well as the need for additional research.  The Biden-Harris Administration recently announced support for expanding research on Schedule I substances to inform and advance evidence-based public policy, and how this research relates to addiction and overdose, chronic pain, and mental health conditions.  It is important that federal research agencies continue to assess the efficacy of potential alternatives to drugs with high misuse potential.NIH has begun to show greater interest in psychedelic research. In April 2021, NIH awarded its first grant dedicated to medicinal psychedelic research, focused on use of neuro-imaging to search for neuronal correlates of clinical change in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder treated with psilocybin. Further NIH’s January 2022 workshop exploring the field of psychedelics as a potential therapeutic for a number of disorders marks another positive step. As the NIH and FDA consider further methods to expand research of mental health treatments, we request written responses to the following inquiries and questions:NIH and FDA are critical to ensuring a comprehensive, rigorous, and deliberative science-based approach to the study of psychedelics, including the potential development of medication and therapeutics derived from these substances. Thank you for your attention to this issue, and we look forward to your written response.Sincerely,###"

The bipartisan bill, which will improve data collection on cybercrimes and give law enforcement and policy makers more tools to combat cybercrime in the United States, passed the Senate in December and the U.S. House of Representatives in March.“By collecting data on how often, when, and where cyberattacks are happening, our bipartisan bill will better protect people in Hawai‘i from online crimes like those against our transit and water systems in Honolulu, help us support victims of online crimes, and give us more tools to go after the criminals who perpetrate them,” said Senator Schatz.Last December, cyberattacks against Honolulu’s TheBus and Handi-Van’s public transit systems and the Board of Water Supply left passengers without rides and employees with their personal data exposed. Recent data from the FBI estimates that cybercrimes cost Hawai‘i residents $17.2 million last year. Each year, hundreds of thousands of Americans are targets of cybercrime incidents that cost billions of dollars. Whether done through online scams and fraud, corporate data breaches, or ransomware attacks, the cost of cybercrime has been increasing annually, from $3.5 billion in 2019 to $4.2 billion in 2020, and impacts an estimated 300,000 to 700,000 victims each year. Unfortunately, these numbers are likely low, as there are no comprehensive metrics on the scale and impact of cybercrime in the United States, or on law enforcement efforts against them. Only 10 to 12 percent of all estimated cybercrime victims report cybercrime incidents in the United States, while other estimates have put the degree of underreporting much higher.The Better Cybercrime Metrics Act will give law enforcement a clearer picture of online crimes in the United States by requiring the FBI to integrate cybercrime incidents into its current reporting streams to better understand all the types of crime that Americans face. As cybercriminals continue to target vulnerable populations, this data will help lawmakers make an informed case for policy changes to curtail the cybercrime wave, keep Americans safe, and bring these criminals to justice.The Better Cybercrime Metrics Act will:The legislation is supported by the National White Collar Crime Center (NWC3), former U.S. Attorney and Los Angeles Police Commissioner Eileen M. Decker, the Cybercrime Support Network (CSN), Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA), National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), National Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), and the Major County Sheriffs of America.The full text of the bill is available here.###"

But it is also about raising awareness of the discrimination and violence they still face today. While we have made significant progress over the years – thanks to the bravery of many transgender leaders – the work for full equality, acceptance, and civil rights protections continues,” said Senator Schatz.Schatz’s resolution is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Bob Casey (D-Penn.), Mazie K.

Trans rights are human rights,” said Senator Markey. “Our job in Congress is to advocate for and celebrate every American, and today on Trans Day of Visibility – and every other day of the year – we recommit to the work of creating a more equitable and inclusive society.”“At a time when trans rights are under attack in state houses and by school boards, it is more important than ever to support transgender people and especially children. On International Transgender Day of Visibility, I am especially proud of Pennsylvania’s own Dr. Rachel Levine, a renowned physician and the highest-ranking transgender official ever to serve in the federal government. She has transcended hate and bigotry throughout her time in public service and has never wavered in her leadership or her commitment to improving the health and wellbeing of all Pennsylvanians and Americans,” said Senator Casey.“Despite the progress we’ve made toward equality, trans people—particularly trans people of color—continue to face discrimination and attacks. On this International Transgender Day of Visibility and always, I stand in solidarity with trans people everywhere and celebrate their perseverance, vibrance, and the important contributions they make to our society. I’ll keep fighting until all transgender, nonbinary, and gender-diverse people have the freedom to live authentically,” said Senator Hirono.“Transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming individuals still face violence, harassment, and discrimination based on their gender identity and gender expression – that must end. Recognizing Transgender Day of Visibility is an important step in celebrating their rights to live openly, and their contributions to our country and the world. We have to keep fighting for full equality and to protect individuals from targeted violence and persecution based on gender identity or expression – I’m glad to be with Senator Schatz in this fight,” said Senator Warren.“On this International Transgender Day of Visibility and always, we celebrate the resilience of transgender, nonbinary and gender nonconforming Americans and their basic right to be their most authentic selves without fear, shame or discrimination,” said Senator Duckworth. “As the transgender community continues to endure horrific, targeted violence and with a wave of anti-transgender bills being proposed in states across the country, I’m proud to join Senator Schatz and my colleagues to introduce this resolution to commemorate Transgender Day of Visibility and send a strong, unified message to our fellow Americans: we see you, we hear you and we will never stop working to advance true equality for all of us.”“The transgender community is diverse, resilient, and strong,” said Senator Rosen. “I'm proud to help introduce this resolution recognizing Trans Day of Visibility and raising awareness of the discrimination and violence the trans community still endures. No one should have to ever live in fear or experience violence for being who they are.”“On Transgender Day of Visibility, I’m reminded of the strength and bravery of all transgender individuals — especially our nation’s trans youth. Everyone in this country deserves to be seen, respected, and loved. Sadly, this is not the case for many, as transgender Americans continue to face intolerance, violence, and barriers to opportunity. Today, and every day, we must continue to lift up these brave individuals to ensure their stories are heard and that they have equal protection under the law,” said Senator Carper.“Today, we celebrate the lives—the joy, the contributions, the perseverance and so much more—of trans and non-binary people here in the United States and around the world,” said Senator Wyden. “As attacks against the LGBTQ+ community continue to plague our nation, we are reminded today of our shared humanity and goals for a more equitable world. Today and every day, I am fighting tooth and nail to protect the rights of trans youth, veterans, and folks in Oregon and across the country to get the gender-affirming care and treatment they seek to continue to be their true selves.”“There is no room for discrimination and hate in society,” said Senator Whitehouse.  “I’m glad to join my colleagues in recognizing trans Americans’ many contributions, and in sending a message of kindness and love as the world celebrates International Transgender Day of Visibility.”“International Transgender Day of Visibility is an opportunity for us to celebrate the contributions, successes and resilience of trans people,” said Senator Bennet. “As the transgender community continues to face an onslaught of bigoted, reprehensible attacks on their humanity, I'll continue working in the Senate to take much-needed steps to protect trans people in Colorado and across the country.”International Transgender Day of Visibility was founded in 2009. Since then, the transgender community has seen many visible leaders in both government and popular culture.A similar resolution was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by U.S. Representative Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.).The full text of Schatz’s resolution is available here.###"

I remember all of our long talks about everything, but mostly about our two shared loves: family and politics, over a meal, which she would let me pay for occasionally. “But most of all I will remember Grandma Maddie, who was kind and curious with my kids, taking us out to dinner in Georgetown, and being one of the most giving, decent human beings that I have ever known.

That means more jobs, more reliable energy, and cheaper electric bills for Moloka‘i residents,” said Senator Schatz.Ho‘āhu Energy Cooperative Moloka‘i will receive tailored expert support from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), a DOE National Lab, to address the island’s unique energy challenges. During this first phase of the initiative, Ho‘āhu Energy Cooperative Moloka‘i will receive one-on-one assistance from PNNL, including training, energy and economic analysis, workforce and equity assessments, and grant application assistance. The program also aims to help participating communities develop a network of experts that can serve as a valuable resource even after the technical assistance phase ends. Technical assistance will take place over a ten-month timeframe extending to the end of 2022. After that, Ho‘āhu Energy Cooperative Moloka‘i may advance to a second phase of assistance, which will involve engineering and budgetary guidance and other technical support for project deployment.“Molokai, which is 60 percent Hawaiian by population, is challenged with energy rates nearly 400 percent higher than the national average,” said Todd Yamashita, president of Ho‘āhu Energy Cooperative Moloka‘i. “We are excited about this opportunity because it’s helping us create, on our own terms, an energy future that is reflective of the resilient and resourceful nature of our people.”The federal support is part of a DOE initiative designed to support communities that experience problems with their energy systems. It aims to mitigate energy access, affordability, and reliability challenges by helping those communities design energy storage solutions.###"

Investors need to know exactly how exposed individual companies are to climate risks. For that, they need consistent, comparable, and detailed data. This rule will give investors mandatory, standardized disclosures that they can compare across different companies.

Right now, there is no easy way out for these victims – they’re trapped in by contracts and hefty fees. Our bill helps survivors get out of these shared plans and tries to find more ways to help victims stay connected with their families and support networks,” said Senator Schatz.“I’m pleased to report that Senator Schatz and I were able to pass this important legislation for survivors of domestic abuse. It is critical for survivors to gain independence and separate their mobile communications from the control of an abuser’s cell phone plan, while having the option of retaining their own number. The Safe Connections Act will do exactly that. The House should pass this bipartisan bill without delay,” said Senator Fischer. Survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, sexual assault, and human trafficking often face challenges when establishing independence from an abuser. These include financial insecurity and limited access to the communications tools essential to maintaining connections with family, social safety networks, employers, and support services. As survivors seek help and stabilize their lives, the Safe Connections Act would help them stay safe and connected by:The Schatz-Fischer legislation is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.).The Safe Connections Act is supported by Access Now, the Clinic to End Tech Abuse at Cornell University, the Hawai‘i State Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the International Justice Mission, the National Domestic Violence Hotline, Public Knowledge, RAINN, StrongHearts Helpline, Legal Momentum - the Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund, the National Network to End Domestic Violence, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, the Domestic Violence Action Center, the Center for Democracy and Technology, and Polaris.The bill now heads to the U.S. House of Representatives for consideration.###"

The new earmark funding will be used to support construction of predator-proof fencing to protect threatened and endangered species within the Mokio Preserve.“This new earmark will protect dozens of threatened and endangered species on Molokai,” said Senator Schatz, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. “By supporting the Molokai Land Trust, we’re helping to care for native wildlife, strengthen local ecosystems, and preserve the island’s environment for years to come.”“Molokai Land Trust is honored and humbled to receive this support through Senator Schatz's office, and it represents an enormous commitment to conservation of our unique genetic diversity here in Hawai‘i and protection of designated critical habitat for numerous federally listed species. Most importantly, the completion of the predator proof fence to protect over 90 acres along this section of coastline will help provide high quality nesting habitat for the expansion of current seabird populations, and future dislocated populations from the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands that will be negatively impacted from projected sea level rise. We would like to thank all those involved in helping make this a reality for our community,” said William “Butch” Haase, Executive Director of the Molokai Land Trust.This funding will help protect endangered ground nesting seabirds, Hawaiian yellow face bees, and many plant species through habitat restoration and safety from invasive, non-native predators. The 60 acre site for the species in the Mokio Preserve is protected by a temporary fence that has enabled them to begin recovering their populations, and the construction of a permanent fence will allow them to better do so. Two rare species that were extinct in the wild, including the Hawai‘i state flower Hibiscus brackenridgei or Mao hau hele, have already been reintroduced through a partnership with the Hawai‘i Department of Land and Natural Resources. The new predator proof fence will expand the protected site to over 90 acres when completed by early 2023.The new congressionally directed funding in this year’s appropriations bill marks the first year members of Congress were able to make earmark requests since they were banned in 2011.

Hawai‘i will receive its first round of funding of $67.8 million this year. The federal funding comes from the Department of Transportation’s newly launched Bridge Replacement, Rehabilitation, Preservation, Protection, and Construction Program, which was created by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed by Congress and signed into law last November.“This historic investment will help rebuild bridges across Hawai‘i, making them safer and more resilient for everyone,” said Senator Schatz, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation and Housing. “The bipartisan infrastructure law is already helping our state, and I’m proud to have supported it.”The program, to be administered by the Federal Highway Administration, represents the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system – providing $26.5 billion to states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico over the five years of the law and $825 million for Tribal transportation facilities. The total amount that will be available to states, D.C. and Puerto Rico in Fiscal Year 2022 is $5.3 billion, along with $165 million for tribes. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes an incentive for states to direct the new Bridge Formula Program funds to off-system bridges owned by a county, city, town or other local agency. While states normally must match federal funding with up to 20 percent state or local funding, the guidance issued today notes that federal funds can be used for 100 percent of the cost of repairing or rehabilitating such locally owned off-system bridges.###"

The bipartisan legislation will support small businesses in creative industries by increasing access to federal resources to help them grow.“Local artists, writers, performers, and the creative industry they support play a leading role in our economy and our everyday lives. As the creative economy begins to rebuild from the pandemic, we have an opportunity to make key federal investments that will create new jobs and help the industry reach its full potential,” said Senator Schatz.“The world knows about the Lone Star State and our rich culture thanks to the creative Texans who have chronicled our way of life for hundreds of years,” said Senator Cornyn. “This legislation would support the Texas writers, singers, artists, and arts entrepreneurs whose work helps drive our economy.” The creative economy includes businesses focused on individual creativity, skill, talent, or expression of indigenous culture or regional or local heritage culture. These businesses collectively add $919.7 billion annually to our nation’s Gross Domestic Product, with a growth rate nearly double the rest of the economy.The recent growth of the creative economy has occurred despite federal small business and economic development policies largely ignoring the needs of the industry. The CREATE Act will offer direct, concrete support to these businesses. Specifically, the CREATE Act:“We are excited how the CREATE Act will help millions of artists, makers and designers grow America’s creative economy. In 2020, Etsy’s creative community added $13 billion and 2.6 million jobs to the economy - imagine the impact these resources can have on the creative economy and local communities. We look forward to continuing to work with policymakers to promote public policies that enable creative entrepreneurs to thrive,” said Jeffrey Zubricki, Head of Americas Advocacy and Public Policy at Etsy.“The CREATE Act is a critical bipartisan policy solution that would strengthen our nation’s investment in our creative economy. By focusing on economic development and small business policy, this bill seeks to leverage existing federal opportunities for the betterment of communities throughout the country.

https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hawaii-schools-to-receive-more-than-2-million-to-help-provide-school-meals-keep-children-healthy,"HONOLULU – U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D- Hawai‘i) today announced that schools in Hawai‘i will receive an estimated $2,340,000 in increased funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to help cover the costs of school meal programs. The boost in funding will assist schools in continuing to serve nutritious meals to children, which is especially critical in light of increasing food costs and operational challenges during the pandemic.“Hawai‘i’s school meal programs are essential to making sure that children have the nutritious meals they need to stay healthy and succeed in school,” said Senator Schatz. “This additional funding helps to ensure that school meal programs have the support they need to continue providing healthy meals to students.”The USDA is making this mid-year increase in school meal reimbursements through a waiver established by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. Schools in Hawai‘i will now receive reimbursement rates for school meals that are 22 percent higher than is standard.###"
https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-warns-against-ongoing-threats-to-american-democracy-commemorates-january-6-capitol-attack,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i) spoke on the Senate floor today to commemorate the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and the continued threats to American democracy.“A year ago, there was an attempted overthrow of American democracy right here in this building. We came perilously close to losing everything that night. Police officers were maimed and killed. Custodial workers and Senate staffers were hiding, with zero protection,” said Senator Schatz. “One year later, and I’m even more worried now. Donald Trump is now defining fealty to him by one thing and one thing only – are you willing to install him into power regardless of the vote count? And so now every Republican politician and election official – secretaries of state, county election commissioners, United States Senate candidates – have to promise to put Trump above democracy itself. And they are doing it!”Schatz continued, “If we take a moment and we realize what’s at stake, we will realize what is required. It will require Republicans to stand up to an autocrat. It will require Democrats to stop arguing amongst ourselves. It will require reporters to write stories that get fewer clicks than whatever BS feels like the news of the day. It will require citizens to understand that democracy in this country is not what we have, it is what we do, and it is never, ever guaranteed.”Video of the speech is available here. The full text of the speech as prepared for delivery can be found below.A year ago, there was an attempted overthrow of American democracy right here in this building.We spend so much time here arguing about things that are unknowable – about the future, about ideology, about opinions – and we’ve become accustomed to treating floor speeches in the Senate as, well, not primarily factual.But I was here. In fact, I was right here at this desk. No one needs to characterize it for me or pontificate about it or tell me what I should think about what happened. It was right here. It wasn’t theoretical, it wasn’t a debate. It was a physical siege on the United States Capitol.I was already angry that day – the idea that American, democratically-elected politicians would participate in a process so foul as to be worthy of our most autocratic adversaries had me in a sour mood. The Electoral College certification is supposed to be the functional equivalent of the swearing in, where the thing gets made official, without any decisions actually being made. But Senators Hawley and Cruz and others, with their unlimited ambition, their big brains, and their supposed expertise in the Constitution, were dancing on the edge of overturning democracy itself.But I had no idea that there was an ongoing, organized conspiracy to steal the election. For real. Not in the “Russian hacking” way, and not in the “too many of the people I don’t agree with voted” way. Actually overturning the whole thing.And so no one needs to tell me how to interpret this. I was here when they yelled “lock down, lock down.” I was here when Mike Pence was ushered off the floor. I was here when Chuck Grassley and anyone with a personal protection detail was rushed to safety, and the rest of us were just locked in here and told to stay in our seats. I was here when Todd Young made himself ready to physically confront the violent traitors. I was here when we were finally rushed to an undisclosed location and Lindsey Graham yelled at the Capitol Police for not having a plan to handle such a moment. I was here when Reverend Black pulled us together in unity. I was here when all but a few of us decided “enough is enough,” and we were collectively determined to finish the count that evening. I was here.We came perilously close to losing everything that night. And some did. Police officers were maimed and killed. Custodial workers and Senate staffers were hiding, with zero protection. The insurrectionists were explicit. They wanted to kill the Speaker of the House!One year later should be a simple, solemn commemoration of what happened and a collective, unified determination to never let anything like this happen again. But I’m even more worried now. Because that moment of unity is gone. And most importantly, that moment of moral clarity, of collective patriotic outrage, is gone. It went from Republicans being apologetic about their President to voting to exonerate him. It went from Republicans being angry at him to voting against putting together a bipartisan commission to get all the facts out. It went from 99 percent of the public being crystal clear about the moral threat to the right rewriting history, and in some cases, the left going along with it by telling us that other issues poll better.To be clear, the litmus test for both political parties is usually to greater and lesser degrees loyalty to their president. Fair enough. That’s how the two party system works for better or worse. But Donald Trump is now defining fealty to him by one thing and one thing only – are you willing to install him into power regardless of the vote count? And so now every Republican politician and election official – secretaries of state, county election commissioners, United States Senate candidates – have to promise to put Trump above democracy itself. And they are doing it!They are now organizing the next coup in plain sight. I don’t know the economics or the psychology behind it – maybe it’s ratings or a natural tendency among the chattering class to not want to sound like a wild-eyed person – that being unworried is what passes for savvy in this town, but everyone, including those who consider themselves “patriots,” seem so chill about this that I’m genuinely alarmed. They are installing loyalists across the country in order to cheat and they are not being subtle about it. Meanwhile, the cocktail set in Washington is busy policing our tone and talking about democratic overreach.And so the defining question this week and this year is: are we willing to face the challenge in front of us? Yes, there is COVID. Yes, there is climate. But democracy itself is at risk in a way we haven’t seen in centuries. And we’re standing around as a country arguing about mostly nonsense. Here’s the problem for all of us, and here’s why this is so hard emotionally. If we take a moment and we realize what’s at stake, we will realize what is required. It will require Republicans to stand up to an autocrat. It will require Democrats to stop arguing amongst ourselves. It will require reporters to write stories that get fewer clicks than whatever BS feels like the news of the day. It will require citizens to understand that democracy in this country is not what we have, it is what we do, and it is never, ever guaranteed.So, this week we commemorate the fallen. We thank everyone who came to democracy’s defense across the country and in our great capital city. But we know that this was round one. We know that authoritarians rarely give up, and we know they aren’t doing their preparation for the next coup d’état in hiding. They are doing it all in plain sight and they must be stopped.###"

https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-brown-introduce-bill-to-support-community-college-students-improve-graduation-rates,"Bill Would Help Community Colleges Provide Students With Free Tutoring, Textbooks, TransportationWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) introduced legislation to expand services for community college students and help them graduate. The Community College Student Success Act would fund programs at community colleges to support students by providing comprehensive wrap around services, including free tutoring, textbooks, and transportation.“Our bill gives community college students the tools they need to earn a degree and find a good-paying job,” said Senator Schatz. “When we provide targeted support services to community college students, it helps them graduate on time. We know this works because some schools are already successfully doing this.”“Respecting the dignity of work means ensuring students of all backgrounds have the opportunity to pursue jobs that pay well and are fulfilling. By investing in programs that provide tutoring, textbooks, and transportation, we empower students to make the best decisions for their careers, whether that’s choosing to pursue additional workforce training or getting a job. I’m proud to join Senator Schatz to support this effort,” said Senator Brown.Community colleges serve low-income students and students of color at far higher rates than public four-year institutions and at more than half the cost. However, community colleges graduate students at far lower rates than public four-year institutions. Many community college students face both academic and financial obstacles. From needing remedial courses, to working part- or full-time jobs to pay for the full cost of college, to navigating the bureaucracy of course selection and financial aid, community college students often face higher barriers with fewer resources.The Community College Student Success Act is modeled on successful student programs, such as the City University of New York’s Accelerated Study In Associate Programs, which has a proven record of doubling community college graduation rates.The Community College Student Success Act establishes competitive grant programs for community colleges to replicate the CUNY ASAP-style completion programs, or to improve and expand existing evidence-based comprehensive student success programs.The Schatz bill would provide community college students with wrap around support including:The Community College Student Success Act is supported by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO), Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP), Higher Learning Advocates, Institute for Higher Education Policy (IHEP), National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC), Ohio Association of Community Colleges (OACC), Results for America, The Education Trust (EdTrust), The Institute for College Access & Success (TICAS), University of Hawai‘i System, and Young Invincibles.The full text of the bill is available here.###"

In addition, people may need to take public transportation for their livelihoods, and individuals working or traveling on transportation conveyances may be unvaccinated or at increased risk of severe illness.  The CDC’s guidance on face masks for fully vaccinated people has evolved as new data have become available and as more individuals are vaccinated.  In May, the CDC announced new guidance that fully vaccinated individuals could resume activities without wearing a mask or staying six feet apart.  At that time, the CDC said that it would continue to update its guidance for travel as the science emerges and that it would need to collaborate with other agencies as the face mask requirement is an interagency policy.  As there has not yet been any change in the requirement for masks while traveling, we request an update on the CDC’s and TSA’s process for updating the mask requirement for fully vaccinated individuals and what the science is showing about the transmission of COVID-19 for fully vaccinated individuals while traveling.  Specifically, we request answers by no later than July 12, 2021, to the following questions:If the requirement for wearing masks while traveling can be safely lifted and would serve the public health interest, then we believe it would benefit the traveling public. We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and hard work in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.Sincerely, ###"

Authorized under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, which also eliminated parole for federal prisoners, compassionate release gives people incarcerated in federal prisons an opportunity to appeal for early release for “extraordinary and compelling” reasons, including advanced age and terminal illness.“People who are eligible for compassionate release are the most vulnerable to public health emergencies like COVID-19, and they are needlessly being put at risk because the process takes too long,” said Senator Schatz. “Our bill will help speed up the approval process so that sick and elderly who qualify for compassionate release get it.”Prisons are designed to house people in tight quarters, making social distancing impossible, which can cause infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, to spread easily and quickly. While this is concerning for prison populations, broader communities around prisons are also put at risk as correctional officers and medical staff return home from work every day to their families and local communities.Over the course of the pandemic, more than 49,000 people in the federal prison system were infected with COVID-19, and 256 died (as of June 11, 2021). At the same time, nearly 31,000 people sought compassionate release, according to BOP’s response to a letter Senator Schatz wrote requesting data on compassionate release. BOP approved only 36 requests. By contrast, 3,221 people were granted compassionate release by federal judges through the GRACE Act provision of the First Step Act, which streamlined federal compassionate release. In 2020, nearly all of the compassionate release motions were granted by federal judges, according to a recent report from the U.S. Sentencing Commission.The Emergency GRACE Act would:Companion legislation is being introduced in the House of Representatives by U.S. Representative Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.).The Emergency GRACE Act has been endorsed by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL), Due Process Institute, R Street, Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime & Incarceration, Dream Corps JUSTICE, FAMM, National CURE, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, Justice Roundtable, and Community Oriented Correctional Health Services.“Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 400,000 prisoners have contracted the virus, and over 2,500 have died as a result,” said Jillian Snider, Director of Criminal Justice & Civil Liberties Policy at R Street Institute. “Many inmates suffer from various health ailments, making them especially vulnerable to COVID-19 complications. The Emergency GRACE Act creates a smart, safe and effective process that removes some of the challenges currently associated with being granted a compassionate release.""Schatz authored the original bipartisan GRACE Act, which streamlined the compassionate release process.

https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-thune-warnock-kennedy-introduce-new-legislation-to-stop-deceptive-subscription-business-practices,"Bipartisan Bill Would Make it Easier For Consumers Lured In By Free Trials To Cancel Costly SubscriptionsWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i), John Thune (R-S.D.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), and John Kennedy (R-La.) today introduced the Unsubscribe Act. The bipartisan bill would require companies to be more transparent about their subscription-based business model and make it easier for consumers to cancel their subscriptions once their free or reduced price trial period has ended.“The subscription-based business model is exploding, and it’s largely because of the deceptive practices that some companies use to lure and trap in customers. When people sign up for a free trial, they shouldn’t have to jump through hoops just to cancel their subscription before being charged,” said Senator Schatz. “Our bill will require companies to be more transparent about their business model and make it easier for consumers to avoid costly, automatic monthly charges they never intended to make.”“Consumers want to know what they’re signing up for, so the more transparency, the better when it comes to online subscriptions,” said Senator Thune. “In addition to empowering online consumers by providing them with more information, this bill helps ensure they don’t face the unwanted and unexpected fees that can sometimes be incurred.”“We must protect consumers’ dignity and their pockets from deceptive marketing practices that harm their ability to thrive in our economy. I am proud to sponsor this important legislation that will provide more protections and transparency to consumers to help ensure they’re spending their well-earned dollars according to their goals and not wasting their money on deceitful practices,” said Senator Warnock.“Free trials should benefit consumers, not trick them into endless payments for a product they don’t want. This bill would give customers who enter subscription trials a clear, easy way to cancel those subscriptions,” said Senator Kennedy.From news to fashion, music to food, subscriptions are everywhere in today’s economy. An important part of their success has been subscription-based businesses’ utilization of reduced-cost or free entry deals for new customers. Theoretically, this allows customers to sample a product or service at a reduced price before committing themselves to the full cost of the subscription. A common practice is to use “negative option billing,” which means that once the free trial is over, the subscription company automatically switches a customer to a full-cost subscription.Unfortunately, in order to retain customers, some subscription providers rely on deceptive marketing, confusing contracts, and restrictions that make it difficult for customers to cancel their subscriptions. For example, some subscriptions do not notify customers when the free trial has expired or that the customer will start to be charged for the full cost of their subscription. Or they will not allow a customer to cancel their subscription online or by email—even if that is how the customer signed up in the first place. Instead, they require a customer to call in to a busy customer service line or send a cancellation by physical mail. This unduly burdensome process often results in customers paying for products and services they do not want and for which they may not even realize they are being charged.The Unsubscribe Act would:Companion legislation is being introduced in the House of Representatives by U.S. Representatives Mark Takano (D-Calif.), Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), Ed Case (D-Hawai‘i), and Michael San Nicolas (D-Guam).The Schatz-Thune legislation is supported by Consumer Action, Truth in Advertising, and the National Consumer League.“From movies, to clothing, to food, to cosmetics, consumers are being marketed subscription services that are often easy to sign up for but hard to cancel,” said Sally Greenberg, Executive Director of the National Consumers League. “That is why we need common-sense consumer protection legislation like the Unsubscribe Act. The bill will help consumers get the information they need to make an informed buying decision and allow them to easily cancel their subscriptions without getting the runaround.”“With the lure of free trial offers, consumers can unknowingly be duped into a subscription deal that they never agreed to purchase,” said Linda Sherry, Director of National Priorities at Consumer Action. “The Unsubscribe Act of 2021 will protect consumers by mandating that sellers clearly explain contract terms, provide plain notice of free trial expirations and make it simple for consumers to cancel a contract that they do not want.”The full text of the bill is available here.###"

That information needs to be decision-useful to investors: detailed, tied to financial statements, and easily comparable across different companies,” said Senator Schatz. “The SEC has the authority and the obligation to improve market efficiency and reduce systemic risk by mandating climate disclosure.

We must ensure these firms’ stated climate goals are consistent with their actual business activities.”“The market will be a very powerful force for curbing climate change if investors can get the information needed to gauge financial firms’ real levels of exposure to climate risks,” said Senator Whitehouse.  “Improved climate disclosure standards will also help ensure corporations – many of which have great stated policies on climate – are actually walking the walk when it comes to lobbying and investing.”The comment focuses on several specific issues that are important components of a comprehensive climate-related disclosure framework:Full text of the comment letter is available here.###"

The bill includes a provision cosponsored by U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i), which would ban the buying and selling of shark fins in the United States and protect sharks from finning, the brutal practice of slicing fins off of live sharks and throwing the remainder of the animal back into ocean to drown, starve, or die a slow death. Schatz led the effort to include the provision when the bill passed out of the Commerce Committee.“Finning is cruel, and it’s crushing the global shark population, which is critical to our oceans and marine ecosystem,” said Senator Schatz. “I’m glad we were able to move this bill one step closer to becoming law so that we can protect more sharks from this brutal practice.”Specifically, the provision will:Although the United States has banned the practice of shark finning aboard vessels in U.S.-controlled waters, there is no federal ban on the removal and sale of shark fins from a whole shark that has been caught and landed legally under U.S. law. That makes enforcing U.S. law difficult because once a shark fin is detached from the body, it is almost impossible to determine whether the shark was legally caught or the fin lawfully removed. Determination of species is also difficult, which is problematic given that some shark species are threatened with extinction.The bill now heads to the U.S. House of Representatives for consideration.### "

It includes $1.44 million for shelters for people experiencing homelessness, group homes, and other congregate settings. The Hawai‘i State Department of Health will use this funding to hire workers to coordinate resources, develop strategies, and support community partners to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among people experiencing homelessness and residents of congregate settings including group homes and encampments.

The Reforming Disaster Recovery Act would strengthen the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) disaster recovery grants for states, local governments, and tribes. It would also improve coordination at the federal level by establishing an office within HUD that would be devoted to disaster recovery and resilient communities.“Right now, the law mandates that communities in crisis wait for Congress to pass a disaster funding bill before they can even apply for help from HUD. This bill changes the law so they no longer have to wait. As soon as a disaster strikes, HUD can help communities begin the process of recovery,” said Senator Schatz, Chairman of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee.“With natural disasters increasing in frequency and intensity, it is critical that states have the necessary resources to respond in order to protect public safety, property, and our economy,” said Senator Collins, the Ranking Member of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee. “Our bipartisan legislation would allow communities to immediately focus on helping families and local businesses recover instead of navigating the federal bureaucracy in the wake of a natural disaster.”“Our legislation would streamline, reform, and inject greater fiscal responsibility into the broken CDBG Disaster Recovery Program,” said Senator Young. “This is a response to reports from the Government Accountability Office and HUD’s Office of Inspector General recommending Congress permanently codify the program to avoid funding lags and rid duplicative requirements in the wake of a disaster.”“Damage from disasters can be unpredictable, but the process of getting funding for long-term recovery shouldn’t be. Congress has an opportunity to ensure that communities suffering from the long-term effects of disasters can access funding from the CDBG-DR program on a reasonable and predictable timeline.  This bill will fix the haphazard process of allocating funding on a case-by-case basis and give community leaders and residents one less thing to worry about in the aftermath of a disaster,” said Senator Leahy.“Red tape and delays hurts families trying to recover from disaster,” said Senator Cassidy. “This legislation streamlines the process to get communities the resources they need, as soon as possible, to get back on their feet.”The bill addresses long-standing recommendations from the HUD Office of the Inspector General and Government Accountability Office to establish a permanent and predictable funding process.

E-Bikes are increasingly being used as a cheaper, more environmentally-friendly transportation option for short trips and daily commutes that can help break the cycle of fossil fuel use.“We need to do everything we can to transition to a clean energy economy and that includes changing the way we get around. E-Bikes have the potential to help us get there -- we just need to make it easier for people get on board,” said Senator Schatz.A recent study by researchers at Portland State University found that if 15 percent of car trips were made by e-bike, carbon emissions would drop by 12 percent. Another survey also found that 46 percent of e-bike trips replaced car trips, making e-bikes an effective tool to achieve the tandem goals of reducing traffic congestion and carbon emissions. However, the cost of e-bikes remains a barrier to adoption for many—prices range from $800 to $8,000 depending on battery quality and size.

https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-reintroduces-legislation-to-narrow-college-achievement-gaps-support-students-of-color-veterans-disabled-students,"Bill Would Establish Competitive Grant Program for Higher Ed Institutions to Address InequitiesHONOLULU – U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i) reintroduced the College Equity Act, a bill that would give colleges and universities funding to address disparities in higher education recruitment, admissions, and support.“There are schools where veterans, people of color, and people with disabilities are able to thrive, and others where they struggle. The difference often comes down to schools knowing the challenges that exist for students and doing something to help,” Senator Schatz said. “This bill provides federal funding so that the doors of every college and university are open to qualified students from all walks of life – and that these schools can offer the resources students need to graduate on time and make a good living for themselves.” Higher education promises economic mobility for all Americans, but outcomes for today’s college students are far from equal. Severe racial inequalities persist across measures from acceptance, enrollment, and completion rates to post-graduation salaries and student loan debt. Over half of all college students with disabilities do not graduate within eight years. And only half of U.S. students at four-year universities and colleges who received Pell Grants in 2011 graduated within six years.The College Equity Act takes three steps toward addressing these kinds of achievement gaps. First, it provides funding for colleges and universities to examine how institutional practices like admissions policies, financial aid processes, access to campus support services, and faculty diversity contribute to gaps in student outcomes by race and ethnicity, gender, income, ability, transfer status, military and veteran status, and other lines of identity. Second, it creates grants for institutions that have completed these audits to develop and execute improvement plans to address the findings. Finally, the bill increases accountability by sharing the findings of audits with higher education accrediting agencies, which can then provide technical assistance and share best practices across institutions.Individual schools and systems have shown success in closing these achievement gaps. San Diego State University has bucked trends by graduating 76 percent of all student veterans, nearly twice the national average graduation rate, exemplifying the positive impacts of targeted resources and customized support. With over 50 percent of students receiving Pell Grants and a student body of 60 percent people of color, Georgia State University recently increased its graduation rate by over forty percentage points by offering advising, mentoring, and tutoring services; providing emergency grants to support low-income students; and keeping tabs on students who may be at-risk of dropping out.The College Equity Act is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).“If we want to repair deep inequities in our society and make college a more reliable path to economic security, we must provide colleges the opportunity to examine their own practices and recognize where they might unintentionally be harming students of color, student parents, and other groups that too often are not well served by higher education. The College Equity Act would give colleges the tools to recognize where they need to improve and ultimately to serve students and society more effectively,” said Marcella Bombardieri, Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress.“Higher education holds enormous potential to transform individual lives, strengthen our communities, catalyze economic and social mobility, and address persistent inequities in our society. Yet many policies and practices limit this potential and hamstring attainment for today’s students, including students of color, students from low-income backgrounds, transfer students, student parents, and students impacted by the justice system.  The College Equity Act will encourage institutions to interrogate the equity impact of their policies and practices – including in admissions and recruitment, financial aid administration, student support services, and faculty diversity – and take productive steps to ensure equitable access, completion, and post-college success for today’s students and for generations to come,” said Mamie Voight, Interim President and CEO of the Institute for Higher Education Policy.“The College Equity Act provides an opportunity for institutions of higher education to identify equity gaps and correct disparities where they exist. For Latinx students, this is key to improving their outcomes in college enrollment and degree completion, and more importantly, their future success in the workforce,” said Roxanne Garza, Senior Policy Advisor for Education at UnidosUS.The legislation is supported by Center for American Progress, Institute for Higher Education Policy, New America, UnidosUS, Center for Law and Social Policy, and Third Way.The full text of the bill is available here.###"

This will ensure that Hawai‘i families have the support they need as they prepare their young children for school.“It cannot be overstated how important early childhood development programs are to a child’s successful and healthy future, and support for these programs is especially critical after the disruptions caused by the pandemic,” said Senator Schatz, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. “This new funding will help families across Hawai‘i get the support they need so that their kids can thrive in school and in life.”Head Start and Early Head Start programs provide comprehensive early childhood education and development services to low-income children.

The remaining $2.6 million will help Hawai‘i DOH expand capacity in several areas to better fight infectious diseases, including to expand public health support to health care facilities, assist health care workers to prevent infections more effectively, support rapid response to detect and contain infectious disease threats, and expand efforts to design and implement effective infection prevention and control training and education to frontline health care staff, among other activities.In September 2020, as a deadly COVID-19 outbreak at the Yukio Okutsu State Veterans Home in Hilo worsened, Senator Schatz called for immediate federal intervention to contain the spread and help save lives.

https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-reintroduces-legislation-to-remove-barriers-to-higher-education-for-americans-with-criminal-records,"Schatz Bill Would Encourage Colleges, Universities To Remove Criminal History Questions From Admissions ProcessWASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i) reintroduced the Beyond the Box for Higher Education Act, which encourages colleges and universities to remove criminal and juvenile justice questions from their admissions applications by providing guidance and training to schools to change their policies. Most schools currently include these questions in their admissions processes.“Everyone deserves the chance to rebuild their life through higher education, whether they have a criminal record or not,” said Senator Schatz. “This bill pushes colleges and universities to remove criminal history questions from the application process – a barrier that all too often keeps people from heading back to school.”About 70 million Americans have some type of criminal record, which shows up on all routine background checks. These records make it difficult for these Americans to go to college, find a good-paying job, and rebuild their lives. Studies have shown that rejection rates for potential students with convictions can be 12 to 13 percentage points higher than applicants who don’t have these kinds of backgrounds, and many fail to complete their application once they reach the criminal history question.As part of his push to encourage schools to change their processes, Senator Schatz has previously led letters to the “Big Six” higher education associations and the Common Application asking them to remove criminal history questions from their admissions processes. As a result, the Association of American Colleges and Universities and the American Association of Community Colleges urged their members to remove these questions. And beginning in August 2019, the Common Application removed criminal history questions from their form.The original cosponsors of the Beyond the Box for Higher Education Act include U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).Companion legislation in U.S. House of Representatives is being led by U.S. Representative Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.).The bill is supported by Association of American Colleges & Universities, Center for Disability Rights, Checkr Inc., Coalition for Juvenile Justice, College and Community Fellowship, National CURE, Dream Corps JUSTICE, Drug Policy Alliance, The Education Trust, From Prison Cells to PhD, Institute for Higher Education Policy, Jesuit Conference Office of Justice and Ecology, Justice Action Network, Justice & Accountability Center of Louisiana, Juvenile and Capital Advocacy Project, Juvenile Law Center, The Law Enforcement Action Partnership, Louisiana Center for Children’s Rights, Middle Ground Prison Reform, National Association for College Admission Counseling, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, National Association of Social Workers, National Employment Law Project, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, Operation Restoration, Prison Scholar Fund, R Street Institute, Safe Streets & Second Chances, Safer Foundation, Second Chance Education Alliance Inc., Unlock Higher Ed, and Young Invincibles.“This bill is instrumental in ensuring that all individuals have access to higher education, a cornerstone of the American Dream and essential to the strength of our democracy,” said Lynn Pasquerella, President of the Association of American Colleges & Universities.The full text of the bill is available here.###"
https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-lujn-reintroduce-legislation-to-create-public-health-insurance-option-provide-more-people-with-affordable-health-care,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) today reintroduced the State Public Option Act, bicameral legislation to create a Medicaid-based public health insurance option to strengthen the Affordable Care Act by providing Americans with a new high-quality, low-cost choice when purchasing health insurance.“Our bill will open up each state’s Medicaid program to anyone who wants it, giving people a high-quality, low-cost public health insurance option,” said Senator Schatz. “Our ultimate goal here is to make sure that every single American has comprehensive health care coverage.”“Health care is a human right. For communities to thrive, Americans need quality, affordable health care,” said Senator Luján. “A state public option puts us one step closer to universal coverage for all Americans, and I’m honored to re-introduce this legislation alongside Senator Schatz to bolster our health care system.”The State Public Option Act will allow states to create a Medicaid buy-in program for all their residents regardless of income, giving everyone the option to buy into a state-driven Medicaid health insurance plan. At least 18 states are exploring implementing a public option within their legislatures. Medicaid is a popular and cost-effective program with a large provider network. The program has the same positive ratings as private insurance, but provides health coverage at a much lower cost. Based on partnerships between state and federal governments, Medicaid also gives states the flexibility to adapt services and models of care based on their individual needs.Even with the progress of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), more than 30 million people remain uninsured. This legislation will help workers who do not have employer-sponsored coverage but may make too much to qualify for subsidies under the ACA. The bill will also help consumers who live in counties with limited insurance carriers or who worry they may soon have no options for affordable coverage.In the Senate, the Schatz- Luján legislation is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Mazie K.

https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-tillis-cornyn-blumenthal-introduce-new-legislation-to-help-fight-cybercrime-keep-americans-safe,"Bipartisan Bill Improves Data Collection On Cybercrime, Gives Law Enforcement More Tools To Understand, Stop Online CrimesWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) today introduced new legislation to fight cybercrime and help keep Americans safe from online scams. The bipartisan Better Cybercrime Metrics Act will improve data collection on cybercrimes, giving law enforcement and policy makers more tools to understand the size and scope of cybercrime in the United States.“To protect people and fight online crimes, including hacks and scams, we need to understand how often, when, and where it’s happening. Our bipartisan bill will equip us with the data we need to go after criminals and provide more support to victims of cybercrime,” said Senator Schatz. “Cybercrimes have steadily increased in recent years, putting private information, energy dependability, and our national security at risk,” said Senator Tillis. “It’s time for Congress to act on these growing threats by giving law enforcement and policymakers the tools needed to improve data collection and respond to cyber-attacks. I am proud to introduce this commonsense, bipartisan legislation to protect every American from the threat of cybercrimes.”“Texas ranks third in the nation for victims of cybercrime, and many more incidents have gone unreported,” said Senator Cornyn. “This legislation would help us quantify how many cybercrimes are committed and the efficacy of law enforcement’s response to them.”“Cybercriminals prey on the most vulnerable of our society, stealing billions of dollars every year through elaborate scams and frauds. What we do not measure, we cannot fix. By improving reporting on cybercrime, this bill is the first step toward fighting back against a massive scourge afflicting consumers, communities, and our economy,” said Senator Blumenthal.Each year, hundreds of thousands of Americans are targets of cybercrime incidents that cost billions of dollars. Whether done through online scams and fraud, corporate data breaches, or ransomware attacks, the cost of cybercrime has been increasing annually, from $3.5 billion in 2019 to $4.2 billion in 2020, and impacts an estimated 300,000 to 700,000 cybercrime victims each year.Unfortunately, these numbers are likely low, as there are no comprehensive metrics on the scale and impact of cybercrime in the United States, or on law enforcement efforts against them. Only 10 to 12 percent of all estimated cybercrime victims report cybercrime incidents in the United States, while other estimates have put that number much higher.The Better Cybercrime Metrics Act will give law enforcement a clearer picture of online crimes in the United States by requiring the FBI to integrate cybercrime incidents into its current reporting streams to better understand all the types of crime that Americans face. As cybercriminals continue to target vulnerable populations, this data will help lawmakers make an informed case for policy changes to curtail the cybercrime wave, keep Americans safe, and bring these criminals to justice.The Better Cybercrime Metrics Act will:“Increased and improved cybercrime data collection is a necessity,” said Robert Burda, Interim CEO and Chief Strategy Officer of Cybercrime Support Network (CSN). ""By better understanding the size and scope of cybercrime in the United States, our law enforcement officers, policy makers, and CSN will be able to more effectively serve individuals and small businesses impacted by cybercrime.”“Cybercrime is pervasive and pernicious, having a negative impact on individuals and communities throughout the United States. The first step in combating the hard problem of cybercrime, like all hard problems, is having a clear, concise, and consistent understanding of cybercrime among all those impacted and those who will face the problem,” said Glen Gainer, President of the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C). “NW3C appreciates the efforts of Congresswoman Spanberger and Senator Schatz in introducing this bill.”“It is critical that cybercrime is counted in a systematic and complete manner.  Victims of cybercrime, particularly vulnerable victims such as minors, stalking victims, and the elderly, deserve to have those crimes counted and the public deserves to know the nature and extent of cybercrime in our society,” said Eileen M. Decker, Lecturer at USC Gould Law School, a former United States Attorney, and Police Commissioner. “Comprehensive cybercrime data will help ensure robust training and increased resources to law enforcement to investigate cybercrimes, and improved public awareness about the pervasiveness of the cybercrime problem. This bill is an important step to achieving these goals.”The full text of the bill is available here.###"
https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-bills-to-support-native-hawaiian-language-schools-and-programs-unanimously-pass-key-committee,"WASHINGTON – Two bills authored by U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i) to support Native Hawaiian language schools and programs, unanimously passed the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, where Schatz serves as Chairman.“Our bipartisan bills will strengthen federal support for culturally-based Native language education and make sure Native language use in Hawai‘i and across the country continues to grow,” said Chairman Schatz.The pair of bills passed by the Schatz-led committee include the Native American Language Resource Center Act and the Durbin Feeling Native American Languages Act. The first bill will create a designated resource center to support and grow Native language education in Hawai‘i and across the United States, while the Durbin Feeling Native American Languages Act, named after a renowned Cherokee linguist and Vietnam veteran, would help improve federal agencies’ coordination in support of Native American languages.“It is wonderful to receive news from Senator Schatz’s office regarding progress on his bill to establish a Native American Language Resource Center. It has been my honor to testify before Senator Schatz’s Indian Affairs Committee regarding the promise and challenges of Hawaiian language medium education and similar programs in American Indian and Alaska Native languages. As we begin our new school year enrollments are up at our main campus as well as our two satellite campuses. Much remains to be done to support our students, faculty, parents and staff. The establishment of a national resource center will be a crucial step in addressing longstanding unmet needs. I am thankful for the leadership of Senator Schatz and appreciate the years of work it has taken to get the bill this far. I will support all of his efforts to secure enactment of this important bill before the end of the year,” said Dr. Kauanoe Kamanā, Principal of Nāwahīokalaniʻōpuʻu Hawaiian Language Medium Laboratory School.“Over the last four decades the tireless efforts of advocates and educators has led to a resurgence of ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi, the Native Hawaiian language. It’s also allowed us the opportunity to encounter and overcome challenges that other Native language communities will face along their journey of language revitalization. I believe that both S.989 and S.1402 are crucial steps and vital to the progress of Native American language revitalization,” said Ka‘iulani Laehā, Chief Executive Officer of ‘Aha Pūnana Leo.“As a Hawaiian Homesteader serving on a national Native American language education and advocacy entity, I am extremely haʻaheo to have this bill passed by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs under the Chairmanship of Hawaiʻi's Senator Brian Schatz. Last year we celebrated the thirtieth year anniversary of the Native American Languages Act (NALA) enacted into law during the chairmanship of Indian Affairs by Hawaiʻi's Senator Inouye. Now this year, another Senator from Hawaiʻi, Brian Schatz, chairing the same committee, has authored and moved forward the Native American Language Resource Center Act, legislation that will help ensure the policies set forth in NALA will become a reality. I am very proud of Hawaiʻi's role in working to save the Indigenous language heritage of our country,” said Namaka Rawlins, Vice President of the National Coalition of Native American Language Schools and Programs.“Weʻve experienced and benefit from the revitalization of ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi, especially in the development of ʻŌiwi Leadership. Our language cultivates a strong sense of identity and contributes to the health and well-being of our people. Thanks to the leadership of Sen. Schatz, the Native American Language Resource Center Act will support the efforts of our community to perpetuate many other Indigenous and Native American communities to preserve their languages which draws upon the strength of their indigenous culture and knowledge to meet the challenges that lie ahead,” said Jack Wong, Chief Executive Officer of Kamehameha Schools.“While there is a broad range of national centers for foreign languages, there is no similar Native American language center accessible to all tribes and Native peoples of our country. Having had the privilege to work in and around indigenous media for the last decade amplifying Native voices and stories throughout the United States and the world, I am keenly aware of the groundswell movement to reverse the loss of our precious languages from our homes and communities. This new national center will be crucial to meeting the needs of grassroots community Native American language movements well into the future,” said Amy Kalili, Host, Producer and Co-Founder of ʻŌiwi Television Network.“The Office of Hawaiian Affairs applauds Chairman Brian Schatz and Vice Chair Lisa Murkowski for their leadership to pass the Native American Language Resource Center Act out of Senate Committee on Indian Affairs today—in furtherance of the federal trust responsibility to Native Hawaiians and our Native cousins across the country,” said Carmen Hulu Lindsey, Chair of the Board of Trustees at the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. “The Hawaiian language movement is widely recognized as the largest language revitalization effort in the United States. While there are several national centers focused on supporting foreign languages, no such national center currently exists for the Native languages of the United States. These centers will build off the decades of hard work put in by Native language advocates by providing technical assistance to schools and communities; collecting and sharing best practices in Native language education and revitalization; and addressing historical discrimination and inequities faced by Native peoples—and they will support the Hawaiian language. Mahalo nui loa iā ʻoe e ke Kenekoa Schatz. We urge the rest of Congress to act swiftly on full passage of this bill.“Today’s bi-partisan passage of S.989—the Native American Language Resource Center Act and S.1402—the Durban Feeling Native American Languages Act by the Senate Committee of Indian Affairs represent critical, long-awaited legislation to support the native peoples of this country. Congress will have two powerful opportunities to amend this country’s intentional denial and suppression of American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. As sovereign peoples, these acts advance our efforts to revive and renormalize our mother languages, cultural practices, and genealogical connections to all things sacred while ensuring that our future generations will continue to thrive,” Dr. Walter Kahumoku III, Co-Director of the World Indigenous Nations Higher Education Consortium Accreditation.“Native American languages are a national treasure, and yet far too many are endangered and close to extinction. The Native American Language Resource Center will support the efforts of Native American communities to protect and revitalize the languages of their ancestors. We are most appreciative of Senator Schatz's effort to support all Native American languages and want to thank him for his bill and for all of his efforts to ensure that our precious Hawaiian language lives on and is spoken by Native Hawaiian children and families now and forever,” said Dr. Keiki Kawaiʻaeʻa, Chair of the Hawaiian Language Renormalization Committee.“The Office of Hawaiian Education (OHE) is excited by the news that the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs has passed two bipartisan bills that will provide supports for strengthening Native Language revitalization efforts across the nation. We especially appreciate the leadership of Senator Schatz and other Senators who acted in a unified manner to support the establishment of a Native American Language Resource Center. The Hawaiian Language Immersion program is in its 34th year of existence within the Hawaiʻi Department of Education and continues its expansion in School Year 21-22 by adding an additional elementary site on the island of Lānaʻi and an additional secondary site in the Koʻolaupoko district at Kailua High School. OHE looks forward to engaging in educational discourse with our indigenous brothers and sisters across the continent and sharing in the benefits of this resource center to continue to build on best practices, policies, programming and projects that work towards the normalization of languages indigenous to the United States of America,” said Kaui Sang, Director of the Office of Hawaiian Education at the Hawai‘i Department of Education."

She has an incredible combination of speed and power in the water, and a remarkable humility she carries herself with everywhere she goes. She’s an intense competitor who wants to win every event she enters, but also one who wants to see her opponents – and more importantly the sport of surfing itself – succeed,” Senator Schatz said on the Senate floor. “Today, we honor Duke and the incredible legacy he left.

My bill will make it safer for everyone to use our streets – whether it’s on foot or on a bike,” said Senator Schatz, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Housing and Transportation.In just a decade, the number of pedestrians killed by vehicles nationally rose by roughly 50 percent. And for cyclists, the death rate also remains high, with more than 800 people killed while riding a bike in 2019 alone.

Once signed into law, the cost-of-living adjustment for veterans would go into effect on December 1, 2021.The veterans’ COLA is usually, but not automatically, enacted each year and is already anticipated in the Congressional Budget Office’s baseline, which means this bill is budget-neutral and will provide disabled veterans additional certainty from year to year.###"
https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-reintroduces-legislation-to-promote-educational-opportunities-for-incarcerated-americans,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i) reintroduced legislation to expand access to education for Americans in federal prisons. The Promoting Reentry through Education in Prisons (PREP) Act would create an office within the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) focused on correctional education and fund a new program to address the lack of educational opportunities currently offered. “Research shows that one of the best ways to break the cycle of recidivism is through education,” said Senator Schatz. “This bill would make it easier for people in the federal prison system to pursue a better life through learning, in turn improving our public safety and saving taxpayers’ money.”Education programs in prison can dramatically help formerly incarcerated individuals by providing the tools to rebuild their lives, while at the same time lowering correctional spending. These programs also have a clear public safety benefit, reducing recidivism rates by over 43 percent. People in federal prisons, however, do not have access to consistent or adequate education opportunities, and the BOP lacks resources needed to administer such programs.The PREP Act would address this by establishing both an Office of Prison Education within the BOP to standardize educational programs across all federal prisons and a new program focused on partnerships between federal prisons and local education providers. It would also provide training and resources for state and local prisons to use in their own education programs. Additionally, it would create a centralized hub for research, policies, and best practices on correctional education. Finally, the bill would ensure that eligible veterans in prison are notified of their ability to access their education benefits and are connected with available education programs in their federal or state correctional facility.“It’s in everyone’s interest that when people re-enter society, they do so with the skills they need to build decent futures for themselves and their families,” Representative Dean said.  “Educational opportunities make all the difference in helping to break the cycle of recidivism and reincarceration – and create more positive outcomes for all.”In the Senate, this legislation is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). Companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives has been introduced by U.S. Representative Madeline Dean (D-Pa.).“The value of prison education cannot be underestimated. As corrections leaders, we know the impact it has on people and how it can transform their lives for the better,” said Anne Precythe, President of the Correctional Leaders Association (CLA) and Director of Corrections for Missouri.The PREP Act is supported by the Correctional Leaders Association, Institute for Higher Education Policy (IHEP), Dream Corps JUSTICE, FAMM, NAACP, The Law Enforcement Action Partnership (LEAP), National CURE, College and Community Fellowship, Center for Disability Rights, Operation Restoration, Second Chance Education Alliance Inc., Prison Scholar Fund, and Record Clearance Project of SJSU.The full text of the bill can be found here.###"

We also encourage you to place a stronger focus on development of and access to COVID-19 diagnostics and treatments and strengthening health systems worldwide,” the bipartisan group of senators wrote. “We were encouraged by the recent steps that the United States has taken to increase global vaccine access, including the recent convening of the Global COVID-19 Summit and the commitment to achieving 70 percent global vaccination by September next year. However, more significant U.S. leadership, urgency, and accountability is essential for a more effective global response to the pandemic.”The full text of the bipartisan letter is available here and can be found below:Dear President Biden:The COVID-19 pandemic has been devastating for the United States and for the world, with over 242 million cases and 4.9 million deaths worldwide. The COVID-19 vaccines currently approved and authorized are remarkably effective and are a crucial tool to ending the pandemic. Thanks to the important work done by Operation Warp Speed, and now continued by the White House COVID-19 Response Team, important progress has been made to make vaccines more widely available. However, we are deeply concerned about the inequitable access to these vaccines and other essential supplies across the world and what that means for more avoidable infections, deaths, disruption to the global economy, and the risk of new variants. We urge you in the strongest possible terms to do more to lead global efforts to end this pandemic and increase global vaccine access. We also encourage you to place a stronger focus on development of and access to COVID-19 diagnostics and treatments and strengthening health systems worldwide. We were encouraged by the recent steps that the United States has taken to increase global vaccine access, including the recent convening of the Global COVID-19 Summit and the commitment to achieving 70 percent global vaccination by September next year. However, more significant U.S. leadership, urgency, and accountability is essential for a more effective global response to the pandemic.The Administration’s commitment to buying 500 million more doses and sharing with our international partners is to be commended. This brings the total number of doses the U.S. has pledged to donate to 1.1 billion, representing the most donated internationally. However, we are concerned that to date, just 200 million of those promised doses have actually been shipped to countries in need. At the recent summit, the United States also led efforts to develop targets for global vaccinations, urged vaccine manufacturers to enhance transparency on the supply and distribution of vaccines, and called for the expansion of global and regional production of COVID-19 vaccines. These are positive steps, but the United States should immediately take additional action to ensure these targets are met, and provide more leadership in global efforts to combat the virus. These steps should include the development of a specific plan to achieve the global vaccination targets and achieving transparency from vaccine manufacturers without any further delay so that other countries and COVAX can prepare for vaccine deliveries and distribution. We also encourage you to consider designating somebody in the White House to coordinate global COVID-19 response efforts. White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients has helped to coordinate efforts to respond to the virus domestically, and your efforts to expand access to vaccines abroad would be well served by having a separate global COVID-19 point person in the White House.As efforts and discussions between the United States, other countries, and other involved organizations at the United Nations continue, we request that the COVID-19 Response Team provide additional information to Congress on how the United States will continue to respond to increase vaccine availability globally: Previously, the United States has been a leader in efforts to combat other diseases, including the HIV/AIDs epidemic. The U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief was the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease and to this day continues to save millions of lives worldwide. It is imperative that the United States steps up similarly in the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure the safety of not only its own citizens but citizens of the world. We would welcome the opportunity to discuss the urgent need to accelerate the Administration’s efforts to address COVID-19 on a global scale in person with your staff. We look forward to receiving answers to the questions listed above and the chance to discuss next steps with the head of the COVID-19 Response Team, Mr. Zients, and others, in the coming weeks.Sincerely,###"
https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-introduces-new-legislation-to-keep-workers-safe-hold-companies-accountable-for-workplace-violations,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i) and U.S. Representative Andy Levin (D-Mich.) introduced new legislation to keep workers safe by requiring the publication of workplace violations. The Keeping Workers Safe Act directs the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to announce major violations by companies and distribute them to local media and related labor and trade organizations, a practice which has been shown to boost workplace safety.“We need to do all that we can to protect American workers on the job,” said Senator Schatz. “Publicizing workplace violations holds companies accountable and leads to a safer work environment for everyone. Our bill will help standardize this practice, keep workers safe and healthy, and strengthen our economy.”A recent Duke University study found that one OSHA press release on a major violation resulted in the equivalent compliance measures of 210 inspections. Based on the number of serious violations found each year, the effectiveness of OSHA inspections could be doubled by mandating these notices. The study, which appeared in the American Economic Review, examined OHSA releases sent to local newspapers, finding a direct association between their being issued and improved workplace compliance. It has been estimated that workplace injuries cost $2.5 billion annually.“As our country continues to tackle this once in a lifetime public health crisis, the Keeping Workers Safe Act will ensure workers aren’t forced to risk their lives for paychecks and hold employers accountable for dangerous working conditions,” said Representative Levin. “After years as a union organizer and a workforce policy administrator, I know how important it is to empower OSHA and workers across the country, and this commonsense bill does exactly that.”The Keeping Workers Safe Act would amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to require the OSHA Administrator to publicly disclose civil penalties greater than $60,000 or multiple serious or repeated violations within seven days of a citation being issued. It would require these disclosures to be submitted to relevant regional and local newspapers, trade or industry organizations, labor organizations, and state and local government entities in the region where the employer is located.“As we have seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, corporations that break federal health and safety laws endanger workers’ lives and risk the wellbeing of local communities. Yet, from meatpacking and manufacturing to construction and healthcare, serious violations of workplace laws are far too frequent in many sectors and communities. By publicizing government actions against the worst violators of workplace health and safety protections, the Keeping Workers Safe Act promises to improve overall compliance with these laws; encourage workers to come forward to report violations; and put employers on notice that our government does not tolerate lawbreaking,” said Karla Walter, Senior Director of Employment Policy at the Center for American Progress.In the Senate, this legislation is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.).The Keeping Workers Safe Act is supported by the National Employment Law Project, the Center for American Progress, UNITE HERE, and Teamsters.The full text of the bill is available here.###"
https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-nadler-reintroduce-legislation-to-eliminate-excessive-court-fines-and-fees-that-target-low-income-communities,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i) reintroduced the State Justice Improvement Act, legislation that will make lasting changes to America’s criminal justice system. Across the country, courts often impose fines and fees without considering an individual’s ability to pay – disproportionately impacting low income communities and communities of color. This legislation provides state and local courts with new and expanded federal funding opportunities to reform these monetary punishment policies. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.“All Americans deserve equal treatment under the law, no matter how much money is in their bank accounts,” said Senator Schatz. “Our bill will help to end the cycle of poverty and incarceration, creating a justice system that treats people fairly and keeps our communities safe.”“All Americans, regardless of their socioeconomic status, deserve equal access to our nation’s criminal justice system,” said Chairman Nadler. “Sadly, numerous courts across the nation impose excessive fees and fines which have failed to improve public safety, and instead have placed an undue burden on low-income communities and communities of color. Our legislation will help address these injustices so that we take a step toward bringing an end to the poverty to prison pipeline, and restore public trust in our criminal justice system.”According to available state data, the national court-related debt total is at least $26.7 billion. Excessive court fines and fees disproportionately burden low income communities and communities of color. Individuals who are unable to pay face serious consequences, including more fees, license suspensions, extended probation, and incarceration – trapping people in the criminal justice system. As a result, they can lose their jobs, their homes, and even their children. In the 50 cities with the highest proportion of revenues from fines, the median size of the African American population in each city was greater than five times the median in the United States.In addition, the practice can be both costly and inefficient for cities and counties. Some counties in Texas and New Mexico, for example spend an average of 41 cents to collect every dollar of revenue raised from fines and fees. Moreover, there is no clear evidence that supports imposing fines and fees as a crime deterrent. In a survey across counties in Alabama, nearly 40 percent of individuals committed a crime to pay off their court debt.The State Justice Improvement Act is a meaningful step forward in creating a justice system that treats individuals fairly and ensures public safety. The legislation will help jurisdictions enforce constitutional and equitable policies by broadening the activities available for federal funding. The grants will be used to provide technical assistance and training to state and local courts as they develop effective alternatives to fines and fees, should a person be deemed unable to pay, as well driver’s license suspensions. The bill also requires the State Justice Institute to conduct a study on the effectiveness of these grants and to provide a report to Congress with appropriate policy recommendations.In the Senate, Schatz’s legislation is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).  The bill has been endorsed by the American Bar Association, Brennan Center for Justice, Business Roundtable, Dream Corps JUSTICE, Fines and Fees Justice Center, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, National Consumer Law Center (on behalf of its low-income clients), National Legal Aid and Defender Association, Operation Restoration – Safety and Freedom Fund, R Street Institute, and The Law Enforcement Action Partnership.“Now more than ever, courts must scrutinize those practices that disproportionately impact low-income communities and people of color, including the imposition of fines and fees. Hawai‘i courts have been carefully considering these issues over the years and are working to improve the current system. This bill would provide the support states need to make positive systemic changes and promote the equitable administration of justice. We are grateful to Senator Schatz for his commitment to this issue, and we thank the State Justice Institute for their ongoing efforts to improve the quality of justice in state courts,” said the Honorable Mark E. Recktenwald, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hawai‘i.“We are encouraged by the proposed amendment to the State Justice Improvement Act to improve the constitutional and equitable enforcement of fines and fees, as well as improve the practices and ensuring their equitable use. In 2017, the Commission’s Targeted Fines and Fees against Communities of Color report found that municipal ordinance violations disproportionately impacted poor communities and communities of color. The Commission made several recommendations to address those discrepancies, and we are pleased to see that several have been incorporated into this amendment.  The proposed amendment recognizes an injustice and aims to fix it. It gives us hope that we are on a path to narrow the inequitable impact that municipal fines and fees have on poor communities, and communities of color. And by communities, we mean the people who live in them.  Justice in any democratic society is measured not solely by how the rich and powerful fair but rather on how the law treats those without those statuses,” said Debo P. Adegbile, Commissioner at the United States Commission on Civil Rights.The full text of the bill is available here.###"

The funding was made possible by the NATIVE Act, a law authored by Senator Schatz to integrate native tourism, empower native communities, and expand unique cultural tourism opportunities across the country.“This new funding will give local organizations more resources to preserve and share Native Hawaiian culture,” said Senator Schatz, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. “Native Hawaiian culture and traditions are foundational to who we are as a place and a people, and every visitor should understand that.”The new funding from the NATIVE Act will go towards improving visitor experiences at a National Park through the development of interpretive materials regarding Native Hawaiian place names, and traditional land forms and divisions; and to support other partner organizations in applying historic preservation skills and knowledge so that their traditional cultural places and stories are documented, preserved, and shared.###"
https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-brown-senators-to-zuckerberg-facebook-cannot-be-trusted-to-manage-cryptocurrency-stop-launch-of-diem-novi-immediately,"Senators Previously Warned Payment Providers of Risks Associated With Libra AssociationWASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i), Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), and U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Tina Smith (D-Minn.) voiced their opposition to Facebook’s revived effort to launch a cryptocurrency (“Diem”) and digital wallet (“Novi”). In light of yet another scandal involving Facebook’s failure to protect its users, the senators urged Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to immediately discontinue the company’s pilot of Novi, announced this morning, and to commit not to bring Diem to market.“Facebook is once again pursuing digital currency plans on an aggressive timeline and has already launched a pilot for a payments infrastructure network, even though these plans are incompatible with the actual financial regulatory landscape—not only for Diem specifically, but also for stablecoins in general,” the senators wrote in their letter to Zuckerberg. “Unfortunately, Facebook’s decision to pursue a digital currency and payments network is just one more example of the company ‘moving fast and breaking things’ (and in too many cases, misleading Congress in order to do so). Facebook cannot be trusted to manage a payment system or digital currency when its existing ability to manage risks and keep consumers safe has proven wholly insufficient.”In October 2019, Senators Schatz and Brown wrote to members of the Diem Association’s predecessor, the Libra Association, and expressed deep concerns about the risks the project posed to consumers and the financial system. Facebook subsequently shelved Libra amid regulatory scrutiny, but the company has now revived its efforts under new branding.The full text of the letter is available here and can be found below:Dear Mr. Zuckerberg:Policymakers are once again facing a scandal involving reports about Facebook’s relentless pursuit of profits at the expense of its users. The most recent allegations detail Facebook’s knowing use of algorithms that harm adolescents and teens, particularly girls. Facebook has repeatedly shown itself indifferent to the harms its products cause.Given the scope of the scandals surrounding your company, we write to voice our strongest opposition to Facebook’s revived effort to launch a cryptocurrency and digital wallet, now branded “Diem” and “Novi,” respectively. In October 2019, Senators Schatz and Brown wrote to members of the Diem Association’s predecessor, the Libra Association, and expressed deep concerns about the risks the project posed to consumers and the financial system. Facebook subsequently shelved Libra amid regulatory scrutiny, but you did not address our concerns before resuming this endeavor.On multiple occasions, Facebook has committed not to launch a digital currency absent federal financial regulators’ approval. In prepared remarks before the House Financial Services Committee in October 2019, you said that Facebook would “not be a part of launching the Libra payments system anywhere in the world unless all U.S. regulators approve it.” More recently, David Marcus, the executive overseeing Facebook’s digital currency efforts, said, “[w]e are definitely not going to launch without the proper regulatory framework.”Despite these assurances, Facebook is once again pursuing digital currency plans on an aggressive timeline and has already launched a pilot for a payments infrastructure network, even though these plans are incompatible with the actual financial regulatory landscape—not only for Diem specifically, but also for stablecoins in general. The agencies that oversee the U.S. financial system are studying the risks that stablecoins pose to financial stability. Accordingly, they are considering how to address these inherent risks and clarify regulation and supervision of these products. As Federal Reserve Chair Powell said of stablecoins at a July 2021 Senate Banking and Housing Committee hearing, “They’re like money funds, they’re like bank deposits and they’re growing incredibly fast but without appropriate regulation.” Acting Comptroller of the Currency Hsu recently likened stablecoins to the wholesale funding markets whose collapse precipitated the 2008 financial crisis: “In terms of ‘known knowns,’ a run on a large stablecoin could be highly destabilizing.” Mr. Marcus has cited Facebook’s success in securing “licenses or approvals for Novi in nearly every state,” and concluded that “Novi is ready to come to market.” To be clear, your ability to secure state-issued money transmitter licenses is not equivalent to obtaining the blessing of “all U.S. regulators,” as you said in your testimony two years ago.In addition to the risks products like Diem pose to financial stability, you have not offered a satisfactory explanation for how Diem will prevent illicit financial flows and other criminal activity. The intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force warned in a report to the G-20 finance ministers that stablecoins’ “propensity for mass-adoption makes them more vulnerable to be used by criminals and terrorists to launder their proceeds of crime and finance their terrorist activities.” The President’s Working Group on Financial Markets said in December 2020 that stablecoins “are likely to attract illicit actors and, without appropriate mitigation measures, allow evasion of key public policy objectives.”Unfortunately, Facebook’s decision to pursue a digital currency and payments network is just one more example of the company “moving fast and breaking things” (and in too many cases, misleading Congress in order to do so). Time and again, Facebook has made conscious business decisions to continue with actions that have harmed its users and the broader society. Facebook cannot be trusted to manage a payment system or digital currency when its existing ability to manage risks and keep consumers safe has proven wholly insufficient.We urge you to immediately discontinue your Novi pilot and to commit that you will not bring Diem to market.###"
