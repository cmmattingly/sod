https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/after-hurricane-fiona-gillibrand-calls-for-billions-in-comprehensive-federal-relief-for-puerto-rico-,"A week after Hurricane Fiona devastated Puerto Rico, leaving at least 16 people dead and hundreds of thousands more without power or running water, today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand stood in Midtown Manhattan to call for billions in federal economic relief for the island. Gillibrand is urging congressional leadership to provide emergency supplemental funding for disaster recovery and relief support as well as $1 billion in nutritional aid for Puerto Rico. She is also asking the Biden administration to provide robust humanitarian aid and disaster relief for the Dominican Republic and other Caribbean nations impacted by Hurricane Fiona. Gillibrand was joined in Midtown by U.S. Representatives Nydia Velázquez and Gregory Meeks and President and CEO of the Hispanic Federation Frankie Miranda.“Over the past few years, Puerto Rico has faced crisis after crisis,” said Senator Gillibrand. “In 2017, Hurricane Maria killed thousands of people and flattened entire neighborhoods. Supply chain disruptions from COVID and rising prices have left too many Puerto Ricans without enough to eat. And now, even before the island had a chance to recover from the last hurricane, Puerto Rico is again facing devastating flooding and crippling damage to its critical infrastructure. I’m urging Congress and the Biden administration to provide both immediate humanitarian relief and funding for long-term investments in the resiliency of Puerto Rico’s electrical grid and other key infrastructure. This is an emergency and we must act now to help Puerto Ricans begin the long road to recovery.” “The people of Puerto Rico are American citizens who are suffering from the cruel timing of a catastrophic hurricane exactly five years after Hurricane Maria decimated Puerto Rico’s infrastructure and caused massive migration off the island,” said Representative Nydia Velázquez, Chair of House Small Business Committee (NY-7). “To help Puerto Rico recover from Fiona, the federal government must step up to aid the over one million people struggling to secure power, shelter, and access to food. In this letter, we are requesting immediate federal aid including $1 billion in nutritional assistance alongside a comprehensive disaster relief supplemental bill to go to Puerto Rico. Together, these and other immediate relief measures can bring hope and light amongst the darkness and suffering.”“Hurricane Fiona has left a trail of devastation in its wake, pummeling infrastructure, destroying homes and businesses, and leaving families still without power. I’m proud to work with Senator Gillibrand on delivering urgent relief to Puerto Rico, including nutrition assistance and other necessary disaster funds,” said Representative Gregory Meeks, Chair of House Foreign Affairs Committee (NY-5). “As Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I’m focused on ensuring U.S. humanitarian assistance will reach our neighbors impacted by Fiona, including the Dominican Republic and other Caribbean islands. As climate change increases both the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, the US must be prepared to act swiftly in delivering aid to our states and territories, and neighbors in the hemisphere.”“Following Hurricane Fiona, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic need support to recover from the devastation. New Yorkers will continue to be there every step along the way,” said Representative Adriano Espaillat, Member of House Appropriations Committee (NY-13).  “I commend Senator Gillibrand for her ongoing efforts to keep Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic at the forefront of discussions to reaffirm our commitment to uplifting the Caribbean at a time where disaster relief efforts are critical to the livelihood of residents on both islands. I remain dedicated to working with my congressional colleagues and our brothers and sisters in the Caribbean to help repair and rebuild during this critical time.”“The exclusion of Puerto Rico from SNAP and other essential federal programs like SSI that support our nation’s most vulnerable, continues to affect the economic stability and progress of children, families, and individuals residing on the island,” said Frankie Miranda, president and CEO of Hispanic Federation. “We are grateful to Senator Gillibrand and other leaders for recognizing the detrimental impact of these longstanding and systemic disparities, particularly when Puerto Rico is now facing devastating damage from Hurricane Fiona. Since Hurricane Maria, the Hispanic Federation has been working on the ground and in Washington D.C. to rebuild a more resilient Puerto Rico. We know how critical the emergency appropriations request of $1 billion for nutrition aid is to combat hunger and food insecurity given so many losses to families on the island.  In addition, our brothers and sisters in the Dominican Republic were deeply affected by Hurricane Fiona and we urge Congress to also respond with aid to our sister country.”“For over 40 years, Puerto Rico’s children, elderly and families have been deeply hurt by their exclusion from the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).  Legislating Puerto Rico into a capped federal block grant in 1981 resulted in chronic underfunding and a loss of billions of dollars to fight food insecurity,” said Lillian Rodriguez Lopez, Director of Coalition for Food Security. “With Hurricane Fiona creating catastrophic damage like Hurricane Maria before her, Puerto Rico has no access to USDA’s disaster SNAP, a federal program with immediate access to emergency nutrition aid.  Senator Gillibrand and other leaders in Congress are calling for Puerto Rico to immediately receive $1B in emergency nutrition aid and to remedy the inequity and disparities for American citizens residing on the island by introducing a bill to include Puerto Rico in SNAP.” Since Fiona made landfall in Puerto Rico on September 18, 2022, mudslides, floods, fallen trees, and power outages have devastated the island and left hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans without power, food, or water. The island is in dire need of robust immediate and long-term assistance in order to recover from Fiona and to upgrade its infrastructure to be resilient against future hurricanes. In her letter to congressional leadership, Gillibrand is urging Congress to: The letter was also signed by Senators Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Martin Heinrich (D-NM).The full text of Senator Gillibrand’s letter to congressional leadership is available here.Gillibrand is also calling for robust humanitarian assistance for the Dominican Republic, Turks and Caicos, Guadeloupe, and other Caribbean nations impacted by Hurricane Fiona. At least 2 Dominicans have died from the storm, at least 12,000 Dominicans have been forced from their homes, and at least 700,000 Dominicans were left without power. Gillibrand is urging the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to rapidly provide food, water, shelter, health care, emergency telecommunications services, utility services, and all other relevant forms of aid to the Dominican Republic and its neighbors.The bicameral letter was also signed by Representatives Gregory Meeks (D-NY-5) and Adriano Espaillat (D-NY-13).The full text of Senator Gillibrand’s letter to Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development Samantha Power is available here."
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/following-devastating-flooding-in-pakistan-gillibrand-calls-on-president-biden-to-grant-temporary-protected-status-to-pakistani-nationals,"Following unprecedented flooding that has left one-third of Pakistan underwater and affected approximately 33 million people, today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand led 11 of her Senate colleagues in writing a letter calling on President Biden to grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Pakistani nationals currently residing in the United States. Implementing TPS would allow Pakistani nationals to remain in the U.S. until Pakistan recovers from this environmental disaster. The ongoing crisis has left many regions of the country uninhabitable and unsafe, caused at least an estimated $10 billion in damage, and contaminated the water supply, spreading an array of waterborne illnesses, including diarrhea, malaria, acute respiratory infections, skin and eye infections, and typhoid. In addition to Senator Gillibrand, the letter to President Biden was also signed by Senators Patty Murray (D-WA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Mark Warner (D-VA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Bob Casey (D-PA), and Tina Smith (D-MN). “Granting TPS to Pakistani nationals in need is a small but consequential step that the United States can take to immediately reduce the human suffering caused by this natural disaster and would reaffirm our stance as a global leader committed to humanitarian relief efforts and protections,” wrote the senators. “Should Pakistan officially request TPS designation given the current conditions the country is facing, we urge the Biden administration to prioritize such a request while continuing to monitor ongoing developments and deliberate on the best way to aid the Pakistani community.” This action is supported by the National Immigration Forum, Asian American Federation (AAF), the Climate Justice Collaborative at the National Partnership for New Americans, Communities United for Status and Protection (CUSP), and South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT).The full text of the letter is available here or below:  Dear President Biden: We write to respectfully urge your Administration to consider designating the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Unprecedented flooding in Pakistan is currently impacting approximately 33 million people and has killed more than 1,500 people, including 536 children. Given the severity of this crisis, the United States must ensure that Pakistani nationals present in the United States are not forced to return to conditions that could imperil their lives. Current conditions in Pakistan represent an ongoing environmental disaster – one of the statutory bases for TPS designation. Extreme flooding has left most regions of the country uninhabitable and unsafe. According to data from the European Space Agency, approximately one-third of Pakistan is underwater. The Indus River is exceeding its capacity, which has led officials to evacuate entire villages in hopes of mitigating further disaster. Half of Pakistan’s municipal districts have declared a “state of calamity” and the country’s National Disaster Management Authority estimates that one in seven Pakistanis has been affected. According to Pakistan’s finance minister, the damage is likely to exceed $10 billion, which is equivalent to 4 percent of the country’s annual gross domestic product.Even as Pakistanis are reeling from the physical destruction caused by the flooding, they are also facing the spread of waterborne illness that this environmental crisis has exacerbated. Tens of thousands have been stricken by diarrhea, malaria, acute respiratory infections (ARI), skin and eye infections, typhoid, and other health issues resulting from contamination of the water supply. While we applaud your Administration’s decision to provide a much needed $30 million in humanitarian assistance and dispatch a USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team, further action is needed to mitigate the harmful effects of this crisis.Forcing Pakistanis to return to a country that is experiencing what U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has called a relentless impact of “epochal” levels of rain and flooding would be a grievous obstruction to relief efforts. It would also risk fueling further displacement, destabilizing the region, and undermining key U.S. national security interests.8 The use and implementation of TPS as a humanitarian tool would provide necessary relief to individuals that are unable to return to their country due to the extraordinary environmental and public health conditions.  Additionally, designating Pakistan for TPS would also contribute to your Administration’s multi-pronged disaster response. It would decrease the strain on Pakistani infrastructure and provide a safe haven for those who cannot return to their homes or whose homes have been destroyed. Should Pakistan officially request TPS designation given the current conditions that the country is facing, we urge you to prioritize such a request and take it into serious consideration while you continue to monitor ongoing developments and deliberate on the best way to aid the Pakistani community. TPS is a small but consequential step that the United States can take to immediately reduce the human suffering caused by this natural disaster and would reaffirm our stance as a global leader committed to humanitarian relief efforts and protections.Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to your timely reply."
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/on-national-voter-registration-day-gillibrand-calls-for-legislation-to-make-registering-to-vote-easier-for-all-americans,"On National Voter Registration Day, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand is calling for two pieces of legislation that would make it easier for Americans to register to vote and to know their registration status. The Same Day Voter Registration Act would require states to offer same-day registration at polling locations on Election Day and during early voting. The Stop Automatically Voiding Eligible Voters Off Their Enlisted Rolls in States (SAVE VOTERS) Act would prohibit states from removing people from their voting rolls unless the state has obtained objective, reliable evidence that a voter is ineligible to vote and establishes notification requirements once a voter is removed. These bills were introduced and led by Senator Klobuchar (D-MN) and included as part of the Freedom to Vote Act, voting rights legislation supported by all Democratic senators.“As states continue to create new barriers to the ballot box, Congress needs to do much more to protect disenfranchised voters and their sacred right to vote. These two essential pieces of legislation would take much-needed steps to strengthen the integrity of our elections and ensure that voting is equal, fair, and accessible for all Americans,” said Senator Gillibrand. “As the leader of the Voter Empowerment Act, I am firmly committed to continuing the great work of the late Congressman John Lewis to make voting rights the highest priority and to ensure no person in our nation is discriminated against at the ballot box.”  The Same Day Voter Registration Act would: Along with Senator Gillibrand, the Same Day Voter Registration Act is cosponsored by Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR), Ed Markey (D-MA), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Angus King (I-ME), and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA).The SAVE VOTERS Act would:Along with Senator Gillibrand, the Save Voters Act is cosponsored by Senators Wyden, Markey, Merkley, Warren, Casey, Smith, Van Hollen, Blumenthal, Sanders, Hirono, Booker, Murphy, Kaine, Menendez, and King.Both bills are endorsed by Democracy 21, Transparency International U.S., End Citizens United/Let America Vote Action Fund, Common Cause, Public Citizen, People for the American Way, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, 20/20 Vision DC, Voices for Progress, and League of Women Voters.Senator Gillibrand is a champion of voting rights in the Senate. Following the passing of civil rights icon Congressman John Lewis, U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Reverend Raphael Warnock, and U.S. House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn and Congresswoman Nikema Williams announced the reintroduction of the bicameral Voter Empowerment Act, legislation originally authored by Lewis. This legislation would help protect the voting rights of people across the country by ensuring equal access to the ballot for every eligible voter, modernizing voter registration, and helping to eliminate deceptive practices that deter people from voting. The Voter Empowerment Act is a cornerstone of the For the People Act, a transformational voting rights, anti-corruption and clean elections reform package."
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/icymi-a-leader-in-digital-asset-regulation-efforts-senator-kirsten-gillibrand-questions-experts-during-hearing-on-digital-commodities,"In case you missed it, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand questioned leading experts during last week’s Senate Agriculture Committee hearing on digital commodities and protection for consumers in the ongoing evolution of the digital assets market. Senator Gillibrand is leading the effort to regulate digital assets in Congress and authored the bipartisan Responsible Financial Innovation Act with Senator Lummis (R-WY). This landmark bill would create a complete regulatory framework for digital assets that encourages responsible financial innovation, flexibility, transparency and robust consumer protections while integrating digital assets into existing law. To date, the Lummis-Gillibrand bill is the most substantial and comprehensive bipartisan effort to provide certainty and clarity to the growing digital asset and blockchain industries. For the full clip and transcript of Senator Gillibrand’s questioning, please click here and read below: U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s Q&A with CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam: U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand: Chairman Behnam, thank you so much for your leadership on this issue. Thank you for being willing to work with this committee, for you being willing to work with me on my legislation as well. This bill that we are looking at, I think, can be transformational. I think it is timely, I think it is urgent, I think it is necessary to create stability in a market that is growing. And I talk to a lot of colleagues about cryptocurrency, blockchain, Web3 and they say, ""Well, is this going to go away?"" It's here for good, it's part of the world economic community. And the question that we have as a committee right now is, are we going to be a part of the solution or are we not? And what is needed so much right now are rules of the road. We just need rules of the road, so market participants, so innovators, so businesses can have basic clarity on how to create their businesses, what level of oversight and accountability will be effective, how to create basic safety and soundness, how to create consumer protection. And you being a part of this process has been absolutely essential to getting this bill written and to getting it where it is today for the committee. So I'm very very optimistic. I would like you to continue along with the line that Senator Ernst started, about why is this relevant now? This bill takes jurisdiction over the commodities part of cryptocurrencies. Some cryptocurrencies are securities. Digital assets can take many forms. SEC has a regulatory responsibility, CFTC will have regulatory responsibility, IRS will have regulatory responsibility and so will thoughts and ideas on cybersecurity, which I’ll address after this question. But what I would like you to talk about is how does this bill fit into the broader framework? Why is getting this bill done now so essential? And, why and how does getting this bill done now allow us to build on it to do the rest of the regulatory frameworks? To then go and look at the Banking Committee and try to do stablecoins, go and look at the Banking Committee to try to get SEC regulation for those digital assets that are securities? Talk about why this piece matters now.CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam: Senator, thanks for the question. You rightfully point that this is one piece of the puzzle. We all have a role to play, we all have our pieces to contribute to the larger puzzle. I’ve been lucky to participate in the principles working group, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, other international fora, and this is a big issue. You mentioned stablecoins, this is a predominantly prudentially banking regulated issue. The security tokens, there are thousands of security tokens that innovators are creating and that we need to address. There are issues around payments, custody, settlements, so many different elements of this larger, digital asset ecosystem that in many respects is interconnected. As much as they’re their own little silos, they are all interconnected. I think this is an important bill because, you expressly outline bitcoin and ether and commodity tokens. That will be a significant majority of the digital asset marketplace, and I think it will push the conversation forward so that we can continue to have policy around the different areas of the digital asset space, clarified and complete. Because as much as this will bring clarity, transparency, and most importantly, as you point out, customer protections to this particular market, which is significant, the other elements need to be completed too. We need to complete the larger puzzle, because if we are going to see advances in the technology and innovation, coupled with the customer protections, the market resilience, and ultimately financial stability depending on the size of the market, we need to have this patchwork all plugged together so that we have the full lens into that space, from a regulatory perspective and from a prudentials perspective.Senator Gillibrand: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Along the lines that I mentioned on cyber, when I first became involved in this issue, it was through my role on the Intelligence Committee. And so, obviously, addressing things like cyber-threats, fraud, theft, privacy breaches, and other technology-based crimes facilitated through Web3 applications by foreign adversaries is top of mind for me. Can you talk a little bit about the work that you and your agency are undertaking to be ready to address these types of threats, and what needs to be done in the future to ensure security of the commodities market?Chairman Behnam: Thanks, Senator.Cybersecurity is top of mind at the agency right now. We are a financial market regulator that has systemically important registrants. As I mention in my earlier responses and in my statement, we have core principles which drive our rules and regulation. The core principle around system safeguards directly relates to cybersecurity. We have to build operation resilience within the institutions, the regulated institutions. Thankfully the DCCPA addresses this specifically, prescriptively mentions cybersecurity. So, we are leveraging the tools, the expertise that we have. We understand that we are going to have to up our game, because, from a markets perspective, the cyber resilience and cyber issues are largely the same. But this technology, specifically the custody element, the how do we hold these tokens and the unique nature of the technology, is going to require some deep thinking. It’s going to require new hires and new expertise in the space.So those are the areas that I’m concentrated on. Using the resources that the bill provides will be critical to ensure that we can recruit, retain, and build out that infrastructure so that we have a cyber-resilient system. As we have seen in the past with Colonial Pipeline or others, digital assets will be a vulnerable point, will be a touch point for bad actors to try to attack the US through different systemically important infrastructure.Senator Gillibrand: Thank you Mr. Chairman, thank you Madam Chairwoman. Senator Gillibrand on decentralized finance:Senator Gillibrand: So, I wanted to, Ms. Warren, I want to talk a little bit about DeFi because this is an area where I think we could improve this bill. Right now, for those who are focused on this issue, decentralized finance has enormous opportunity to improve innovation toward, collectively towards creating more financial inclusivity, as many of you have testified about, fewer intermediaries, more opportunities for people of all income levels to engage in the financial system. And while this bill does include decentralized finance in its regulatory framework, I don't know that it is being treated in the way it would need to be treated to actually continue to participate. So I want to talk a little bit more specifically for the benefit of the staff who are working on the next iteration of this bill, what you would suggest laying out in terms of protocols that would apply and map for decentralized finance better than the definitions right now that seem to be overly broad and encompassing too many things that don't really apply.CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation Sheila Warren: Thank you, Senator. I agree. I think that the definition proposed as now is frankly a bit unworkable in terms of how DeFi actually operates, and I think it's important to note that crypto is not a monolith, and so DeFi – I've been in this space full-time now for almost six years, and DeFi didn't exist when I entered this space as a concept. It was brand, brand new. So we are really at a point where the cutting edge of innovation is reflected in what we're seeing in this space. And the market hasn't even had time to decide which models make sense, let alone settle into parameters and models that are consistent across different types of offerings and services here. I echo your sentiment that this is a critically important edge for financial inclusion in our system. It is going to provide, I believe, over time increasing advantages to those who simply cannot access other forms of financial services because they have been, again, historically underserved, as the report that is named in the DCCPA so aptly, it’s so aptly named. I think what's also really important is to ensure that DeFi remains in the United States as a locus of innovation. And the concern that I have, which I've shared with you previously, is that we are going to see offshoring of this innovation space in a way that, as our colleagues on the panel have noted, is going to not embed the principles-based frameworks that are so critical to ensure that Americans receive the adequate protections that they need and deserve, let alone the global citizenry that's going to benefit from this innovation. So as a general matter, you know, we do recommend that this is a space that requires a lot of study, requires a lot of focus on what is happening, what is coming, the trajectory here, but also a bit more time for the space to settle a bit before we try to box it into something that may wind up cutting off avenues that could benefit tremendous groups of people. Senator Gillibrand: And can you just explain it a little more in detail? Because a lot of people don't understand the difference. So if you have a DeFi protocol that never takes custody of assets, does it need to make sure they're not co-mingled? Like a bank or something, more institutional finance bases. Can you explain the difference and why these definitions unfortunately may include, and therefore exclude, DeFi entirely? Just explain the difference for the committee, particularly for Chairman Boozman and the staff, so they understand why it needs a separate study for this part and to make sure it's not being excluded.Warren: Swept up, really, in these workflow definitions. So the way that DeFi works is it is basically an immediate pass through. It enables a precise peer-to-peer connection between two parties that are engaging in a transaction, without a centralized intermediary that's in the middle of that. Senator Gillibrand: And that it's software and it's not an entity. It's not like a group of people managing an organization. It's a software program. Warren: That's exactly right. It is code, it is code that is actually governing this exchange. And that leads to a lot of exciting innovation, but it's also challenging to figure out, how do you create a framework around that? Because everything that's come before – we've talked a lot about 1922. This is about as opposite from that kind of model as you could get because there isn't an entity in the middle of this that is directing the flow of funds and pointing you know, things to where they ought to go. It is code. It is essentially conducting that same service and providing that same opportunity. So we do, it does behoove us, I think, to think very carefully about the precedent that's being set when we think about a code base that is perhaps serving a primary financial service function. How ought we to think about regulation there in a way that protects consumers but again, retains that innovation edge, and most importantly, ensures that a principles-based framework that is grounded in historical, the US historical approach to financial services is underlying all of that.Senator Gillibrand: Thank you, Ms. Warren. Mr. Phillips, I want to thank you as well for your leadership and the work you've done with this committee and with my staff on writing portions of this legislation in terms of ideas and thoughtfulness. I want to talk a little bit about the issue that people have concerns about, about energy use, and the way this bill will create a study and a protocol to create better disclosure, perhaps, or other recommendations so that the participants can make informed choices. Can you talk a little bit about how you do that? Which other regulatory agencies, such as FERC, we may ask for information from, and explain how we're doing that and how you think ultimately will help long term? Director of Financial Regulation and Corporate Governance at the Center for American Progress Todd Phillips: Absolutely, Senator, thank you. So this bill would require the CFTC to conduct a study, along with other regulators, examining the energy impacts of a variety of digital asset commodities. In addition to studying and creating recommendations for Congress and the agency on how to reduce those energy impacts, it would also require the CFTC to list the energy impacts of a variety of different digital asset commodities, so that investors can see those disclosures and make investing decisions based on what they see. If there is a token that has an extremely high energy impact compared to something else that is a similar type of token, it's reasonable to believe that investors would move to the lower energy intensive asset, incentivizing the higher energy ones to reduce their energy impacts by moving to a different blockchain or doing something else, reducing the overall impact of energy usage in the crypto market overall. As for other regulators that the CFTC should speak with in doing this, definitely FERC, which does have oversight of the nation's energy markets, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which I expect would also – I would want them to examine the energy impacts of those digital asset securities. And in addition, potentially, the bank regulators and FSOC, who oversee other parts of the digital asset markets.Senator Gillibrand: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have more questions if you want me to filibuster, but if you have questions it’s your turn.Senator John Boozman: If you want to ask another question.Senator Gillibrand: I have one more.Senator Boozman: As long as they don't get mad at you over on the floor.Senator Gillibrand: Oh, well they might. One more, Ms. Warren, I have one more. I want to talk a little bit about what happened after the days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. People were concerned that cryptocurrency would be used by Russian oligarchs to evade sanctions. But that actually wasn't the story that we heard. It winded up being a very important example of how this industry and blockchain technology can be a solution for families, countries, unstable governments that need resources to get them quickly. I thought Ms. Dixon made some excellent points about remittances and how important that is for a world financial market. I care very deeply about access to capital for communities that are disadvantaged and are unbanked or underbanked. And then the banking community doesn't serve it.So I'd like you to augment Ms. Dixon’s testimony and talk about some of the really positive stories about how this industry and this technology can transform who has access to capital at urgent times of need. And I think you can use the Ukraine example as one but whatever ones you want to add to the record.Warren: Well, I think that is the most acute. Because I think there is really no question, and I don't mean to sound dramatic about this, there's really no question we'd be in a very different situation in that conflict if the crypto community had not mobilized in response to a specific request from the Ukrainian government, all the way up to the president's office, asking for crypto donations to bridge and serve as a catalyst while the international community could provide the badly needed aid, the billion dollars of aid that actually has resulted in where we are and the ability of the Ukrainian people to stand up to this brutal invasion.There's no question crypto was a bridge, it was a catalyst. It was essential and critical in order to give the international community time to use traditional financial means to provide this kind of capital. And we know because we can see on what's called a block explorer where that money went, who it was given to and also what it was used for. So we know based on all the accounts that come from the Ukrainian government, this was medical supplies. It was in some cases arms, it was just things that were critically vitally important at that crucial time.In addition, we've seen crypto be a critical tool for activists, those who are working in some cases with the US government against rogue states to actually provide money, whether it's money to get them securely out of a country in times when their lives are in political crisis because of political happenings around them. We've seen this all over the place. We've also seen women in times of trouble, and Afghanistan is probably a really great example of this – maybe the best – where in a patriarchal society, where when the Taliban came in, they were looking to basically seize and appropriate funds. And the community was using crypto, particularly women were using crypto in a way to shield assets from that seizure, which is critical and again provided the ability for people in that country to resist the authoritarian regime that was being pushed upon them.So these are examples that I think are located in other countries, but they are so critical. And they underlie, in my opinion, the nature of crypto and why it is so important to your particular point in times of crisis. And the reality is that here in the United States, we certainly have communities in crisis as well. And so these may not be the examples that are as popular as noted, because they are quieter examples and maybe aren't as dramatic in terms of the opposition that's being faced. Nevertheless, there are communities here that also have been unable to get access to basic financial services that are turning to crypto. And the numbers speak for themselves and we quoted them already.So whether or not you're in an acute situation or a crisis, I do find that preserving the opportunities that this particular innovation represents is of critical importance. And again, grounding that in the principles-based frameworks that underlie the American financial system are also of critical importance.Senator Gillibrand: I just want to thank the entire panel. I appreciate your testimony and the information you're giving to this panel about the urgency and the importance and the benefits of really creating these regulatory frameworks now. Thank you so much."
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrand-calls-on-biden-administration-to-swiftly-implement-debt-relief-provisions-for-small-farmers-passed-in-the-ira-,"Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand held a video press conferencing announcing her letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack urging the USDA to quickly implement the small farmer debt relief provisions in the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act. The historic bill includes $3.1 billion in economic relief for struggling farms, but without rapid distribution of funds, farmers burdened by loans will continue to struggle to make ends meet. Gillibrand sent this letter with U.S. Representative Sean Patrick Maloney (NY-18). The members are calling on the USDA to immediately clarify eligibility guidelines for debt relief and provide relief to as many economically distressed small farmers in New York State as possible. “The Inflation Reduction Act takes critical steps to help relieve small farmers’ crushing debt, but they can’t afford to wait weeks or months for relief,” said Senator Gillibrand. “I urge Secretary Vilsack to act now to clarify the eligibility guidelines for debt forgiveness so that farmers can get the help they need as soon as possible. Small farmers form the backbone of our rural communities and we have to do more to ensure that they have the support they need to stay in business.” “Small family farmers like those in the Black Dirt region of the Hudson Valley are pillars of our communities and the backbone of America’s agricultural industry. Despite their critical importance, small farmers face more challenges than ever and have often been forced to take on unrealistic amounts of debt to keep their farms operational. That’s why I’ve been working directly with farmers across the Hudson Valley to ensure they get the help they need to continue their work for generations to come,” said Representative Maloney. “Today, Senator Gillibrand and I called on the US Department of Agriculture to promptly distribute the billions in debt relief we fought for in the Inflation Reduction Act to as many small farmers in New York as possible. This funding will be life-changing for Hudson Valley farmers.”As it currently stands, the USDA needs time to design and implement a debt relief program, including the eligibility criteria. Until the program is in place, economically distressed farmers will continue to need to make loan payments, putting them at risk of defaulting or being forced to sell their farms. Gillibrand and Maloney are urging the USDA to base the eligibility criteria for IRA forgiveness on the framework included in their bill, the Relief for America’s Small Farmers Act, which Gillibrand and Maloney introduced last year. The bill defines eligible borrowers as those who had an average annual adjusted gross income of $300,000 or less for the previous 5 years and was created to capture as many economically distressed farmers as possible. Using these criteria would help ensure that all farmers in need of debt relief get it soon. The full text of the letter is available here or below: Dear Secretary Vilsack,The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will deliver billions of dollars in resources to help fight inflation, reduce healthcare costs, and notably provide relief to economically distressed farmers. Section 22006 of the IRA grants the U.S. Department of Agriculture broad authority to provide debt relief to at-risk famers, but many farmers are concerned as to whether they will be able to access these resources. We urge you to quickly implement the small farm debt relief program in a way that ensures as many small farmers as possible are included in this necessary relief, consistent with our original legislation.As staunch advocates for farmers across New York State, we introduced the Relief for America’s Small Farmers Act and have worked tirelessly to ensure that financially distressed small farmers can obtain the relief they need to continue the essential work critical to our economy and many local communities. Language from the Relief for America’s Small Farmers Act was even included in the House-passed Build Back Better Act and provided up to $150,000 in relief to small farmers with Farm Service Agency (FSA) loans. The eligibility criteria for IRA forgiveness should be based upon the framework included in the Relief for America’s Small Farmers Act, which defined eligible borrowers as those who had an annual adjusted gross income under $300,000 for the previous 5 years. This criteria was specifically created to capture as many economically distressed farmers as possible and should be used as the framework of IRA implementation. We know firsthand the diligent work it took to include this incredible relief in the IRA, and we want to ensure that it will reach all farmers for whom the program was designed.This debt relief program will help thousands of farmers across the country. The USDA needs time to design and implement the program; however, many farmers have loan payments due before the end of the year that they will not get back even though their loans will be forgiven once the debt relief program is implemented. Many farmers are struggling to complete their payments as it stands but have not yet defaulted, and they deserve to be included within USDA regulations. Therefore, we urge the USDA to establish a dedicated program for farmers who will qualify for this program for the 2022 season and to expeditiously issue the criteria and eligibility guidelines.We have heard stories from many farmers across New York struggling to make ends meet or considering selling their farm because of their debt. The inclusion of this debt relief in the IRA has the potential to prevent this and help thousands of families in our state. We must ensure that small farmers will not be left out of this process or forced to wait for additional rounds of assistance that may not come. We wrote the original legislation to target all small farmers who are saddled with burdensome FSA loans, and we hope you will honor that intent as the USDA works on guidance for this debt relief program. While we understand the importance of helping our most at-risk farmers, it is imperative that USDA take into consideration economically distressed farmers who are on the brink of defaulting.Our offices stand ready and eager to work in partnership to ensure we can do the most good for the most people with the resources allotted for this program. Thank you for your attention to this matter and we look forward to your response.Sincerely,"
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrand-statement-on-federal-bill-to-ban-abortion,"Today, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand responded to legislation introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham that would strip more than half of the American population of their bodily autonomy and right to privacy regardless of where they live. “While many of us feared this day would come ever since the U.S. Supreme Court broke with nearly 50 years of precedent and overturned Roe v. Wade, it is still an enormous blow to women across the country,” said Senator Gillibrand.“A nationwide, federal ban on abortion would not only put the lives of countless Americans at risk, it would contradict the argument Republicans have made repeatedly — which is that such decisions about the right to bodily autonomy and life and death medical decisions should be decided by individual states.“With this bill my Republican colleagues have shown their true colors. They have proven beyond all doubt that they will stop at nothing to control our bodies, our families, and our lives. And they have demonstrated their disregard for the six in ten Americans who support women’s reproductive freedom.“But now our mission as Americans and as voters is crystal clear. We will do whatever it takes to elect more pro-choice candidates. And when we expand our majority we will pass legislation guaranteeing the right to bodily autonomy and enshrining the right to reproductive freedom into federal law.” "
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/schumer-gillibrand-announce-500000-in-federal-funding-for-substance-use-recovery-programs-in-chautauqua-county,"Today, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand are announcing $500,000 in federal funding for the Mental Health Association in Chautauqua County. The funding was allocated by the Appalachian Regional Commission’s (ARC) Investments Supporting Partnerships In Recovery Ecosystems (INSPIRE) Initiative, which aims to fight the substance use disorder crisis across Appalachia. This grant will provide recovery support, pre-employment development, and vocational training to individuals struggling with substance use disorder and establish partnerships with local employers to help these individuals re-enter the workforce.“Western New York is on the frontlines of the opioid crisis, and this funding will tackle the heart of this epidemic in Chautauqua County by expanding access to care, giving people the support they need to get back on their feet, and saving lives,” said Senator Schumer. “We need an all-of-the-above approach: more interdiction, prevention, treatment and recovery, to fight the flow of drugs, and more effectively assist those who are suffering from addiction. That is why I am proud to deliver this funding today and why I fought for historic increases for addiction services in the COVID relief bills, and why I will keep fighting increases to these federal programs to give Western New York all the resources they need fight the fentanyl fueled opioid crisis.""“The pandemic exacerbated our nation’s ongoing substance use crisis and Appalachian communities like those in Chautauqua County have been disproportionately impacted,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This funding will allow the Mental Health Association in Chautauqua County to continue to provide free, comprehensive support to individuals struggling with substance use and will give these individuals the tools they need to obtain and maintain stable employment and enter long-term recovery. Community-based initiatives like this one are key to overcoming the substance use crisis and I’ll keep fighting for more federal funding to ensure that organizations like the Mental Health Association in Chautauqua County have the resources they need to help as many people as possible.”Schumer and Gillibrand have been leading advocates for the Appalachian Regional Commission. In the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Schumer and Gillibrand delivered a historic $1 billion for the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) over the next 5 years. Earlier this year, Senator Gillibrand joined six of her Senate colleagues in calling for $235 million in federal funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission to support initiatives that address workforce challenges caused by the Appalachian Region’s drug crisis and help diversify the economies of Appalachian communities.The ARC is a federal-state partnership that invests in projects designed to support economic development in 423 counties across the 13 Appalachian states, encompassing more than 25 million Americans. In Fiscal Year 2021, ARC supported 465 projects totaling over $163 million in federal investment. This federal investment helped attract over $1 billion in local, state, and private funding that resulted in the creation or retention of over 20,000 jobs in Appalachia.

Given the advancements in medicine for both HIV and HBV, the risk of battlefield transmission is near zero and people living with HIV and HBV can manage their condition with as little as one pill a day and are able to lead very long and healthy lives. Just recently, multiple district court cases affirmed this notion by stating that the categorical bars to the deployment and commissioning of service members with HIV violate the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. The argument that these viruses make an individual less fit to serve is outdated, harmful, and discriminatory, and places unnecessary barriers on these individuals who wish to serve their country.Gillibrand and Coons were joined by Senators Schatz (D-HI), Hirono (D-HI), Baldwin (D-WI), and Casey (D-PA). U.S. Representative Mike Quigley (IL-05), Vice-Chair of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, Representative Sara Jacobs (CA-53), and Representative Barbara Lee (CA-13) led 31 of their House colleagues in sending an identical letter to the Biden administration. “We are pleased to learn that DOJ will no longer defend the constitutionality of regulations barring the deployment and commissioning of service members with HIV who are currently serving in the U.S. military. We now ask that the Biden administration follows this conclusion and allows individuals living with HIV to enlist, to seek appointment, and to otherwise join the U.S. military,” said the senators. “For far too long, people living with HIV and HBV have faced harmful and discriminatory policies in our armed forces that create unnecessary barriers to serve. The current policy banning these individuals from enlisting or joining a commissioning program is outdated and without merit, and does not reflect the military’s commitment to equality, diversity, and the inclusion of all races, ethnicities, religions, and sexual orientations in service. Anyone who is qualified and has a desire to serve their country should be allowed to do so, and we remain optimistic the administration will heed this important call.”  ""As our nation entered into one of the most difficult military recruiting cycles in more than twenty years, it is even more critical now, to recruit and retain individuals who are capable and qualified to serve, including individuals living with HIV or chronic HBV. Medical technology has vastly improved in the past decades, making transmission rates almost zero and a person's viral load undetectable,” said Jennifer Dane, CEO of Modern Military Association of America. “Discriminating against these individuals is not simply unjust, but a threat to national security. The Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security must act now to remove these barriers to service.""""Scientific evidence shows that people living with hepatitis B do not pose a risk to others, and that hepatitis B does not impact the ability of military students and personnel to serve. By failing to align their current policies with recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Defense has created an inequitable environment where people living with hepatitis B and HIV are vulnerable to being discharged unnecessarily,” said Chari Cohen, DrPH, MPH, President of Hepatitis B Foundation. “We urge President Biden to take swift action to ensure that all who wish to serve in the military can do so unimpeded."" “The current policy banning the military enlistment of individuals with well-managed Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) ignores the science in favor of stigma. It is a disservice to this country’s values and to those who would volunteer to protect them. We strongly urge the Biden Administration to allow all who want to serve their country, including individuals with well-managed HIV or HBV, to do so without facing unnecessary barriers,” said Human Rights Campaign Senior Vice President Policy and Political Affairs, JoDee Winterhof. “Due to advancements in modern medicine regarding HIV and HBV, individuals living with these viruses can and do lead long and full lives, often requiring just one pill a day to manage their condition. These advancements also mean that the risk of transmission is near zero and the research demonstrates that neither of these viruses makes an individual less able to serve – a fact recently recognized by our nation’s military leaders when they began allowing already-enlisted members with HIV to continue their service. We call on the Biden Administration to follow the science and to allow individuals with well-managed HIV and HBV to serve their country.”“Lambda Legal has a long history of defending LGBTQ+ people and people living with HIV against discrimination in the military, including litigation challenging Don’t Ask Don’t Tell, the ban on open transgender military service, and most recently, successfully challenging the discriminatory restrictions placed on servicemembers living with HIV. It is essential that the Department of Defense take the next step by formally ending discrimination in enlistment for people living with HIV or chronic HBV,” said Lambda Legal CEO Kevin Jennings. “There are people living with HIV/HBV who are ready, willing, and able to serve our country that are being harmed every day this ban remains in effect. We urge immediate action by Biden administration to remove this remaining discriminatory obstacle to commencing dedicated service defending our country.For the full letter, please click here."
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/senator-kirsten-gillibrand-calls-for-additional-funding-for-community-health-force-workers-to-help-tackle-ongoing-health-crises,"Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand called on congressional leadership to include at least $1 billion for community health workers in any upcoming COVID-19 supplemental funding package to help tackle health care issues at the local level. The funds that Senator Gillibrand seeks in her letter would build on the $3 billion she secured in the American Rescue Plan based on her legislation – the Health Force, Resilience Force, and Jobs to Fight COVID-19 Act (Health Force). The CDC has been using this funding to provide much-needed support to health workers treating COVID-19 and other patients at the ground level, including in New York, as well as helping with vaccine administration and connecting underserved communities with social and wraparound services.“The public health workforce is the pillar that keeps our communities safe and healthy. It’s our public health system that provides assistance in emergencies, helps people make the most of the health services available to them, and connects them to services outside of the doctor’s office, like housing and nutrition support, that play just as big of a role in their overall health,” said Senator Gillibrand. “That’s why I believe that every community should have a Health Force – a strong, local community health workforce like the ones we’ve been able to establish in New York, providing boots-on-the-ground, all-around health and social service support to those who need it the most. I’m calling on congressional leadership to include at least $1 billion for community health workers in any upcoming COVID-19 supplemental funding package to tackle these public health challenges from the local level.”The $3 billion already secured by Senator Gillibrand in the American Rescue Plan is being invested in the creation of a robust public health workforce, providing community leaders with the tools to improve health outcomes in their communities.In New York, the recent monkeypox and polio outbreaks are causing great concern. As we enter into the fall season, health care officials are warning about a potential uptick in COVID-19 infections as people begin to spend more time indoors. These simultaneous health crises demand urgent resources to alleviate an already strained health care system. New York City received $35 million from Gillibrand’s Health Force initiative and established the inaugural New York City Public Health Corps with more than 500 community health care workers. The New York City Public Health Corps has managed to help with a range of issues, from getting people vaccinated to counseling residents about diabetes and depression.For those who would like more information on how to apply for the funding allocated in the American Rescue Plan, please visit gillibrand.senate.gov/help/grants or email grants@gillibrand.senate.gov.For the draft letter, please click here.

https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrand-pushes-for-more-federal-funding-to-address-monkeypox-health-emergency,"U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, along with a group of 13 other senators, wrote a letter to congressional leadership urging them to include critical funding to address the monkeypox (MPV) / orthopoxvirus Public Health Emergency (PHE) in any forthcoming legislative package.Senator Gillibrand noted that while the United States public health system remains on the front lines in identifying MPV cases, informing Americans about access to vaccines and therapeutics, and connecting constituents to necessary medical care and resources, it continues to be strained and underfunded, especially in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.“Monkeypox is a serious threat to public health and we need to be doing everything in our power, using all available resources, to ensure that we prevent further spread of this disease,” said U.S. Senator Gillibrand. “With over 11,000 confirmed MPV / orthopoxvirus cases in the United States, I urge my colleagues to make this public health issue a top priority in any forthcoming legislative package.”Senator Gillibrand most recently called on the Biden administration to invoke the Defense Production Act to increase domestic production of and access to monkeypox vaccines. With New York State having emerged as a center of the outbreak and cases expected to rise, Senator Gillibrand noted that invoking the Defense Production Act would give President Joe Biden the authority to mandate that corporations and manufacturers accelerate production of this critical vaccine.The letter was also signed by Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Jack Reed (D-RI), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN).Full text of the letter can be found HERE and below:Dear Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell:We write today to express concern over the rising number of monkeypox virus (hereon referred to as MPV) cases in the United States, and to urge you to include funding to address this Public Health Emergency (PHE) in any forthcoming legislative package in the 117th Congress.As of August 9, 2022, there have been over 9,492 confirmed MPV / orthopoxvirus cases in the United States from when the first case in the current outbreak was identified on May 18, 2022. The current outbreak in the United States is the largest in the world by case count in the current global outbreak—which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization—and the largest in the nation’s history. As such, the outbreak was declared a national PHE by the Department of Health and Human Services on August 4, 2022. Nevertheless, we recognize that many experts have stated that the current number of cases is likely an undercount due to a gap in provider knowledge, limited access to information and testing, as well as social stigma that may increase reluctance to seek medical care.As the country continues to navigate the MPV PHE, the United States public health system remains on the frontlines in identifying MPV cases, informing Americans about access to vaccines and therapeutics, and connecting our constituents to necessary medical care and resources. A recent survey conducted by the National Coalition of STD Directors of more than 100 clinics nationwide—including Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), reproductive and sexual health clinics, and primary care providers—demonstrates that our country’s health professionals have the willingness and expertise to play a central role in the MPV response, and are already being called upon to do so. However, these care providers are in dire need of additional resources to scale an appropriate response and prevent the spread of the virus.MPV testing efforts are currently encountering processing and collection barriers that have led to underreporting of cases and poor data to aid the federal government in directing necessary resources in an appropriate manner. Additionally, as both a prophylaxis and treatment, acquiring and administering vaccines swiftly is crucial to stemming the spread of MPV and protecting all communities across the United States. Finally, clinics and providers are facing additional barriers in clinical services supplies, education for providers to properly identify MPV, vaccines, testing supplies, contact tracing, and community outreach to bolster our public health response to MPV, and ensure that accurate and adequate information is reaching our constituents.We appreciate the work that Senators Leahy, Murray, and Coons have undertaken to develop and introduce an emergency supplemental funding bill to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other emerging disease that pose a significant threat to public health, and we ask you to include additional funding in any forthcoming legislative package to address the MPV PHE in our communities.Thank you for your attention and partnership in addressing this public health concern."

https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrand-leads-senate-colleagues-in-calling-on-administration-to-invoke-defense-production-act-to-increase-access-to-monkeypox-vaccines,"As monkeypox continues to spread rapidly throughout the United States, today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand is leading 8 of her Senate colleagues in calling on the Biden administration to invoke the Defense Production Act to increase domestic production of and access to monkeypox vaccines. There are currently over 6,000 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the United States, including several in children, and New York State has emerged as a center of the outbreak. Cases are expected to rise, but the U.S. does not currently have enough vaccines to protect all at-risk individuals. New York State has been allotted only 170,000 vaccine doses as demand continues to skyrocket. Invoking the Defense Production Act would give the president the authority to mandate that corporations and manufacturers accelerate production of this critical vaccine.Today, Senator Gillibrand held a virtual press conference to speak on this issue and was joined by Dr. Jay Varma, Director of the Center for Pandemic Prevention and Response at Weill Cornell Medicine; Dr. Donald Chen, an infectious disease specialist and hospital epidemiologist at Westchester Medical Center; and Amanda Babine, Executive Director of Equality New York. “Monkeypox is a serious threat to public health, and we need to be doing everything in our power to ensure that vaccines are widely available to those who need them,” said Senator Gillibrand. “We don’t have time to wait. I urge President Biden to immediately invoke the Defense Production Act to ramp up vaccine supply and keep our communities across our state and our country safe.”“Monkeypox represents an acute threat to the health of Americans. While the outbreak is almost exclusively impacting gay men and their sexual health networks right now, there is no biological reason for it to stay that way. Vaccination is one of the most important ways that we can prevent infections, but it only works if there are vaccines available. I strongly support the Senator’s efforts to use all tools at the US governments disposal to increase the supply of monkeypox vaccines,” said Dr. Jay Varma, Director of the Center for Pandemic Prevention and Response at Weill Cornell Medicine.""Vaccination is an effective method in slowing the spread of monkeypox,"" said Donald Chen, MD, Hospital Epidemiologist, Westchester Medical Center. ""The current monkeypox vaccine is approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration and is one of the most fundamental ways to combat the further spread of monkeypox and to protect the health of New Yorkers. The Westchester County Department of Health provided vaccine doses to Westchester Medical Center and other sites around the county, and we here are offering safe and convenient monkeypox vaccinations to eligible community members as a drive-thru service by appointment only. For more information and to schedule a monkeypox vaccine appointment, visit WestchesterMedicalCenter.org/Monkeypox-Vaccine.""""Right now, we are in a crucial place and need to act fast to stop the spread of Monkeypox. We are calling on the federal government to prioritize prevention and get more vaccines to New Yorkers. We are lucky to have Senator Gillibrand's leadership and dedication to educating individuals on how to protect themselves and their communities,"" said Amanda Babine, Executive Director Equality New York.The letter was also signed by Senators Chris Murphy (D-CT), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Martin Heinrich (D-NM).The full text of the letter is available here or below: Dear President Biden,We respectfully request for you to invoke your authorities granted under the Defense Production Act of 1950 (P.L. 81-774, 50 U.S.C. §§ 4501 et seq.) to increase the production of vaccines that target the monkeypox virus to halt the spread of a disease representing a public health emergency of international concern.As of today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting 6,326 known cases of monkeypox in the U.S., but we know there are more that are uncounted. We also know that the West African type of monkeypox is currently dominant in the U.S. and demonstrates a very low fatality rate but we need to be better prepared. COVID taught us that different variants demonstrate different behavior; some spread more easily and can depend on the mode of transmission and underlying immunity that can impact the severity of symptoms experienced. COVID vaccines demonstrated their effectiveness in curbing the deadly effects of a pandemic.The World Health Organization indicates that monkeypox is currently endemic in 10 countries and the other type of monkeypox, Congo Basin type, has a nearly 10% fatality rate. The threat of the monkeypox virus and its spread demands greater attention. We urge you to act on the hard earned lessons from COVID and invoke the Defense Production Act to increase the accessibility of testing and vaccines to Americans.Under the Defense Production Act, the President is given a broad set of authorities to assist domestic industry with solving critical national issues like the current shortage of vaccines effective against monkeypox. Under Title I of the Defense Production Act, you have the authority to require persons, businesses, and corporations to prioritize and accept contracts for vaccine production under both emergency and non-emergency conditions. Title III also allows you to direct the expansion of productive capacity and supply of vaccines by incentivizing the domestic industrial base when a critical shortage exists; while Title VII grants you the authority to establish voluntary agreements with private industry that could allow for the coordination of vaccine production. These authorities have been employed numerous times since the 1950s to supplement national stockpiles.Thank you for all that you and your Administration have done thus far to bring awareness to monkeypox’s mounting threat to public health and our economy. We look forward to working with you and the Administration to address this urgent problem.Sincerely,"

Finally, we have come together to deliver on the promise we owe them for our freedoms, our values, and our safety. After the long and winding road we took to get to final passage of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022, we owe this success to the veterans advocates – Burn Pits 360 and all of the veterans service organizations – who fought day and night to change the hearts of senators and get this bill passed. I am honored to have worked beside them in this fight, and I urge President Biden to sign this bill into law swiftly!” BackgroundGillibrand’s bill, the Presumptive Benefits for War Fighters Exposed to Burn Pits and Other Toxins Act, formed the cornerstone of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act. She first introduced her bill in September 2020, alongside a bicameral group that included Representative Raul Ruiz (D-CA), comedian Jon Stewart, activist John Feal, and a strong coalition of veterans service organizations. The group introduced an updated, bipartisan version in the spring of 2021 together with Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Representative Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA).In March 2022, the House of Representatives passed the Honoring Our PACT Act, an effort led by House Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Mark Takano and Gillibrand’s House co-lead, Congressman Raul Ruiz. The War Fighters bill was included in the Honoring Our PACT Act as the centerpiece of the presumptive coverage section. Also in March, Gillibrand held a hearing in her role as chair of the Senate Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee to examine the health effects of burn pits. Later that month, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer joined the coalition to announce his support for the bill and pledged to give it a vote in the Senate.In May 2022, Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Jon Tester and Ranking Member Jerry Moran announced a bipartisan deal on toxic exposure legislation. Their package, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022, is an amended version of the House-passed Honoring Our PACT Act and retains Gillibrand’s bill as the cornerstone of the presumptive care section. "

Thanks to President Biden, our intelligence community, and our military, we are one step closer to justice for those we lost during the 9/11 attacks, for their loved ones, and for the first responders who risked everything to protect innocent lives.”"
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrand-visits-syracuse-highlighting-historic-federal-investment-in-lead-pipe-removal,"Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand held a press conference at a lead pipe removal site in Syracuse to discuss funding for lead pipe replacement in the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Lead is commonly found in older homes and buildings and in areas with aging water supplies, and exposure causes a variety of serious health and developmental issues, particularly in pregnant women and young children. Syracuse has more than 14,000 lead service pipes delivering water to homes, putting thousands of children and families at risk of heavy metal poisoning. The IIJA includes $2.6 billion in federal funding to help improve water infrastructure and replace the roughly 360,000 lead service pipes across New York State. Senator Gillibrand was joined by Syracuse Mayor Ben Walsh, Director of the Environmental Justice Project at the New York Civil Liberties Union Lanessa Owens-Chaplin, State Senator John Mannion, State Senator Rachel May, and Onondaga County Legislators Christopher J. Ryan and Peggy Chase.“New Yorkers have the right to expect clean and safe water when they turn on their faucets,” said Senator Gillibrand. “But in Syracuse, lead contamination is still widespread, putting residents at risk of kidney damage, brain damage, miscarriage, and a number of other devastating health problems. We have to do more to keep our communities safe. That’s why I’m proud to be delivering $2.6 billion in federal funding to improve water infrastructure in our state and get hazardous lead pipes out of New York’s homes, schools, and workplaces. This is a historic investment in our aging infrastructure and in the health and well-being of our most vulnerable. I’ll keep fighting to bring federal dollars home to New York and revitalize our neighborhoods.”“Funding for lead service line replacement through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is a game changer for the City of Syracuse in our ongoing effort to reduce lead exposure. It is critical that we mitigate the risks of lead poisoning through projects like lead pipe removal to protect our families, especially those most vulnerable – our children,” said Syracuse Mayor Ben Walsh. “I am grateful to President Biden, Senator Gillibrand and their colleagues in Washington for the historic investments Syracuse continues to see through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill.”“As we dismantle old and dilapidated infrastructure projects we must protect our communities from the multigenerational debilitating impacts of lead poisoning and exposure, especially in a city where Black children already have some of the highest rates of lead poisoning in the nation. The community is demanding intentional efforts to prevent further damage to their homes, health, and dignity, including lead abatement and remediation. Thanks Senator Gillibrand for bringing this issue to the forefront,” said Lanessa Owens-Chaplin, Director of the Environmental Justice Project at the New York Civil Liberties Union.   “It’s imperative that we keep our drinking water safe and reliable and thanks to Senator Gillibrand the City of Syracuse will get historic financial support to remove hazardous lead pipes. The multitude of infrastructure investments flowing into Central New York - including the reconstruction of I81 - will be transformative in the years ahead,” said Senator John W. Mannion.“Thank you to Senator Gillibrand for her important work in replacing lead pipes in our city and protecting our water supply. The fight against lead poisoning in Syracuse has involved a tremendous coalition of families, elected officials at all levels of government, advocacy groups, and experts. The resources provided by the Federal infrastructure bill will help make significant progress toward our goal of eradicating lead poisoning, and I look forward to continuing the work with Senator Gillibrand and others on this issue,” said State Senator Rachel May.According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as many as 10 million lead pipes still carry water to homes and businesses across the country, and New York State has the fourth highest number of lead service lines in the nation. Senator Gillibrand has long worked to combat these and other lead hazards throughout the state. She leads the annual push to include funding for the EPA’s lead-based paint abatement, inspection, and enforcement programs in the Interior-Environment Appropriations Bill. Last year, she cosponsored the bipartisan Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act of 2021 to remove miles of lead pipes and help families cover the cost of removing lead hazards from their homes. Senator Gillibrand also secured $360 million in funding for lead hazard control in the FY 2021 government spending package.  "
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrand-visits-buffalo-highlighting-historic-federal-investment-in-lead-pipe-removal,"Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand visited Buffalo to participate in a roundtable discussion with community leaders at Northland Workforce Training Center about the implementation of major infrastructure funding secured in the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Following the roundtable, Senator Gillibrand held a press conference at a lead pipe removal site to discuss funding for lead pipe replacement in the IIJA. Lead is commonly found in older homes and buildings and in areas with aging water supplies, and exposure causes a variety of serious health and developmental issues, particularly in pregnant women and young children. Buffalo has about 100 miles of lead pipes, putting thousands of children and families at risk of heavy metal poisoning. The IIJA includes $2.6 billion in federal funding to help improve water infrastructure and replace the roughly 360,000 lead service pipes across New York State. Senator Gillibrand was joined by Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown, Congressman Brian Higgins, Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes, State Senator Tim Kennedy, Assemblymember Bill Conrad, Assemblymember Karen McMahon, County Executive PJ Wendel, Lockport Mayor Michelle Roman, Dunkirk Mayor Willie Rosas, Jamestown Mayor Eddie Sundquist, and Tonawanda Mayor John White, as well as other local community leaders.“New Yorkers have the right to expect clean and safe water when they turn on their faucets,” said Senator Gillibrand. “But in Buffalo, lead contamination is still widespread, putting residents at risk of kidney damage, brain damage, miscarriage, and a number of other devastating health problems. We have to do more to keep our communities safe. That’s why I’m proud to be delivering $2.6 billion in federal funding to improve water infrastructure in our state and get hazardous lead pipes out of New York’s homes, schools, and workplaces. This is a historic investment in our aging infrastructure and in the health and well-being of our most vulnerable. I’ll keep fighting to bring federal dollars home to New York and revitalize our neighborhoods.”""Mayor Brown and the Common Council already dedicated $10 million of their $331 federal allocation under the American Rescue Plan to the ROLL program.  Now the federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is making more federal resources available; New York will get more than $115 million for lead pipes each year, and local communities can access this money by applying by August 31,"" said Congressman Brian Higgins.“Lead is known to poison children, causing debilitating neurological damage and limiting their potential. Sadly, every single child lead poisoning case responded to by our county’s Department of Health is preventable,” said Erie County Executive Mark C. Poloncarz. “Erie County is committed to continuing our work with local partners like the Buffalo & Erie County Lead Safe Task Force to educate residents and property owners on lead poisoning’s devastating effects. Together with state and federal support we can protect our community’s youngest members from this insidious toxin,” said Dr. Gale Burstein, Erie County Health Commissioner.“I thank Senator Gillibrand for coming to Western New York to raise awareness about the importance of replacing lead pipes in homes across the country,” said PJ Wendel, Chautauqua County Executive. “Chautauqua County is committed to reducing lead exposure in our communities and we routinely monitor municipal water systems for hazards to our drinking water. Funding from the Infrastructure package would further enable our communities to update aging water infrastructure to ensure our residents continue to receive safe drinking water,” said Chautuaqua County Executive PJ Wendel.“The City of Buffalo welcomes the continued commitment by our Federal government partners to address infrastructure improvements, especially the buried and often hidden infrastructure concerns of lead service lines. My administration is doing our part by investing millions through our Replace Old Lead Lines (ROLL) program to keep our children safe from lead. This is a National problem, and we need consistent Federal support to ensure that no child suffers from the life changing effects of lead poisoning,” said Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown.“The City of Lockport like many municipalities needs to continue improving its aged infrastructure and these federal funds will help us achieve that goal without burdening our taxpayers,” said Mayor Michelle Roman of Lockport,” said Lockport Mayor Michelle Roman.“As Mayor in the city of Dunkirk, NY, I applaud President Biden and NY Senator Kirsten Gillibrand for bringing renewed recognition to environmental health issues and for bringing technical solutions & financial support to help address those issues.  I thank the Senator for joining our community leaders here in WNY and providing discussion for financed action plans to remove lead from our water lines wherever it may be lurking as a possible threat to the health of New Yorkers.  Many older homes in WNY contain lead pipe connections for water service, and the safest route to have zero exposure to lead is to remove these.  I thank all of our government officials helping to get that done,” said Dunkirk Mayor Willie Rosas.“The Infrastructure Bill highly impacts communities like the City of Jamestown,” said Mayor Eddie Sundquist. “Getting an opportunity to attend the round table with Senator Gillibrand on lead pipe replacement, which is a critical issue for our municipal utility, is extremely valuable as funding becomes available,” said Jamestown Mayor Eddie Sundquist.“The City of Tonawanda has a lot of historical buildings and landmarks, due to the Erie Canal corridor in our back yard,” said Tonawanda Mayor John White. “The fact that we have many old buildings, increase the potential of exposure to lead pipes for our seniors, kid’s gyms, play grounds and schools is a very real concern for us. I applaud Senator Gillibrand for hosting this roundtable to shed light on this important issue.”“Buffalo and cities like it across Upstate New York face the challenges of aging housing and infrastructure, including the removal and replacement of lead pipes,” said Senator Kennedy. “Thank you to Senator Gillibrand for bringing much-needed attention to this pressing health and infrastructure issue and for facilitating an important conversation in how we can work together at all levels of government to address this need,” said State Senator Tim Kennedy.“Buffalo continues to lead the nation in water quality and prevention of lead poisoning. Still, despite significant progress, childhood lead poisoning remains a serious problem in Erie County and throughout the state. I applaud the leadership of all levels of government on remaining vigilant on this important issue. Today’s round table hosted by US Senator Gillibrand, is a conversation that continues to center lead poisoning prevention as a priority and pushes the momentum to eradicate lead completely from our water sources,” said NYS Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes.“Not unlike so many cities across the country, Buffalo has hundreds of miles of lead lines delivering water to its homes. Mayor Brown has taken remarkable initiative to replace damaged pipes, but the work at hand is extensive and costly. Our communities need the support of government – and the stakes couldn’t be higher. As a former teacher, I am deeply concerned about the life-altering effects of lead poisoning on the developing brains of children. I thank Sen. Gillibrand for initiating this important conversation here in Buffalo,” said Assemblymember Bill Conrad.""The use of lead pipes in old houses and buildings was the norm for decades. As we have seen the dangerous and tragic effects of lead on personal health and the environment, it has become more necessary than ever to take action,"" said NYS Assemblymember Karen McMahon. ""Today's roundtable discussion with Senator Gillibrand and other leaders was important in affirming the need to address this long-standing problem. The historic infrastructure package that was recently passed will make possible important changes, like the elimination of lead pipes, and will help communities in Western New York achieve better health and safety.""“I’m very grateful to meet with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand to talk about the important work of rebuilding and repairing key elements of American infrastructure,” said Buffalo Labor Council President Denise Abbott. “This work includes replacement of lead pipes which is key in making our water cleaner and safer for all our communities.  We have high hopes such important work will also benefit millions of American workers,” said Denise Abbott, Buffalo Labor Council President.“Similar to the numerous environmental impairments and infrastructure challenges history has saddled our Great Lakes region with, addressing the health risk from lead pipes and aging water infrastructure is going to require the mobilization of the community, increased municipal capacity, and the willingness of the residents to work in partnership with government”, said Jill Jedlicka, executive director Buffalo Niagara Waterkeeper. “However, with the significant resources now available through the infrastructure package and the priority that Congress and the Biden administration have placed on these issues, we finally have a fighting chance to fix the mistakes and remove the residual threats to our health and community. We are thankful for Senator Gillibrand’s leadership on this issue in Washington, and for inspiring collaborative problem solving and action in Western New York.”  ""Western New York’s aging lead pipes pose a persistent health risk to our residents, especially children, who are most susceptible to lead poisoning,” said Assemblymember Monica Wallace.  “The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funding provides an historic opportunity for municipalities and schools in our region to replace these water lines and eliminate this threat once and for all. I thank Sen. Gillibrand and the Biden Administration for their work in providing this vital infrastructure investment for our community,” said Assemblymember Monica Wallace.“No mother should have to be concerned that the paint in a new home could drastically alter her child’s development and potentially inhibit them for life. It’s far past time that we took a proactive approach to limiting the dangers renters and homeowners face as a result of lead paint exposure. I am currently sponsoring two bills within the NYS Assembly (A.7488 and A.06608A) that will better protect New York residents from exposure to lead-based paint by closing key insurance loopholes and mandating more transparency in real estate transactions. I want to thank Sen. Gillibrand for her advocacy on this issue, and the Biden administration for producing the Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan, which will utilize resources from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law while leveraging every tool within federal, state, and local government to deliver clean drinking water, replace lead pipes, and remediate lead paint across the nation,” said Assemblymember Jon Rivera.According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as many as 10 million lead pipes still carry water to homes and businesses across the country, and New York State has the fourth highest number of lead service lines in the nation. Senator Gillibrand has long worked to combat these and other lead hazards throughout the state.

Lead is commonly found in older homes and buildings and in areas with aging water supplies, and exposure causes a variety of serious health and developmental issues, particularly in pregnant women and young children. Rochester has more than 20,000 lead pipes, putting thousands of children and families at risk of heavy metal poisoning.

This bill previously passed the Senate by a large margin with a vote of 84-14 and was being reconsidered in the Senate due to a technical error during initial passage. Yesterday, the cloture vote on the toxic exposure legislation failed by a vote of 55-42. After previously voting for the measure, 25 Republicans changed their vote to vote against the PACT Act yesterday.“The fabric of our nation is built on the shared truth that we honor and care for our service members and veterans who have given everything to serve our nation. Yesterday, our Republican colleagues chose to play politics with the lives and well-being of these brave men and women,” said Senator Gillibrand, Chair of the Senate Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee. “Just six weeks ago we collectively passed the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act with overwhelming bipartisan support to give our veterans the health care and benefits they have earned. Now, 25 Republicans are holding our service members hostage for the sake of politics. The lives of our veterans are on the line, and these senators’ actions are an utter disgrace.”“Yesterday, dozens of Senate Republicans turned their backs on our nation’s veterans and their families by voting against the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act,” said Senator Tester, Chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee. “It was unacceptable and a slap in the face to every member of our all-volunteer military—those who served and sacrificed with the promise they would be taken care of when they returned home. My colleagues can make up all sorts of excuses as to why they decided to change their vote for this bill, but the bottomline is, veterans will suffer and die as a result on behalf of these excuses, and that’s why we’ve got to pass this bill.”  “Today, we planned to celebrate the enactment of our bipartisan Honoring our PACT Act – but instead, Republicans threw a tantrum on the Senate Floor and blocked benefits for as many as 3.5 million sick veterans,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.  “Democrats advance People Over Politics: fighting to protect the health of those who fought to protect us.  Yesterday, Republicans proved that they are just the opposite – willing to play selfish, partisan games with the health, lives and financial security of the American people.”""America’s veterans have demanded action. Instead they got a bunch of Senate Republicans hiding behind hollow arguments about fiscal responsibility as the reason to oppose this bill when the MORAL responsibility of caring for veterans has been made crystal clear. This bill gives the mechanism to finally pay the true cost of war - the human cost of war. For years, toxic-exposed veterans have held up their end of the deal – I guess for some Senate Republicans – that’s just not enough,"" said Chairman Mark Takano“It’s a disgrace that Senate Republicans are continuing to play politics with the health care and benefits that veterans have earned, deserve, and desperately need,” said Dr. Ruiz. “Their partisan games are at the expense of veterans who are sick and dying from their burn pit exposure. Enough is enough. The fight to help burn pit-exposed veterans is not over, not ever.” “Millions of men and women – patriots like Heath Robinson – served this nation without asking once what was in it for them,” said Senator Brown. “Yesterday, Senate Republicans thanked them for their service by using them and their families as a bargaining chip in their latest political game. Their gimmick will not work – we’re going to make good on our promise to veterans.” “3.5 million veterans would have been put on track to benefit from this bill, and every single veteran and their family felt the floor fall out from under them yesterday. Veterans are angry and confused at the sudden change from those who they thought had their backs,” said Cory Titus, Director of Veteran Benefits for the Military Officers Association of America. “We will do what we have always done in this situation, we will regroup, rally together, and fight back to get this bill over the finish line.  Our service taught us to work as a team, and our service fortified our resolve to never quit and never leave a fallen comrade. We will abide by that ethos, and we will charge forward to get the PACT Act passed.”""September is too late. November is too late. The PACT Act needs to be passed before the Senate goes home next week. If any of us in the military had left our post to go home before our work was done, we would have been court-martialed.  The Senate has a duty to get this done before they go home.  Stay-in late, stay-in overnight, stay-in next week, stay in all of August.  They need to do their job,"" said Bob Carey, Executive Vice President of The Independence Fund.""Like so many, we watched the Senate cloture vote yesterday in disbelief. TAPS is a leading voice for the families of those who died as a result of illnesses connected to toxic exposure, and we know first hand that every day the PACT Act is delayed means precious time lost for our veterans suffering from the effects of toxic exposure. It is our nation’s moral obligation to care for our veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors, and we urge the Senate to pass this historic legislation without further delay,” said Candace Wheeler, Director Government and Legislative Affairs, Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors.“The PACT Act passed the House and Senate in a bipartisan manner, yet this delay continues because of political games. The American Legion demands that Congress end this delay and allow our veterans to receive the healthcare they desperately need,” said Lawrence Montreuil, Legislative Director of The American Legion.“The Senate should pass this bill without amendment before they go home for August recess -- because sick veterans can’t wait any longer. No more excuses, no more delays, no more broken promises. The Senate needs to pass the PACT Act now,” said Aleks Morosky, Government Affairs Deputy Director, Wounded Warrior Project."
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrand-statement-on-senate-passage-of-chips-act,"Addressing Senate passage of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand released the following statement:“Over the past few years, U.S. consumers and companies experienced how our overreliance on foreign companies for semiconductors led to increased prices and the disruption of American supply chains. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 will deliver billions in resources to build our domestic chip industry, address vulnerabilities in domestic manufacturing and supply chains, and increase our competitiveness with China. This bill will strengthen our national security, create good-paying jobs and pave the way for continued U.S. leadership in semiconductor technology, design and fabrication.”Gillibrand has long championed increased efforts to expand the domestic semiconductor and broader microelectronics industries, including by cosponsoring legislation like the bipartisan American Foundries Act, which she helped negotiate with Majority Leader Chuck Schumer as an amendment to the FY21 NDAA. In February, Gillibrand introduced her bipartisan, bicameral Made in America Manufacturing Communities Act of 2022, which would incentivize private-public partnerships that would be eligible for federal financial and technical assistance designed to expand and support domestic manufacturing. Gillibrand also led a push with Senator Schumer and Representatives Tonko and Katko calling on President Biden to invest in U.S. semiconductor production. Last year, Senator Gillibrand led a bipartisan call on the Biden administration to implement the provisions that she fought for in the FY21 NDAA to bolster the domestic semiconductor industry."

The survey showed that 8.4% of active duty women and 1.5% of active duty men reported at least one unwanted sexual contact in the prior year, amounting to an estimated 35,900 total active duty service members – a disturbing rise from previous years. For years, Senator Gillibrand has fought the DoD to fundamentally reform how it deals with sexual assault among its ranks. She earned bipartisan majority support for her bill, the Military Justice Improvement & Increasing Prevention Act, which was blocked from receiving a vote in the full U.S. Senate.In response to today’s shocking numbers, Gillibrand said: “This data shows a military in a crisis. Nearly one in ten active duty women reported unwanted sexual contact during a single year, and that number rises to one in four when the service member experienced an unhealthy command climate involving sexual harassment. When service members cannot trust their leaders to uphold the values of our military services it means we are failing. Finally, the percentage of cases preferred for court-martial charges continues to drop. These results are completely unacceptable.“We are betraying the trust of service members and their families and failing the most heroic among us. The current versions of the National Defense Authorization Act in Congress contain vital military justice reforms that I have fought for for nearly a decade, and they should be passed and enacted with the urgency this crisis demands.”The DoD’s full report can be viewed here."
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/following-rule-that-lowers-the-bar-for-truck-safety-senator-gillibrand-and-representative-cohen-lead-their-colleagues-in-calling-for-clarification-on-safety-standards-for-underride-crashes-,"Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Congressman Steve Cohen (D-TN-9), a senior member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, are leading their colleagues in a bicameral letter expressing their serious concerns regarding the final rule on rear underride protection recently issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on June 30th. Last year, several provisions of Senator Gillibrand’s and Congressman Cohen’s Stop Underrides Act were included in the bipartisan infrastructure bill, including a requirement that NHTSA complete rulemaking to improve the protections for drivers and passengers in the event of an underride crash, which occurs when a car slides under a large truck, such as a semi-trailer, during an accident. Instead of strengthening requirements, the new NHTSA rule undermines current industry standards. In light of these concerns, Senator Gillibrand, Congressman Cohen, and their colleagues are requesting further explanation from NHTSA regarding the final rule, as well as additional insights into NHTSA’s approach to underride protection going forward.“While we were hopeful when initially notified about the final underrides rule, we were extremely disappointed to see that it functionally lowers the bar for truck safety in the United States,” said the lawmakers. “Instead of meaningfully raising the standards that transportation and logistics companies must meet, the rule merely comports the standards to general industry practice. Deaths caused by underride crashes are preventable, and we remain committed to working with NHTSA to clarify and enhance safety standards to help prevent future tragedies.”When an underride accident happens, a car’s safety features are rendered useless because most of the car slides under the trailer and the trailer undercarriage crashes straight through the windows and into the passengers. The passengers in the car often suffer severe head and neck injuries, including decapitation. These accidents are frequently fatal, even at low speeds. Each year, hundreds of people are killed in underride accidents, but this data is estimated to be undercounted due to differences in local police reporting. The full text of the letter is available here or below: Dear Administrator Cliff,We write to express our deep concerns regarding the final rule (RIN 2127-AL58) recently issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that modifies NHTSA’s safety standards (FMVSS Nos. 223 and 224) addressing rear underride protection.As you well know, an underride crash occurs when a car slides under a large truck, such as a semi-trailer, during a collision. When these crashes happen, critical safety features in a car are rendered useless because most of the car slides under the trailer and the trailer undercarriage crashes straight through the windows and into the passengers. The passengers in the car often suffer severe head and neck injuries, including decapitation. These crashes are frequently fatal, even at low speeds. Data indicates that at least hundreds of people are killed in these crashes each year—with the actual number likely being much higher.As a part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA, P.L. 117-58), NHTSA was required to issue a final rule on rear impact guards within a year of the enactment of the bill, which NHTSA announced on June 30, 2022. This final rule (RIN 2127-AL58) changed NHTSA’s standards by adopting “similar requirements to Transport Canada’s standard for rear impact guards.”  Specifically, the rule requires large trucks be equipped with rear impact guards that prevent passenger compartment intrusion (PCI) when: (1) 100 percent of the width of a car overlaps the rear of the truck; and (2) 50 percent of the width of a car overlaps the rear of the truck. However, the rule does not require such rear impact guards when 30 percent of the width of a car overlaps.While we were hopeful when initially notified about the final underrides rule, we were extremely disappointed to see that it functionally lowers the bar for truck safety in the United States. Instead of meaningfully raising the standards that transportation and logistics companies must meet, the rule merely comports the standards to general industry practice. As stated by NHTSA itself in the final rule, “94 percent of new trailers sold in the United States subject to FMVSS Nos. 223 and 224 already comply with the requirements of this final rule.” Not only are most trailers currently equipped with rear guards that already meet the new standards, but many trailers also have rear guards that even mitigate PCI in 30% overlap crashes. In fact, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has been testing and rating semitrailers on their response to 30% overlap for five years and nine companies, which represent 80% of the market, have received the Toughguard Award. Again, NHTSA acknowledges this high level of compliance—and has been repeatedly directed by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees to require rear guards that meet the standards for Toughguard awards —but still concludes that mandating such superior guards would be unreasonable and impracticable. Most worrying of all, NHTSA justifies its determination by arguing that the lives saved would not be worth the cost—which seems directly contrary to the Department of Transportation’s policy of “prioritizing the elimination of crashes that result in death and serious injuries.”  To be clear, we are not questioning NHTSA’s motives or efforts with regards to this final rule. We know the staff is passionate about making our transportation system safer, and we understand the challenges and constraints inherent in agency rulemaking processes. That said, this issue is simply too important for us to stay silent.In light of our concerns, and to shed light on NHTSA’s approach to underride protection going forward, we ask that you provide responses to the following questions by September 6, 2022;1.         What specific actions are being taken by NHTSA to develop more comprehensive data regarding rear, side and front underride crashes?2.         Did NHTSA reach out to (a) the manufacturers of rear guards that meet the IIHS standard of providing protection in 30% overlap crashes or (b) trucking companies that currently use rear guards that meet the stronger requirement to collect data on performance and crashes?  If not, why? If so, what was their response?3.         Does NHTSA plan to work with law enforcement to improve police accident reports in order to enhance the collection of data on fatal and injury-producing truck crashes resulting in rear, side and front underride?4.         What factors did NHTSA consider when it decided to forgo the directive from the House Appropriations Committee?5.         When will NHTSA re-evaluate its current determination that requiring rear guards that mitigate PCI in 30% overlap crashes would be unreasonable and impracticable despite approximately nine manufacturers currently offering rear guards that meet the stronger requirement? And how will NHTSA incorporate the advisory committee on Underride Protection into future rulemakings that comply with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act?Thank you for your attention to this important matter. We look forward to your response."
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrand-visits-cornell-to-highlight-historic-federal-investment-in-small-farmers,"Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand held a press conference at Cornell University’s Guterman Greenhouse to discuss rural development and small farmer debt relief provisions in the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act. The historic bill includes $3.1 billion in economic relief for struggling farms and billions more in federal funding to help farmers implement climate-smart agricultural practices and allow rural communities to transition to clean energy. Gillibrand was joined by Chair of the Tompkins County Legislature Shawna Black, Vice President for University Relations at Cornell University Joel Malina, Dean of Cornell University’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Ben Houlton, and professors from the Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.“We cannot solve the climate crisis without the support of our farmers and agricultural producers,” said Senator Gillibrand. “The Inflation Reduction Act will provide billions in federal funding to help ensure that farmers who want to transition to more environmentally friendly practices have the resources and support they need to do so. This bill will drastically cut emissions, keep our water clean, protect wildlife, and preserve our forests. It will provide billions in economic relief to help struggling farmers get back on their feet and allow agricultural producers and small businesses to make the switch to green energy. The IRA is a historic investment in our rural communities and I am proud to have fought for its passage. I’ll keep working to bring federal funds to our Upstate communities and pass legislation to protect our planet.”“Cornell’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences is proud to have nearly 150 years of partnership with New York state and its farm and food community,” said Benjamin Houlton, the college’s Ronald P. Lynch Dean. “I am delighted that Senator Gillibrand has recognized the value of agricultural innovations, both technology-driven and nature-based, in supporting the Inflation Reduction Act. These programs will help farmers adopt science-based environmental solutions through economic incentives.”“Senator Gillibrand has always recognized the value that land grant universities like Cornell - through her strong support for agriculture research and extension -  provide to our stakeholders in New York. Her work to include agriculture programs in the Inflation Reduction Act will help ensure that the tools and resources developed and tested at Cornell to address climate change in agriculture are adopted by farmers and in communities throughout the state,” said Joel M. Malina, Vice President for University Relations at Cornell.The IRA provides $3.1 billion in loan modifications and economic relief for economically distressed farmers and unlocks additional funding to provide land access grants and loans, scholarships, and other assistance to underserved farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners. This funding includes an additional $2.2 billion for farmers who have previously experienced discrimination in USDA lending programs.The bill also expands the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s existing voluntary land conservation programs, allowing them to provide support to more farmers as they adopt environmentally friendly land management practices. The bill includes: The IRA also makes historic investments in clean energy development in rural communities. It includes:"

Removing this crushing debt will help us to continue to supply our neighbors with nutritious, healthy local food, which supports the local economy and a healthy lifestyle. It is a godsend and a game changer and for once it is policy that targets aid to smaller farms. I have been engaging in grassroots public policy work on farming issues for over 25 years but great ideas mean nothing if there aren’t concerned and dedicated officials like Senator Gillibrand and staff that are committed to sound public policy and hard work to make a difference. It’s both a true pleasure and privilege to work with her and her staff. Farmers, especially small family farmers, locally, in NYS, and across the country are very fortunate to have her and her staff fighting in our behalf.

This funding will allow six North Country health care providers to upgrade electronic health care records, fund telemedicine programs, and purchase new equipment. It will also reimburse hospitals for revenue lost at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.“From the North Country to the Southern Tier, Upstate New York’s rural hospitals and healthcare providers heroically stepped up during the pandemic, ripping holes in their budgets while experiencing significant revenue loss. This over $14 million boost is the shot in the arm our rural areas need to accelerate their economic recovery, develop new telemedicine programs, and keep our communities safe,” said Senator Schumer. “When I led the American Rescue Plan to passage I made sure our front line health care systems would get the support they need and I am proud to deliver this funding to give our frontline heroes the financial support they need to keep saving lives.”“North Country hospitals incurred enormous costs fighting at the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This funding will help reimburse some of those costs and help ensure that rural hospitals can continue to operate and provide thousands of North Country residents with continued access to care. It will also help hospitals continue to develop crucial telemedicine programs and purchase desperately needed new equipment. I’m proud to have fought to pass the American Rescue Plan to provide over $16 million in federal funding for these hospitals and I’ll keep fighting to ensure that our hospitals and our dedicated health care workers have the support they need to continue saving lives.”A full list of recipients is below: Recipient Amount PurposeGouverneur Hospital$10,000,000Electronic health care record upgrade and training/staffingLewis County General Hospital$1,000,000 (Awarded in April 2022)Reimburse for health care-related lost revenue used to maintain capacity during the coronavirus pandemicSt. Lawrence Health System$1,000,000Reimburse for health care-related lost revenue used to maintain capacity during the coronavirus pandemicCarthage Area Hospital$773,166Reimburse for health care-related lost revenue used to maintain capacity during the coronavirus pandemicClaxton-Hepburn Medical Center$857,067Reimburse for health care-related lost revenue used to maintain capacity during the coronavirus pandemicRiver Hospital$778,490Reimburse for health care-related lost revenue used to maintain capacity during the coronavirus pandemic and electronic health care record upgrade The Emergency Rural Health Care Grant Program provides up to $500M in grant funding for eligible facilities.

The funding was allocated through the Federal Aviation Administration’s Airport Improvement Program (AIP), which was bolstered by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and will be used to acquire emergency equipment and enhance airfield safety. “This federal investment from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act, which I championed in the Senate, will help airports across the Finger Lakes reach new heights,” said Senator Schumer. “Transportation connections to the wider world are essential for community development and economic opportunity, and I have long been a champion of bringing those connections to Rochester, Penn Yan, and beyond. The funding announced today means opportunities for more jobs, more growth, and more investment in the future. I will always work with the community to fight for Rochester and the Finger Lakes economic take off.”“Airports in and around Rochester serve millions of travelers each year,” said Senator Gillibrand. “They need to be safe, modern, and efficient in order to facilitate tourism and spur local economic growth, and that requires continued upgrades. That’s why I fought to pass the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which is providing billions in funds for projects like these.

The $2.9 million project was initially stalled due to lack of funds. Senator Gillibrand secured this significant federal investment to close the funding gap and put the stalled Dryden Rail Trail Bridge project back on track. Senator Gillibrand was joined by Assembly Member Anna Kelles, Town of Dryden Supervisor Jason Leifer, Town of Dryden Deputy Supervisor Dan Lamb, and the Ithaca-Tompkins County Transportation Council Director Fernando de Aragón.“The Dryden Rail Trail Bridge project will bring invaluable recreational and economic opportunities to the Tompkins County, and I am so proud to have helped the stalled project get back on track,” said Senator Gillibrand. “The $700,000 in federal funding needed to help finally complete the trail and bridge will bring Dryden and Ithaca together, and provide the communities with new opportunities for safe, sustainable transportation, and a beautiful way to get around.”“More and more people are recognizing the tremendous natural beauty of places like Dryden and the gorges trails of Tompkins County. I am proud to deliver this $700,000 in federal funding to keep the Dryden Rail Trail on track and help complete this long desired community project,” said Senator Schumer. “This funding will boost tourism, increase green infrastructure by making our communities more walkable, and blow a breath of fresh air into our local economies.”“This is a game changer for the Town of Dryden,” said Assembly Member Anna Kelles. “The Dryden Rail Trail will connect the village of Dryden to Freeville, Etna, Cornell and the city of Ithaca. Not only will this create many miles of trails to support sustainable transportation and connectivity in our region, this outdoor recreation resource will also support local tourism and public health.” “For decades, the story has been that the Dryden Rail Trail can’t be completed due to the challenge of crossing a busy state highway,” stated Deputy Town Supervisor Dan Lamb.  “Today, with the help of US Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, we are rewriting that script.”  ""Tompkins County envisions having a world class multiuse trail system. The Dryden Rail Trail is a key component and the trail bridge over route 13 will be the 'golden spike' link, connecting the east and west trail systems in the county,” said Fernando de Aragón, Director of the Ithaca-Tompkins County Transportation Council.When completed, the Dryden Rail Trail Bridge will help connect the Town of Dryden and the City of Ithaca and will give the community sustainable transportation options to get to work, school, community centers, stores, and parks.

https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/standing-at-the-port-of-albany-gillibrand-and-tonko-fight-to-bring-clean-energy-and-renewable-offshore-wind-jobs-to-new-york,"Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Congressman Paul Tonko stood at the Port of Albany to announce their plan to bring clean energy and renewable offshore wind jobs to Albany and position New York to be a key player in helping the U.S. meet its national goal of deploying 30GW of offshore wind energy by 2030. Their bicameral legislation, the Restoring Offshore Wind Opportunities Act, would reverse the harmful and arbitrary Trump-era ban on offshore wind leasing, which will halt progress and innovation in energy in the United States. Locally, the success of this bill would help support the Port of Albany’s Offshore Wind Tower Manufacturing Port Project to create hundreds of construction and manufacturing jobs. As the rate of inflation continues to rise, this bill is crucial to securing America’s energy independence and global competitiveness, and supports a burgeoning industry that will generate clean and reliable electricity to power 10 million homes, create 77,000 jobs, and cut 78 million metric tons of carbon emissions.“Clean energy and renewable jobs are the key to a successful future and a strong economy, and the United States is well-positioned to be at the forefront of this frontier,” said Senator Gillibrand. “Today, I’m announcing my Restoring Offshore Wind Opportunities Act, legislation that would open the gates to innovation in clean energy and help create hundreds of offshore wind jobs right here in Albany. I am always proud to represent my hometown and visit sites like the Port of Albany that set the standard for what is possible for the future of clean energy in New York and the entire nation, and I am grateful to Congressman Tonko for being a partner in this fight. I am confident this bill will pass in the Bipartisan Innovation Act and New York will lead the way in meeting our national goal of deploying 30GW of offshore wind energy by 2030.”“Investments in offshore wind energy not only create good jobs and drive economic growth, they are fundamental in our fight to address the climate crisis,” Congressman Tonko said. “But currently, an arbitrary Trump-era ban on new offshore wind leasing will prevent those key benefits from reaching our communities. Our Restoring Offshore Wind Opportunities Act would overturn this arbitrary ban and jumpstart clean energy deployment while helping us reach President Biden’s goal to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030. Our legislation was included in the House-passed America COMPETES Act, and—as one of the conferees facilitating negotiations between the House and Senate—I’m working hard to advance it in a final package that strengthens America’s global competitiveness. I’m grateful for Senator Gillibrand’s strong partnership in this effort to advance our bill that will propel our nation’s transition to a cleaner, more competitive economy of the future.”“We applaud Senator Gillibrand and Congressman Tonko for their unyielding encouragement of the Offshore Wind Industry and the opportunities it creates for this Country, environmentally, economically and beyond. We are pleased that the Port of Albany will be the setting to push for the Restoring Offshore Wind Opportunities Act also known as Bill S.3808. The Port team and our project partners are working to bring the first Offshore Wind Tower Manufacturing facility to the United States. We know first-hand that bringing a new industry to the United States is a complex task and can use this level of support. We want to thank Senator Gillibrand and Congressman Tonko for this effort” said Richard Hendrick, Port of Albany CEO.“New York State and the Capital Region have seized the opportunity to become the undeniable leader in offshore wind development. The Restoring Offshore Wind Opportunities Act, introduced the Senator Gillibrand and Congressman Tonko, will further the growth of this industry along the east coast, which will have positive impacts on supply chain opportunities locally,” said Mark Eagan, President and CEO of the Capital Region Chamber of Commerce and Center for Economic GrowthOffshore wind provides an opportunity to launch a whole new green economy industry in New York and across the country, and is critical to reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. By restoring offshore wind opportunities Senator Gillibrand and Congressman Tonko are fixing a loophole that would block clean energy progress for a decade. The New York League of Conservation Voters supports this proposal and similar legislation to enable development of renewable energy,” said Julie Tighe, President of the New York League of Conservation Voters.“Big action requires collaborative work at many levels, because everything is connected.  Here in Bethlehem, we have a remarkable offshore wind tower manufacturing facility under construction.  But we need appropriate places for these wind towers and their turbines to be sited, and I am so grateful to Senator Gillibrand and Congress member Tonko for stepping forward with critical legislation that will reopen ocean spaces to wind farms, thereby supporting local economies and advancing our nation’s clean energy future,” said David VanLuven, Bethlehem Town Supervisor.In September 2020, President Trump withdrew areas off the coasts of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida from new offshore oil and gas leasing in a pair of memoranda for the Secretary of the Interior. Due to the broad and imprecise language of these memoranda, the 10-year moratorium also applies to offshore wind, imperiling a critical new wave of offshore wind energy development. This threatens tens of thousands of high-quality jobs in a globally competitive industry and billions of dollars of investments planned or already in progress for offshore wind projects.The Restoring Offshore Wind Opportunities Act was successfully passed by the House in the America COMPETES Act. Now, the members are calling for the Senate version to be included in the Bipartisan Innovation Act - the final conference version of the Senate-passed U.S. Innovation and Competition Act and the House-passed America COMPETES Act.In December of 2021, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand secured nearly $30 million in federal funding for the Port of Albany’s Offshore Wind Tower Manufacturing Port Project. This project will be critical in establishing an offshore wind supply chain in the United States and moving toward renewable energy. In January of this year, Gillibrand also joined U.S. Secretary of Energy Granholm, Congressman Tonko, and Governor Hochul in Albany to highlight how the historic climate investments of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help lower energy costs, generate good-paying, union jobs and drive down air pollution across the Empire State."
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrand-and-pappas-introduce-legislation-to-stop-polluters-from-contaminating-waterways-with-toxic-levels-of-pfas,"Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Representative Chris Pappas (D-NH) announced their plan to introduce the bicameral Clean Water Standards for PFAS 2.0 Act, which would further regulate per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) by setting deadlines for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop water quality criteria and limits on industrial PFAS discharges into water and to water treatment plants.Joined by Newburgh City Manager Todd Venning, New York State Senator James Skoufis, New York State Assemblyman Jonathon Jacobson, and Riverkeeper Co-Director of Science and Patrol Dan Shapley, Senator Gillibrand outlined how the Clean Water Standards for PFAS 2.0 Act would require EPA to develop water quality criteria for all measurable PFAS or classes of PFAS, and develop effluent limitations guidelines and standards for all measurable PFAS or classes of PFAS. This updated legislation sets deadlines for these criteria and limits within the next few years, in accordance with the EPA PFAS Roadmap.This includes establishing pretreatment standards, which are a type of effluent limitations guideline and standard, to prevent the introduction of PFAS into publicly-owned water treatment facilities, therefore helping stop PFAS at the source before it gets into the municipal water system.“It is unacceptable that not just across New York State, but in every state across the country, communities have had their water supplies needlessly polluted by toxic PFAS chemicals,” said Senator Gillibrand. “I am proud to introduce the Clean Water Standards for PFAS 2.0 Act along with Representative Pappas, which would help prevent polluters from contaminating our waterways and improve access to clean, safe drinking water for everyone, regardless of zip code.”“The dangers posed by forever chemicals such as PFAS is one of the most pressing environmental and public health issues facing us today,” said Congressman Chris Pappas. “Despite knowing about the dangers they’ve posed since at least 1998, the EPA has still failed to take meaningful action to keep these toxic, ‘forever chemicals’ out of our water. No industry should be given a free pass to poison our water, and no family should ever have to wonder whether their drinking water is safe when they turn on the tap. The Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act will finally take action to hold polluters accountable, establish proactive limits for PFAS, set water quality criteria, and support communities with contaminated water. I am proud to re-introduce this legislation today, and will keep fighting to protect our water until it is enacted into law.”""I am grateful to Senator Gillibrand and her colleagues for taking up this critical measure to regulate 'forever chemicals' on the federal level,” said New York State Senator James Skoufis. “My constituents here in Newburgh, and in countless communities across the country, have unknowingly suffered the life-altering effects of extended PFAS/PFOA exposure, and lawmakers must act to hold corporate contaminators accountable while protecting the most vulnerable among us. The Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act will serve as another level of protection in the fight against drinking water toxicity, and is a welcome complement to my Emerging Contaminants legislation, signed into state law this year.""“The health risks posed by PFAS contamination in our nation’s waterways to communities across the country are well documented, and we are grateful for this announcement to reintroduce critical legislation to stop contamination at its source,"" said Earthjustice Legislative Counsel Christine Santillana. ""By establishing effluent standards for PFAS for several industries, we can hold polluters accountable and protect communities from dangerous contamination. We applaud Senator Gillibrand and Representative Pappas for their leadership and plans to reintroduce this bill to protect families and our waterways from PFAS.” “Industries shouldn’t be able to dump as much PFAS as they like into nearby rivers, streams, and lakes, putting the health of their neighbors at risk,” said Melanie Benesh, Legislative Attorney at the Environmental Working Group. “The Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act is a critical piece of legislation that will ensure that the EPA acts quickly to turn off the tap on some of the most notorious PFAS polluting industries,”The bill includes nine priority industry categories to further expand on current EPA standards. These priority industry categories include: Organic Chemicals, Plastics and Synthetic Fibers (OCPSF); pulp, paper, and paperboard; textile mills; electroplating; metal finishing; leather tanning and finishing; paint formulating; electrical and electrical components; and plastics molding and forming.The bill would also authorize $200 million per year in grants to assist Publicly Owned Treatment Works with program implementation, which would be appropriated through Fiscal Years 2022-2026."

https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/senator-gillibrand-announces-plan-to-slash-drug-prices-during-visit-to-suny-upstate-medical-university,"Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand announced her policy package to slash prescription drug prices, the “Gillibrand Prescription for Lower Drug Prices,” during her visit to SUNY Upstate Medical University and pushed congressional leadership to take action on reducing drug prices. Joined by State Senator John Mannion, Dr. Mantosh Dewan, President of SUNY Upstate Medical University, County Legislator Peggy Chase, County Legislature Minority Leader Christopher Ryan, and Syracuse Common Council President Helen Hudson, Gillibrand outlined the tenets of the bill package, which would help tackle the high cost of prescription drugs.“While our nation is recovering from the pandemic, drug prices remain unacceptably high, which puts a heavy financial burden on older adults and families in Syracuse and across the country,” said Senator Gillibrand, member of the Aging Committee. “I am releasing the ‘Gillibrand Prescription for Lower Drug Prices’ plan to provide a framework for slashing drug prices. From fighting price gouging to importing affordable drugs from Canada to enabling Medicare to negotiate drug prices, this plan will help us bring down costs for countless Americans.”State Senator John W. Mannion (D-Syracuse) said, “The cost of prescription and maintenance medications can be crippling for families and I’m grateful for Senator Gillibrand’s leadership to lower drug costs in Central New York and across the country. It is unconscionable for anyone to be forced to choose between paying for needed medicine or paying their bills.  I am confident that Senator Gillibrand’s legislation will lead to more affordable health care, more access to medications, and better health outcomes for patients.”“Just as families cope with high costs for lifesaving prescription drugs, so do safety net hospitals like ours. On behalf of SUNY Upstate Medical University, our retail pharmacy, and the thousands of patients we treat every year, we are grateful for Senator Gillibrand’s leadership toward making prescription medications more affordable,” said Mantosh Dewan, MD, president of SUNY Upstate Medical University.“As a nurse I have often seen people  ignore their health issues because they felt they could not afford medical care, especially pharmaceuticals,” said Legislator Peggy Chase. “This only leads to eventual big expensive medical problems.  Many seniors only have Medicare Insurance. Having better coverage for seniors, especially those with low income, is a huge step in keeping people healthy.”“With the rising cost of prescription drugs, people are having to make choices and some of those choices are not necessarily healthy choices. But with prescription drug prices changing rapidly, being excluded from the formulary puts citizens in a horrible position,” said Syracuse Common Council President Helen Hudson.The core pieces of the “Gillibrand Prescription for Lower Drug Prices” are:Reimagine financial assistance for Medicare. Legislation to create the Medicare Cost Assistance Program, a new, streamlined program to provide assistance with Medicare Part A and Part B premiums and cost-sharing for low-income individuals. This would reimagine financial assistance for Medicare Part A, Part B and Part D. The legislation would also expand and streamline administration of the Extra Help program to provide premium and cost-sharing assistance to eligible low-income individuals with Medicare Part D.Review brand-name price gouging. Legislation that would level the market for Americans purchasing prescription drugs by pegging the price in the United States to the median price in Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Japan.Empower Medicare to negotiate drug prices. A bill that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs under Medicare Part D.Import lower-cost drugs from Canada. Legislation to allow patients, pharmacists and wholesalers to import safe, affordable medicine from Canada and other major countries.Expand subsidies to seniors living in U.S. territories. Legislation that would make Medicare beneficiaries in U.S. territories, such as Puerto Rico, eligible for the Medicare Part D Low Income Subsidy program. Under current law, low-income Medicare beneficiaries in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories are ineligible for Medicare Part D subsidies. This program, known as “Extra Help,” provides federal subsidies to help low-income seniors with their monthly premiums and other out-of-pocket prescription drug costs.Under current law, the secretary of HHS is prohibited from negotiating lower drug prices on behalf of Medicare Part D beneficiaries. In contrast, other government programs, like Medicaid and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), are allowed to negotiate. According to a recent report by the Government Accountability Office, Medicare paid twice as much for the same prescription drugs as the VA in 2017.In 2020, five of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. made nearly $45 billion in profits. That same year, in the midst of a twin public health and economic crisis, drug makers raised the prices of more than 860 prescription drugs by 5%, on average. In 2020, the average annual cost of therapy for widely used specialty drugs was more than $84,000. This is nearly three times the median income for people on Medicare and more than four and half times the average Social Security retirement benefit."

https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/icymi-gillibrand-op-ed-in-the-journal-news-our-public-schools-need-more-support,"In case you missed it, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Representative Jamaal Bowman (D-NY-16) published an op-ed in the Journal News calling on the federal government to provide more resources for our nation’s public schools. Gillibrand and Bowman advocate for high-quality college and career pathways for all students, access to wrap-around services, and measures to address ongoing teacher shortages. Read the full op-ed here or below:  The Journal News: Pandemic shows schools need resourcesU.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Representative Jamaal Bowman | April 24, 2022Education is primarily the responsibility of our state and local governments. That is true. But the pandemic has put a spotlight on the needs of our nation’s public schools and brought a new urgency to the federal government’s responsibility to best support elementary, middle and high schools in urban, suburban, and rural communities across America. The federal government – and Congress, specifically – must fulfill their responsibility of ensuring that students and their families have the resources and supports they need, and that our schools and school districts have the tools required to best serve all students and teachers.Our schools are a pillar of our democracy and a cornerstone of our economy. We cannot forget that and we cannot be derelict in our duty to ensure that as essential, critical infrastructure, federal resources support public education and incentivize our public schools to adhere to key principles that will best serve current and future generations.Our education policies must start with the question 'What do kids need?' and public schools should serve as the center of our communities to provide those things. One way to ensure this is to increase community schools which help expand timely and meaningful access to wrap-around services for students, families and communities, including for basic needs. The full-service community school model can support comprehensive learning, social, and health services for students and community members outside of the typical school day and must offer expanded learning opportunities, integrated student supports, and inclusive family and community engagement.Schools must also have the resources to take care of the whole child. Districts, schools and educators must be provided the tools they need to address the well-being needs of students, including their physical and mental health needs. They should each have the ability to ensure a well-rounded education for all students.We must also recognize that not every student follows the same pathway and our schools should be designed to support a meaningfully accessible, high-quality college and career pathway for all students. These should include dual enrollment opportunities; coursework and other opportunities to be prepared for, and connected to, careers in STEM, cyber, education, and the arts; continuous pathways between high school and work; and access to engage in work-based learning opportunities to earn credit or credentials.A professional educator workforce is a critical ingredient in any recipe for success. That means it is time to address the causes of the teacher shortage in order to recruit and retain a high-quality, diverse teacher workforce. We must ensure better pay and benefits for teachers, support their education through loan forgiveness and full college tuition reimbursement, and strengthen teacher preparation programs through apprenticeships and residencies.It cannot take another public health emergency to get people talking about the critical need for our students to be in a high-quality school every day. It shouldn’t take another crisis for us to direct needed resources to our nation’s public schools. The time is now to ensure that school leadership and teachers, students, their families and their communities, be part of the decision-making processes in emergencies and get the resources they need to stay safe, healthy and well educated.What does that mean? It means that schools must remain on the top of the priority list for resources that can keep them safe and open. It means teachers must be supported and the structure of our educator workforce must be designed to keep school employees safe and able to continue their work in high-performing settings. And, it means that our public schools should be seen as a hub for our democracy and a pinnacle of our communities – and we all must feel a responsibility and take actions to contribute to their success."
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrand-kildee-introduce-landmark-bill-to-protect-firefighters-from-toxic-pfaschemicals-used-in-firefighting-foam,"Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Representative Dan Kildee (MI-05) held a video press conference to announce the introduction of their landmark bill, the PFAS Firefighter Protection Act. Per- and polyfluoroalykl substances (PFAS) are a class of toxic chemicals found in a special foam used to fight fires called aqueous film forming foam (AFFF), and have been linked to certain cancers, thyroid disease, reproductive problems, decreased immune function in children, and other serious adverse health effects. For years, firefighters have been exposed to these chemicals through the use of AFFF and face a higher risk of developing cancer and other diseases. This bill would ban firefighting foam containing PFAS chemicals. Gillibrand and Kildee were joined by Liz Hitchcock, Director of Safer Chemicals Healthy Families, the federal policy program of Toxic-Free Future, and Edward A. Kelly, General President of the International Association of Fire Fighters. during the press conference.“PFAS chemicals in firefighting foam jeopardize the health, safety, and well-being of firefighters who have put their lives on the line to protect our communities. To make matters worse, the runoff from this foam can quickly lead to widespread PFAS contamination in the drinking water of surrounding communities near the facilities where it is used,” said Senator Gillibrand. “AFFF is harming our firefighters, our military communities, and innocent families who live near these facilities, and it has to stop. My PFAS Firefighter Protection Act would do just that by permanently banning the use of harmful firefighting foam in the United States.”“For decades, firefighters have been exposed to toxic PFAS chemicals in firefighting foam, which are known to cause cancer and other health issues,” said Congressman Kildee. “Our firefighters put themselves in harm's way to protect us––and we must protect them by getting rid of PFAS chemicals in firefighting foam. I am proud to introduce this legislation with Sen. Gillibrand to protect our brave firefighters.”""PFAS firefighting foams have contaminated drinking water for communities in New York State and across the country. States from Washington and California to Colorado and New York have banned PFAS foams. Fluorine-free foams are available and in use around the world, with more and more entering the marketplace. It's time for the federal government to ban these dangerous toxic foams to protect firefighters and the communities they serve,"" said Liz Hitchcock, Director of Safer Chemicals Healthy Families, the federal policy program of Toxic-Free Future""Fire fighters serve as this nation’s frontline emergency responders. While combatting fires, our members are exposed to PFAS-laden firefighting foams. This exposure subjects us to higher risks of occupational cancer and other life-threatening diseases. The time has long passed to accept this as a hazard of our work,” said Edward A. Kelly, General President of the International Association of Fire Fighters. “The 326,000 members of the IAFF support Senators Gillibrand’s legislation banning the manufacture and distribution of toxic PFAS-laden foams, and she has my gratitude for taking up this battle with us to save lives and communities from this deadly exposure.”“For decades, PFAS-laden firefighting foam has been one of the biggest sources of pollution from toxic forever chemicals, especially in communities near military bases, airports, and fire training sites,” said Melanie Benesh, Environmental Working Group Legislative Attorney. “It’s also a major source of exposure for the firefighters who risk their lives to protect those communities and suffer from higher rates of cancer and other serious health harms. Safer alternatives to PFAS in firefighting foams are already widely available and PFAS Firefighter Protection Act will finally turn off the tap on this use of PFAS.” Congress has already passed legislation removing the legal requirement for AFFF containing PFAS to be used at many commercial airports and military installations. To better protect our firefighters in New York and across the country, Senator Gillibrand’s legislation would go a step further by putting prohibitions in place against firefighting foam containing PFAS chemicals. Specifically, the PFAS Firefighter Protection Act would:Experts estimate that the drinking water supplies of more than 200 million Americans are contaminated with PFAS. PFAS chemicals do not break down in the environment and have been found in groundwater and drinking water across the United States, and are commonly used in products like firefighting foam, water-repellent clothing, and nonstick cookware, among others.For the full bill, please click here."

This is the gold standard; it is what our veterans have earned, and our bipartisan coalition will not stop fighting until this bill passes the Senate and is signed into law.""In March 2022, the House of Representatives passed the Honoring Our PACT Act, which included provisions of Senator Gillibrand’s Presumptive Benefits for War Fighters Exposed to Burn Pits and Other Toxins Act. Gillibrand originally introduced the bipartisan and bicameral War Fighters Act alongside Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), Congressman Raul Ruiz (D-CA) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA).The bill would create a presumptive service connection for over 20 categories of diseases and streamline the process for veterans to obtain benefits from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). It would remove the “burden of proof” from the veteran to provide enough evidence to establish a direct service connection between their health condition and exposure. Rather, the veteran would only need to submit documentation that they received a campaign medal associated with the Global War on Terror or the Gulf War and they suffer from a qualifying health condition. Campaign medals are awarded to members of the armed forces who deploy for military operations in a designated combat zone or geographical theater.The War Fighters Act would cover a wide range of cancers and respiratory illnesses as presumptive conditions, including: asthma that was diagnosed after service, head cancer of any type, neck cancer of any type, respiratory cancer of any type, gastrointestinal cancer of any type, reproductive cancer of any type, lymphoma cancer of any type, lymphomatic cancer of any type, kidney cancer, brain cancer, melanoma, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, constrictive bronchiolitis or obliterative bronchiolitis, emphysema, granulomatous disease, interstitial lung disease, pleuritis, pulmonary fibrosis, and sarcoidosis.The following organizations support the bill: IAVA, The American Legion, Vietnam Veterans of America, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Wounded Warrior Project, Reserve Officers Association, Military Order of the Purple Heart, Burn Pits 360, Green Beret Foundation, Go2 Foundation for Lung Cancer, Dixon Center, National Veterans Legal Services Program (NVLSP), Military Veterans Advocacy, Veterans for Common Sense, Sgt.

https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrand-pushes-for-legislation-to-limit-levels-of-toxic-heavy-metals-in-baby-food,"Following a congressional investigation that found that many top-brand baby foods contain dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand is announcing her support of the Baby Food Safety Act. Exposure to toxic heavy metals endangers infant neurological development and may cause a variety of health issues, including permanent decreases in IQ, disruptive behavior, or socialization challenges in growing children. The Baby Food Safety Act would limit the amount of lead, mercury, arsenic, and cadmium contained in baby food by imposing strict requirements on manufacturers to regularly test and verify that their baby foods are under new, lowered limits for these substances. The legislation would also require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to further lower limits for toxic metals within two years, to put regulations in place within three years, and to review the regulatory limits every five years. “It is outrageous that trusted brands are knowingly selling toxic baby food to unsuspecting parents,” said Senator Gillibrand. “Lead and other heavy metals cause serious and permanent damage to our children’s health. We must act now to keep our kids safe and I’m proud to be introducing this bill that will do just that.” A recent investigative report from Politico found serious deficiencies in the FDA’s efforts to keep toxic elements out of baby food. The baby food industry currently self-regulates and often disregards its own standards for toxic heavy metals. Many brands of juice, candy, and water have also been found to contain high levels of lead and cadmium. The bill was sponsored by Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and was also cosponsored by Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA).The full text of the legislation is available here. "

The proposed updates to the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance), detailed in a recent report from the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment, would help create safe and good-paying jobs, that are also accessible to those in historically marginalized communities, including people of color, women, returning citizens, veterans, and other workers facing barriers to employment.   “As we begin to make critical, long overdue investments in our nation’s infrastructure, we must also prioritize the needs of communities that have historically been left behind,” said Senator Gillibrand. “Too often, federal policies have overlooked the needs of disadvantaged and underserved communities—and in many cases, have actually hurt them. As states and localities begin to receive funding from the historic Infrastructure and Jobs Act, we can’t repeat the mistakes of the past. I urge the White House to promptly update the Uniform Guidance to ensure that local communities receive the full benefits of federal funding - this means prioritizing local hire programs, creating opportunity for marginalized communities, and ensuring that all workers on federal projects have the right to unionize.”“The bipartisan infrastructure package that President Biden signed into law last year included a provision to allow agencies like L.A. Metro to prioritize the hiring of local Angelenos for transportation projects that are taking place in their own backyard. While this was a momentous step, we can’t stop there. As our economy recovers from this crushing pandemic, we need to ensure that we are coming back better than before and stronger than before.

This report represents an important opportunity to strengthen unions, lift up workers, and ensure local communities reap the full benefits of federal funding.  We are committed to working with the Biden administration to implement the recommendations included in the report. The report encourages OMB to explore and identify opportunities to update the Uniform Guidance, which dictates how states and localities can spend federal money. Proposed updates include: Allow states and localities to consider job, wage, and worker empowerment impacts when contracting with federal funds;Ensure states and localities have the freedom to apply worker-empowering, high-road conditions, including local hire and project labor agreement (PLA) obligations, on their subgrantees; andEnsure federal financial assistance programs cannot be used to deny workers the right to organize.We strongly support these proposed updates and encourage OMB to begin formally updating the Uniform Guidance to include these new provisions. We want to be able to create fulfilling, safe, high-road jobs for our constituents, and make them accessible to communities that have not traditionally had access to jobs on projects funded through federal awards - especially for people of color, women, returning citizens, veterans, and other workers facing barriers to employment. We applaud the Biden administration’s work around the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), a historic investment in our nation’s infrastructure that will enhance our competitiveness and create good-paying jobs. As states and cities begin receiving federal funding from this new law, we ask that OMB issue an interim guidance supporting these changes. This would allow states and cities to broadly implement policies, like local and targeted hire, while OMB proceeds with the formal update of the Uniform Guidance. The interim guidance would also align with Section 25019 of the IIJA, which removes the prohibition on local hire for transportation construction projects.  Excitingly, the Department of Transportation has already started to implement this provision by including local hire in their selection criteria for the next round of Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grants. We hope the projects funded by RAISE grants illustrate the benefits of local hire and embolden OMB to issue the interim guidance, allowing local hire on other projects funded through the IIJA.Updating the Uniform Guidance is a crucial step to connecting good-paying, family-sustaining jobs to the communities that need them the most. Local hire programs can help communities address historic inequities by creating on-ramps to construction careers for low-income workers, who are more likely to be people of color. Money earned by those workers strengthens local economies by channeling resources back into their communities.We look forward to working with the Biden administration to empower state and local recipients of federal funds to take substantial strides in improving job creation, quality, and equity for workers in hundreds of industries across the United States.“As we begin to make critical, long overdue investments in our nation’s infrastructure, we must also prioritize the needs of communities that have historically been left behind,” said Senator Gillibrand. “Too often, federal policies have overlooked the needs of disadvantaged and underserved communities—and in many cases, have actually hurt them.

This report represents an important opportunity to strengthen unions, lift up workers, and ensure local communities reap the full benefits of federal funding.  We are committed to working with the Biden administration to implement the recommendations included in the report.  The report encourages OMB to explore and identify opportunities to update the Uniform Guidance, which dictates how states and localities can spend federal money. Proposed updates include:   We strongly support these proposed updates and encourage OMB to begin formally updating the Uniform Guidance to include these new provisions. We want to be able to create fulfilling, safe, high-road jobs for our constituents, and make them accessible to communities that have not traditionally had access to jobs on projects funded through federal awards - especially for people of color, women, returning citizens, veterans, and other workers facing barriers to employment. We applaud the Biden administration’s work around the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), a historic investment in our nation’s infrastructure that will enhance our competitiveness and create good-paying jobs. As states and cities begin receiving federal funding from this new law, we ask that OMB issue an interim guidance supporting these changes. This would allow states and cities to broadly implement policies, like local and targeted hire, while OMB proceeds with the formal update of the Uniform Guidance.  The interim guidance would also align with Section 25019 of the IIJA, which removes the prohibition on local hire for transportation construction projects.  Excitingly, the Department of Transportation has already started to implement this provision by including local hire in their selection criteria for the next round of Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grants. We hope the projects funded by RAISE grants illustrate the benefits of local hire and embolden OMB to issue the interim guidance, allowing local hire on other projects funded through the IIJA. Updating the Uniform Guidance is a crucial step to connecting good-paying, family-sustaining jobs to the communities that need them the most. Local hire programs can help communities address historic inequities by creating on-ramps to construction careers for low-income workers, who are more likely to be people of color. Money earned by those workers strengthens local economies by channeling resources back into their communities. We look forward to working with the Biden administration to empower state and local recipients of federal funds to take substantial strides in improving job creation, quality, and equity for workers in hundreds of industries across the United States."

The funding was allocated through the Federal Aviation Administration and will be used to rehabilitate a runway to maintain the structural integrity of the pavement and extend its useful life.“This one-two combo from the CARES Act and American Rescue Plan will help Buffalo Niagara International Airport reach new heights and accelerate Western New York’s regional economic takeoff,” said Senator Schumer. “Air travel was among the most severely impacted industries amid the height of the pandemic, which is why I fought so hard to include much needed federal relief to vital economic engines like the Buffalo Niagara Airport. As Majority Leader, I am proud to deliver this funding for these essential upgrades to keep local air travel safe & efficient  and boost Western New York’s largest travel hub to soar like never before.”“Buffalo Niagara International is one of our state’s busiest airports. It plays a critical role in welcoming tourists from around the country and the world and helping our upstate economy thrive,” said Senator Gillibrand. “These grants will fund critical repairs and ensure that the airport remains safe and efficient. I’m proud to have worked to pass the legislation that delivered this funding and I’ll keep fighting tooth and nail to bring federal dollars home to Buffalo.” This funding comes from two separate grants. The first awards $14,435,749.00 of funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) of 2020 to complete the second phase of the project, which consists of the rehabilitation of 1,800 feet of the 8,829 foot runway. The second grant awards $13,333,333.00 of funding from the American Rescue Plan to complete the project’s third phase, which consists of rehabilitating an additional 3,159 feet.Senator Gillibrand previously delivered $10 million in federal funding to Buffalo Niagara International Airport for runway repairs and rehabilitation. "

The Local 186 Pension Plan, which covers 379 participants in the construction industry, became insolvent in July 2021. This funding will enable the pension plan to restore all benefit reductions caused by the plan’s insolvency and to make payments to retirees to cover prior benefit reductions. “Insolvent pension plans should not deprive workers and their families of the benefits they have worked hard to earn,” said Senator Gillibrand. “I’m proud to have fought to pass the American Rescue Plan, which provided the funding to protect the retirement security of nearly 400 construction workers in Massena and I’ll continue working to ensure that our seniors are financially secure.” The Special Financial Assistance Program was enacted as part of President Biden’s American Rescue Plan and will provide benefits to over 250 severely underfunded multiemployer pension plans."
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrand-blackburn-and-smith-meet-with-ukrainian-civil-society-leaders,"Today, U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Tina Smith (D-MN) met with leaders of Ukrainian civil society, Olena Tregub and Maria Berlinksa. Olena Tregub has an extensive career focusing on corruption prevention in Ukraine and since 2017, has served as a secretary general of NAKO (the Independent Defense Anti-Corruption Committee). Maria Berlinksa is a Ukrainian military volunteer and women’s rights advocate who volunteered for the War in Donbas as an aerial reconnaissance drone operator and who has championed women’s integration into the Ukrainian Armed Forces.Gillibrand and Moran had previously met with members of Ukrainian civil society in March on a bipartisan Senate delegation visit to Poland and Germany. The group discussed updates on the ongoing war and atrocities in Ukraine and additional U.S. government aid. “The images and testimony revealing the ongoing atrocities in Ukraine are horrifying,” said Senator Gillibrand. “Hundreds of innocent civilians in Bucha have been killed at the hands of Putin and his generals, and they must be held accountable for their war crimes. I am grateful to Olena and Maria for their insight and expertise, and I will work to ensure that the U.S. continues providing defensive weaponry to our allies and leveling crushing sanctions that starve Putin’s war machine. As Americans, we remain united with the people of Ukraine in their fight for freedom.” “Every day we hear more stories and receive sickening images of the atrocities committed by Russian troops against Ukrainians,” said Senator Moran. “I appreciate Olena and Maria meeting with us to share their own experiences and insight on how the United States can help the people of Ukraine. During my visit to Poland and at the Ukrainian border, I heard over and over that the aid we had promised wasn’t enough and needs to arrive faster. I recently called on the White House to expedite the delivery of weapons and aid to Ukraine and our allies so Ukraine can win this fight.”“Ukrainian civil leaders Olena Tregub and Maria Berlinksa have demonstrated a fearless resolve to stand for freedom,” said Senator Blackburn. “They shared details about on the ground conditions and made it abundantly clear that the United States cannot waver in our support of Ukrainian people.”"

I was honored to cast my vote to confirm Justice Jackson to the Supreme Court and look forward to seeing her build a long and distinguished career.”"
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/following-her-senate-armed-services-hearing-on-suicide-in-the-armed-forces-senator-gillibrand-announces-letter-to-secretary-austin-calling-for-timely-access-to-mental-health-care-for-service-members,"Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, chair of the Senate Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee, held a hearing on suicide in the armed forces and, subsequently, held a video press conference to discuss findings from the morning’s hearing and her Senate priorities to address the rising toll of suicide in the military. Last week, the Department of Defense released a new report showing that 518 service members died by suicide in 2021, and the suicide rate among active-duty personnel rose to its highest level ever recorded in 2020. As deaths by suicide continue to spike, Senator Gillibrand is calling on Department of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to address lapses in delivering timely access to mental health care for service members.“The men and women of our armed forces pledge their lives to serve our country and we have an obligation to take care of them in return. Today, in my capacity as chair of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel, I convened experts and military leaders to address the epidemic of suicide among our service members and learn more about the steps being taken to combat future tragedies,” said Senator Gillibrand. “I am alarmed by the spiking rates in suicide recently reported by the DoD and have called on Secretary Austin to address this issue head-on. I remain steadfastly committed to closing gaps in mental health coverage and the challenges far too many of our service members are facing.” A study released last year by the Costs of War Project found that, since September 11th, suicides among active-duty personnel and veterans of post-9/11 conflicts have outpaced military operation deaths four to one. In 2019, 156 veterans in New York died by suicide — one nearly every other day — and veterans die by suicide in New York at a much higher rate than the overall state population. This tragic pattern continued when late last year, three 10th Mountain Division soldiers at Fort Drum lost their lives to suspected suicide within three days.Senator Gillibrand has been a staunch advocate for increasing access to mental health services in order to combat the scourge of suicide in the military. Last year, Senator Gillibrand secured key provisions of the Brandon Act, named in Brandon Caserta’s honor, in the NDAA, which will allow service members to access confidential mental health evaluation referrals without fear of retaliation. She also fought to secure improved health care benefits and TRICARE coverage, including a pilot program that will ensure beneficiaries receive direct assistance identifying appropriate mental health providers within the direct care system or TRICARE network when referred for mental health care services. In 2019, Senator Gillibrand used her position as chair of the Personnel Subcommittee to raise the issue of suicide and access to mental health services in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, and again during a press conference in 2021. She has also previously called on the Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense to improve the support veterans receive during their transition from military service to civilian life.The full text of the letter is available here or below:  Dear Secretary Austin For two decades, the Department of Defense (DoD) has struggled to address the mental health needs of our men and women in uniform throughout the Global War on Terror. Despite recognition of this epidemic, the number of those who have taken their own lives has increased. In 2021, 30,177 active duty personnel and veterans who served in the military after 9/11 died by suicide compared to the 7,057 service members killed in combat in those same 20 years. U.S. Army Alaska alone experienced 17 suicides in 2021—more suicide deaths than in the previous two years combined.Many service members and their families across the DoD experience long waits to see mental health counselors and there is a lack of resources available to treat those in crisis. Delays in care are unacceptable for our young men and women that have pledged their lives to serve our country. While I agree with your decision to include Alaska in the DoD’s Suicide Prevention and Response Independent Review Committee (SPRIRC), service members experiencing mental health crises require timely assistance and should not have to wait for access to mental health resources. I ask that you immediately assess the access service members have to timely mental health care. I fear that these suicides could have been prevented if there were adequate resources to help those struggling.I intend to require DoD have licensed behavioral health providers available to conduct yearly in person mental health exams and pre-separation exams for all service members. Too often the DoD has delegated this requirement to untrained personnel allowing those struggling with mental health issues to potentially slip through the cracks. Service members contemplating suicide need urgent help and should never have to experience lengthy delays to see a mental health counselor. These situations are matters of life or death for those seeking help. As chair of the Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee, today I held a hearing on mental health and suicide in the Armed Forces in order to determine what resources and actions are needed to prevent suicide and address mental health among our service members. I ask that you put forth all resources required to address this critical issue for our military personnel and their families. "
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/-gillibrand-announces-over-7-million-in-federal-funding-for-public-health-americorps-projects-in-new-york-state,"Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand announced $7,082,762 in federal funding for seven Public Health AmeriCorps projects in New York State. Public Health AmeriCorps is a joint initiative between AmeriCorps and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was established in the American Rescue Plan in order to support the recruitment, training, and development of young public health leaders. The funding will support 275 new Public Health AmeriCorps members in New York who will work to meet a variety of public health needs in local communities, including COVID-19 response and recovery services, family health education, and care management services.“Over the past two years, the COVID-19 pandemic has put our health care system and providers in desperate need of reinforcements,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This federal funding is a critical investment in the next generation of public health leaders. Public Health AmeriCorps members will serve on the front lines to provide low-income communities with improved access to health education and care and provide surge capacity as we continue to battle the pandemic. I’m proud to have fought to pass the American Rescue Plan, which provided the funding to make this project possible, and I’ll keep fighting to ensure that New York is prepared for future health crises.” This funding was secured through Senator Gillibrand’s public workforce package included in the American Rescue Plan, which contained over $7 billion to recruit and hire public health workers to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future public health needs. This included $400 million to launch a new public health workforce program, Public Health AmeriCorps, jointly through the CDC and the Corporation for National and Community Service.More details about funding recipients and projects below:RecipientAmountCityAmeriCorps MembersProjectPublic Health Solutions$115,189New York4Provide needs assessments and navigation services to low-income families in underserved areas of Queens, New YorkCommunity Health Care Association of NYS$2,600,000New York101Provide family health education and care management services to individuals in Community Health Centers (CHCs) across New York StateNew York City Office of the Mayor$2,246,000New York80Perform public health-related direct service and capacity-building activities in New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) developments and with nonprofit partnersRonald McDonald House New York$115,000New York4Build the infrastructure needed to advance health equity outcomes for underserved medically complex children and their families receiving care at public and safety-net hospitals in New York CityConcrete Safaris Inc.$687,696New York24Conduct environmental health literacy and place-based service-learning interventions and refer participants for medical and wrap-around services in East HarlemRural Health Network of South Central New York$684,377Binghamton40 Provide health access services and increase capacity in upstate New York counties, primarily the rural Southern TierCity of Rochester$634,300Rochester22Provide COVID-19 response and recovery services, assist in establishing neighborhood preventative health clinics, facilitate youth mentoring and trainings in public health and mental health education and awareness within high-poverty, urban and marginalized neighborhoods in Rochester"
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrand-colleagues-introduce-the-bipartisan-support-kids-not-red-tape-act-bill-would-help-schools-continue-to-provide-free-meals-to-low-income-students,"U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand joined 51 of her colleagues to introduce the bipartisan Support Kids Not Red Tape Act. The bill would extend USDA pandemic school meal waivers that have helped students access much-needed meals throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This bill would extend school meal waivers to September 2023 as they are currently set to expire on June 30, 2022. These flexibilities limit burdensome paperwork requirements and provide schools with additional support to deal with rising costs and supply chain issues, allowing them to continue to provide meals to students throughout the school year and over the summer.“Thousands of children across New York State rely on school meals - for many, it’s their only reliable source of food each day. As food costs continue to skyrocket and families struggle to put food on the table, we can’t let our children go hungry,” said Senator Gillibrand. “That’s why I’m proud to introduce this critical legislation. The Support Kids Not Red Tape Act will empower local schools to tailor their meal programs to the needs of their communities and help ensure that low-income kids always know where their next meal is coming from.”Senator Gillibrand has led the fight against child hunger since the beginning of the pandemic. In 2020, following her push, USDA approved New York State’s Pandemic-EBT program, which provides nutritional resources to families that lost access to free or reduced-price school meals. She also urged USDA to extend flexibilities for school meal programs so that students could access meals regardless of school opening status. Last year, Gillibrand pushed to permanently implement a universal school meals program that would provide free school meals to all students. Finally, Senator Gillibrand introduced the bipartisan Summer Meals Act, which would relax the Summer Food Service Program eligibility threshold, reduce red tape for programs that provide meals during both the school year and the summer, and improve access to nutrition in rural, underserved, and hard-to-reach areas.The Support Kids Not Red Tape Act was introduced by Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) was also co-sponsored by Senators Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Susan Collins (R-ME), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Bob Casey (D-PA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Tina Smith (D-MN), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Ed Markey (D-MA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Jack Reed (D-RI), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Mark Warner (D-VA), Patty Murray (D-WA), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Chris Coons (D-DE), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tom Carper (D-DE), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Gary Peters (D-MI), Angus King (I-ME), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Chris Murphy (D-CT), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Jon Ossoff (D-GA), Jon Tester (D-MT), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Maria Cantwell (D-WA).The legislation has been endorsed by the Mayors Alliance to End Childhood Hunger as well as nearly 2,000 anti-hunger, nutrition, education, children’s, school, preschool, and out of school providers, faith groups and industry groups. The full text of the legislation is available here. "

Joined by CEO of University of Rochester Medical Faculty Group Dr. Mike Rotondo, Chief Pharmacy Officer at University of Rochester Medical Center Dr. Curt Haas, and Monroe County Executive Adam Bello, Gillibrand outlined the tenets of the bill package, which would help tackle the high cost of prescription drugs.“While our nation is recovering from the pandemic, drug prices remain unacceptably high, which puts a heavy financial burden on older adults families in Rochester and across the country,” said Senator Gillibrand, member of the Aging Committee. “I am releasing the ‘Gillibrand Prescription for Lower Drug Prices’ plan to provide a framework for slashing drug prices. From fighting price gouging to importing affordable drugs from Canada to enabling Medicare to negotiate drug prices, this plan will help us bring down costs for countless Americans.”“Rising drug prices not only increase the out-of-pocket financial burden on patients, they drive up the cost of care across the nation’s entire health care system. We know that patients often end up in the hospital when they cannot afford to take their medications as prescribed, one of many reasons it is critical to provide people at all income levels access to the medications they need to get and stay healthy.  We thank Senator Gillibrand for calling attention to this important issue,” said Mike Rotondo, MD, CEO of the University of Rochester Medical Faculty Group, Vice Dean for Clinical Affairs in the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry.“The unrelenting year-over-year increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals is the fastest growing contributor to overall costs of care. Innovative drug therapies hold great potential, but dramatic increases in the price of both new and existing drugs threatens to make them inaccessible to patients and the providers who care for them.  We appreciate Senator Gillibrand’s efforts, which should help reduce unwarranted barriers to care for many patients,” said Curt Haas, Pharm.D., Chief Pharmacy Officer, University of Rochester Medical Center.“As prices rise on food, gas and other necessities, people shouldn’t have to worry about whether they can afford prescription drugs. I fully support Senator Gillibrand’s fight to pass new legislation to keep the cost of vital prescription drugs in line with what other countries pay,” said Monroe County Executive Adam Bello. “Thank you, Sen. Gillibrand, for advocating on behalf of Monroe County residents and all New Yorkers.” The core pieces of the “Gillibrand Prescription for Lower Drug Prices” are:Under current law, the secretary of HHS is prohibited from negotiating lower drug prices on behalf of Medicare Part D beneficiaries. In contrast, other government programs, like Medicaid and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), are allowed to negotiate. According to a recent report by the Government Accountability Office, Medicare paid twice as much for the same prescription drugs as the VA in 2017 In 2020, five of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. made nearly $45 billion in profits. That same year, in the midst of a twin public health and economic crisis, drug makers raised the prices of more than 860 prescription drugs by 5%, on average. In 2020, the average annual cost of therapy for widely used specialty drugs was more than $84,000. This is nearly three times the median income for people on Medicare and more than four and half times the average Social Security retirement benefit. "

Joined by Mayor of Cohoes Bill Keeler, Assembly Member John McDonald, and Deputy Director of the New York StateWide Senior Action Council Gail Myers, Gillibrand outlined the tenets of the bill package, which would help tackle the high cost of prescription drugs.“While our nation is recovering from the pandemic, drug prices remain unacceptably high, which puts a heavy financial burden on older adults and families in Cohoes and across the country,” said Senator Gillibrand, member of the Aging Committee. “I am releasing the ‘Gillibrand Prescription for Lower Drug Prices’ plan to provide a framework for slashing drug prices. From fighting price gouging to importing affordable drugs from Canada to enabling Medicare to negotiate drug prices, this plan will help us bring down costs for countless Americans.""“In a working class community like Cohoes, access to affordable prescription drugs is not a theoretical policy issue for debate, it is a kitchen table problem to be solved. People should not have to make a choice between paying for food or filling a prescription, but they do,” Mayor Keeler said. “We are grateful for Senator Gillibrand’s leadership in working to find solutions that will protect the health of all in our community, particularly our most vulnerable seniors for whom prescription drugs are often essential but too expensive.”“Thank you to Senator Gillibrand for supporting legislation in Congress to address prescription affordability,” said Assemblymember John T. McDonald III, RPh. “As a practicing pharmacist and state legislator, I understand the obstacles and how the high cost of prescriptions impacts our community members. I will continue to advocate on the state level for legislation that improves our current system and appreciate the partnership of our federal colleagues on this issue""Older New Yorkers are worried about being able to afford their Medicare premiums and their prescription drug costs. We are pleased to stand with Sen. Gillibrand today because she has heard these concerns and knows that economic security for all NYers includes health care benefits that meet their needs,” said Gail Myers, Deputy Director, New York StateWide Senior Action Council. “We thank her for working to raise the income eligibility to 200%FPL for the Medicare Savings Program and the low income subsidy/Extra Help with prescription drug costs.  This measure will put money back into the pockets of lower income Medicare enrollees and help them make ends meet.  Importantly, her efforts to reign in the price of prescription drug costs through other methods, including removing the ban on Medicare negotiating prices, will be transformative for years to come and will be a relief for all New Yorkers."" The core pieces of the “Gillibrand Prescription for Lower Drug Prices” are:Under current law, the secretary of HHS is prohibited from negotiating lower drug prices on behalf of Medicare Part D beneficiaries.

The funding was allocated through the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology and will be used to quantify and research CO2 and methane emissions from urban environments along the Northeast Corridor, including New York City.  “Stony Brook and SUNY are helping New York lead our nation in the fight against climate change. This federal investment will aid SBU’s greenhouse gas emissions research and help New York reach the goals laid out in its groundbreaking climate law, the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act,” said Senator Schumer. “I am proud to deliver federal funding like this to help in the fight against climate change and achieve meaningful reductions in greenhouse gasses, while delivering on justice and equity.”“The Research Foundation for the State University of New York has long been a leader in groundbreaking climate research. I’m thrilled to deliver this investment that will help us better understand urban emissions, particularly from the New York City region,” said Senator Gillibrand. “As we look to reach New York’s 85 percent emission reduction target by 2050, we must have the necessary information to regulate the output of greenhouse gases. This project is an investment in a greener future and I will keep fighting for resources that help us understand and protect our environment.”"

Last spring, Gillibrand, Sanders, Kaptur, Ocasio-Cortez and Pascrell had sent a letter to appropriators pushing for the pilot programs.The pilot programs launched in four cities—Washington D.C., Falls Church, Virginia, Baltimore, MD, and Bronx, NY—to offer customers the ability to convert cash payroll or business checks up to $500 onto a prepaid Visa gift card. However, the lack of marketing of the program has led to very few reported transactions.In the letter, the officials pressed DeJoy to improve marketing of the program, to expand test site locations, price the products more affordably, expand the available services and increase the value of the service it already provides.The lawmakers wrote, “We are writing to ask USPS to expand and improve the services they are offering in the pilot, under their current legal authority, so that more of the needs of the unbanked and underbanked can be addressed, and so that lessons can be learned that can be applied to making postal banking more universal through legislative efforts.”Millions of Americans live in “bank deserts” — regions without immediate access to a brick and mortar bank — and approximately 46 million Americans are considered unbanked or underbanked. Nearly ninety percent of the zip codes lacking a bank or credit union are in rural areas, and low-income communities and communities of color are also historically underserved by mainstream financial services — approximately 30% of Hispanic adults and 40% of Black adults are underbanked or unbanked, and 84% of all unbanked adults have a family income below $25,000.Additionally, establishing permanent postal banking services would strengthen the Postal Service by creating a nonprofit bank that offers low-cost checking and savings accounts, ATMs, mobile banking, and low-interest loans. According to a report from Gillibrand’s office, this proposal would create nearly $19 billion in revenue for the Postal Service each year.Senators Gillibrand, Merkley and Sanders are the lead Senate sponsors of the Postal Banking Act, legislation that would establish permanent essential financial services in post offices in every community. Full text of the letter can be found below.Dear Postmaster General DeJoy,We are writing with regard to the postal banking pilot that the United States Postal Service launched on September 13th in four locations – Washington D.C., Falls Church, Virginia, Baltimore, MD, and Bronx, NY. In these four pilot cities, customers can now convert cash payroll or business checks up to $500 onto a prepaid Visa gift card.While we commend the postal service for taking these actions as first steps, there are several areas that we believe USPS can take right away to improve the pilot. Currently, the transaction has a very high process fee of $5.95. That is nearly $2 more than Walmart charges to convert a $1,000 check onto a similar card. In addition, USPS has done very little marketing or advertising of the expanded service which has led to very few reported transactions. For example, according to postal employees at Baychester Station in the Bronx, not a single business or payroll check transaction was made between September 13, when the pilot launched, and October 31.  A study by the University of Michigan found that sixty-nine percent of census tracts with a post office retail location do not have a community bank branch – that is 14,938 census tracts representing 60 million people. Seventy-five percent of tracts with a post office retail location do not have a credit union branch.  We are writing to ask USPS to expand and improve the services they are offering in the pilot, under their current legal authority, so that more of the needs of the unbanked and underbanked can be addressed, and so that lessons can be learned that can be applied to making postal banking more universal through legislative efforts. The USPS Office of Inspector General (OIG) released a study in 2015 that found that USPS could expand its current offering of financial products under its existing legal authority. This can include expanding check cashing, bill payment services, electronic money transfers, and international money transfers. Furthermore, in addition to this being a critical need for millions of Americans across the country and in rural and urban communities, the USPS OIG estimated that this approach could generate $1.1 billion in annual revenue after 5 years, while covering costs and contributing profits.First, we ask for USPS to significantly expand the test site locations, both to reach more people to achieve greater density in a given geography and to test the service in more diverse geographic areas, including rural, urban and suburban locations.Second, if the idea is to offer services in an affordable way to expand the number of people who can access them, the pricing of the products must be made more affordable.Third, the services provided should be expanded. This should include both expanding the maximum value on the card to $2,000 to serve more Americans who need to be able to cash their paychecks. If an employee is paid bi-weekly at a $15 minimum wage working 40 hours a week, their paycheck will be more than the $500 amount currently allowable.And, finally, USPS should test out other services in a pilot so that we can learn more about what is needed and its impact on serving the unbanked and underbanked. Services should include expanded check cashing and domestic and expanded international wire services.Thank you for your consideration."

The legislation requires the creation of a rule within a year of enactment mandating trucks to have strengthened rear underride guards to stop cars from sliding underneath trucks in the event of a crash. In the letter, the lawmakers also call for DOT to initiate a study on the impact of side underride guards, solicit public input via an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM), and strengthen requirements on any new rule regarding rear underride guards.“The provisions in our Stop Underrides Act will save lives and make our roads safer,” said Senator Gillibrand. “Deaths caused by underride crashes are preventable, and I’m urging the Department of Transportation to quickly implement these measures to help prevent future tragedies. Every day we don’t act, we are losing an opportunity to save the lives of innocent Americans.”“I have long been an advocate of tractor trailer underride guards because I have witnessed the harm done to victims of these crashes and their surviving family and friends such as the death of Michael Higginbotham from my district who was killed in an underride crash in Memphis,” said Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-09), a senior member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. “I was proud to champion and see included several provisions of our bill, the Stop Underrides Act, in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and urge for their expeditious implementation so that we can prevent these horrific crashes and save more lives.”An underride crash occurs when a car slides under a large truck, such as a semi-trailer, during an accident. When these accidents happen, a car’s safety features are rendered useless because most of the car slides under the trailer and the trailer undercarriage crashes straight through the windows and into the passengers. The passengers in the car often suffer severe head and neck injuries, including decapitation. These accidents are often fatal, even at low speeds. Each year, hundreds of people are killed in underride accidents, but this data is estimated to be undercounted due to differences in local police reporting. The full text of the letter is available here or below:  Dear Secretary Buttigieg:We write to you as members of Congress who supported the inclusion of the Underride provisions in the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA, P.L. 117-58). Signed into law on November 15, 2021, this legislation includes requirements for a rule on strengthened rear underride guards to be made within a year of enactment, the creation of a new Advisory Committee on Underride Protection, and the implementation of a study on the impact of side underride guards. These provisions are designed to address the urgent issue of preventable deaths caused by underride crashes, which occur when a car slides under the body of a truck, such as a semi-trailer, during a crash.We urge the Department of Transportation (DOT) to provide clarification on the agency’s schedule for executing these requirements mandated by the IIJA to mitigate underride incidents. We also urge you to utilize the Department’s Office of Research and Technology in order to effectively find solutions for the Department’s Underride Initiative.Additionally, we write to reiterate Congress’ intent on the aforementioned provisions and would like to see DOT, in coordination with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), initiate the following:We urge you to expeditiously establish the Advisory Committee on Underride Protection and to complete the life-saving  side guard research which we hope will lead to a proposed rule on side guards. Together these provisions will help save lives and aim to prevent passenger compartment intrusion from crashes with trucks.Thank you for the steps which you have already taken to address this public safety issue, and please do not hesitate to contact our staff if you have any questions."

https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrand-sanders-introduce-postal-banking-act-to-provide-financial-services-to-underbanked-americans,"Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) reintroduced the Postal Banking Act, legislation that would re-establish postal banking to provide financial security to millions of Americans in low-income and rural communities. The Postal Banking Act would strengthen the Postal Service by establishing a nonprofit bank offering low-cost checking and savings accounts, ATMs, mobile banking, and low-interest loans.At the same time, Gillibrand released an original report, “Postal Banking: Delivering For The American People,” demonstrating that:“As our economy rebounds from the pandemic, it is essential that every American has access to financially safe and reliable banking services,” said Senator Gillibrand. “However, more than 46 million Americans are not having their needs met by our current banking system and often fall prey to predatory lenders who take advantage of them with high fees and interest rates. The Postal Banking Act is a simple solution to a complex problem—it would offer basic financial services at post offices in both rural and urban communities, while simultaneously generating nearly $19 billion per year for the USPS. Put simply: postal banking delivers.”“It is absolutely unacceptable that nearly 50 million people in this country are unbanked or underbanked,” said Sen. Sanders. “What does that mean? That means millions of working people across this country are unable to access basic banking and financial services. That means that working people across this country are forced to face unnecessary barriers to important moments, such as buying a house, starting a business, or saving to send their children to college. That means that working people across this country are too often forced to rely on predatory lenders. This must change. The time has come to put exploitative loan sharks out of business, and guarantee affordable banking options to all Americans through the United States Postal Service.  And that is exactly what our legislation will do.” “All Americans deserve access to affordable banking and financial services. Postal Banking is a critical tool in providing access to the financial system to all Americans. We applaud all members of Congress who like Senator Gillibrand and Senator Sanders, are working together to find solutions to this problem,” said American Postal Workers Union President Mark Dimondstein.The Postal Service employs more than 600,000 workers, including nearly 70,000 vets, and millions of Americans rely on it to deliver their paychecks, prescriptions, and votes. Unfortunately, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has imposed destructive changes that have slowed mail and compromised services for veterans, small businesses, rural communities, seniors, and families who rely on the mail for medicines, essential goods, voting, correspondence, and income.The Postal Banking Act would strengthen the Postal Service by establishing a nonprofit bank offering low-cost checking and savings accounts, ATMs, mobile banking, and low-interest loans. Using a method derived from the USPS Office of Inspector General, the report concludes that this proposal could create nearly $19 billion in revenue for the Postal Service each year. The postal bank would provide financial services to Americans who have been economically devastated by the coronavirus pandemic. Predatory financial services and practices such as prepaid debit cards, rent-to-own stores, and overdraft fees often exploit the most vulnerable populations – including low-income households, rural communities, veterans and families of active duty personnel – especially in times of economic crisis. Instead of turning to these predatory services, families would gain access to traditional basic banking services and safe financial alternatives through the postal bank.The legislation has been endorsed by Alliance for Retired Americans, American Family Voices, Center for Popular Democracy, Color of Change, Family Farm Defenders, Farm Aid, Indivisible, Mainers for Accountable Leadership, MoveOn, NETWORK Lobby Catholics for Social Justice, Our Revolution, and Paragon Florida."

https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/-gillibrand-leads-20-colleagues-in-calling-on-biden-administration-to-continue-and-make-permanent-oshas-emergency-covid-19-protections-for-health-care-workers-protections-have-been-allowed-to-lapse,"As the rise of the Omicron variant continues to threaten the safety of our nation’s health care workforce, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand is leading her colleagues in a letter calling on the Biden administration to continue and make permanent the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) emergency COVID-19 protections for health care workers. The letter addresses OSHA’s announcement at the end of 2021 that it would allow the Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) to lapse, despite the fact that health care workers still face serious safety challenges and workplace risks. Today, more than 120,000 people are hospitalized with COVID-19 nationwide, further straining overworked health care workers and hospitals facing severe staffing shortages. Recent reporting shows that overworked doctors, nurses, and staff have been forced to continue working in unsafe conditions and are concerned for their health and safety.“OSHA’s emergency standard was absolutely necessary to protecting our nation’s health care workers. Implementing a permanent standard will both ensure health care workers have the protections needed to continue their lifesaving work and mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” said Senator Gillibrand. “I urge the Biden administration to take immediate action to issue a rule that will protect health care workers serving on the front lines of this pandemic. As we continue to see record burnout among our health care workforce two years into the pandemic, it is necessary to keep these protections in place to provide the accountability and transparency needed to keep our patients, workers, and communities healthy.”  “It is critical that the federal government ensures that nurses and other healthcare workers are getting the protections we need to do our jobs safely, without putting ourselves or our families at risk of Covid exposure,” said NNU Executive Director Bonnie Castillo, RN. “We can’t safely care for our patients if we are sick ourselves. We thank Senator Gillibrand, Leader Schumer, and every senator who signed this letter, for standing in solidarity with nurses across the country and fighting for the protections that we need to do our jobs safely during this pandemic. The Biden administration must quickly issue a final permanent Covid-19 health care standard—and retain the emergency temporary standard until the permanent standard goes into effect—before one more nurse is sidelined, lost to the profession, or lost to this world for good.” ""As a frontline worker, I live around COVID, as a direct care worker, I and my coworkers deal with COVID daily. It's imperative that we're protected in order to take care of our patients, but also take care of the public.  We love giving care to our patients, but we also need to be safe so that it doesn't spread and so that we don't take it home to our families,” said Scheena Tannis, RN from Brookdale Hospital, 1199SEIU.“These protections are critical to the health and safety of nurses and, in turn, the welfare of our patients. The nation is best served by a Department of Labor advocating for an OSHA standard that gives nurses here in New York -- in all the states -- the confidence in the protections from an airborne virus.  We join Senator Gillibrand and others calling for all provisions of the Emergency Temporary Standard to remain in force while expeditious promulgation of a permanent standard is carried out,” said Pat Kane, RN, Executive Director, New York State Nurses Association In June of 2021, OSHA issued an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) to protect the workers who have shouldered the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide clear standards detailing health care employers’ responsibilities to the safety of their workers. The standard requires employers to identify and control COVID-19 hazards in the workplace, provide access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and adequate ventilation systems, and ensure workers are notified of workplace exposures to COVID-19. This standard also gave health care workers a tool against which to measure their workplace practices, and recourse to OSHA if they felt their workplace was out of compliance.On December 27, 2021, six months after promulgation of the ETS, OSHA announced it was not ready to issue a permanent rule and would let the non-recordkeeping portions of the temporary standard expire. When OSHA issued the ETS in June 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported that 491,816 health care workers had contracted COVID-19 and 1,611 had died. Today, those numbers have nearly doubled, with the CDC reporting that 848,028 health care workers across the nation have contracted COVID-19. Without a permanent rule, the health and well-being of our nation’s health care workers are at risk.This letter is endorsed by the AFL-CIO, NYS AFL-CIO, SEIU, 1199SEIU, 32BJ SEIU, and National Nurses United.This letter is signed by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Bernie Sanders (D-VT), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Tina Smith (D-MN), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Ed Markey (D-MA), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Gary Peters (D-MI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Chris Murphy (D-CT).Congresswoman Dingell led a similar letter in the House of Representatives that has more than 100 co-signers.

https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrand-urges-powell-to-answer-questions-about-stock-trading-by-federal-reserve-officials,"Ahead of the Senate Banking Committee’s confirmation hearing for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand is urging Powell to address the Federal Reserve’s trading rules for Federal Reserve officials, policymakers and senior staff. While the Federal Reserve announced it would issue a new set of rules that purports to “prohibit the purchase of individual securities, restrict active trading, and increase the timeliness of reporting and public disclosure by Federal Reserve policymakers and senior staff,” the recent resignation of the Federal Reserve’s vice chair, who faced questions about trades made in 2020, raises the urgency about the need to codify these rules into law. In October 2021, Gillibrand introduced the Ban Conflicted Trading at the Fed Act, legislation to prohibit Federal Reserve officials from trading individual stocks and ensure Americans can trust that the Federal Reserve is acting in the best interest of all Americans. The legislation was introduced with Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and Raphael Warnock (D-GA), and Senator Jon Ossoff (D-GA) is also a cosponsor.“Serious and important questions remain about Federal Reserve officials trading stocks while setting U.S. economic policy,” said Senator Gillibrand. “While Federal Reserve Chair Powell has previously announced that rules would be implemented to restrict trading by Federal Reserve policymakers and senior staff, it is clear that my legislation, the Ban Conflicted Trading at the Fed Act, is necessary. The bill would ban Federal Reserve officials and leadership from trading stocks and penalizes them if they do so. Powell must answer questions about the stock trading by Fed officials and proposed legislation to address this problem.”Senator Gillibrand is a leading advocate for increasing transparency and accountability in Congress. Gillibrand supports banning members of Congress from owning individual stocks and in 2020, Gillibrand, lead sponsor and author of the original STOCK Act, announced the STOCK Act 2.0 with Representative Katie Porter (D-CA). This bicameral legislation would expand the STOCK Act by strengthening disclosure rules and preventing individuals in trusted positions of public service -- including members of Congress, their families, and their staffs -- from using their access for self-enrichment. The original STOCK Act bars a member of Congress, the president, vice president and high level staff from engaging in insider trading or otherwise using nonpublic information for their own benefit. It also included important updates to financial transparency, by requiring these high ranking government officials to expeditiously disclose financial transactions to the public."

https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/senator-gillibrand-visits-albany-with-secretary-of-energy-granholm-highlighting-new-york-states-historic-climate-and-alternative-energy-investments,"Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand travelled across Albany with U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm to highlight how the historic climate investments of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Build Back Better Agenda will help lower energy costs, generate good-paying, union jobs and drive down air pollution across the Empire State. This visit follows Gillibrand’s invitation to Secretary Granholm to join her in New York State, a leader in alternative energy technology and hydrogen fuel production. They were joined by Governor Kathy Hochul and U.S. Representative Paul Tonko (NY-20) to highlight the climate goals set out by congressional leaders, Governor Hochul’s State of the State, and the Biden administration’s commitment to expanding renewable energy and deploying strong, secure power grids across the country. A staunch advocate for local manufacturing, unionized labor, and clean energy in Albany and across the state of New York, Senator Gillibrand was instrumental in securing $29.5 million in federal funding for the Port of Albany’s Offshore Wind Tower Manufacturing Port Project, which was successfully awarded through the Department of Transportation’s Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP) Grant. This project will be critical in establishing an offshore wind supply chain in the United States and moving toward renewable energy. “It’s a great honor to welcome Secretary Granholm to my hometown of Albany to visit the Port of Albany and other key sites that exemplify the ingenuity happening in clean energy right here in New York State,” said Senator Gillibrand. “The Port of Albany will be home to some of the first manufacturers to make offshore wind towers in America and will solidify the Capital Region as a leader in renewable energy. That’s why I fought to bring $30 million home to kickstart this project. This federal investment is a testament to the innovation in our state and ambition to be a leader in clean, renewable energy. I will always be a fierce advocate for clean energy in the Senate, and I look forward to continuing this work alongside the Biden administration, Governor Hochul, and my congressional colleagues in our commitment to a greener future.""“I want to thank Senator Gillibrand - a steadfast champion for New York workers and union members - for inviting me to Albany. I’d also like to thank Governor Hochul and Congressman Tonko - these leaders know that clean energy and energy efficiency means more jobs, healthier communities, and lower bills for New York families,” said Secretary Granholm. “Their support has been essential to this administration’s success in our first year—a year that saw 6.4 million new jobs. That’s the most jobs created in a single year under any president in history and we’re going to create millions more. The incredible projects happening here in Albany will help us reach our goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030 and powering over 10 million homes with clean, cheap offshore wind energy.”""We know what it takes to build and sustain for the future, it's in our DNA as New Yorkers. By advancing these significant offshore wind projects, we can maintain our cadence for developing projects that will spur much-needed green job creation and investment, including in the Capitol region and at the Port of Albany,""  Governor Kathy Hochul said. ""No state has felt the impacts of climate change more than New York State, and now we can continue to lead the way with our ambitious, nation-leading vision to transition to a renewable energy and a cleaner, greener future. I want to thank Secretary Granholm for visiting our great state to see this first hand and Senator Gillibrand and our colleagues in Congress for their tireless efforts to bring much needed federal funding back home to benefit all New Yorkers."" “Our clean energy goals cannot be fully realized without strong partnerships across the local, state and federal levels,” Congressman Tonko said. “Today’s visits proved the strength of building those connections while showcasing a few of the cutting-edge projects and initiatives being developed by visionaries right here in our Capital Region. I’m proud of the work my colleagues and this administration have done to invest in these bold clean energy initiatives with the passage of the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. But we have much further to go. My heartfelt thanks to Secretary Granholm for her steadfast dedication in developing clean energy technologies, spurring job growth and strengthening our economy. I look forward to working alongside her as we carry the conversations of today back to Washington and continue pushing to build our nation back better than ever.”Gillibrand joined Granholm, U.S. Representative Tonko and other local leaders to meet with workers and students at Hudson Valley Community College and tour the facilities of GE Global Research to highlight the historic climate investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. After months of negotiations, Gillibrand was instrumental in bringing home at least $27 billion in direct funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which will help New York State continue its legacy as a leader in alternative energy.For her letter of support to Secretary Buttigieg for the Port Of Albany PIDP Grant, please click here. "

https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrand-joins-senate-dems-calling-for-tps-designations-for-el-salvador-guatemala-honduras-nicaragua,"U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand joined 32 of her Senate Democratic colleagues, led by Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Menendez (D-NJ), in formally requesting that the Biden administration grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) redesignations for El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, in addition to a new TPS designation for Guatemala. In a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Gillibrand expressed grave concern with the worsening humanitarian conditions across Central America being compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and multiple devastating natural disasters, all of which have contributed to an uptick in outmigration from the region.“The crisis in Central America is urgent and TPS designations and redesignations would provide critical protections for eligible beneficiaries,” said Senator Gillibrand. “New York State is home to more than 40,000 TPS holders and we must enable them to support the basic needs of loved ones back home and invest in safer alternatives to irregular migration. The severe damage caused by back-to-back hurricanes just over one year ago, combined with extreme drought conditions, and the social and economic crises exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, warrant such an action by the administration.”Established by the U.S. Congress through the Immigration Act of 1990, TPS is a temporary, renewable program that provides relief from deportation and access to a work permit for foreign nationals from certain countries who are unable to return safely to their home country due to natural disasters, armed conflicts, or other extraordinary conditions.Senator Gillibrand is an original cosponsor of both the U.S. Citizenship Act, a comprehensive immigration reform bill led by Senator Menendez, and the Citizenship for Essential Workers Act led by Senator Padilla. In 2021, Gillibrand led 20 colleagues in two separate funding requests to appropriators to deliver necessary resources to the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to ensure efficient and fair due process for unaccompanied minors and other vulnerable populations during immigration removal proceedings. She also introduced the Funding Attorneys for Indigent Removal (FAIR) Proceedings Act, a bill that guarantees access to government-funded legal counsel during removal proceedings for children, individuals with disabilities, victims of abuse, torture, and violence, and those living at or below 200% of the federal poverty line.In addition to Chairman Menendez, Gillibrand is joined by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Senators Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), and Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.).Find a copy of the letter here and below.Dear Secretary Mayorkas and Secretary Blinken,We write to express our concerns about ongoing humanitarian needs in Central America and to appeal for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) redesignations for El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and a new TPS designation for Guatemala. It is our assessment that the severe damage caused by back-to-back hurricanes just over one year ago, combined with extreme drought conditions, and the social and economic crises exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, warrant such an action by the Administration. The Guatemalan government has requested a TPS designation, and U.S. Embassies have issued disaster declarations for El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua in recognition of the urgent needs. TPS designations and redesignations would provide critical protections for eligible beneficiaries and enable them to support basic needs of loved ones back home and invest in safer alternatives to irregular migration. Lastly, such designations would be consistent with the Administration’s commitments to address climate migration.The crisis in Central America is urgent. In the past year, the region has experienced extreme weather events, including two hurricanes followed by a months-long drought. According to the World Food Program (WFP), farmers in the region face the worst dry farming season in 35 years. Hunger in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua has increased almost fourfold over the past two years, according to WFP, from 2.2 million people in 2018 to close to 8 million people in 2021. Eight in ten households are resorting to crisis coping measures, selling their lands, tools, and livestock, and missing meals or eating less nutritious meals. It will take years to repair damage to roads, schools, bridges, wells, and other physical infrastructure caused by hurricanes Eta and Iota, which continue to impede citizens’ livelihoods. The pressures have led to an uptick in outmigration from the region. In January, 15 percent of people surveyed by WFP said they were making concrete plans to migrate — double the number two years ago. Media report that the region’s citizens are having to choose between migrating or facing hunger. Despite U.S. Embassies’ disaster declarations, which activated the delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance, 8.3 million people were in need of humanitarian assistance in July 2021, including 5.5 million who were in desperate need of food as of September 2021, according to the Famine Early Warning System Network.The International Monetary Fund says that remittances initially supported the region’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, but tropical storms Eta and Iota interrupted progress, damaging crops and halting manufacturing. In 2020, Honduras’ GDP dropped nine percent, El Salvador’s GDP dropped nearly eight percent, Nicaragua’s dropped two percent, and Guatemala’s by 1.8 percent. The IMF supported the region with emergency financing to cope with these shocks. However, the enduring effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lagging vaccination campaigns, especially in Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, will prolong the region’s economic recovery.Combined, the effects of the natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic have profoundly exacerbated food insecurity, violence, and led to rising social tensions. Forced displacement continues to plague the region. Over one million Central Americans have been displaced by violence and insecurity. Gender-based violence continues to be a major driver of displacement, with rates increasing dramatically throughout 2020. On November 3, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights named El Salvador the most dangerous Latin American country for women. Additionally, countries in the region have suffered severe democratic backsliding and political persecution is on the rise, including through the consolidation of a dictatorship in Nicaragua, the dismantling of independent judiciaries, and efforts to intimidate and silence civil society and independent media.TPS a humanitarian tool used by both Democratic and Republican administrations to provide relief for individuals who are unable to return to countries facing extraordinary conditions. The Biden administration must act and provide certainty for eligible individuals from Central America during this challenging moment. These temporary designations would give the U.S. government more time to partner with governments and civil society in the region to ensure that the return of a large number of individuals to Central America does not create further instability and volatility. They would also provide immediate and tangible humanitarian benefits to new status holders and help mitigate the factors driving dangerous outmigration by securing life-saving remittances.It is our view that El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua meet the standards for TPS. We look forward to working closely with and supporting the Biden administration as it take this important step to uphold humanitarian protections, safeguard U.S. national security interests, and defend American families. Thank you for your consideration of this important matter."

Almost two years into the coronavirus pandemic, families are experiencing levels of utility debt that are approximately 67 percent higher than in the average year, and last month, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicted that some households’ winter heating bills may rise by as much as 39 percent. Increased energy burdens will most affect low-income families and Black and Hispanic households and pose a serious economic, racial, and health justice issue“For too long, the federal government has allowed too many utility companies to put profit above the public,” said the lawmakers. “We have a responsibility to ensure that everyone has access to safe living conditions, and we cannot let corporate greed or a quest for profit get in the way of fundamental human rights…With high winter energy costs, the ongoing threat of the pandemic, and racial and economic justice issues surrounding energy debt, we urge FERC to use its existing statutory authority to better protect consumers from energy market manipulation. FERC should use existing statutory authority to provide more transparency on gas spot markets to protect consumers from companies that use hidden prices to set or manipulate energy costs on a non-competitive basis.”Senator Gillibrand has consistently fought to ensure New Yorkers can afford their utilities. Last month, Gillibrand joined colleagues to urge the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to address the ongoing energy crisis and ensure families that rely on the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) have the resources needed to stay safe throughout the winter. Previously, in October, she joined colleagues to ask HHS to distribute LIHEAP funding quickly and at the highest level possible. When millions of workers were laid off at the onset of the pandemic, Senator Gillibrand fought alongside her colleagues to deliver $900 million in LIHEAP funding in the CARES Act and an additional $4.5 billion in supplemental funding to the program as part of the American Rescue Plan. Gillibrand also successfully pushed the Trump administration to immediately release the emergency funding and send a vital lifeline to New Yorkers. The letter was signed by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and Representatives Alma Adams (NC-12), Cori Bush (MO-01), André Carson (IN-07), David N.

Velázquez (NY-07), and Peter Welch (VT).The Center for Biological Diversity, Food & Water Watch, National Consumer Law Center, and Public Citizen endorsed this letter.The full text of the letter can be found here or below:  Dear Chairman Glick:We write to express our concern in regard to the effect that anticipated increases in heating and energy costs will have on our constituents this winter. As the entity tasked with the regulatory mission of ensuring consumers can access reliable energy at a reasonable cost, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has a significant role to play in promoting energy justice and protecting United States residents from unfairly high energy costs. Under its statutory authority, FERC has the power to influence retail rates for natural gas and electricity, including by preventing market manipulation in wholesale natural gas and electricity markets and enforcing gas spot market transparency. We urge the Commission to use its existing regulatory authority to ensure that households’ energy bills are not driven up by manipulation, obfuscation, or other malfeasance from regulated entities, and to work collaboratively with other agencies to address energy debt.Disparate energy debt burdens are a serious economic, racial, and health justice issue. In December, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicted that some households’ winter heating bills may rise by as much as 39 percent, compared to last year—a spike that will most affect those with the fewest resources.  Nationally, low-income households face energy burdens that are three times higher on average than other households.  This is also a racial justice issue, with Black and Hispanic households having a median energy burden that is 43 percent and 20 percent higher than non-Hispanic white households, respectively.  The loss of utility service due to high energy burdens is one of the primary reasons for homelessness, especially for families with children.  Accordingly, during this pandemic, the loss of utility service and resulting homelessness directly led to higher COVID-19 death and infection rates among vulnerable populations. There are many overlapping factors leading to this rise in energy prices, including profiteering from oil and gas companies and high oil and gas exports. Additionally, as families across the country struggle to pay their utility bills, utility companies received significant federal support during the pandemic. Sixteen utilities received a combined $1.25 billion in financial support through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, and some utilities have seen soaring profit margins during the pandemic. NextEra Energy, for example, dedicated a combined $2.7 billion to CEO compensation and shareholder dividends between April 2020 and June 2021.  For too long, the federal government has allowed too many utility companies to put profit above the public. We have a responsibility to ensure that everyone has access to safe living conditions, and we cannot let corporate greed or a quest for profit get in the way of fundamental human rights.With high winter energy costs, the ongoing threat of the pandemic, and racial and economic justice issues surrounding energy debt, we urge FERC to use its existing statutory authority to better protect consumers from energy market manipulation. FERC should use existing statutory authority to provide more transparency on gas spot markets to protect consumers from companies that use hidden prices to set or manipulate energy costs on a non-competitive basis.  Additionally, should prices increase this upcoming winter, FERC must closely monitor wholesale natural gas and electricity market activity to determine if any market participants are engaging in market manipulation or other violations. Lastly, we are encouraged to see FERC’s commitment to the creation of the Office of Public Participation and the appointment of Director Elin Katz to spearhead transparency and consumer participation in FERC proceedings. It is essential that FERC’s Office of Public Participation engage consumers around how FERC can protect vulnerable households in the long-term by establishing new policies that limit harm from market manipulation, non-competitive gas transactions, and other activities that put private profit above public access to affordable energy.We also recognize that numerous agencies—including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Energy—have a collaborative role to play in supporting energy consumers and promoting energy justice. Almost two years into the coronavirus pandemic, families are experiencing immensely burdensome levels of utility debt that are approximately 67 percent higher than in the average year.  Electric utilities carried out more than one million disconnections during the pandemic, directly threatening the health and well-being of millions of Americans.  And according to a recent Census Bureau survey, nearly 30 percent of respondents reported either minimizing or altogether foregoing other households expenses like food and rent to pay their energy bills in the last year.  In addition to using FERC’s standalone statutory authority, we encourage you to work as part of a whole-of-government response on this critical issue.Thank you, and we look forward to working with you on this matter."

https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/senator-gillibrand-congressmen-higgins-and-jacobs-urge-dhs-to-keep-us-canada-land-border-open-to-vaccinated-individuals,"As the Omicron variant of COVID-19 raises new challenges and continues to spread, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Congressman Brian Higgins (D-NY-26), and Congressman Chris Jacobs (R-NY-27) are urging the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to maintain the open U.S.-Canada land border for vaccinated individuals safely and efficiently. After nearly 20 months of closure, the Biden administration announced the decision to allow fully vaccinated travelers from Canada and Mexico to travel to the U.S. for non-essential travel through all ports of entry in October of 2021. The New York lawmakers are now urging the administration to uphold its decision to protect the economic livelihoods of New York businesses and to ensure additional burdens are not placed on the nation’s supply chains.“Now that vaccines are widely available, we cannot return to the economic and personal sacrifices that would be made if the northern border is closed once again,” said the lawmakers. “The impact of nearly 20 months of closure was devastating to countless New York businesses, medical providers, and families who depend on travel across the New York-Canadian border. The northern border is the gateway to an indispensable economic partnership, and we are confident border crossings can continue safely and efficiently.”Throughout the pandemic, Senator Gillibrand has been a vocal advocate for safely reopening and maintaining an open U.S.-Canadian border. Weeks before the administration made its decision to reopen the border in October, Gillibrand sent a letter to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) requesting clarification and medical justification for the CDC’s decision to treat air and land border crossings differently. Since the onset of the pandemic, Gillibrand has requested guidance from both the Biden and Trump administrations to understand how closures and quarantines would affect New York’s bordering communities and to ensure all necessary exemptions have been made in the interest of public health and safety. The closure and loss of Canadian business cost the U.S. economy $1.5 billion each month and $665-855 million annually in Erie County alone. In July of 2021, Gillibrand applauded Canada’s decision to reopen the border to fully vaccinated U.S. citizens, even as the U.S. government extended its ban on non-essential travel from Canada. The full text of the letter can be found here and below:  Dear President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas:Thank you for your commitment to a safe and efficient northern border even as the pandemic has forced restricted travel and sometimes closure. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continually been advocating for safe, healthy travel between the United States and Canada at our shared northern border because of how vital it is to New York communities. Maintaining an open border to vaccinated travelers has been essential to the functioning economy of New York State and to the wellbeing of New York families. We write to urge you to work with Canada to keep the northern border open to vaccinated individuals, even as the new Omicron variant of COVID-19 raises new challenges. This is necessary to protect the economic livelihood of New York businesses and to ensure we are not placing additional burdens on our supply chains. It is also important for our constituents who are reliant on travel across the northern border to connect with friends and family members.Since the beginning of the pandemic, the United States-Canada border was closed for more than a year and a half. This extended closure caused significant disruptions in border towns, where people routinely cross to shop, visit family and participate in local events. We heard from so many New Yorkers about the harm their families suffered as a result. The closure and loss of Canadian business cost the U.S. economy an estimated $1.5 billion each month and $665-855 million annually in Erie County alone.Vaccines work and provide the best opportunity to end this pandemic. Canada has a high rate of vaccination with over 76% of its general population fully vaccinated with both doses. We must recognize vaccine efficacy and follow the public health data. There should not be additional restrictions placed on non-essential travel for fully vaccinated Americans and Canadians and all ports of entry on the northern border must remain openWe appreciate your consideration and look forward to continuing to work with you on this issue.Sincerely,"

This bipartisan bill would help address retention and recruitment issues in the health care workforce by removing financial barriers and authorizing $50 million to establish a new student loan repayment program for infectious disease clinicians and bio-preparedness health care professionals. “We are starting this year as we finished the last - our health care system and providers are under historic levels of stress and they need reinforcements,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This bipartisan bill would establish a loan repayment program to meet the needs of our nation’s health care workforce and attract more students to receive vital clinical care training. We must do everything in our power to eliminate financial barriers and encourage the next generation of infectious disease and public health professionals so New York is well equipped for future crises.”A June 2020 study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that 208 million Americans live in areas with little or no access to an infectious disease (ID) provider. In 2020, only 75% of infectious diseases training programs were able to fill all their slots, in part due to lower salaries for ID providers than nearly all other specialties, including general internal medicine. Given that the average medical student debt is over $200,000, the ID specialty and related bio-preparedness work are a financially infeasible choice for many. Physicians, nurses, laboratory professionals, and other health care professionals have also been working intense hours in an environment of health risks, uncertainty, and overwhelming patient loss, contributing to severe burnout during the pandemic. Many have considered early retirement, exacerbating existing workforce concerns and threatening the future of this critical workforce.Qualified individuals working in infectious disease and bio-preparedness and response, including physicians, clinical pharmacists, physician assistants, and advanced practice registered nurses, may receive up to $50,000 for each year of service, up to a total of $150,000 in loan repayment.The BIO Preparedness Workforce Act is supported by Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Medical Association, American Hospital Association, American Association of Medical Colleges, National Rural Health Association, Association for Clinical Microbiology, American Society for Microbiology, American Dental Association, Association of Professionals in Infection Prevention and Epidemiology, HIV Medicine Association, AIDS Institute, AIDS United, American Academy of HIV Medicine, American College of Clinical Pharmacy, American Institute of Dental Public Health, Association of Nurses in AIDS Care, GLMA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBTQ Equality, American Association for the Study of Liver Disease, Society for Health Care Epidemiology, American Society for Clinical Laboratory Science, American Society for Clinical Pathology, HIV Dental Alliance, HIV + Hepatitis Policy Institute, National Hispanic Medical Association, National Medical Association, National Virus Hepatitis Roundtable, National Working Positive Coalition, Latino Commission on AIDS, National Black Gay Men’s Advocacy Coalition, Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, Physician Assistant Education Association, Ryan White Medical Providers Coalition, Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists, University of Wisconsin Health System, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Vivent Health, Wisconsin Medical Society, and the Wisconsin Hospital Association.This bill is led by Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Susan Collins (R-ME), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Ben Cardin (D-MD).The full text of the Bolstering Infectious Outbreak (BIO) Preparedness Workforce Act can be found here."
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/icymi-gillibrand-op-ed-in-washington-post-to-keep-our-country-safe-we-need-a-national-cyber-academy,"In case you missed it, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand published an opinion piece in the Washington Post calling for the creation of a national Cyber Academy, a government-funded university that would train cyber and tech professionals for the civil service. The institution would address a deficit of cybersecurity professionals in the public sector and enable the U.S. to defend against increasingly frequent cyberattacks.  The full text of Senator Gillibrand’s op-ed can be found here or below: Washington Post | Opinion: To keep our country safe, we need a national Cyber Academy. Think of it as West Point for technology defense.By Senator Kirsten GillibrandDecember 23, 2021Cybersecurity is undoubtedly one of the United States’ most important lines of defense, but too many parts of the government don’t have the reinforcements they need. In one of the most serious examples of danger, Russian hackers in 2019 penetrated SolarWinds software widely used by the U.S. government, and the hack went undetected for months. Networks ranging from the departments of Energy, Treasury and Justice to the National Institutes of Health were exposed to exploitation.Unfortunately, the government faces a severe shortage of cyber personnel needed to protect ourselves from such adversaries. As of September, more than one-third of public-sector cybersecurity jobs — more than 38,000 — were unfilled. And the tech workforce we do have is quickly aging out: By our calculations, just 7 percent of federal employees in computer science, computer engineering and information technology positions are under 30.We need to take bold, forward-looking action to build not only a new generation of cybersecurity and technology professionals, but also a new pipeline to cyber and tech careers in government. We need to establish a Cyber Academy.Working with colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I recently secured provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act, the annual defense budget bill, that will jump-start our work to do just that. They would create a road map for establishing, building and devising a curriculum for an institution that would staff up the federal cyber workforce and prepare the next generation of civil servants for the vital jobs of the 21st century.The Cyber Academy we envision would be a state-of-the-art civilian counterpart to West Point, the Air Force Academy and other military academies — a government-funded university dedicated to training cyber and tech professionals for the civil service. It would make the U.S. government a vanguard in digital careers, while providing talented and civic-minded young people with a free postsecondary technological education and a way to serve their country.Cyber Academy students would earn degrees in fields such as artificial intelligence, software engineering, cybersecurity, robotics and data science. They then would be placed for a prearranged term in corresponding roles in various federal agencies, determined according to the government’s digital and cyber needs and the students’ preferences, and informed by our national security priorities.These graduates would have important roles beyond defense. They could help us to protect the electric grid and food supply chain, oversee policies about cryptocurrency and develop regulations for complex machinery such as driverless cars and autonomous drones — and that’s just scraping the surface.The current tech workforce is neither large enough nor diverse enough to meet the nation’s critical needs. There are more than 600,000 open computing jobs in the United States, but just 71,000 computer science students graduated into the workforce in 2020. And the government has to compete for them with private tech giants such as Google and Amazon. The Cyber Academy’s service requirement would help address that uneven playing field and expedite the often slow-moving federal hiring process.Recruiting for the Cyber Academy would also help us to diversify the field. The more perspectives, languages and skill sets we can bring into government, the more we can out-innovate and outperform our competitors and counter looming technological threats from China and Russia. The Cyber Academy could make this education and these careers accessible to everyone, including nontraditional students and those from underserved communities.Without an urgent strategic investment in strengthening our federal cyber workforce, we risk ceding global leadership to our competitors and falling behind on our ability to protect and advance our national interests. As it stands, we are not fully prepared to face the challenges and seize the opportunities ahead.Experts in science, technology and national defense agree: Former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt said last year that establishing a type of cyber academy will help to address the “vast shortage of the talent” the United States needs to keep up “in a world shaped by strategic competition.” Just last month, the Government Accountability Office published a report on the need for a “pipeline of digital staff,” specifically noting that an academy could create a dedicated pool of talent with “proficiency in both digital skills as well [as] understanding the functions of government [required] to meet agencies’ needs.”In the short term, the steady stream of tech talent from a Cyber Academy would enable the government to address its urgent personnel deficit. In the long term, it would build up a pool of digital and cyber experts, allowing the United States to gain substantial ground in technological innovation and cement our global leadership in the digital age."

The cost of home heating is expected to increase by 30% nationwide this winter for the nearly half of U.S. households that rely primarily on natural gas, a level not reached since 2014. In New York State alone, there are already more than 1.2 million households that collectively owe roughly $1.7 billion in late energy bill payments. LIHEAP is a critical home heating assistance program that is vital to New York’s most vulnerable seniors and families who depend on this money to offset the high cost of energy bills. However, the ongoing energy crisis means this lifeline program could lose much of its appropriated purchasing power due to volatile heating costs. “The ongoing economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic has strained global energy markets still struggling with a surge in demand, supply shortages, and supply chain issues. For low-income families, these price increases are unsustainable and could force them to choose between heating their homes and paying for essentials like rent, food, and medicine,” said Senator Gillibrand. “Today, New Yorkers hold approximately $1.7 billion in energy bill debt alone. LIHEAP is a critical lifeline for seniors and low-income families in need of assistance to stay safe and warm, and I’m urging HHS to make sure our state is equipped to support New Yorkers during a challenging winter.”The average cost of home heating is unaffordable for millions of low-income households, costing over $900 per year nationally. With prices surging worldwide for heating oil, natural gas, and other fuels, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is projecting even higher prices for home heating this winter. The EIA’s Winter Fuels Outlook reports households nationwide could see their heating bills jump as much as 54% from last winter. The EIA also projects that Northeast customers who use natural gas will see their bills rise to $865, up from $731 last year. New Yorkers can spend more than $3,000 a year on energy bills alone — for low-income New Yorkers, that can amount to more than 10% of their income on energy. Robust and early LIHEAP funding is a crucial lifeline that will help meet the demand of rising utility costs and help financially strained households pay their energy bills and stay safe throughout the winter.Senator Gillibrand has consistently fought to ensure New Yorkers can afford their utilities. In October, the start of heating season for many states, Gillibrand urged HHS to distribute LIHEAP funding quickly and at the highest level possible. When millions of workers were laid off at the onset of the pandemic, Senator Gillibrand fought alongside her colleagues to deliver $900 million in LIHEAP funding in the CARES Act and an additional $4.5 billion in supplemental funding to the program as part of the American Rescue Plan. Earlier this year, Gillibrand made stops across New York State — including in Syracuse, Rochester,  Buffalo, and Albany — in her fight for robust LIHEAP funding in the COVID-19 relief package. Gillibrand also successfully pushed the Trump administration to immediately release the emergency funding and send a vital lifeline to New Yorkers.  For the full letter, please click here."
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrand-announces-nearly-30-million-in-federal-funding-for-wind-turbine-tower-manufacturing-at-the-port-of-albany,"Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand announced that $29.5 million in federal funding was granted for the Port of Albany’s Offshore Wind Tower Manufacturing Port Project. In a letter sent earlier this year, Senator Gillibrand advocated for this funding, which was successfully awarded through the Department of Transportation’s Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP) Grant. Gillibrand is a staunch advocate for local manufacturing and unionized labor in Albany and across the state of New York, and this project will be critical in establishing in an offshore wind supply chain in the United States and moving toward renewable energy. “I am so proud to have fought for this nearly $30 million in federal funding for Albany’s offshore wind turbine manufacturing project,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This project will solidify Albany as a leader in renewable energy and establish the city’s port as an economic hub. Just as I fought for my Build Local, Hire Local provision in this year’s infrastructure package, I will always keep fighting for New York’s regional economies and workers.”For the full letter, please click here. Dear Secretary Buttigieg,I write in support of application submitted by The Port of Albany for funding from the Port Infrastructure Development Program Grant (PIPD) through the U.S. Department of Transportation. The funding will be used for the Port of Albany's expansion and offshore wind manufacturing project.The Port of Albany, officially established in 1925, serves as a major shipping and trading post along the Hudson River in upstate New York. Its central location makes the port well positioned to serve as a midpoint between major cities and economic hubs in the region, such as Boston, New York City, and Montreal. Besides water access, the port also provides a close connection to the regional rail and inter-state highway systems that fuel regional economic development. The requested funding will be used for The Port of Albany's Offshore Wind Tower Manufacturing Port Project, the first of its kind in the United States. Funds will go towards material costs and necessary infrastructure, which includes the development of 95 acres. This project is critical in establishing an offshore wind supply chain in the United States and moving towards renewable energy. Additionally, the site will create hundreds of construction jobs and up to 400 manufacturing and maritime jobs. Funding for the Port of Albany is vital to maximizing the project's development and energizing the local and national green economy.I ask that you please give this application your full consideration. If you have any questions, or desire further information, please do not hesitate to contact my staff member, Anisa Dhillon, at (202) 224-4451."

Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today announced that due to funding secured through the bipartisan infrastructure and jobs package, the Environmental Protection Agency will accelerate hazardous waste cleanup in Elmira, the Town of Vestal, and Niagara County. Some of these projects have been listed on the EPA National Priorities List (NPL) for decades waiting for federal funding. Senators Schumer and Gillibrand fought to bring this critical funding back to New York to finalize hazardous waste cleanup at these sites. Because of this funding, the EPA will now facilitate the long-term cleanup of hazardous waste at the Vestal Water Supply Well 1-1 in Vestal, Facet Enterprises, Inc. in Elmira, and Eighteen Mile Creek in Niagara County.“The recently-passed Bipartisan Infrastructure and Jobs Law includes a surge of new funding for the federal Superfund program that we fought hard to deliver, and those dollars are now being put to use to jumpstart long-delayed clean-ups at toxic sites in Elmira, the town of Vestal, and Niagara County,” said Senator Schumer. “Cleaning up these toxic sites in Elmira, Vestal, and Niagara County is critical to protect the public health, clean up our environment and pave the way for economic regeneration at these locations. I applaud the EPA and President Biden for focusing on improving the Superfund program and moving quickly to put these infrastructure dollars to use to benefit the public and create new jobs.”“I’m thrilled to announce that key Superfund sites located in Elmira, the town of Vestal, and Niagara County are receiving the funds needed to clean up hazardous waste in these communities. This critical funding is a direct result of the bipartisan infrastructure package and will help clean up these sites in order to keep the surrounding communities safe from exposure to harmful, toxic waste,” said Senator Gillibrand. “The health of New Yorkers should not be put at risk due to toxic waste dumps – period. I fought alongside Senator Schumer to secure and deliver this funding, and I am grateful to the Biden administration for quickly disbursing this money.” The Vestal Water Supply Well 1-1 Superfund site located in Vestal, New York was one of three production wells in the Vestal Town Water District 1 intended to provide drinking water to several water districts in the area. Well 1-1 is moderately contaminated with several volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and will receive thermal soil treatment. Other soil in the area contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) will be excavated and removed from the site. The Facet Enterprises, Inc. facility is a 31-acre parcel of land in the Village of Elmira Heights. The facility was previously used to make products such as bicycle parts, automobile engine components and small arms for the military. Vapors from chemical contamination, primarily trichloroethylene (TCE), have seeped into more than 65 properties in the vicinity of this site. TCE can produce emissions that rise through the soil and potentially affect indoor air quality, a condition known as vapor intrusion. The EPA will use these federal funds to install vapor mitigation system to remove harmful chemicals from soil where there is potential for vapor intrusion, specifically trichloroethylene (TCE).The Eighteen Mile Creek Superfund site located in Niagara County flows north for approximately 15 miles, discharging to Lake Ontario in Olcott. The Eighteen Mile Creek Corridor extends from the Creek's headwaters at the Barge Canal to Harwood Road in Lockport and contains most of the site's sediment, soil, and groundwater contamination. The federal funding will be used to excavate and dispose of lead and PCB contaminated sediment within the Creek Corridor. Additionally, soil at adjacent upland commercial properties will be excavated and disposed.The Superfund program was established by Congress in 1980 to investigate and facilitate cleanup of the nation’s most complex, uncontrolled, and abandoned hazardous waste sites. Only sites added to the NPL are eligible to receive federal funding for long-term permanent cleanup. The EPA’s Superfund program operates under the “polluter pays” principle, giving the EPA the authority to require polluters to take responsibility for cleanup of the environmental contamination they caused. EPA adds sites to the NPL when mismanagement of contamination threatens human health and the environment. The Senators outlined the sections of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act related to cleaning up pollution below:Senators Schumer and Gillibrand have long fought to address water contamination, expedite Superfund designations, and remove PFAS to protect public health in New York State. In 2017, following a multi-year push, the senators announced the EPA’s designation of Hoosick Falls as a Superfund site to facilitate cleanup of PFOA at Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics."

https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/ndaa-final-language-includes-roadmap-to-establish-gillibrands-seminal-cyber-academy,"U.S. Senator Gillibrand is announcing that her Cyber Workforce and Education Curricula provision was included in the final language of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The United States government is currently facing severe cyber personnel shortages and capacity gaps in cybersecurity, IT, cloud computing, and AI. Already in 2021, the number of data breaches in the United States has far outpaced 2020, and cybercrime costs the nation more than $100 billion annually. The growing number of cyberattacks across all industries and increasingly digital world underscores the need for a robust cyber workforce across all federal agencies. Senator Gillibrand’s provision in the NDAA would require that the Department of Defense (DoD) submit reports to the Senate and House Armed Services Committees that assess the establishment of a National Cyber Academy, a talent strategy to satisfy DoD’s future cyber education requirements, and DoD’s overall workforce requirement for cyberspace and information warfare.Senator Gillibrand has proposed the creation of a Cyber Academy to address our government’s cyber and digital workforce crisis. Senator Gillibrand’s Cyber Academy is especially pertinent as the current tech workforce is quickly aging out, with just 6% of federal employees in computer science, computer engineering and IT positions under the age of 30 and many tech workers opting instead for competitive private sector positions. Modeled after existing military service academies, this first-of-its-kind establishment would be the world’s first government-funded university dedicated to training cyber and tech professionals for the civil service. This centralized vehicle for recruiting cyber and tech talent would have graduating classes of several hundred students per year, make public service more accessible, and give the United States a competitive edge on the world stage.“The need for an effective, talented, and diverse cyber workforce for the U.S. government has never been clearer, but the workers simply aren’t there. The persistent gaps in our federal tech workforce call for bold, innovative solutions to sustainably bring in young talent, build out our digital capabilities, and maintain our strength and influence in cyberspace,” said Senator Gillibrand. “My proposal for a state-of-the-art Cyber Academy would provide civic-minded young people with a free, unparalleled postsecondary technological education and a way to serve their country outside of the military. This is the step we desperately need to take to ensure the U.S. is keeping pace on a global scale and can protect ourselves from threats.”Senator Gillibrand’s provision in the NDAA would require that the Department of Defense submit two reports to be produced by the Secretary of Defense, acting through the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness and the Chief Information Officer of the Department of Defense, in consultation with Secretaries of the military departments and the head of any other organization or element of the Department the Secretary determines appropriate. These reports will be submitted to the Senate and House Armed Services Committees. The first report, due by January 1, 2023, assesses the establishment of a National Cyber Academy for the purpose of educating and training civilian and military personnel for service in cyber, information, and related fields throughout the federal government. The cyber education report will include a talent strategy to satisfy future cyber education requirements for military and civilian personnel that considers acquisition personnel, accessions and recruits to the military services, cadets and midshipmen at the military service academies and enrolled in the Senior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps, information environment and cyberspace military and civilian personnel, and non-information environment cyberspace military and civilian personnel. It will also identify appropriate locations for information warfare and cyber education for military and civilian personnel, including a potential Cyber Academy. The second report, due by January 1, 2025, will determine the overall workforce requirement of the Department for cyberspace and information warfare military personnel across the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces (other than the Coast Guard) and for civilian personnel. The cyber workforce report will consider personnel in positions securing the Department of Defense Information Network, defense agencies, field activities, and combatant commands, including current billets primarily associated with the Department of Defense Cyber Workforce Framework. The cyber workforce report would also include a talent management strategy that covers accessions, training, and education.The Cyber Academy would borrow basic elements of the existing military service academies at West Point, Annapolis, and Colorado Springs. In exchange for a fully-funded undergraduate degree in a digital technical field like AI, software engineering, cybersecurity, robotics, data science, computational biology, or design, students would incur an obligation to serve in corresponding digital technical roles across the federal government as civilians. Agency placement would then be determined by student preference and an annual interagency assessment of the government’s digital and cyber needs. In addition to rigorous academic coursework, students would be required to complete internships to gain practical experience and would begin applying for a security clearance midway through their undergraduate careers to expedite the job onboarding process once their degree is completed."

Our service members risk their lives to keep us safe and I will remain relentless in our fight to ensure the military operates in a manner worthy of their dedication.” Below is a description of Senator Gillibrand’s personnel provisions for service members and their families included in the FY22 NDAA:Pay Raise: This provision provides a 2.7% increase to base pay for all service members and the DoD workforce. This will increase a Sergeant’s basic pay (excluding housing allowance and other benefits) from $2,844 to $2,920 and a Captain’s basic pay from $6,023 to $6,186.Parental Leave: This amendment authorizes up to 12 weeks of parental leave for all service members, both primary and secondary caregivers, in the case of birth, adoption, or long-term foster placement of a child. Service members can also now defer their parental leave to a later year if occupied with a professional circumstance that is deemed reasonable and appropriate. This provision will allow service members to care for their families and take time for themselves during a critical adjustment period and will help them achieve long-term success, both professionally and personally. Senator Gillibrand supported Senator Duckworth (D-IL) in her fight to ensure that all service members are able to access paid parental leave that will lead to more stable, healthy military families and, ultimately, better retention, recruitment, and readiness. Today, many service members only receive 3 weeks or less of parental leave, and foster parents do not receive any form of paid parental leave. Increasing access to parental leave is shown to have long-term positive effects on the strength of both parent-child and spousal relationships.Child Care: Senator Gillibrand worked with Senator Duckworth to improve the quality and availability of child care services for service members and their families. Their provisions in the final NDAA will help increase the capacity and availability of quality child care for service members and their dependents, and meet the real-life needs of military families. Their provisions accomplish the following:Health Care and Mental Health Services: The bill authorizes multiple improvements to health care benefits and TRICARE coverage, including:1.    Coverage of preconception and prenatal carrier screening tests: This provision establishes coverage of preconception and prenatal carrier screening tests for certain medical conditions under the TRICARE program, including cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy, Fragile X Syndrome, Tay-Sachs disease, Hemoglobinopathies, conditions linked with Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and more. 2.    TRICARE co-pays: This provision directs the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress on the usage of outpatient services following the increase of TRICARE co-pays for Group A beneficiaries. In the last few years, increased TRICARE co-pays have resulted in higher costs for service members seeking mental health care and speech, physical, and occupational therapy, forcing many to halt treatment. The report will analyze the percentage of beneficiaries who stopped receiving services between 2016-2020 and service differences between TRICARE Prime and Select.3.    Autism CARES: Gillibrand’s provision on Autism CARES compels the Secretary of Defense to work with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to analyze data on treatment and applied behavior analysis (ABA) effectiveness.With the rate of military and veteran suicide outpacing military operation deaths four to one, Senator Gillibrand has been fighting for improved access to mental health care for service members. Her provisions in this year’s NDAA include:1.    Pilot Program for Mental Health Scheduling: This provision requires the DoD to develop a pilot program that will ensure beneficiaries receive direct assistance identifying appropriate mental health providers within the direct care system or TRICARE network when referred for mental health care services. This provision was established following a 2020 DoD IG report revealing barriers that have led to delays, and in some cases, the inability to receive coverage. 2.    Independent Review of Suicide Prevention and Response: This provision mandates the Secretary of Defense to establish an independent suicide prevention and response review committee at military installations within 90 days of the NDAA’s final passage. 3.    Brandon Act: Following her push earlier this year, Gillibrand secured key provisions of the Brandon Act, named in Brandon Caserta’s honor, which would expand access to mental health care services for active-duty military personnel. Namely, these provisions will allow services members to access confidential mental health evaluation referrals without fear of retaliation.PFAS Remediation & Treatment at U.S. Military Installations: Gillibrand successfully pushed to include critical per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) provisions that will expedite the testing, cleanup, and remediation of PFAS at some of the most contaminated U.S. military installations and state-owned National Guard facilities. Through her advocacy, Gillibrand helped add $517 million authorized above President Biden’s budget request for clean-up of military communities impacted by PFAS contamination. The FY22 NDAA also includes three provisions modeled after Gillibrand’s Filthy Fifty Act, including:1.    A provision to establish a two-year deadline for the DoD to complete testing for PFAS at all currently identified military installations and National Guard facilities.2.    A provision that requires the DoD to submit a report to Congress with the status of clean-up efforts to remediate PFAS at 50 priority installations, matching those listed in the Filthy Fifty Act, that are among the most contaminated with PFAS.3.    A provision that requires the DoD to establish a schedule with proposed deadlines to complete PFAS remediation at all military bases, National Guard facilities, and formerly used defense sites that have been identified as having a PFAS release related to DoD activities.Clean Drinking Water at Fort Drum: Gillibrand helped secure $27 million authorized for energy resilience and conservation investment projects that will help maintain and improve Fort Drum’s water infrastructure. Specifically, this funding will support the Wellfield Expansion Resilience Project to help develop the Fort Drum water supply.Basic Needs Allowance: Gillibrand helped secure key provisions of the Military Hunger Prevention Act of 2021, a bill to support military families struggling with food insecurity, which was introduced by Senator Duckworth. Unintended barriers to assistance exist for struggling military families, such as counting a service member’s basic housing allowance as revenue in determining eligibility for federal nutrition programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).? As a result, low-income military families facing food insecurity are disqualified from this resource and often rely on food pantries and food banks for emergency food assistance. Along with Senator Duckworth, Gillibrand helped correct this unacceptable situation and ensure these families can put food on the table by establishing a basic needs allowance for service members with a gross income at or below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines. Authorizing a basic needs allowance to eligible, low-income members of the Armed Forces will help low-income military families living with food insecurity make ends meet.  "
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrand-schumer-call-on-federal-transit-administration-to-fund-the-rochester-genesee-regional-transportation-authority-,"U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand wrote to the Federal Transit Administration in support of the Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority’s (RGRTA) application for funding from the Bus and Bus Facilities Grant Program. The requested funding would be used to build a facility to house administrative operations and operational staff facilities for the RGRTA, which provides transportation to tens of thousands of residents in the greater Rochester metro area and operates a paratransit service for disabled individuals. RGRTA’s current facilities are over four decades old and beyond their usable lifespan. “Transportation is what connects our communities and keeps the wheels of the local economy rolling, but in Rochester the aging RGRTA facility is putting the brakes on continued development. That’s why I am urging the Federal Transit Administration to greenlight funding for the construction of a new bus garage for the RGRTA’s paratransit bus service,” said Senator Schumer. “This new facility would allow RGRTA to increase accessibility to paratransit customers and ensure RGRTA continues to operate reliably as an economic engine for the region.”  “RGRTA provides an invaluable service to the Rochester community,” said Senator Gillibrand. “However, its current facilities are in dire need of an upgrade. I urge the Federal Transit Administration to give RGRTA’s application for federal funding the full attention it deserves so that it can continue to provide reliable transit service to those who depend on it.”  “With a new transit system in place that is more frequent, reliable, and connected, RTS is now focused on growing the system to improve access for our customers and support efforts related to economic recovery, job growth, climate change, poverty, mental health, and social justice,” said Regional Transit Service CEO Bill Carpenter. “Building a new facility for our paratransit operation is one of our highest priorities and I thank Majority Leader Schumer and Senator Gillibrand for their support of our grant application.”Senator Schumer and Senator Gillibrand recently fought to include over $5.5 billion in funding for the FTA’s Bus and Bus Facilities program in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill to fund local transit systems. Read the full text of the letter here. "
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrands-groundbreaking-unidentified-aerial-phenomena-amendment-included-in-final-ndaa_,"U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand is announcing the inclusion of her Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) amendment in the FY22 NDAA. Today, UAPs pose a significant challenge to our national security, appearing in sensitive U.S. airspace and around military personnel. Gillibrand has been working alongside Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Congressman Ruben Gallego (AZ-07) to establish an office that would replace the current Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force and would have access to Department of Defense (DoD) and Intelligence Community data related to UAPs. By doing so, the office will have the authority to establish a coordinated effort to report and respond to UAPs, significantly improve data-sharing between agencies on UAP sightings, address national security concerns, and report health effects people may experience in relation to UAP events. The office will be administered jointly between the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, and will empower military and civilian personnel working for the DoD and Intelligence Community to report incidents and information involving UAPs.“Our national security efforts rely on aerial supremacy and these phenomena present a challenge to our dominance over the air. Staying ahead of UAP sightings is critical to keeping our strategic edge and keeping our nation safe,” said Senator Gillibrand. “My amendment will establish a formal office to report and respond to UAPs and give us the scientific capabilities needed to track and share data, investigate sightings, and develop a response to this growing security threat. The United States needs a coordinated effort to take control and understand whether these aerial phenomena belong to a foreign government or something else altogether. I am proud to have worked alongside Congressman Gallego to include  this amendment that will help remove the stigma surrounding UAPs, protect our nation, and keep those who serve safe.”“It is my hope that the creation of a new joint Defense Department and Intelligence Community office focused on UAPs will provided the resources, analytics and attention needed to determine what is loitering around our military training ranges,” said Senator Rubio. “The DoD and IC need to ensure a more uniform collection strategy is in place and that we continue to destigmatize reporting on UAPs, particularly from military aviators. Significantly, we also maintain the transparency and accountability that my provision in last year’s Intelligence Authorization Act report provided, by ensuring ongoing unclassified reporting.” “The bicameral, bipartisan Gillibrand amendment provides a comprehensive framework for a scientific data driven approach to get to the truth about UAP,” said Senator Blunt. “This amendment ensures that we treat UAP as we would any potential national security threat that would enter U.S. restricted training or operational areas.”    “Protecting our national security interests means knowing who and what are flying in U.S. airspace. Right now our system of tracking and identifying UAPs is scattered throughout the Department of Defense and other departments and agencies of the federal government,” said Congressman Gallego. “Based on briefings I’ve received as Chairman of the House Intelligence and Special Operations Subcommittee, I firmly believe that the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community need to come together and create a permanent, synchronized structure to collect and analyze UAP data. I’m excited that the amendment I introduced alongside Senator Gillibrand was included in the final version of the NDAA.”As established in the NDAA, the UAP office would be given the task of providing a full spectrum of intelligence, scientific, and technical assessments related to UAPs, including:This amendment is cosponsored in the Senate by Senators Rubio (R-FL), Graham (R-SC), Heinrich (D-NM), and Blunt (R-MO)."
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrand-statement-on-the-gutting-of-bipartisan-military-justice-reforms-by-house-and-senate-armed-services-leadership,"Addressing the gutting of bipartisan military justice reforms by House and Senate Armed Services leadership, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand issued the following statement:“As sexual assault survivor advocates warned would happen for months, House and Senate Armed Services leadership have gutted our bipartisan military justice reforms behind closed doors, doing a disservice to our service members and our democracy. Committee leadership has ignored the will of a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate and a majority of the House in order to do the bidding of the Pentagon. This disregards the calls of service members, veterans and survivors who have fought for an impartial and independent military justice system. Worse yet, DoD successfully undercut Defense Secretary Austin’s proclaimed commitment to removing sex crimes from the chain of command and ignored President Biden’s public support for removing felonies from the chain of command.“Despite claims otherwise, the NDAA does not remove the convening authority from military commanders. Removing that authority from commanders is critical. To quote Secretary Austin’s own panel, “The DoD Office of the Special Victim Prosecutor structure must be, and must be seen as, independent of the chains of command of the victim and of the accused all the way through the Secretaries of the Military Departments. Anything less will likely be seen as compromising what is designed to be an independent part of the military justice process, thus significantly undermining this recommendation…Finally, because of the breadth and depth of the lack of trust by junior enlisted Service members in commanders, it was determined that the status quo or any variation on the status quo that retained commanders as disposition authorities in sexual harassment, sexual assault, and related cases would fail to offer the change required to restore confidence in the system.”“This bill represents a major setback on behalf of service members, women and survivors in particular. However, we will not stop seeking true military justice reforms for our brave service members and I will continue to call for an up or down floor vote.”"
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/standing-in-front-of-hostos-community-college-senator-gillibrand-announces-eats-act-to-expand-snap-benefit-eligibility-to-more-college-students,"U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, stood in front of Eugenio María de Hostos Community College in the Bronx to announce her legislation, the Enhance Access to SNAP (EATS) Act, which would expand Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit eligibility to all college students attending 2 and 4-year universities part-time or more who meet traditional SNAP income and other eligibility requirements. Gillibrand was joined by CUNY Chancellor Félix Matos Rodríguez, Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr., Assembly Member Amanda Septimo, Hostos Community College President Dr. Daisy Cocco De Filippis, Hostos Health And Wellness Director Fabián Wander, LCSW, and Hunger Free America CEO Joel Berg. Congressman Ritchie Torres (NY-15) is also a cosponsor.Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, students on college campuses in New York and across the nation were experiencing high levels of food insecurity and hunger. According to The Hope Center for College, Community, and Justice, food insecurity is a serious problem on college campuses across the nation, especially for students of color, first-generation students, low-income students, and students at community colleges. Student work requirements, known as “work for food,” only serve to exacerbate food insecurity among college students and continue to impede student learning, health, and stability. Senator Gillibrand has been a leader in the fight against food insecurity and has continuously led the charge to protect and expand access to healthy meals for children, seniors, students, and veterans since her first days in office. Gillibrand’s EATS Act would ensure that SNAP no longer requires eligible students to perform work study or 20 hours per week of outside employment in order to receive benefits.  “No student should be forced to make the impossible choice between food and education, but that is sadly the choice students face on campuses across New York every day. We were able to make more low-income college students temporarily eligible for SNAP in our COVID relief efforts, but we have to go further. That is why I am introducing the Enhance Access to SNAP (EATS) Act alongside Representatives Torres and Espaillat. This bill would permanently eliminate the work-for-food requirement for college students, because students should be allowed to focus on their studies without worrying about where their next meal is coming from or how they will fit in a part-time job on top of their full-time academic career,” said Senator Gillibrand.“We’re seeing a hunger crisis sweep across college campuses nationwide, setting too many of our most vulnerable students up to fail – and it’s absolutely unacceptable” said Congressman Adriano Espaillat (NY-13). “No student should ever have to choose between a meal and their education, and as public servants it’s our duty to ensure no student is ever put in that position – here in New York State and around the country. I’m proud to join Senator Gillibrand in this fight to eliminate work-for-food barriers for low-income students – and through it, fostering a more equitable learning environment for young scholars around our nation.”“The growing hunger crisis among college students hinders their ability to excel in their studies, complete their education and will impact their financial success in the long run. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the hunger crisis, and made clear that we must adjust governmental tools to meet the needs of the moment. SNAP is one of the most effective tools we have to combat hunger, but unfortunately current restrictions prevent food-insecure, low-income college students from using this important benefit. We have a moral obligation to ensure that no one goes hungry. The EATS Act would expand SNAP eligibility to college students, and this legislation is an important step in combatting the hunger crisis in higher education that has been made worse by the pandemic,” said Congressman Ritchie Torres (NY-15)“Food insecurity transcends educational and socio-economic expectations, and even follows many college students in their pursuit of earning a degree,"" said Congressman Jamaal Bowman (NY-16). “People deserve the ability to buy food, including healthy food options, for their sustenance and nourishment – especially as their minds are being constantly stimulated throughout the process of earning a degree. Many college students face multiple economic burdens that will follow them after college – including student loans. There is no reason they should endure the additional stress of being able to afford to eat. The EATS Act allows us to continue in the right direction of taking care of the people who need it most.”""Food insecurity can have wide-ranging negative impacts for so many in our community, and is particularly hard on students during this critical time in their educational and professional development. Students of color and LGBTQ students are more likely to face food insecurity, and COVID-19 has only increased these disparities. The EATS Act would permanently ensure low-income college students have access to the nutrition they need without subjecting them to harmful work-for-food requirements. Thank you to Senator Gillibrand and Congressman Torres for their commitment to the health and wellbeing of our students,"" said New York State Senator José M. Serrano“College students here in The Bronx and across the country experience a high level of food insecurity, a problem that has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Senator Gillibrand’s legislation to permanently allow college students to have access to SNAP benefits without a work requirement will enable these students to focus more on their studies and less on making ends meet. I applaud the Senator’s efforts to provide this critical aid,” said Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr.“I support the EATS Act, expanding critical food access programs for low-income students.  As it eliminates the current work-for-food requirements for students in the SNAP program and reduces the documentation and paperwork burden, EATS removes barriers which further discourage those in need from applying. We should do everything in our power to support students working towards a better future for themselves and their families, and that means giving them an opportunity to learn free from hunger,” said New York Assembly Member Amanda Septimo.“We want all students to be focused on their education, not worrying about how they’ll pay for their next meal. That is why we enthusiastically applaud Senator Gillibrand’s efforts to permanently remove barriers to SNAP eligibility for college students,” said CUNY Chancellor Félix V. Matos Rodríguez. “One of the country’s most robust antidotes to food insecurity has long been largely off limits to one of its most vulnerable populations. Enabling all college students of limited means to qualify for SNAP benefits would be an unprecedented step toward combating student food insecurity and, in so doing, making higher education more equitable. The EATS Act would help CUNY advance its mission of elevating New Yorkers from underserved communities. We thank Senator Gillibrand for her leadership.” ""Food insecurity was a serious problem in the South Bronx, even before COVID. Hostos and CUNY students who face this harsh reality deserve the opportunity the EATS Act bill presents. All eligible New York City students should know they can pursue their education and have food on their tables. Many drop out because they need to work to be eligible for SNAP benefits and cannot go to school. I am grateful to Senator Gillibrand for sponsoring the EATS Act, and to all four Bronx Congress Members Torres, Espaillat, Bowman and Ocasio-Cortez for co-sponsoring the bill, which if passed will expand the federal SNAP program to all eligible college students,"" said Dr. Daisy Cocco De Filippis, President of Hostos Community College.""Not only is enabling more low-income college students to obtain SNAP benefits the best way to fight campus hunger, it’s also one of the most effective ways to help students get their degrees, increase their long-term earning capabilities, and thus no longer need SNAP in the future,"" said Joel Berg, CEO of the nonprofit group Hunger Free America. ""We once again thank Senator Gillibrand for her steadfast leadership on these vital issues.""Today’s SNAP eligibility rules for students are overly complicated and only include college students working 20 hours per week or participating in a federal or state work study, or those who meet very specific exemptions. In December 2020, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, which temporarily extended SNAP eligibility to students who are eligible for federal or state work study and students with an Expected Family Contribution (EFC) of $0, including students eligible for the maximum Pell Grant. These temporary student eligibility changes for SNAP will remain in effect until 30 days after the federally declared COVID-19 public health emergency ends. The EATS Act goes a step further and would permanently ensure that low-income college students have equitable access to SNAP benefits by amending the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to include “attending an institution of higher education” as a form of qualification the same as work. With this change, 470,000 New York college students would qualify for SNAP assistance, including as many as 290,000 newly eligible students.For a one-pager of the EATS Act, click here. For the bill text of the EATS Act, click here.For the endorsement list, click here. "
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/on-senate-floor-gillibrand-urges-congress-to-include-paid-leave-in-the-build-back-better-bill,"Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand spoke on the Senate floor urging her colleagues to include paid family and medical leave provisions in the Build Back Better bill. For nearly ten years, Senator Gillibrand has been fighting to create a national paid leave program, which would help prevent workers from having to choose between their paycheck and their health or the health of a loved one. During the pandemic, we saw firsthand how this affected more than 5 million women who lost their jobs. The United States is the only industrialized country without a paid leave program and, today, nearly 8 in 10 workers in America still do not have access to paid family leave. Including a universal paid leave program in the Build Back Better Bill is beneficial to both employees and employers, and would help mitigate the impossible choice so people can take care of their children, their aging parents, and themselves without worrying about losing their job or their paycheck.Below are Senator Gillibrand’s remarks as prepared for delivery:M. President, I rise to join my colleagues in calling for the Build Back Better bill to include provisions that will solve the problems working people and families have been facing for too long and that were magnified by COVID.Paid leave is the perfect example. Today, nearly 8 in 10 workers in America don’t have paid family leave. Those numbers are even worse for lower wage workers, just 12 percent of whom have access to paid family leave. But we know nearly every single worker will need paid leave at some point – whether they are dealing with another pandemic or a personal emergency. We have to recognize that workers are people first – people who get sick, who have babies, who adopt children, who need to care for their children when they get sick, who have parents who age and die. They work to provide for those families, but providing for your family means – first and foremost – being able to care for them. Without paid leave they can’t. They are forced to make an impossible choice between their family and their paycheck and we see the reality of those choices every day. We send new mothers back to work while they are still bleeding, while their stitches are healing, before they can even recognize postpartum depression. We force them to leave their babies when they are just days old – they can’t nurse them, they can’t bond with them. And they can’t even put them in child care because they are too young.Right now, many women get less time with their babies than dogs get before being separated from their puppies. That is how we’re valuing women workers right now – less than dogs.This issue extends far beyond new mothers. New fathers should be able to stay home with new children. Parents with sick children should be able to care for them without fear of losing their job. And workers who need to move a parent to a memory care facility or take them to chemotherapy should be able to do so without risking their professional future. Without paid leave too many workers have no choice but to quit their jobs at the very moment they most need a paycheck and health insurance. It’s inhumane. Not having a paid leave program also leaves us vulnerable to future health crises. If we’d had paid leave in place before the pandemic, millions of people could’ve stayed home from work when they got sick, limiting the spread of COVID, or could’ve stayed home with their children when schools closed, limiting the number of people who lost or had to leave their jobs. I heard from a New Yorker named Amir, whose son’s health and special needs were becoming significantly more complex, and required his and his spouse’s full attention around the clock for weeks. At a time of great stress, they were not only worrying about how they could best care for their son, but also how they could maintain their livelihoods. Luckily, they were able to turn to New York’s state paid leave program. He told me it saved their family – they were able to focus on being good parents without harming their ability to be good professionals.Your ability to access that kind of support should not be dependent on where you live. But right now, just 9 states and DC have enacted paid leave legislation, leaving far too many Americans vulnerable.The numbers prove that paid leave keeps people employed, providing stability to their families and the companies they work for. A study in the Journal of Population Economics found that women who take paid family leave are 40 percent more likely to return to work after having a new child than those who don’t take it. And, in general, workers who can take paid leave return to their job up to 97 percent of the time. That makes paid leave a good business investment – it helps ensure that the time and money companies invest into an employee doesn’t walk out the door when the employee gets sick.Furthermore, when paid leave was implemented in California, nine in ten employers said that either did not change or improved profitability, employee productivity and morale, and many said it decreased turnover.Major corporations already know that offering paid leave helps them attract and retain the best talent. By making this program universal, we can level the playing field and allow small businesses to compete with them and hire the best of the best. In fact, that same survey of California employers found that small businesses were actually more likely to report seeing no change or an improvement in their productivity and profitability when paid leave was implemented. So, it is not surprising to see that 70 percent of small business owners and operators support the creation of a national paid leave program.State programs have also shown us that these programs are not targets for fraud. In California, 91 percent of employers said that they were unaware of any instances where their employees abused the state’s paid leave program. And in a study of New Jersey employers, none were aware of any instances of employees abusing the state’s paid leave program.Creating a national paid leave program makes economic sense. Every year that we go without paid leave costs American workers and their families 22.6 billion dollars in lost wages. That’s 22.6 billion dollars that could be going back into our economy – helping families get groceries, pay bills or buy homes. And it’s estimated that the mass exodus of women from the workforce during COVID could have long-term costs as high as 64.5 billion dollars in lost wages and economic activity every year. We can stem those losses now if we take action.I would also like to note, for those who are worried about the price tag of this bill, that paid leave was included in the House version of this bill, which the CBO found essentially pays for itself.There is a reason every other industrialized nation – with every kind of political system – has paid leave: it works. Most of them offer far more leave than this bill would, and their economies are proof that it is a net-positive. We can’t be a global economic leader when we’re not even in the game.  Beyond all of that – this is what the American people, the people who send us here to serve them, want. A full 70 percent of voters – including 81 percent of Democrats and 58 percent of Republicans – said that paid family and medical leave should be included in the reconciliation bill. This bill is designed to help the American people, and this is the help they are asking for.This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape the American workplace. We should not squander it. To my colleagues who say that we should not proceed on paid leave until we can do so in a bipartisan manner, I say that the American people cannot afford to wait for us to have the same conversations for another year that lead us to the same result – offers of a plan that is not universal or mandatory. A voluntary plan is not what the American people want or need. They need a plan that covers all workers for all life events.There is good bipartisan work we can do in the future to build on the plan included in the House bill, and I look forward to doing that work. But this is not the moment to delay or deny the American people the help they clearly need. This is the moment to deliver on paid leave and invest in the future of our families, our middle class, our companies, and our country. We should not miss this chance. We should include paid leave in the Build Back Better Bill. "

This way, the producers who understand these dynamics firsthand will have a voice in formulating any potential changes in calculating the price of Class I milk. The introduction of this bill was a direct result of Senator Gillibrand’s Senate Agriculture Subcommittee hearing on modernizing milk pricing and the Federal Milk Marketing Order system (FMMO) and would pave the way for critical FMMO reform in not just Class I pricing, but potentially other areas of need. Gillibrand will continue her efforts as chair of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock Dairy, Poultry, Local Food Systems, and Food Safety to focus on modernizing the FMMO system.“When the dairy pricing system isn’t working for farmers, the economic ramifications are felt across the country. I heard from producers across the industry firsthand during my subcommittee hearing on dairy pricing and the message was clear– our dairy pricing system is inadequate, out of date, and working against producers. That’s why I introduced the Dairy Pricing Opportunity Act, a bill that would put the power back in farmers’ hands and bring the industry together to build a system that works for the 21st century dairy farmer. This bill is a great first step and I look forward to continuing efforts on broader FMMO modernization.” – Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, chair of the Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, Poultry, Local Food Systems, and Food Safety and Security“Even before the coronavirus pandemic upended the dairy economy, producers in Vermont and throughout the Northeast were already struggling through years of price volatility, market consolidation, and rising costs. Small- and mid-sized farms, the very same farms that have underpinned Vermont’s rural communities for generations, have long borne the brunt of these market forces. As Congress and USDA help farmers recover from the pandemic’s immediate impacts, it’s a critical time to reexamine the federal milk pricing system and ensure it works equitably for all farmers.”  - Senator Patrick Leahy, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee“Maine dairy farmers are resilient, and for years they have been weathering the storms of market instability and industry consolidation. The Dairy Pricing Opportunity Act would help restore some stability to this sector by ensuring that USDA holds public hearings to receive farmers’ input on ways to correct the unintended consequences of a pre-pandemic pricing policy. Our dairy farmers have always worked tirelessly to provide high-quality, nutritious products for Maine people, and we must address the obstacles that threaten to prevent them from carrying on that tradition.” – Senator Susan CollinsSenator Gillibrand represents the fourth largest dairy-producing state in the nation and heard from dairy farmers and industry experts across the nation during her September Agriculture subcommittee hearing on dairy pricing. Experts agree - the current milk pricing system is one of the most complicated economic systems in the country and leaves too many farmers without adequate pay, especially as costs rise and competition intensifies. Even before the pandemic, dairy farmers across the nation were facing the challenges of volatile milk prices, as well as increased competition from non-dairy “milk” products. This has led to a substantial loss of licensed dairy herds, with the United States losing almost 40,000 dairy herds since 2003. The Dairy Pricing Opportunity Act would allow dairy producers and industry to consider and review proposals that could change Class I skim milk pricing, while also creating the opportunity for hearings to be held on other areas of the Federal Order system that are in need of reform.The Dairy Pricing Opportunity Act has been endorsed by the American Farm Bureau Federation, New York Farm Bureau, American Dairy Coalition, the Maine Dairy Industry Association, and the Northeast Dairy Producers Association..Prior to the 2018 Farm Bill, Class I milk was calculated using the “higher of” Class III or Class IV price plus the applicable Class I differential. This was changed in the most recent Farm Bill to an averaging method of Class III and Class IV plus $0.74. This change, compounded by government intervention in cheese markets as a result of the pandemic, has resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in lost income for dairy farmers from May 2019 through April 2021. This combination of factors demonstrates that when there is a wide discrepancy between the Class III and Class IV price, the current mover will cause significant loss of Class I skim milk revenue relative to the previous Class I mover and what was intended by Congress in the 2018 Farm Bill change. This has led to increased calls from producers and industry for USDA to hold Federal Milk Marketing Order national hearings to resolve this issue with the Class I mover.For the full text of the bill, please click here. "

The bipartisan and bicameral letter is signed by 44 senators and 22 members of the House. MJIIPA would professionalize how the military prosecutes serious crimes by moving the decision over whether to prosecute them to independent, experienced military prosecutors, and was successfully included in the committee-passed Senate National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2022. MJIIPA currently has 66 Senate co-sponsors and the House companion legislation has 220 co-sponsors, representing a majority of the House.“It is outrageous that the Senate and House Armed Services Committees would even consider stripping out a provision that is backed by a bipartisan majority in both chambers and has been included in the Senate version of the bill. Sexual assault in the military is a serious concern and demands a real solution, not a watered-down provision slipped in the final bill behind closed doors. Retaining the full Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act provision will ensure that the will of this strong majority is respected. It is the only reform that will provide true independence for prosecutors in the military justice system and is essential to ensure that victims, accused, and the public all have full faith and confidence in the military justice process.” – said Senator Gillibrand.In addition to the bill’s widespread congressional support, veterans service groups are also applying pressure to congressional leadership. On November 23, coalition of veterans groups—including the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, AMVETS, Student Veterans of America, the Service Women Action Network and Vietnam Veterans of America— wrote a letter to congressional leaders pushing them not to remove or water down military sexual assault reform provisions in the final NDAA. The American Legion sent a similar letter on November 29.Furthermore, earlier this month, 29 state attorneys general, led by Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson, penned a letter to congressional leadership urging Congress to swiftly pass Senator Gillibrand’s widely supported MJIIPA. In addition to Senator Gillibrand, the signers include Senators Baldwin (D-WI), Bennet (D-CO), Blumenthal (D-CT), Booker (D-NJ), Brown (D-OH), Cardin (D-MD), Carper (D-DE), Casey (D-PA), Coons (D-DE), Cortez Masto (D-NV), Cruz (R-TX), Duckworth (D-IL), Durbin (D-IL), Ernst (R-IA), Feinstein (D-CA), Grassley (R-IA), Hawley (R-MO), Hassan (D-NH), Heinrich (D-NM), Hickenlooper (D-CO), Hirono (D-HI), Kaine (D-VA), Klobuchar (D-MN), Leahy (D-VT), Lujan (D-NM), Markey (D-MA), Marshall (R-KS), Menendez (D-NJ), Merkley (D-OR), Murphy (D-CT), Murray (D-WA), Padilla (D-CA), Sanders (I-VT), Schatz (D-HI), Shaheen (D-NH), T.

https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/icymi-military-times-veterans-groups-urge-congress-to-include-military-sexual-assault-reforms-in-defense-authorization-bill,"In case you missed it, the Military Times published a story about a coalition of veterans groups pushing Congress to not remove or water down military sexual assault reform provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The Senate NDAA includes Senator Gillibrand’s Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act, which would move the decision of whether to prosecute serious non-military crimes out of the hands of commanders and into the hands of independent, professional military prosecutors. The veterans groups represent the interests of millions of veterans and service members and include the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, AMVETS, Student Veterans of America, the Service Women Action Network and Vietnam Veterans of America.Read the full article here and below.Vets groups worry military sexual assault reforms will be dropped from Congress’ defense bill plansLeo Shane III | November 23, 2021 Veterans groups are urging lawmakers not to drop provisions in the annual defense authorization bill to overhaul how military sexual misconduct cases are prosecuted amid worries that congressional leaders are already backing away from the idea.“The scourge of sexual assault in the military is a serious concern and demands a real solution, not a watered-down provision slipped in the final bill behind closed doors,” a coalition of leading advocates wrote to House and Senate leaders on Tuesday. “Retaining the [reforms] will ensure that the will of this strong majority of both houses of Congress is respected.”Signers of the letter include officials from Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, AMVETS, Student Veterans of America, the Service Women Action Network and Vietnam Veterans of America.At issue is the controversial Military Justice Improvement Act, provisions of which were already approved by the full House membership and the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year.The proposal — championed by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. — would move felony crimes out of the traditional military chain of command and into a new specially trained group of military prosecutors.Proponents have argued that military leaders for years have failed to adequately handle sexual assault and abuse cases under the current system, and that removing all felony cases from their purview is the only way to ensure they are dealt with fairly and professionally.Military leaders for years resisted the idea. But earlier this year, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a reversal of that stance, supporting changes to create a separate legal track for only the sexual misconduct cases.Lawmakers were expected to settle the issue in this year’s annual defense authorization legislation.But the Senate still has yet to pass its draft of the measure, meaning debate over many topics in the sweeping policy bill may be cut short or cut off entirely as chamber leaders scramble to write a compromise measure in the next few weeks.House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, D-Wash., last week said House and Senate leaders are already looking at alternatives to the traditional conference process, potentially crafting new — and simplified — legislation to speed up passage of a final agreement.The coalition of veterans groups urged lawmakers not to abandon the needed prosecutorial reforms in that condensed debate process.“According to VA, approximately 1 in 3 women veterans and 1 in 50 male veterans experienced military sexual trauma while serving their country,” their letter states. “DoD has given this issue a great deal of attention over the past few years but has failed to find the right solution as numbers continue to rise each year.“Over the years, this legislation has continued to receive an increasing amount of support from legislators and veteran service organizations, coming to an all-time high this Congress. It would be disrespectful to all those that have experienced the injustice not include [it] within the NDAA.”The defense authorization bill has passed out of Congress for each of the last 60 consecutive years. "
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/schumer-gillibrand-announce-300000-in-federal-funding-for-local-arts-organizations-,"Today, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand announced $300,000 in federal funding for local arts agencies in Westchester and St. Lawrence counties. The funding was allocated through the National Endowment for the Arts as part of the American Rescue Plan and will be used to help local arts venues recover from the economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic. ArtsWestchester and the St. Lawrence County Arts Council will each receive $150,000 for subgranting within their own communities. “The arts are the beating heart of New York’s cultural life and a driving force in the economy; an investment in the arts is an investment in New York’s future, as a cultural capital of the world, tourist destination, and a vibrant place to live,” said Senator Schumer. “Our arts venues were among the hardest hit during the heights of the pandemic, and I am proud to deliver this critical funding which will help art venues in the Hudson Valley and North Country recover and thrive. I will continue to fight hard for programs that support our artists, foster creativity and supports venues as the critical cultural hubs that they are on Main Streets across the state.” “New York’s cultural institutions are world-renowned,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This funding will help ensure they have what they need to survive and thrive after the devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic.” “ArtsWestchester has supported artists throughout the pandemic with over $730K in grants and commissions,” said ArtsWestchester CEO Janet T. Langsam. “This major American Rescue Plan grant from the NEA will help us expand our support of the artist community through our Voices for Change grant program in 2022. Voices for Change grants will enable artists to develop and present new work that inspires and informs and may be a catalyst for action. ArtsWestchester believes that art has the ability to address complex social issues, encourage discussion in communities and open up new ways to look at old issues. Central to our mission is the advancement of diversity, inclusiveness and equity. After two years without the arts, investment in the cultural sector is more important than ever in order to help the arts make a comeback in the nation.”Senator Gillibrand has long been a supporter of New York’s vibrant art community. Earlier this year, she voted for the American Rescue Plan, which included this funding for the National Endowment for the Arts."

The funding was awarded through the Appalachian Regional Commission INvestments Supporting Partnerships In Recovery Ecosystems (INSPIRE) Initiative and will be used to provide comprehensive support and workforce re-entry services for over 100 individuals struggling with substance use disorders. The funding will also help provide training for 20 local businesses to become recovery-friendly workplaces. “In the face of the record number of overdose deaths in the nation, it is crystal clear we must take more aggressive and coordinated action to prevent and treat substance abuse and addiction. And today’s federal funding for Delaware and Otsego County will work to rally community resources for employment services and outreach surrounding addiction recovery support,” said Senator Schumer. “I am proud to deliver this essential funding and will continue to fight to ensure New Yorkers struggling with addiction have all the help they need to get back on their feet and receive gainful employment.”  “The pandemic has exacerbated an ongoing addiction crisis, but in too many of New York’s rural communities, those suffering from substance use disorder and addiction have nowhere to turn for help,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This funding will help remedy the shortage of recovery services in Delaware and Otsego counties and provide individuals struggling with addiction with the resources they need to get back on their feet and secure gainful employment. I will keep fighting for programs that help New York overcome the epidemic of addiction.” The project will provide individuals engaged in recovery who are unemployed or underemployed with case management and peer support services throughout the recovery, job search, and job training process. Businesses that employ these individuals will also receive assistance and education. Local sources will provide an additional $500,000 of project funding."
https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov//news/press/release/gillibrand-bill-modernizes-wic-program-and-makes-families-first-coronavirus-response-act-waivers-permanent,"Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, along with Senator Roger Marshall, introduced the bipartisan More Options to Develop and Enhance Remote Nutrition in WIC Act (MODERN WIC) to make WIC more accessible to low-income families and help ensure more applicants receive needed benefits by allowing them to certify and recertify for WIC services remotely. In the first year of the pandemic alone, WIC providers reported a 2.5% increase in WIC participation and more low-income households continue relying on this social safety net to feed themselves and their families. To keep up with the growing need, Gillibrand’s bill would invest $60 million to modernize the critical safety net program and codify two waivers granted through the Families First Coronavirus Response Act that simplified user access to WIC benefits throughout the pandemic by offering remote services. Currently, the two waivers are in place until the Public Health Emergency status is set to expire on January 16, 2022.“Bringing the WIC program into the 21st century will make these essential benefits more accessible than ever before,” said Senator Gillibrand. “Something as simple as loading a WIC EBT card should be easy and flexible, and should never be a roadblock that keeps families from putting food on the table. The MODERN WIC Act would provide the investments and upgrades needed so that all children and infants can have a healthy start to life.”“I am excited to partner with Senator Gillibrand on the MODERN WIC Act,” said Senator Marshall. “I’ve seen firsthand the benefits WIC brings to mothers and their children, heightening access and efficiency to the WIC program for American families is a common-sense solution in a post-pandemic world.”“Remote WIC services implemented during COVID-19 removed the most persistent barriers to ongoing participation and resulted in sharp increases in child retention. The MODERN WIC Act is transformative legislation that smartly incorporates lessons learned during COVID-19 to build stronger, more inclusive WIC services,” said Rev. Douglas Greenaway, President & CEO of the National WIC Association. “The MODERN WIC Act lays out a measured approach to preserve flexible appointment structures while bolstering WIC’s public health character by ensuring ongoing health assessments and promoting coordination with physicians. WIC families should be given the same options available in healthcare settings, including online applications and telehealth appointments. As Congress considers Child Nutrition Reauthorization, we thank Senators Gillibrand and Marshall for their leadership in spearheading this urgent effort to chart a course for modern, 21st-century WIC services.”“Our goal is to best serve moms, babies and young children, and The MODERN WIC Act is an important step to allow us to connect families as effectively as possible with WIC’s nutrition support,” said Lauren Brand, Chair of the WIC Association of NYS. “We know from decades of research findings both that WIC improves child health outcomes, and that out-dated technology and regulations have been long-standing barriers to WIC access and retention. Local WIC agencies have worked hard to serve nearly 370,000 New Yorkers every month throughout the COVID-19 public health crisis, and our participation has strengthened, thanks to USDA waivers allowing remote services. WIC will return to in-office options after the national emergency health crisis, but as overdue advances in telehealth have made clear from lessons learned during the pandemic, video and telephone certifications should be allowed and equipped to continue. The MODERN WIC Act honors WIC’s public health mission and, as our nation’s premiere maternal and child health nutrition program, help WIC clinics rise to healthcare industry standards be 21st Century patient-centered and better serve this generation’s parents.”  “The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and our members support improving health and reducing food insecurity for pregnant people, new mothers and their children,” said Kevin L. Sauer, registered dietitian nutritionist and the Academy’s 2021-2022 President. “The Academy thanks U.S. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Roger Marshall (Kan.) for introducing the MODERN WIC Act, which capitalizes on lessons we’ve learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and will provide flexibility for WIC participants to use remote certification and ensure all eligible mothers and children can access this important program.”“We are grateful for Senator Gillibrand’s leadership in introducing The MODERN WIC Act,” said Andres Vives, Executive Director of Hunger Solutions New York. “This legislation equips our nation’s premiere maternal and child health nutrition program to be technologically responsive and attentive to the needs of today’s families. WIC currently serves less than 50 percent of potentially eligible moms, babies, and children here in New York, and the MODERN WIC ACT will help more eligible families to get the benefits and food they need to thrive.”Now more than ever, improvements made to the WIC program during the COVID-19 pandemic should be made permanent. Remote WIC services implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic helped remove common barriers to participation, helping to significantly increase child retention. Specifically, the two waivers proposed to be codified in this bill would:In addition to codifying these two waivers, the MODERN WIC Act would provide $60 million in funding for WIC offices around the country to upgrade and establish technology to help streamline these changes to the program. The bill also requires the Secretary of Agriculture to submit a report to Congress outlining the uses of remote technologies, impact of remote technologies, and best practices.This legislation is endorsed by the National WIC Association, 1,000 Days, A Better Balance, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the Alliance to End Hunger, the Association of Maternal & Child Health Programs, the Association of State Public Health Nutritionists, Bread for the World, Danone North America, First Focus Campaign for Children, FMI – The Food Industry Association, Hunger Solutions NY, MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hunger, the National Grocers Association, the Nurse-Family Partnership, RESULTS, Save the Children, Save the Children Action Network (SCAN), the Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior, and the WIC Association of New York State.The full text of the legislation can be found here.In addition to MODERN WIC Act, Senators Gillibrand and Marshall introduced the WIC Healthy Beginnings Act to promote competition and quality for infant formula manufacturers by creating an online database to centralize state solicitations. The database would be administered through USDA and would help streamline bids from formula manufacturers to state WIC programs. Currently, an infant formula manufacturer would have to sift through all contract solicitations in all 50 states in order to make bids. This legislation will increase transparency in the solicitation bid process and help prevent disruptions in getting essential nutrition to children and infants.During the height of the pandemic, 1 in 5 parents nationwide did not have enough money to feed their children. To help keep families fed, Senator Gillibrand successfully led a push for $6 billion in funding for WIC -- including $90 million to continue WIC’s highly successful Breastfeeding Peer Counselor program, which provides vital peer-to-peer support, especially in underserved areas, and $14 million for program infrastructure. Gillibrand also successfully fought for the inclusion of an emergency increase in the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Cash-Value Benefit in the American Rescue Plan, which more than doubled benefits for participating women and children. In March of this year, Gillibrand led a bicameral push from over 135 members of Congress, urging U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack to review and increase the value of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) food packages in order to reflect a modern, healthy diet. Gillibrand also leads the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and the WIC Farmers Market Nutrition Program annual appropriations letters every year and is a major anti-hunger champion. "

As directed by President Biden at the beginning of his presidency, HHS is currently undergoing a review of these rules. Gillibrand and her colleagues expressed concern over the widespread consequences of the rule, which caused more than 1,000 health centers to withdraw from the Title X program following the rule’s implementation, inhibited 844,083 fewer patients from receiving Title X-funded services in 2019 compared to 2018, and left 6 states without any Title X-funded health centers.“The dangerous domestic gag rule was one of the last administration’s most blatant attempts to interfere in patients’ rights to make their own reproductive health care choices, and I’m encouraged that President Biden has already taken steps to review it,” said Senator Gillibrand. “The consequences of this policy are clear and far reaching and it must be rescinded immediately. Rebuilding the Title X program and funding our federal family planning programs should be a priority for Congress so that all people have access to essential reproductive health services they need.”Full text of the letter can be found here and below.Dear Secretary Cochran:We write to encourage you to swiftly complete your review of the current regulations (42 CFR Part 59) for the Title X family planning program, as directed by President Biden in his January 28, 2021 Presidential Memorandum on Protecting Women’s Health at Home and Abroad. As you know, the memorandum directs HHS to “consider, as soon as practicable, whether to suspend, revise, or rescind, or publish for notice and comment proposed rules suspending, revising, or rescinding, those regulations, consistent with applicable law, including the Administrative Procedure Act.”[1] We believe that this review will make clear that the changes made to the Title X program resulted in numerous harms to patients and community health, and that the COVID-19 pandemic necessitates immediate rescission of the current rule. We urge you to complete the rescission no later than March 29, 60 days after the president issued the presidential memorandum.  Title X is the nation’s only dedicated source of federal funding for family planning services, and it is essential we restore the capacity of this vital program. The Trump administration pushed forward the 2019 rule over the objections of many major medical and public health organizations, 218 members of Congress, and tens of thousands of members of the public.[2] Experts in medicine, law, public health, and reproductive health, rights, and justice argued that the rule was both unlawful and one of the greatest threats to access to family planning in the United States in a generation. Unfortunately, the predictions of curtailed access to critical family planning and sexual health services have proven correct: more than 1,000 health centers withdrew from the program following the rule’s implementation; 844,083 fewer patients received Title X-funded services in 2019 than did in 2018;[3] six states have no Title X-funded health centers; and providers and community members across the country have struggled to maintain access to care under the onerous terms of the rule. Every day that the rule remains in effect is another day that access to family planning services for people with low or no incomes is under threat. The rule’s rescission is particularly urgent in light of the challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic has placed on the public health safety net, of which Title X providers are a key part. The Title X program disproportionately serves communities of color and people with low incomes,[4] and failure to act will only serve to compound the devastating impact the pandemic is having on these communities. In addition, a 2020 study found that the pandemic has led many women to want to delay or prevent pregnancy even as it has made it more difficult for people to access family planning and sexual health care, including contraception. Both of these findings were strongest for women of color and women with low incomes.[5] Rebuilding the Title X program, which cannot begin until the rule is rescinded, is one of the most important ways that the Biden administration can support access to family planning and other essential health care services during this challenging time for our country.  Finally, we know that President Biden stands firmly behind efforts to rescind the rule. During the presidential campaign, he pledged to undo the Trump administration’s rule,[6] and he prioritized this issue as one to address during his first ten days in office. We urge you to work with all possible speed to complete your review of the program and move to quickly rescind the rule and reinstate the previous regulations that governed the program. We look forward to remaining updated on your progress in the weeks to come.Sincerely, "
