https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/small-independent-business-advocate-names-boozman-a-champion-for-industry,"WASHINGTON––The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) named U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) a “Guardian of Small Business” award winner for his consistent support of legislation that benefits small, independent businesses during the 117th Congress.Boozman, an optometrist and former small business owner, has earned NFIB’s top honor throughout his tenure in the Senate. “The NFIB Guardian of Small Business award is presented to Senators who have proven themselves to be real champions of small business,” said NFIB President and CEO Brad Close. “This Congress, small businesses emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic but faced continual threats of high inflation, workforce shortages, and supply chain disruptions. These NFIB Guardians demonstrated strong support of small businesses on key issues. NFIB is unique in that we only represent small and independent businesses, and our members decide our policy positions. We are proud to recognize the elected officials from the 117th Congress who earned this distinction by taking pro-small business votes that supported an extension of the Paycheck Protection Program and opposed tax increases and new mandates that would have threatened Main Street’s economic recovery. NFIB commends Senator Boozman for earning the Guardian of Small Business Award.”Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/small-independent-business-advocate-names-boozman-a-champion-for-industry"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/boozman-backed-drone-inspection-grant-program-gains-momentum,"WASHINGTON––Following House-passage of the Drone Infrastructure Inspection Grant Act, U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) advocated for the Senate to pass the bipartisan legislation during an Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW) hearing Wednesday.Boozman highlighted the efforts in Arkansas to use drones to enhance infrastructure inspections across the state. “One of the reasons I’m championing this legislation is because the Arkansas Department of Transportation has really embraced the use of drones to augment human inspectors and spot flaws,” Boozman said. The nominee to serve as Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, Shailen Bhatt, promoted the use of drone technology to improve infrastructure safety calling it “efficient” and expressing excitement about the possibilities it offers. The Drone Infrastructure Inspection Grant Act would authorize $100 million in competitive grants to use American-made drones to perform critical infrastructure inspection, maintenance or construction projects. This bipartisan bill would also authorize $100 million in grants for workforce training and education to prepare the next generation of workers in this field. It was introduced by Boozman and Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT).Boozman promoted this legislation in this column published last month about the use of drones in Arkansas.

https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/senators-introduce-resolution-recognizing-the-75th-anniversary-of-the-u-s-air-force,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Air Force Caucus Co-chairs Senators John Boozman (R-AR), Jon Tester (D-MT), John Hoeven (R-ND) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) introduced a resolution commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Air Force as an independent military branch.“As an air, space and cyberspace leader, the Air Force continues to innovate, accelerate and thrive in order to meet the challenges in defending our nation and its allies. Our airmen deliver the best airpower the world has ever known, bravely serving to protect freedom and liberty in all corners of the globe. As the son of a retired USAF Master Sergeant, I’m proud to honor our Air Force, airmen and their families, both across Arkansas and our country for their continued service and sacrifice to make American air superiority exceptional,” Boozman said. “Since the earliest days of World War I, our nation’s military aviators have served and sacrificed on all seven continents to defend the United States against enemies of freedom and democracy. As Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, I will continue to work hard to provide the brave members of our Air Force with the resources they need to make sure we maintain our place as the world’s leading military power in the face of threats from adversaries like China and Russia. The members of the Air Force are heroes, and I’m immensely proud of their work at Malmstrom Air Force Base and around the world to promote liberty and ensure our national security,” Tester said.“For 75 years, the U.S. Air Force has gone above and beyond in defense of our nation,” said Hoeven. “North Dakota is proud to be home to the Minot Air Force Base and the Grand Forks Air Force Base along with our Air National Guard wing in Fargo. The incredible airmen at these bases play a vital role in our nation’s defense. As a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Committee, we remain committed to ensuring the Air Force is well positioned to be a strong force for many years to come.” “Ohio has a proud legacy of leading the country in aviation, from the Wright Brothers and Eddie Rickenbacker, to the airmen now serving in Toledo, Dayton, Youngstown and beyond,” said Brown. “We come together to honor the contributions of those who have kept us safe for the past 75 years, and those continuing to protect our country today.” The Air Force was established on September 18, 1947 as part of the National Security Act of 1947. The Air Force is recognizing this milestone with celebrations across the country including at the U.S. Capitol with members of the U.S. Senate Air Force Caucus Wednesday.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/senators-introduce-resolution-recognizing-the-75th-anniversary-of-the-u-s-air-force"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/boozman-gop-colleagues-biden-administration-s-overreaching-child-mask-mandate-must-end,"WASHINGTON––U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) joined U.S. Sens. John Thune (R-SD) and Richard Burr (R-NC), ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and other GOP colleagues in sending a letter to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra requesting the department rescind its one-size-fits-all federal mask mandate on Head Start programs. Children six months to five years of age are currently eligible to be vaccinated against COVID-19, but a HHS interim final rule (IFR) still requires all staff and volunteers in Head Start educational facilities to be vaccinated and requires all staff, volunteers, and children two years of age and older to wear masks – even when they are outside on the playground. “This IFR continues to be an overly rigid, inflexible rule that complicates individual Head Start programs’ ability to operate and attract staff and volunteers – though there is a preliminary injunction against the IFR in multiple states – and we request that you immediately rescind it,” the senators wrote. “The nation must continue to transition toward treating COVID-19 as an endemic condition and return to a sense of normalcy, and it is past time for Washington bureaucrats to allow Head Start programs to do the same.”In May, the Senate passed a bipartisan resolution to repeal the Biden administration’s mask mandate for toddlers in the Head Start program. In January, Republican Senators sent a letter to Secretary Becerra requesting the administration rescind the IFR.The Head Start program is a federal program that provides qualifying, low-income children with early education services. Program facilities are located throughout the nation and, up until the issuance of this IFR, individual locations had been able to set and enforce their own COVID-19 protocols. Although this rule has been halted by federal courts in several states, the only way to ensure it never sees the light of day is to permanently rescind it nationwide.    The letter was also signed by U.S. Sens. John Barrasso (R-WY), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mike Braun (R-IN), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), James Lankford (R-OK), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Jim Risch (R-ID), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Dan Sullivan (R-AK) and Thom Tillis (R-NC).  Full letter below: The Honorable Xavier Becerra                                                                                                          Secretary                                                                                                                                            U.S. Department of Health & Human Services                                                                             200 Independence Avenue, Southwest                                                                                 Washington, D.C. 20201 Dear Secretary Becerra:Since November 2021, vaccine and mask mandates on Head Start and Early Head Start programs have been in effect as a result of a U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) interim final rule (IFR). We write to highlight how unnecessary these mandates continue to be and request that this IFR be rescinded immediately. As you know, as of January 31, 2022, this IFR requires Head Start staff and volunteers to be vaccinated against COVID-19. It also requires Head Start staff and volunteers to wear masks. But beyond these mandates, the IFR also requires students two years of age and older to wear masks despite the World Health Organization advising against mask mandates for children five years of age and younger.Up until the publication of this IFR in late 2021 – more than 18 months after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic – individual Head Start programs across the nation had the flexibility to implement their own precautions that effectively protected staff, volunteers, and students in these facilities. This flexibility afforded each individual program the opportunity to establish health and safety protocols and other mitigation strategies that were consistent with state and local laws and recommendations that worked best for their staff, volunteers, and students. In fact, according to a December 2020 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this flexibility was effective, as the CDC found that individual programs successfully implemented recommendations that limited the transmission of COVID-19 in their facilities.The application of inflexible federal rules on individual Head Start programs through this IFR and the forcing of toddlers enrolled in these programs to wear masks even caught the attention of Congress. On May 3, 2022, the U.S. Senate passed a joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of this IFR by a bipartisan vote of 55 to 41, with seven Democrats supporting the resolution and opposing the IFR.Prior to Senate consideration of the resolution, President Biden unfortunately committed to vetoing it. A primary reason for his opposition was because, at the time of Senate consideration, the CDC had not yet approved children five years of age and younger to be vaccinated against COVID-19. However, on June 18, 2022, the CDC approved certain COVID-19 vaccines for children six months through five years of age. Head Start-aged children are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine if their families so choose. This IFR continues to be an overly rigid, inflexible rule that complicates individual Head Start programs’ ability to operate and attract staff and volunteers – though there is a preliminary injunction against the IFR in multiple states – and we request that you immediately rescind it. The nation must continue to transition toward treating COVID-19 as an endemic condition and return to a sense of normalcy, and it is past time for Washington bureaucrats to allow Head Start programs to do the same. Thank you for your prompt attention to this request.  Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/boozman-gop-colleagues-biden-administration-s-overreaching-child-mask-mandate-must-end"

WASHINGTON––U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) joined U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, and dozens of their Republican colleagues in support of the Simplify Timelines and Assure Regulatory Transparency (START) Act, comprehensive federal regulatory permitting and project review reform legislation.“I'm pleased to join this effort to achieve permitting reform that is long overdue and will benefit our economy in a number of ways,” Boozman said. “It's especially needed in the face of historically high inflation and uncertainty caused by the Biden administration's policies. I appreciate Senator Capito’s leadership on this critical issue.” “Since our calls for action and offers to see legislative text from the permitting ‘deal’ remain unheeded, Republicans are introducing this legislation today to deliver solutions to the roadblocks, delays, and postponements of key infrastructure projects across the country,” Ranking Member Capito said. “The START Act would provide regulatory certainty to states, expedite permitting and review processes, codify substantive environmental regulatory reforms, and expedite permitting of the critically important Mountain Valley Pipeline. Republicans are unified in working to deliver needed permitting reform, and this legislation is a blueprint for how we can help communities benefit from being able to finally get critical projects across the finish line.”More than one month ago, Ranking Member Capito called on Democrats to release text, work together and enact strong permitting legislation before proceeding forward with their reckless tax-and-spending spree.After no text was released and no Republican input taken, Boozman voted in favor of Capito’s amendment to the reconciliation bill that would have enacted strong permitting reforms for burdensome regulations currently delaying key energy and infrastructure projects across the country. The amendment failed by a vote of 50-49, with all 50 Senate Democrats voting against it.In addition to Boozman and Capito, the START Act is cosponsored by 45 other senators including Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Senators John Thune (R-SD), John Barrasso (R-WY), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Rick Scott (R-FL), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Jim Risch (R-ID), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Mike Braun (R-IN), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Todd Young (R-IN), Ted Cruz (R-TX), John Hoeven (R-ND), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Steve Daines (R-MT), Richard Shelby (R-AL), Richard Burr (R-NC), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Marco Rubio (R-FL), John Cornyn (R-TX), Tim Scott (R-SC), John Kennedy (R-LA), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Rob Portman (R-OH) and James Lankford (R-OK). BILL DETAILS:Full text of the legislation can be found here.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/boozman-supports-comprehensive-regulatory-and-permitting-reform-legislation"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/marking-suicide-prevention-month,"In Arkansas, 554 lives were lost to suicide and over 100,000 adults had suicidal thoughts last year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The tragic reality is a growing number of our family, friends and neighbors suffer from mental health conditions and despair that can lead to attempts to take their own lives. There are steps we can take to tackle this crisis and get our loved ones and others struggling in our communities the help they need.One is to remove the stigma from disclosing mental health issues and another is to empower those in need of support and treatment to seek it. It’s ok to talk about it –– and doing so can lead to lifesaving outcomes.This is not just a challenge that affects a particular demographic. It can touch people from all walks of life.For years, the rate of suicide has been higher in rural America than in urban areas. Farmers and ranchers experience incredible stress, anxiety and pressure in the course of their efforts to plant and harvest each year. Combined with limited access to mental health resources, these factors present a serious risk that leaves too many working and living in farm country as part of the agriculture industry feeling hopeless.Similarly, our nation’s veterans can often find themselves in dire mental health straits. Those who have deployed in combat zones can bring back invisible wounds of war that manifest in a variety of ways. We know that over 17 former servicemembers die by suicide each day, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, despite many good faith efforts to get them the outreach and assistance necessary to cope.These are just two groups among countless others that are susceptible to mental health crises and suicide. The list, unfortunately, goes on and on.Understanding who is at risk is just one piece, though important, of the larger puzzle to prevent suicide. The next step is to get resources and appropriate care to vulnerable populations. That has been a priority at all levels of government because our society’s awareness of this issue is increasing almost daily. We’re pushing resources and information out to those in crisis, including through federal and state agencies, establishing programs that seek to leverage successful existing approaches to community support and prevention, and expanding access to mental health care.The latest example is the creation of the 988 National Suicide Hotline, a quick and convenient way to connect any American who calls or texts this number to a trained crisis counselor. This critical tool can make a difference in the lives of those who are moments away from a tragic decision by providing free, confidential guidance.Coming together to confront this problem is what it will take to make a difference. September is National Suicide Prevention Month and serves to remind us how urgent it is to find solutions that will improve mental health and reduce the rate of suicide. This month also marks the 21st anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, which showed us just how resilient and supportive Americans can be for and with one another. Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/marking-suicide-prevention-month"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/boozman-cotton-womack-comment-on-va-inspector-general-report-on-community-care-coordination-delay,"WASHINGTON–– Arkansas U.S. Senators John Boozman and Tom Cotton and Congressman Steve Womack (AR-3) commented on the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General’s report on community care coordination delays for a veteran at the Fayetteville VA Medical Center:“In this instance, the Fayetteville VA Medical Center failed to live up to its mission. Negligence in ensuring a veteran receives the quality and timely care they deserve is unacceptable. I will be working with my colleagues to ensure those responsible will be held accountable and this never happens again, in Arkansas or elsewhere,” said Boozman, a member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee. “The Fayetteville VA Medical Center’s staff failed in their duty to this veteran—completely unacceptable. I will work with my colleagues to investigate this incident, hold to account those responsible, and prevent this negligence in the future,” Cotton said.“The report details an unacceptable failure on behalf of one of our heroes. Actions, or lack thereof, which jeopardize the health and well-being of any veteran breach the required and deserved standard of care. It’s a situation never to be repeated—and those liable must be held accountable. I will be working alongside my colleagues to ensure those obligations are met,” Womack said.Boozman has been leading legislation to ensure the VA improves oversight and accountability. In June, the president signed into law the Strengthening Oversight for Veterans Act to provide the VA Office of Inspector General with the authority to subpoena testimony from former VA employees who have left federal service, former contractor personnel who performed work for the VA or other potentially relevant individuals during the course of its inspections, reviews and investigations.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/boozman-cotton-womack-comment-on-va-inspector-general-report-on-community-care-coordination-delay"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/advancing-policies-to-fight-hunger,"Classrooms across the state are full of eager students ready to learn. Many Arkansas school kids are better prepared to learn as a result of a bipartisan law approved months ago helping ensure children could enjoy summer vacation without having to worry about being hungry. As the lead Republican on the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I joined with my Democrat counterpart to broker a deal to ensure kids have access to healthy, nutritious meals over the course of the summer and this school year.The Keep Kids Fed Act allowed meal program operators to continue to utilize flexibilities granted at the onset of the pandemic over this past summer break. It also extends administrative and paperwork flexibilities through the current school year to help schools streamline meal operations and continue serving food despite supply chain disruptions.  We’re all well aware of the skyrocketing food costs. On the Biden administration’s watch, food inflation has shot up to its highest rate since Jimmy Carter was president. This trend has increased food insecurity at home for many young Arkansans while also making it more difficult for schools and hunger relief organizations to step in and help those same children.   This need is especially acute during the summertime when families with children who rely on  meals at school no longer have access to this resource. In Arkansas, and across the country, there are a number of excellent organizations that step in to help during those months, but they are hamstrung by rules dating back to the 1960s. I have long-championed reforming the summer meals program to fix this outdated model. The flexibilities Congress granted providers during the pandemic were based off the Hunger-Free Summer for Kids Act which I introduced in the Senate. Removing outdated requirements during the pandemic spurred innovation with public-private partnerships and provided access to nutritious meals for young Arkansans. The success of this updated model offers a good recipe for how to reach more children in need.  In order to comply with social distancing mandates, Congress waived the requirement for children to travel to a central location and eat their meals together. While the congregate feeding standard works well in some communities, it clearly was not possible to operate in this manner during a pandemic. Even before COVID, it wasn’t feasible in many rural areas, as it can be difficult for children to reach a site—if one even exists. In suburban and urban areas, inclement weather or violence can keep children from these sites and cause them to miss a meal. The pandemic-instituted changes proved new options—from off-site, grab-and-go models, to home delivery, to electronic benefits transfer—do in fact reach a broader audience of those in need. While continuing to ensure that children have access to healthy meals this coming school year, the summertime flexibilities provided through the Keep Kids Feed Actshould be part of an overdue child nutrition reauthorization. As we recognize September as Hunger Action Month, I am committed to fighting hunger and will continue pushing for passage of the Hunger-Free Summer for Kids Act in a broader reauthorization to ensure all options for summertime meals remain on the table. Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/advancing-policies-to-fight-hunger"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/assisting-more-arkansans-as-federal-services-pick-up-pace,"Many federal agencies continue to fight backlogs as they dig out from pandemic shutdowns and two years of limited staffing.Having agencies like the Social Security Administration open in person again is welcome and I am pleased to see progress being made on getting caught up, however, I continue to hear the frustration of Arkansans every day who are working through bureaucratic processes that, unfortunately, are taking longer to resolve than in prior years.This struggle is apparent when we look at the numbers for the two federal agencies that handle requests for military records. The National Archives and Records Administration and the National Personnel Records Center have received more than 350,000 new requests in the last four months. Previously these agencies would have been able to manage the increase, but these new cases come amid their efforts to respond to those it accumulated during the pandemic, leaving them with 499,000 pending requests. For veterans and caregivers waiting for records to obtain benefits or services, that is an overwhelming number they’d rather not be buried deeply within. Unfortunately, the situation at other federal agencies is very similar. Backlogs at the IRS can have a ripple effect on other processes as taxpayers need data from the agency for everything from small business loans to immigration applications. The reality is we expect these challenges to continue, especially as staffing remains a hurdle in the public and private sectors. But across the board, there are things we can all do to help if we need federal services.The most important thing right now is to plan ahead. This is especially true with international travel. Although the Passport Agency made incredible strides to work through its pandemic backlog, it still takes up to three times longer to get a passport than it did in 2019 – an average of five to seven weeks for an expedited passport and eight to eleven weeks for standard processing. It is possible to get an in-person appointment for emergencies, but the Arkansas Passport Center has limited availability and cannot accept walk-in visitors. Another key is to get things right on the front end. Whether Arkansans are filing a tax return, a VA claim or applying for a passport, every agency tells my office cases needing changes or additional information are taking much longer. We’re seeing this in tax returns where mailed 2021 returns with no errors or additional verification take at least five months. However, amended returns don’t even have a timeline and the IRS says it won’t be able to provide updates on these until mid-October. For veterans, it a good idea to get help from an accredited veterans service officer before you file a claim. Having that process accurately completed on the front end can shave valuable months, and sometimes years, off of processing.  Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/assisting-more-arkansans-as-federal-services-pick-up-pace"

https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/boozman-cftc-commissioners-get-firsthand-look-at-blockchain-center-of-excellence,"WASHINGTON––U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR), ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioners Christy Goldsmith Romero and Summer Mersinger got a firsthand look at the Blockchain Center of Excellence at the University of Arkansas today while discussing a path forward to bring more consumer protection to the crypto industry.Boozman, who recently introduced the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act of 2022 to give the CFTC new tools and authorities to regulate digital commodities, invited the commissioners to Arkansas to further the discussion on how a mandatory framework will safeguard customers and markets. “There is simply no substitute for visits like this to ensure we are making informed decisions. The Blockchain Center of Excellence and the CFTC have been important partners to my office as we worked to draft this legislation, sharing crucial insight into the real-world impacts of the bill. The center truly is on the forefront of research of digital assets and more of our leading businesses are embracing the technology, positioning Arkansas as a leader in this emerging field and making it an ideal spot to further this discussion,” Boozman said.“As a sponsor of the CFTC’s Technology Advisory Committee, I am thrilled to join Senator Boozman at the University of Arkansas School of Law’s Blockchain Center of Excellence. The Blockchain Center is furthering a critical public discussion about the potential of blockchain technology to benefit American businesses and households,” said Commissioner Goldsmith Romero. “I am thankful to Senator Boozman for introducing me to the Blockchain Center. Senator Boozman has been a leader in working across the aisle with Senator Debbie Stabenow and other colleagues to bring digital assets, like Bitcoin, into a regulatory framework that focuses on the need to protect customers, safeguard customer assets, and address regulatory gaps.”“It was an honor to join Ranking Member Boozman today for this meeting at the University of Arkansas’ Center for Blockchain Excellence to see firsthand how they are preparing students for critical jobs in this cutting-edge industry. At the CFTC, we have seen firsthand how blockchain technology is being utilized in everything from commodities trading to farming. Ensuring a well-educated, domestic workforce is crucial to ensuring US competitiveness in developing and implementing blockchain technology throughout our economy.  Arkansans should be proud of both the key leadership roles both Ranking Member Boozman and the University of Arkansas are playing in our nation’s approach to the digital asset and blockchain technology space,” said Commissioner Mersinger. (Pictured from L-R: Professor Carol Goforth, Commissioner Goldsmith Romero, Senator Boozman, Commissioner Mersinger and Kathryn Gadberry Carlisle, senior managing director for the Blockchain Center of Excellence.) The Blockchain Center of Excellence was established in May of 2018 within the Department of Information Systems in the Sam M. Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas. Its mission is to make the Sam M. Walton College of Business a premier academic leader in research and education of blockchain-enabled technologies and digital ecosystems.“The Blockchain Center of Excellence and the University of Arkansas School of Law are thrilled to witness Senator Boozman’s work and leadership in the crypto space. It is a daunting task to balance the need for regulation while simultaneously encouraging technological innovation, and the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act of 2022 could help to plug regulatory holes without stifling business development,” said Professor Carol Goforth, a member of the faculty network at the Blockchain Center and the Clayton N.

https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/improving-infrastructure-inspections-with-drones,"Arkansas businesses are realizing the benefits of using drones and implementing this advanced technology in their operations. It’s improving efficiency and safety for us all and I’m championing efforts to build on this momentum. The agricultural industry is also expanding its use of this innovative technology. I’ve seen firsthand how students at Arkansas State University are using drones to study water use in fields and weed suppression. The University of Arkansas-Monticello College of Forestry, Agriculture and Natural Resources is using a drone for forestry studies. Entergy Arkansas is strengthening the electrical grid with its three-person drone team that works to detect problems with the hundreds of miles of power lines to prevent issues that could cause outages. Drones allow the company to inspect lines at hard-to-reach locations in a fraction of the time and for a much lower cost. Since May 2021, the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ARDOT) has embraced the use of drones to augment human inspectors and spot flaws and structural issues on bridges, railways and other infrastructure projects. After the shutdown of the I-40 bridge connecting Arkansas to Tennessee last year, ARDOT increased its drone capabilities and now it boasts one of the most expansive programs in the country. Congress is recognizing the unique opportunities available with this technology and supporting this new approach to empower more communities to use this innovative tool to improve safety and save taxpayer dollars. I recently helped introduce the Drone Infrastructure Inspection Grant (DIIG) Act. This bipartisan legislation supports community investments in American-made drones and the next generation workforce to operate these tools. This legislation will help local governments save money. According to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, it costs $4,600 to conduct a manual inspection on each bridge. In comparison, using a drone drastically cuts down on the cost and saves more than $3,000 per bridge. The implementation of drone inspections for bridges would save roughly $783 million nationwide.In addition to saving money, we know using a drone also saves time. While it takes about eight hours to conduct a manual bridge inspection, a drone inspection on the same infrastructure takes about one hour. It’s no surprise this legislation is gaining backing from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, industry leaders and local governments across the country. This is a positive step forward in creating a better inspection process and training drone pilots.  As we continue to work on issues facing our country, I’m committed to giving our state and local governments the resources they need to maintain safe and reliable roads, bridges, dams and other critical infrastructure.  In Arkansas, we’re investing in modernizing our capabilities and developing a workforce to operate these cutting-edge tools. In recent days, the Arkansas and Oklahoma Governors launched a partnership to leverage the region as the national hub for advanced mobility which includes drones and the development of a workforce to pilot them.Using this advanced technology will help ensure our infrastructure, electrical grid and agricultural industry remain strong.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/improving-infrastructure-inspections-with-drones"

As the lead Republican on the Senate agriculture committee, I want to ensure the next farm bill has the input of Arkansas’s growers, private forestland owners, nutrition professionals and rural communities. I look forward to visiting with our producers on this tour, finding out what is working and what needs to be fixed, and sharing their experiences when I return to Washington to strengthen and support food and fiber production in the Natural State,” said Boozman.Boozman’s Ag Tour will include meetings with ranchers, farmers and other agricultural stakeholders as he visits farms, production facilities and research operations. The tour stops in Washington, Franklin, Johnson, Pope, Yell, Faulkner, White, Lonoke, Prairie, Phillips, Arkansas, Lincoln, Chicot, Ashley, Union and Columbia counties. Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/boozman-kicks-off-annual-arkansas-agriculture-tour-monday"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/boozman-launches-tour-spotlighting-impact-of-inflation-high-energy-prices-on-arkansans,"WASHINGTON––As near record-high inflation and surging gas prices squeeze companies and families’ budgets nationwide, U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) is embarking on a regional tour to hear directly from community leaders, business owners, industry representatives and local Arkansans about the challenges they’re experiencing in the current economic climate.The senator, who has opposed policies that are exacerbating the inflation crisis such as the president’s tax-and-spending spree in addition to advocating for a return to increased domestic oil and gas production as well as an all-the-above energy strategy, will make stops around Northwest Arkansas and the River Valley beginning Tuesday. “Arkansans are constantly sharing how skyrocketing prices at the gas pump, grocery store and elsewhere are hitting their pocketbooks and forcing them to choose between buying necessities, filling up vehicles with gas and paying bills,” Boozman said. “It’s taking a tremendous toll and we’ve got to provide some relief quickly instead of pouring more fuel on the fire by pushing out more massive federal spending and refusing to unleash American energy. I will be championing that message and taking the feedback I receive about what hardworking people are facing back to Washington.” Earlier this year, Boozman held a series of meetings with Chamber of Commerce officials in several Natural State communities to discuss the effects of inflation, supply chain breakdowns and labor shortages on local economies. The senator’s agenda on this tour includes stops in Harrison, Alma, Van Buren, Fort Smith, Greenwood, Bethel Heights, Springdale, Bentonville and Rogers.To follow along as Arkansans tell Senator Boozman about how the Biden administration’s policies are harming them, search the hashtag #BustingMyBudget on social media.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/boozman-launches-tour-spotlighting-impact-of-inflation-high-energy-prices-on-arkansans"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/arkansas-youth-serving-the-natural-state,"As teachers dust off desks, parents buy new school supplies and students prepare to head back to the classroom, the signs that a new school year is upon us are unmistakable. Yet I can attest that some young Arkansans were still learning over the summer break, developing new skills and gaining vital experience to help shape their future through congressional internships.We have a responsibility to provide our youth with the resources for a solid foundation to be the next generation of leaders. That extends beyond the classroom.As the U.S. Capitol resumes normal operations, we were able to welcome more Arkansas interns back to Washington for our summer congressional internship program. Students from Magnolia to Fayetteville came to Congress and got first-hand experience with serving Arkansans as well as a front row seat to the legislative process. Our country has always relied on dedicated citizens to perform essential tasks and help administer services. Instilling a passion for public service in America’s youth is something I’m proud to advocate. This is one of the many reasons I’ve launched initiatives like the Congressional Youth Cabinet and continue to promote interning in the Senate.  Constituent service is one of my most important duties as an elected official. Interns provide vital support in answering phones and processing correspondence. The hands-on approach my office strives for would not be possible without the hard work of diligent interns. Beyond day-to-day operations, they serve as stewards to visiting Arkansans, especially in giving tours of the Capitol –– a special opportunity sightseers and interns alike often report is a highlight of their time in the nation’s capital.My staff and I aim to provide interns with an experience that will last a lifetime. One of the many ways we achieve this is through our speaker series. Our state often feels like one big community, so it’s only natural to welcome Arkansas natives working in Washington to share their professional experiences with interns during informative question and answer sessions. This opportunity creates connections interns can leverage to achieve personal and career growth while also leaving a lasting, positive impression of public service and the impact The Natural State has on Capitol Hill.  Our hope is that the opportunities we provide help interns learn and flourish regardless of their professional goals. These young men and women have a wide range of interests and aspirations from engineering to economics to government and beyond. Regardless of their career paths, congressional interns can find something D.C. has to offer them, all while helping Arkansans. I encourage any young person interested in public service to consider applying for an internship. Some interns find their passion for policy and civic engagement while they are here. Many now work in government at all levels or take their interest for giving back to other important roles elsewhere. I was fortunate to have had very special and promising students working alongside my staff this summer serving the public. I wish all of our interns the best in school and beyond, knowing their time spent representing our state will help them along the way.  Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/arkansas-youth-serving-the-natural-state"

Despite these hardships, Jaim has led Big Cuppa to expand and serve the community. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. I will continue to advocate for policies that encourage investment and support certainty and predictability for Jaim and other small business owners,” Boozman said.Big Cuppa opened in 2017 and has two locations in addition to its own roastery.

https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/boozman-backed-toxic-exposure-legislation-signed-into-law,"WASHINGTON– President Joe Biden signed landmark legislation championed by U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) to deliver all eras of toxic-exposed veterans their earned Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care and benefits into law.“Providing generations of men and women who served in uniform the benefits they deserve honors the promise our nation made for their service and sacrifice. This is a long overdue day for veterans and their families living with illnesses as a result of toxic exposure who will now be able to get the care they earned,” Boozman said. The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022 includes a Boozman-authored provision to expand benefits to Vietnam War-era veterans exposed to Agent Orange during their service in Thailand after Arkansas veteran Bill Rhodes shared his benefits were denied because the VA didn’t allow him to prove toxic exposure based on his service location.Rhodes has been a relentless advocate for making this legislative update and helping veterans who face similar circumstances. He attended the signing ceremony at the White House Wednesday. “This is an important bill for veterans. I did my own research after being denied VA benefits and raised the issue with Senator Boozman who fought to right this wrong. This goes to show that one person can make a difference. I appreciate the senator’s leadership and guidance for getting the PACT Act across the finish line,” Rhodes said. This is the latest successful push by Boozman to ensure toxic-exposed veterans get the benefits they earned.In June, President Biden signed into law the Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas SERVICE Act, legislation authored by the senator requiring the VA to conduct mammograms for all women who served in areas associated with burn pits and other toxic exposures regardless of age, symptoms or family history.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/boozman-backed-toxic-exposure-legislation-signed-into-law"

The bill, originally introduced by Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), clarifies the information required on post-9/11 GI Bill benefit transfer forms. “Our men and women in uniform should not be prevented from helping their spouses or children access the benefits they have earned due to a technicality,” Boozman said. “I’m pleased the Senate took action to make this right and I encourage the House to follow our lead so the president can sign this correction into law to show our support to America’s servicemembers, veterans and their families.”“As the son of a veteran and a grateful American, I want to ensure that our veterans and their families are well-taken care of, not the victims of bureaucratic red tape,” said Tuberville. “This bill is another targeted, meaningful change that makes it easier for our veterans and their families to receive the benefits they so rightly deserve. I look forward to seeing this bill pass the House and sent to President Biden’s desk soon.”Currently, neither the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) nor the Department of Defense (DoD) has the flexibility to amend the information on the transfer form in the event the servicemember makes an error and subsequently dies before the dependent accesses the benefit. This legislation fixes this technicality and ensures the servicemember’s dependents can access rightfully earned benefits..There are multiple examples of servicemembers misreading the information requested in the GI Bill benefit transfer forms, resulting in eligible dependents being barred from education benefits. Since the “end date” field is the cause of many incorrectly completed transfer forms, the bill would remove it to prevent further issues. Specifically, it allows a servicemember to transfer his or her Post-9/11 GI bill benefits to a spouse or child so long as the servicemember has done the following:Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/boozman-tuberville-bill-streamlining-post-9-11-gi-bill-benefits-passes-senate"

https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/the-biden-administration-continues-its-reckless-tax-and-spending-spree,"While we’re experiencing a 41-year high inflation rate, the president and his allies are pursuing a plan out of touch with the priorities of the American people. In June, Arkansans spent an additional $577 as a result of inflation. This legislation fails deliver the relief Americans are demanding.Far-fetched claims about the Biden plan reducing inflation were almost immediately debunked by the Penn Wharton Budget Model. Instead, it found the tax-and-spending bill will actually increase inflation over the next two years and then have no measurable positive long-term impact.Not only does the Biden plan fail to tackle the current economic crisis, but it would also raise taxes on low- and middle-income earners. A tax increase is not just what I think would happen, but it is what an analysis by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation determined.The president is proposing job-killing tax hikes, enhanced IRS enforcement and Green New Deal policies that could worsen energy security and food security concerns while pushing us further into a recession.  After we’ve just been reminded of the importance of domestic production, the National Association of Manufacturers worries this bill could reduce our national output by $68.5 billion and result in more than 218,000 fewer workers in the economy.Its tax on American manufacturers is a backdoor attempt by the president and his party to impose a rate increase on companies and penalize workers, ultimately making them less competitive globally and encouraging job offshoring. If that’s not bad enough, this reckless plan would funnel an additional $80 billion to the IRS to hire another 87,000 agents for enforcement of noncompliance by all taxpayers regardless of income.This is extremely troublesome given the IRS’s history of targeting faith-based organizations. The Biden administration wants to arm the IRS with more authority and manpower to pay for its far-left wish list, including imposing extreme environmental policies. Further attacking American-made energy will continue to drive up the costs to heat and cool our homes and operate our vehicles. When it comes to agriculture policy, this bill sets a particularly bad precedent for farm bill programs. As the lead Republican on the Senate agriculture committee, I’m alarmed this backroom, partisan approach eliminates input from farmers, ranchers and producers. It’s their farm bill too and they must have a say on it.By extending conservation programs until 2031, well beyond the life of the next two farm bills, the tax-and-spending bill deliberately takes away our ability to change and adjust these farm programs to meet the future needs of our nation.  Arkansans are already suffering the consequences of the Biden administration’s spending spree. My bottom line is I won’t support this Biden plan and risk raising our taxes.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/the-biden-administration-continues-its-reckless-tax-and-spending-spree"

This requirement has been paused since the Families First Coronavirus Response Act was signed into law in March 2020.“These work requirements were established on a bipartisan basis. They were waived for the COVID emergency on a bipartisan basis. They should be reinstated with bipartisan support too now that COVID restrictions have largely ended,” Boozman said. “Job openings are still near a historic high, contributing to our ongoing supply chain bottleneck. It is time for these requirements to be enforced so that able-bodied adults return to the workforce.""There are more than 10.6 million job openings, 5.7 million unemployed individuals, and nearly two job openings per unemployed persons. While unemployment rates are low at 3.5 percent, the number of individuals not in the job market is over 100 million and the labor force participation rate is only 62 percent. Employers added 528 thousand jobs, but to do so wages had to grow sharply, which contributes to higher inflation.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/boozman-introduces-amendment-to-get-more-americans-back-to-work"

Our family-owned operations do a tremendous job raising catfish that consumers crave. I’m proud to join my colleagues to mark National Catfish Month and celebrate the entire industry.”“Catfish represents more than 50 percent of the United States aquaculture industry, and Mississippi is leading the charge,” Wicker said. “Farm-raised catfish is sustainable and contributes billions of dollars to our economy. Designating August as National Catfish Month gives us the opportunity to recognize the many producers who are a part of this important industry.”“It’s a point of pride that Mississippi is the No. 1 catfish producing state in the nation, and I applaud the domestic industry for its role in providing safe, affordable, farm-raised catfish to consumers across the country,” Hyde-Smith said. “Catfish is the largest farm-raised aquaculture product in the nation, and the success of its production in the U.S. is because of southern states like Alabama. Our catfish farmers and workers play a major role in providing jobs and enhancing the local economy,” Shelby said. “National Catfish Month is a great opportunity to recognize the significance of this industry.”“A fried catfish po’ boy, dressed, with ketchup, my mouth waters to think of it. Thanks to everyone who makes it possible for the rest of us to enjoy great catfish dinners. We recognize National Catfish Month,” Cassidy said.“The catfish industry contributes billions of dollars to our economy and employs thousands of people across the country,” Tillis said. “North Carolina is one of a few states home to farm raised catfish which is why I am proud to work with my colleagues to recognize August as National Catfish Month to honor all the workers that provide catfish for people across our country and the world.”“The aquaculture industry greatly benefits Texas and the nation, with domestic catfish growers alone contributing well over $350 million to the U.S. economy. Texas is one of four states whose industry accounts for over 97 percent of total U.S. sales. I am proud to join my colleagues in resolving to designate August as National Catfish Month to acknowledge the contributions of these producers,” Cruz said.The full text of the resolution can be found here or below: Whereas the Catfish Institute recognizes August to be National Catfish Month; Whereas the States of Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas recognize August to be National Catfish Month;Whereas the States of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Tennessee embody the Channel Catfish as their State Fish; Whereas the farm-raised catfish industry in the United States employs nearly 10,000 people and contributes more than $4,000,000,000 to the economy of the United States;Whereas the United States has 67,640 surface water acres used for catfish production in 2022, and catfish growers in the United States had $421,161,000 in sales during 2021;Whereas the average catfish farmer produces 5,000 pounds of catfish per acre;Whereas 99 percent of all United States farm-raised catfish are grown in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, and Texas;Whereas catfish is the largest farm-raised seafood product, by weight, in the United States, representing more than 50 percent of the United States aquaculture industry;Whereas United States farm-raised catfish are consistently high quality and, unlike ocean-caught fish, are available all year long;Whereas United States farm-raised catfish are a sustainable and environmentally friendly seafood product;Whereas catfish is a lean fish and an excellent source of protein; andWhereas catfish is a versatile fish in cuisine of the United States, with a myriad of regional and national recipes to be enjoyed by all people of the United States: Now, therefore, be itResolved, That the Senate—(1) designates August 2022 as ‘‘National Catfish Month’’;(2) recognizes the contributions of all workers, past and present, that produce, process, and provide catfish for the people of the United States; and(3) recognizes that purchasing United States farm-raised catfish supports farmers, jobs, and the economy of the United States.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/senators-praise-resolution-designating-august-as-national-catfish-month"

This bipartisan bill would also authorize $100 million in grants for workforce training and education to prepare the next generation of workers in this field. “Using advanced technology for infrastructure safety inspections will improve and strengthen our bridges and railways,” said Boozman. “In Arkansas, we’ve invested in modernizing our capabilities, including utilizing drones and other emerging technologies. The DIIG Act continues to build on this momentum while also helping develop the workforce to operate these cutting-edge tools.”“As we make historic investments in fixing and updating our nation’s infrastructure, we can rely on the latest technology to identify physical vulnerabilities that need to be fixed,” said Rosen. “This bipartisan legislation will help local governments invest in drones and skilled workers to ensure America’s existing infrastructure remains safe.”  “This bill promotes the use of domestic drone technology to inspect and maintain our nation’s vital infrastructure,” said Blumenthal. “Through important grant programs, our workforce will be given the tools and skilled training necessary to keep our bridges, dams, and highways across the country safe. I’m proud to join this legislation as we build on the groundbreaking investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.”  Drones have been used to help inspect infrastructure projects and prevent catastrophes. Last year, drone footage helped reveal a severe crack in the I-40 bridge connecting Arkansas and Tennessee, leading to the bridge being shut down. This legislation would also enable research universities to access grants for programs geared toward training the next generation of workers who operate drones.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/boozman-introduces-bipartisan-legislation-to-increase-use-of-drones-to-inspect-and-maintain-infrastructure-projects"

If they go down this road, we very well might be looking at reconciliation as the only way future farm bills get written. Whoever holds the pen wields the fate for vital programs that farmers, ranchers and foresters depend on. Not to mention nutrition programs that help low-income families and policies that allow conservationists to achieve our shared goals,” Boozman said during a speech on the Senate floor. The top Republican on the Senate agriculture committee continued to take aim for how the process has excluded vital input from important stakeholders and shatters the longstanding traditions of bipartisanship that has led to past successes with previous farm bills. “We haven’t had a single hearing on this bill, yet its agriculture title spends forty billion dollars—a huge amount allocated with no input from stakeholders, Republicans and, quite frankly, most Democrats,” Boozman said. “We have never written a farm bill in this manner. It is antithetical to how the Senate—and the ag committee in particular—should operate. We have a storied history of working together at the agriculture committee. Our stakeholders value the fact that we approach the issues they face together, rather than as Republicans and Democrats. They appreciate that their voices are heard. Unfortunately, with this decision, the Majority has changed that dynamic.”

https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/boozman-stabenow-booker-and-thune-introduce-legislation-to-regulate-digital-commodities,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, and John Boozman (R-AR), Ranking Member, along with Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and John Thune (R-SD) today introduced the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act of 2022 to give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission new tools and authorities to regulate digital commodities. This mandatory framework will safeguard customers and our markets.“Digital assets and blockchain technology have already, and will continue, to change the way global markets function. Yet, this fast-growing industry is currently governed largely by a patchwork of regulations at the state level. That simply is not an effective way to protect consumers from fraud. Furthermore, relying solely on state regulation does not ensure that rules and regulations work for all stakeholders. Our bill will empower the CFTC with exclusive jurisdiction over the digital commodities spot market, which will lead to more safeguards for consumers, market integrity and innovation in the digital commodities space,” Senator Boozman said. “One in five Americans have used or traded digital assets—but these markets lack the transparency and accountability that they expect from our financial system. Too often, this puts Americans’ hard-earned money at risk,” said Senator Stabenow. “That’s why we are closing regulatory gaps and requiring that these markets operate under straightforward rules that protect customers and keep our financial system safe.”“As the number of Americans engaging with digital assets continues to grow, it is critical that we clarify and strengthen the regulation of our financial system,” said Senator Booker. “This bipartisan legislation will enhance oversight over digital commodities, taking an important first step to ensure that the digital marketplace operates fairly with commonsense rules in place and protects consumers entering this market.”“Technology continues to transform digital commodities, and it’s critical that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has the proper tools to regulate this growing market, ” said Senator Thune. “This legislation would provide the CFTC with the necessary visibility into the marketplace to respond to emerging risks and protect consumers, while also providing regulatory certainty to digital commodity platforms.”An overview of the legislation can be found here.A section by section description of the legislation can be found here.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/boozman-stabenow-booker-and-thune-introduce-legislation-to-regulate-digital-commodities"

For too long, veterans living with illnesses as a result of their service have been denied the care they deserve. This comprehensive legislation passed by Congress ensures toxic-exposed veterans who need help now can get it. I urge the president to quickly sign it into law,” Boozman, a senior member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, said.The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022 will:           o   Includes Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Guam, American Samoa, and Johnston Atoll as locations for Agent Orange exposure;           o   VA claims processing;           o   VA’s workforce; and           o   VA health care facilities.Boozman has been a relentless advocate for this legislation at every step of the process.  He authored a provision to expand benefits to Vietnam War-era veterans who served on military bases in Thailand after learning from an Arkansas veteran who developed illnesses related to Agent Orange exposure the VA doesn’t recognize the impact of herbicides inside base perimeters. He delivered remarks on the Senate floor in June urging his colleagues to support this historic legislation.This is the latest successful push by the senator to ensure toxic-exposed veterans get the benefits they earned.In June, President Biden signed into law the Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas SERVICE Act, legislation authored by the senator requiring the VA to conduct mammograms for all women who served in areas associated with burn pits and other toxic exposures regardless of age, symptoms or family history.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/breaking-senate-advances-boozman-backed-legislation-to-expand-health-care-for-post-9-11-toxic-exposed-veterans"

https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/the-best-ideas-come-from-the-ground-up,"Recently, the American Farm Bureau Federation recognized me with the Golden Plow, the highest honor it awards sitting members of Congress.The success I’ve had in shaping ag policy is thanks, in large part, to the Farm Bureau – and especially its Arkansas branch – serving as a vital resource in supporting Natural State farmers, ranchers and foresters. For over 100 years, the Farm Bureau has been on the forefront of efforts to boost rural America and strengthen the lives of those who call it home.I strongly believe the best ideas come from the ground up, not the other way around, which is why the Farm Bureau’s voice carries so much weight in my book. We have stood side by side on numerous battles over the years and those outcomes would have been much different had the Farm Bureau not been there. The Farm Bureau’s guidance will be heavily relied upon as we begin to develop the next farm bill, the nation’s five-year-plan for agriculture, conservation, food, forestry and rural development policy.Arkansas Farm Bureau has made a notable impact on the farm bill drafting process already, as members offered testimony at the Senate agriculture committee’s recent field hearing in Jonesboro.Our witnesses shared insights and concerns about our commodity programs, safety nets, risk management, conservation programs, rural development and more—covering nearly the whole gambit of issues that the farm bill touches. The hearing was invaluable in that it provided a look into the effectiveness of, and opportunities to improve, farm bill programs for our state’s ag industry. There is a long list of challenges we face as we begin writing the next farm policy framework. Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine has created a global food shortage. Inflation is historically high and Americans do not feel positive about the economy. Our producers are dealing with high input costs, including record high fertilizer prices and skyrocketing energy bills. They are also dealing with drought, a labor shortage and supply chain bottlenecks. Consumers are facing the highest food inflation rate since the Carter administration.  I’ve had the opportunity to work on several farm bills over the years. There is one consistent key to success—we have to all work together. The good news is the Senate agriculture committee has a long and storied history of doing just that.But there is one threat that continues to hang over the farm bill process: the Democrats’ reckless tax and spending legislation. Their latest proposal sets aside the bipartisan farm bill process and charges forward in designating funding for specific farm bill programs in a partisan way which will make it much more difficult to write farm bills in the future. Using this partisan process to increase farm bill spending sets a bad precedent and undermines our own work. If we're not careful, farm bills will only be written this manner moving forward. Not only does this process cut out the minority party, but it also means policy is written without input from the stakeholders. Having input from those directly impacted by the policy is vital to ensuring the final product will work when it is implemented. Engaging farmers, ranchers and producers should happen as we formulate legislation, not as an afterthought. I am committed to always seeking out and incorporating the counsel of the Farm Bureau, and other agricultural stakeholder groups, as we craft policy in the Senate.     Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/the-best-ideas-come-from-the-ground-up"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/boozman-brown-introduce-bill-to-expedite-disbursement-of-veterans-life-insurance-benefits,"WASHINGTON––U.S. Senators John Boozman (R-AR) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) introduced the Faster Payments to Veterans’ Survivors Act of 2022 which will ensure veterans’ surviving family members or beneficiaries will receive the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits their loved ones earned through their service to our country in a timely fashion. This legislation will not only assist with paying these beneficiaries, but also will help identify and locate those who are owed these undisbursed funds.“Veterans need to know their loved ones will be taken care of when they are gone, and this legislation is an important step to supporting their needs. Improving the VA’s process for administering life insurance will ensure surviving family members receive these benefits in a timely manner. I’m proud to advocate for veterans and fulfill our promise to them,” Boozman said. “Our veterans and their families have sacrificed so much to serve our country. They shouldn’t have to wait to receive their earned benefits after a loved one passes away,” said Brown. “This legislation will give VA the tools it needs to speed up a slow and outdated process, and ease the uncertainty for families awaiting benefits during a difficult time.” When a veteran passes away, the surviving spouse or child is often owed certain benefits, such as life insurance proceeds. Unfortunately, the VA often struggles to identify, locate and pay these families or beneficiaries in a timely fashion. As of September 2020, approximately 15,000 individuals remain undisbursed with more than $155 million in life insurance benefits owed to veteran families. By the VA’s own account that is approximately $10,500 per family. The Faster Payments to Veterans’ Survivors Act of 2022 would improve the VA’s management of undisbursed funds by:The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), American Legion, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA), Military Officers Association of America (MOAA), Modern Military Association of America (MMAA) and Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) support the legislation. Companion legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Reps. Chris Pappas (D-NH-1) and Nancy Mace (R-SC-1) and has a total of 30 cosponsors.For full text of the bill, click here.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/boozman-brown-introduce-bill-to-expedite-disbursement-of-veterans-life-insurance-benefits"

These bills are the result of the efforts by stakeholders and folks who identified an issue and how they can be solved. Recycling helps reduce waste while also creating jobs and driving innovation. I applaud Senate passage of these initiatives and urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to follow the Senate’s lead and pass these bipartisan bills,” Boozman said.  The Recycling and Composting Accountability Act would require the EPA to collect and make publicly available data on recycling and composting rates across the country. The Recycling Infrastructure and Accessibility Act would establish a pilot rural recycling program at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).Boozman joined Senate Recycling Caucus co-chair and chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW) Tom Carper (D-DE) and ranking member Shelly Moore Capito (R-WV) to introduce and advance the two pieces of legislation. In February, Boozman participated in a Senate EPW hearing to gain input from recycling industry leaders on the challenges confronting our nation’s recycling infrastructure. Members used that input to improve these legislative initiatives.

The retail industry is extremely important to Arkansas’s economy. I am committed to encouraging development and pro-growth policies that help our retailers and their hardworking employees flourish,” Boozman said.“Small and local businesses are the cornerstone for job growth and opportunity in communities across the country,” NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said. “It is an honor to recognize Senator Boozman and the 2022 ‘Heroes of Main Street’ for their commitment to supporting policies and programs that ensure the economic health and viability of the retail industry.” The National Retail Federation is the world’s largest retail trade association advocating for the people, brands, policies and ideas that help retail thrive. The overwhelming majority of retailers are small businesses, with more than 98 percent of all retail companies employing fewer than 50 people.  The Hero of Main Street award was created by NRF in 2013, and eligibility is based on key votes, bill sponsorship and advocacy to advance retailers’ priorities. Recipients have supported policies that recognize the contributions of the retail industry, and have worked to encourage a vibrant, sustained and healthy retail sector. Senator Boozman was honored by the National Retail Federation.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/boozman-named-hero-of-main-street-by-national-retail-federation"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/boozman-senators-introduce-global-food-security-legislation,"WASHINGTON––U.S. Senators John Boozman (R-AR), Bob Casey (D-PA), Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Ranking Member Jim Risch (R-ID) and Chris Coons (D-DE) introduced the Global Food Security Act, which reauthorizes Feed the Future – the U.S. government’s global hunger and food security initiative. The legislation, which would extend the program through 2028, comes as the world is grappling with an international food crisis, in part because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Together, Ukraine and Russia export nearly a third of the world’s wheat and barley. “The high cost of food has complicated humanitarian efforts to help those suffering from food insecurity at a time when the world is seeing those most in need being the most severely impacted. Food insecurity knows no boundaries but is preventable, and the United States is in a position to help. I’m pleased to support legislation reauthorizing the Feed the Future Initiative so we can deploy tools and education to combat hunger and malnutrition while promoting global stability,” Boozman said “Putin’s war in Ukraine exacerbated a global food crisis, and families around the globe are going to bed without enough to eat,” said Casey. “Food security leads to global stability and the United States has a moral obligation to eradicate global hunger. The Feed the Future Initiative is reaching millions of people around the world and I’m proud to introduce this bill with Senator Risch to continue this American success story.”“No nation on Earth has done more to reduce global hunger and stimulate agriculture-led economic growth than the United States. The ingenuity of American farmers has transformed global agriculture, reduced poverty, and ultimately saved a billion lives. I’m proud to support this work, including the Feed the Future public-private partnership with the University of Idaho on blight resistant potatoes,” said Risch. “As world leaders like Putin use food as a weapon, it’s more important than ever to help people combat food insecurity and grow their way out of poverty. The Global Food Security Act Reauthorization that I’ve introduced with Senator Casey today provides a roadmap to deliver emergency assistance when and where it’s needed most, then help people transition away from dependence to self-reliance.” “Russia’s brutal and unjustified invasion of the ‘breadbasket of Europe’ has crippled food supplies worldwide, putting tens of millions of people at risk of starvation and causing food prices to soar here at home,” said Coons. “As Chairman of the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, I’m proud to have helped secure billions of dollars for food aid in our most recent emergency funding package, but there’s far more to do. Reauthorizing the Feed the Future Initiative is a critical step that will further address food insecurity and ensure that the United States continues to lead the way in preventing famine.”  The Global Food Security Act was passed into law in 2016 and reauthorized in 2018 for five years.

John Boozman, R-Ark., of Rogers received the Golden Plow award from American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) President Zippy Duvall during a luncheon at the Arkansas Farm Bureau’s mid-summer Officers & Leaders conference at the Rogers Convention Center.Boozman is the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee. He is in his second term as senator after five terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. The senator is a 10-time Friend of Farm Bureau, which is awarded to members of Congress who have supported Farm Bureau’s policy positions.“For two decades, Senator Boozman has demonstrated his commitment to agriculture and farmers across the country. His unwavering support for hardworking farm families has earned him Friend of Farm Bureau award for 10 consecutive sessions, so presenting him with the Golden Plow award seems only natural,” Duvall said. “Senator Boozman knows the key to good policy is consensus. He’s willing to work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to meet the needs of farmers and ranchers while ensuring America’s families continue to enjoy a stable food supply.”Arkansas Farm Bureau Rich Hillman, a rice farmer from Carlisle, nominated Boozman for the award.“Senator John Boozman is a champion for agriculture,” Hillman said. “Our nation’s farmers and ranchers could not be better served than we are with John Boozman leading agriculture policy efforts in the U.S. Senate.

https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/988-mental-health-hotline-makes-connecting-to-help-easier,"There is a new way to get help for folks experiencing a mental health or substance use crisis and it’s as easy as dialing 988. In July, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline launched, ushering in a link to crisis centers nationwide through a toll-free number connecting callers to trained counselors for free and confidential care. This comes as a result of years of hard work by mental health advocates and legislators to expand access to mental health care through this critical service. After studying the feasibility of this initiative, with my support, Congress passed the bipartisan National Suicide Hotline Designation Act in 2020 to establish a quick and convenient way to get individuals the help they need so we can save lives. The stress of the past couple of years only exacerbated the mental health crisis that was already gripping our nation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports suicide was the 12th leading cause of death for all ages in the United States in 2020. Arkansas ranked 11th in the nation for deaths by suicide that same year. Investments in mental health care are more important than ever. Expanding access to critical care is essential to getting individuals the help they need. The National Alliance on Mental Illness estimates health professionals answering these calls can resolve more than 80-90 percent of the challenges over the phone.The new nationwide emergency number continues our commitment to improving services designed to confront the challenges of mental illness and deploying support tools for those at risk of suicide.Men and women who are serving or have served in their nation’s uniform suffer a disproportionately higher rate of suicide compared to the general population. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) estimates more than 20 veterans die by suicide every day. While we’ve increased federal funding to address this national crisis, there has been little to no improvement in reducing that number. That’s why we’ve updated the VA’s policies to support veteran-serving non-profits and other community networks that have proven effective in their outreach and better measure the effectiveness of existing programs.  Congress approved my legislation, the IMPROVE Well-being for Veterans Act, two years ago to create a VA grant program to leverage the positive outcomes of these organizations and build on their successes. The VA received applications for the inaugural funding and is currently in the process of reviewing the submissions and awarding millions of dollars in grants to support this effort. Implementing a comprehensive strategy to provide mental health care and treatment is essential. The good news is there is support from every level of government. We’ve taken critical steps, but we know this is just the beginning. The 988 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline will save lives and I am committed to working to further improve access to mental health care for Arkansans. Establishing the 988 number that is easy to remember and access during a mental health crisis is a simple way we can save more lives. Preventing suicide and reaching those struggling with their mental health is all about helping them understand they are not alone and assistance is available. I look forward to the good this new lifeline will do for Arkansans who are at risk and need support.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/988-mental-health-hotline-makes-connecting-to-help-easier"

Photo courtesy of Arkansas Farm Bureau)Boozman, a 10-time Friend of Farm Bureau award recipient, has a long history of advancing U.S. and Arkansas agriculture interests and standing up for family farmers, ranchers and foresters. His efforts that helped earn this honor include:Protecting the Future of Family Farming: In his role as lead Republican on the agriculture committee, Boozman was among the most vocal opponents of the Biden administration’s proposed tax code changes that would have had a devastating impact on rural America. Boozman and his colleagues were successful in forcing the White House to abandon the idea of paying for its “Build Back Better” plan on the backs of our family farmers, ranchers and foresters with proposed changes to capital gains, stepped-up basis and like-kind exchanges.Ensuring New Programs Put Farmers First: Boozman’s leadership was key to ensuring the Growing Climate Solutions Act secured overwhelming support in the Senate, passing by a 92-8 margin. He worked across the aisle with Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Senator Mike Braun (R-IN) to make the programs created by the bill more farmer-friendly, farmer-focused and, most importantly, voluntary.Securing Vital Emergency Relief for Producers: As a member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, Boozman played a key role in ensuring that the second round of relief from the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program would be available to contract growers of livestock and poultry who suffered revenue losses and were originally omitted when the program was created. American Farm Bureau said inclusion of a provision in the bipartisan Omnibus Appropriations bill that Boozman pushed for “resulted in almost $1 billion in federal assistance to support poultry growers who were seeing reduced flock placement because of supply chain challenges that resulted during the COVID-19 pandemic.”Working Across the Aisle to Put Agriculture First: Boozman was among a select number of members who crafted the final version of the 2018 Farm Bill legislation, forging a compromise between the competing versions passed by the Senate and House of Representatives. The final bill received more votes on the Senate floor than any previous farm bill. It contained several provisions Boozman authored, including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) reform, regulatory reform and many other priorities for Arkansas agriculture.Creating Market Access for Our Producers: Throughout his tenure in Congress, Boozman has made it a priority to expand new market opportunities for Arkansas producers to compete in and ensure existing trade partners, like Iraq, keep their commitments to purchase Arkansas-grown commodities.Advocating for Nutrition and Hunger Relief Programs: Boozman is a co-chair of the Senate Hunger Caucus and has been a leader in the effort to improve USDA’s summer meal programs. The proposed reforms for which he has advocated since his introduction of the Hunger-Free Summer for Kids Act of 2015 were the basis for successful pandemic hunger relief programs.

https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/boozman-heinrich-introduce-legislation-eliminating-penalty-to-travel-for-va-care,"WASHINGTON–– U.S. Senators John Boozman (R-AR) and Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Ranking Member and Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee responsible for Department of Veterans Affairs funding, introduced legislation to repeal the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) copayment requirement for veterans traveling to medical appointments.“Veterans in rural areas with limited access to specialty care and VA facilities are disproportionately impacted by this policy. We must correct this inequity,” Boozman said. “I appreciate the guidance of Arkansas veterans who have shared with me their concerns about this unnecessary cost to receiving the health care they earned. I urge the Senate to remove this penalty for veterans.”“Veterans who live in rural areas shouldn’t be tasked with paying a travel deductible when heading to their medical appointments,” said Heinrich. “That’s why I’m proud to join Senator Boozman in this bipartisan effort to eliminate this financial hurdle and make it easier for all veterans to access the health care benefits and services that they have earned. The Boozman-Heinrich bill eliminates the cost veterans pay when seeking VA-approved medical care. Under the VA’s Travel Beneficiary Program, eligible veterans and caregivers are reimbursed for mileage and other travel expenses incurred while traveling to and from their homes to VA-approved health appointments. Deductibles are automatically withheld from the claim prior to disbursement. In Fiscal Year 2021 veterans paid the VA over $29 million to travel for approved health care.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/boozman-heinrich-introduce-legislation-eliminating-penalty-to-travel-for-va-care"

Considering the significance of these rules and initiatives, I request any information about any of USDA’s efforts to review current regulations, proposed rules, and other agency actions that may be affected by this recent Supreme Court decision.”In December 2021, Boozman signed onto an amicus curiae brief filed at the U.S. Supreme Court in support of the petitioners in West Virginia v EPA.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/after-scotus-rejects-epa-overreach-boozman-calls-for-review-of-usda-regulatory-actions"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/breaking-ground-to-honor-veterans,"It’s been more than 30 years since the United States and coalition forces helped liberate Kuwait from the Iraqi invasion. Now, the men and women who served in uniform during Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield will soon be recognized with a national memorial honoring their selfless service and sacrifice.Hundreds of people recently gathered in Washington, D.C. to celebrate the groundbreaking for the tribute.  The site has national significance. In the shadows of the Lincoln Memorial, it appropriately recognizes the sacrifice of those called to serve in our nation’s uniform. The stretch of ground holds a special place in the hearts of Americans. It’s where we honor influential leaders and recognize the leaders who shaped the history of our nation and heroes who defended our ideals. It’s where America gathers to celebrate Independence Day, commemorate the ingenuity that has made our country great and exercise our freedoms. When people around the world think of our nation’s capital, they picture the landmarks spread across the backdrop of the National Mall and associate them with what the United States represents. These memorials and monuments stand as shining beacons of hope and the promise of the American dream. So it’s only fitting for the home of the National Desert Storm and Desert Shield War Memorial to be found there as well.    I championed this bipartisan effort with my friend from Indiana, former Senator Joe Donnelly.In 2013, we introduced legislation to authorize a national memorial to honor the hundreds of thousands of men and women who fought to defend freedom in the Gulf War including those who made the ultimate sacrifice.It’s been more than three decades since the war ended. The time has come to ensure we have a dedicated landmark honoring the valor and dedication of our servicemembers and their loved ones. We want these men and women to be able to have a dedicated place of honor to reflect on their mission and those they served alongside. I’m proud to have played a small role in helping make the memorial a reality, but the hard work was done by those whose service and sacrifice will be memorialized there for generations to come. It will stand as a symbol of reverence to and respect for the veterans and their families, and help teach future generations about this important moment in our nation’s tradition of fighting tyranny.  It’s critical we reflect on this episode and those who willingly set out to answer this call. I was honored to join those who have spent years advocating for this memorial, veterans and their families to mark the occasion and acknowledge the incredible support worldwide to recognize those who served in this mission. We can be proud of the efforts of Arkansans Jeff Kurczek and Brenten Byrd who have helped pave the wave for this monument as National Desert Storm War Memorial board members.As long as men and women fight and die on behalf of the country we love and the freedoms we espouse, they must never be forgotten or have cause to question our national gratitude. I look forward to the day the site features a completed tribute to America’s Gulf War veterans. They richly deserve it, and our unending thanks, for what they did and all they represent.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/breaking-ground-to-honor-veterans"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/boozman-demands-answers-on-biden-administration-s-failed-catch-and-release-policy,"WASHINGTON––U.S. Senators John Boozman (R-AR), Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) sent a letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Acting Director Tae Johnson expressing concern over the dangers of President Biden’s continued implementation of catch and release policies in response to the border crisis. In particular, the concerns focus on how the Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program is failing to accomplish its stated goals.“Under the Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program, ICE releases apprehended illegal immigrants into the United States with some type of temporary monitoring in the hopes that they will show up for their immigration court hearing and then depart if they are ordered to do so,” the senators wrote. “In a recent report, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that ATD is failing to keep track of illegal immigrants ICE is supposedly monitoring. By ICE’s own calculations, 33 percent of the illegal immigrants unenrolled from ATD in FY2020 were unenrolled because they absconded and could not be found. GAO calculates that, overall, 9 percent of all illegal immigrants enrolled in ATD in FY2020 ultimately could not be found.”The senators continued, “While these numbers sound bad enough, we are concerned that these calculations fail to truly capture the extent to which ATD is ineffective in ensuring that illegal immigrants actually show up for their immigration court hearings. The GAO report finds that over 75% of all ATD participants were unenrolled before the conclusion of their immigration proceedings. We find it troubling that so many illegal immigrants are unenrolled before the conclusion of their immigration court proceedings, despite the fact that the goal of the ATD program is to ensure that illegal immigrants complete their immigration proceedings.”  “Instead of doing more to stop illegal immigration at our southern border, the Biden administration has instead chosen to spread its failures to more cities. Recent reporting indicates that the Department of Homeland Security is considering plans to transport illegal immigrants from the border to cities further and further within the interior,” the senators concluded.In addition to Boozman, Tillis and Grassley, Senators Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Mike Braun (R-IN), John Cornyn (R-TX) and Tom Cotton (R-AR) also signed onto the letter.Read the full letter here.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/boozman-demands-answers-on-biden-administration-s-failed-catch-and-release-policy"

U.S. Senators John Boozman, O.D. (R-AR), Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-KS), John Barrasso, M.D. (R-WY), Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) and Rand Paul M.D. (R-KY) participated in the PSA saying in part,“I come to you today, not only as a U.S. Senator, but as a medical provider concerned for the health and safety of our nation. Fentanyl is killing over 200 Americans every day. Unfortunately, many Americans who have died from an overdose didn’t even know they were taking the deadliest drug our nation has ever seen…They didn’t know that just one pill can kill…As medical providers in the Senate, we know Fentanyl is everywhere – no community is spared…Never take any drug except those personally prescribed by your physician and filled by your pharmacist.

https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/boozman-joins-sullivan-gop-colleagues-on-effort-to-overturn-biden-s-onerous-permitting-rules,"WASHINGTON––U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) joined Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) to introduce S.J. Res. 55, a joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to nullify the Biden administration’s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Implementing Regulations Revisions that will further bog down the already-onerous federal permitting process and add further delay to building vital infrastructure projects and putting hard-working Americans back to work.The recently enacted Biden administration NEPA rules undermine important provisions intended to streamline key elements of our broken federal permitting process and represent a substantial roll-back of the Trump administration’s 2020 NEPA regulations, which were the first major modernization of federal environmental reviews since 1978. In addition to Boozman and Sullivan, every Republican senator has signed on in support of the CRA. “The federal permitting process is a tremendous hurdle to getting economic development projects off the ground and completed in a timely fashion,” Boozman said. “As inflation soars, the Biden administration should be working overtime to clear away obstacles that prevent or slow growth and hinder the creation of jobs. I’m proud to join my colleagues to support this commonsense step pushing back against more government red tape.”“I want to thank all of my Republican colleagues for cosponsoring this resolution. A broad coalition in Congress last year included commonsense permitting reforms in the bipartisan infrastructure bill to ensure that projects wouldn’t be stalled by endless review and delay,” said Senator Sullivan. “Remarkably, those important provisions to cut federal red tape, supported by America’s workers, are now being killed by the Biden administration’s new NEPA regulations. The bridges and roads, pipelines and tunnels, ports and runways that American taxpayers were promised will now suffer from an increasing regulatory quagmire. It doesn’t have to be this way. When NEPA was originally enacted, the average environmental impact statement took less than a year to complete. Today, the average EIS takes four to six years to complete at a cost of several millions of dollars. My resolution will work to end this bureaucratic stagnation. Because of the provisions of the Congressional Review Act, my Senate Democratic colleagues will have to vote and make a choice: Will they capitulate to the far-left radical environmentalists, or will they stand with the American people and the hard-working men and women of this country who build the vital hard infrastructure projects we need? There won’t be any hiding from this vote. It will be very interesting to see who my Democratic colleagues stand with. I know who I stand for: the men and women who build our country.”Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/boozman-joins-sullivan-gop-colleagues-on-effort-to-overturn-biden-s-onerous-permitting-rules"

Those who knew him, and those who will hear of him, can draw inspiration from a life well lived. In 21 short years, Officer Story did more good and spread more joy than countless others blessed with many more years on this earth. May God bless and keep Officer Jeremiah Story and may God console his family and friends in this time of grief,” Cotton said.

https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/summer-road-trip-in-arkansas,"Summer always brings back memories of my family’s road trips to Petit Jean State Park and other adventures around Arkansas. Whether I was in the back seat as a kid or driving my own daughters, there was always a lot to see and do as we explored the state.I know many families in Arkansas are making tough choices about vacations this year. It’s harder to visit friends and family, enjoy some downtime on a vacation or transport school-age children to camps and other activities as rampant inflation and record-high gas prices take a bigger bite out of families’ budgets. Still, lots of folks are doing what they’ve always done – finding a way to make things work while creating as little disruption to their normal lives and routines as possible.I recently took a road trip to see how families and communities are weathering these challenging times. Each stop underscored the strength of our citizens, various challenges and opportunities they’re confronting and the common bonds we all share as proud Americans and Natural State residents.Traveling to a variety of towns and cities gives me the opportunity to receive updates on important local projects as well as understand more intimately how national issues are playing out in homes and on streets throughout our state. That’s exactly what the Senate’s In-State Work Periods are designed to do and why I aim to hit the road during them. Touring the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers hydroelectric power plant in Ozark with Congressman Bruce Westerman (AR-4) was a great way to start. Many Arkansans know this site at the Ozark-Jeta Taylor Lock and Dam for its excellent camping and fishing. But, in addition to its role in recreation, the hydropower generated at the Ozark Powerhouse plays a critical role in ensuring the power grid has the capability to support demand, particularly in the summer when power usage peaks. From there we were off to the races, making stops across western and northern Arkansas. In Mulberry and Pea Ridge, I talked to stakeholders about anti-hunger efforts and policies I’ve championed to ensure students in need have access to healthy meals all year long.I also made time to speak at the National Be Pro Be Proud conference in Northwest Arkansas. Workforce development and skilled training are only becoming more important, so I’m excited by the model our state is building in this area.Next, I made my way over to the scenic and vibrant communities of Mountain Home, Fifty-Six, Mountain View and Heber Springs as part of my commitment to sitting down with local officials to discuss concerns and priorities. Joining Congressman Rick Crawford (AR-1) to address the continued closure of Blanchard Springs Caverns to the public with the U.S. Forest Service was an especially important item given the caves are one of our state’s most popular destinations. After the July Fourth holiday, I set out for the River Valley and Southwest Arkansas for more opportunities to get feedback from businesses, elected officials and community advocates. In Fort Smith, I talked agriculture policy with a poultry company and then got an update on the preparations at Ebbing Air National Guard Base for the new missions coming to the Arkansas Air National Guard’s 188th Wing, which the congressional delegation worked tirelessly to bring to fruition.Then we turned the car south on Highway 71 to events in Waldron, De Queen and Texarkana to talk economic development, transportation and health care before heading to central Arkansas to tour a local business poised to mark its 100th anniversary. We closed out the trip at a roundtable to share with Natural State veterans about recently passed initiatives I’ve championed that will improve their benefits and services.It was a busy, but productive two weeks out and about, listening to and learning from the people of our state. That’s where the solutions to problems come from and there’s no substitute for getting face-to-face for these important conversations. Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/summer-road-trip-in-arkansas"

As a parent, I understand how challenging the summer months are to keeping kids busy. Communities offer specialized programs to engage youth through public library reading programs, sports camps and Boys and Girls Clubs. For young people aiming to challenge themselves and make a difference in the lives of others, there is the Congressional Award.   The Congressional Award program is a worthwhile experience for Arkansans interested in improving themselves and their community. It serves as motivation for young citizens to get involved in public service and inspires the next generation of leaders. The Congressional Award creates a valuable opportunity for our youth to highlight their potential by setting goals and being rewarded for reaching their potential. Established by Congress in 1979, the Congressional Award recognizes the achievements of young individuals who accomplish dedicated commitments through public service. This is the highest honor presented by Congress to America’s youth. Participants in this program earn bronze, silver, and gold certificates and medals based on their achievements. Each specific award requires setting goals in four different program areas: voluntary public service, personal development, physical fitness, and expedition and exploration.Across the country, young Americans are setting ambitions goals, learning valuable skills and making a difference in their communities as they meet the requirements for the Congressional Award. From its most recent report of engagement, the Congressional Award Foundation found youth actively involved in the program have volunteered more than 970,300 hours of public service including more than 8,400 by Arkansas participants. We can be proud of the young Arkansans who are challenging themselves, improving their community and achieving their goals.This year, Etana Morse of West Fork has earned the prestigious honor of the Congressional Award Gold Medal for her completion of 400 hours of voluntary public service, 200 hours of personal development, 200 hours of physical fitness and completion of an exploration trip.Serving as a member of the Washington County 4-H Youth Development Club, and also creating a fundraiser campaign to support a non-profit organization, Etana is making a positive impact in her community while challenging herself. She is one of nine Arkansans who have earned the Congressional Award Gold Medal since 2020.Nationwide, more than 50,000 youth are setting ambitious goals and taking actions to reach them all while demonstrating that personal growth goes hand-in-hand with serving others. I’ve seen the excitement surrounding the Congressional Award and the unique opportunities it offers young people. In recent years, the Congressional Award has partnered with 4-H and other youth organizations to encourage involvement and setting challenging goals.  Earning the Congressional Award is an opportunity for youth to challenge themselves, learn new skills and better their communities. I encourage young Arkansans to explore this program to help shape their future. The Congressional Award program reminds us all our next generation promises great things for our state and our country.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/congressional-award-recognizing-tomorrow-s-leaders"

https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/boozman-leads-effort-to-improve-va-support-for-military-sexual-trauma-survivors,"WASHINGTON— U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) teamed up with Senators Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) to introduce legislation that would ensure veterans who have survived military sexual trauma (MST) have access to trained peer support specialists within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). “The VA must continue to improve its delivery of benefits and care to survivors of military sexual trauma. This legislation will update the department’s policies to create a peer support program that expands access to critical resources and meet veteran survivors’ needs as they seek out vital assistance,” Boozman, a senior member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, said.Currently, veterans who file disability claims with the VA for benefits due to the physical and mental effects of MST have no formal mental or emotional health support. This legislation will ensure veterans have trained specialists to help them navigate the complicated and often re-traumatizing process of documenting their assault in order to receive the benefits to help them heal. Sexual assault in the military is vastly underreported due to concerns regarding confidentiality, retaliation and the perception the military chain of command will be unresponsive. This makes providing evidence of MST problematic when a veteran files a claim for disability benefits based on the physical and mental impacts of their assault. This bill would require the VA to ensure every individual who files a claim relating to MST is assigned a peer support specialist during the claims process. These peer support specialists must be trained to support veterans throughout the MST claims process. Full text of the bill is available here.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/boozman-leads-effort-to-improve-va-support-for-military-sexual-trauma-survivors"

John Boozman said people who can't earn a living or feed their families will care little about international troubles such as the war in Ukraine or domestic issues such as political turmoil.""If you don't have a job and you don't have a situation where you can take care of your family and make a living wage, everything else is unimportant,"" he said.Boozman's morning audience, participants in the Be Pro Be Proud workforce development program, are focused on building a skilled workforce through job training and post secondary education to provide for better careers and lives.The organization is known for its mobile labs, customized, interactive trailers loaded with information and skills challenges. The program began in 2016 in Arkansas through a partnership between the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce and the Associated Industries of Arkansas and is currently operating through licensed efforts in Arkansas, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.The event was attended by about 60 business and workforce leaders from around the country as well as legislators, including U.S. Rep. French Hill, R-Ark. and U.S. Rep Virginia Fox of North Carolina, along with Randy Zook, president and chief executive officer of Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce.Andrew Parker, executive director of Be Pro Be Proud, said in an interview during the conference his organization's focus is to give students a clear idea of what job opportunities are out there for them and to help them pursue those opportunities as soon as possible.""If you can understand what an opportunity looks like ... and what income potential this career path can provide, and where can it lead them, they're a lot more inclined to consider it,"" he said.Boozman, speaking to the group at the Louise Thaden School in Bentonville during its two day conference, said during his travels around Arkansas he's constantly told the thing businesses need more than anything is access to a reliable source of trained and capable workers. He praised the group for reaching out to young people, meeting them where they are to tell them about job opportunities around the state and nation and to encourage and help them obtain useful and marketable skills.He said as a legislator he's willing to do all he can to help but he stressed the true solution to filling open jobs with much needed workers is organizations like Be Pro Be Proud.""Don't wait for Washington to solve the problem,"" Boozman said of the demands for a modern, skilled workforce.

https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/adg-senators-learn-of-farmers-troubles-during-jonesboro-visit,"President Joe Biden signed a bill over the weekend championed by Sen. John Boozman and others that aims to ensure students continue to have access to meals this summer as pandemic-era child nutrition assistance ends.Pandemic-related federal aid that made school meals free to all public school students regardless of family income levels ends Thursday, though children will still be able to get meals this summer.Schools nationwide are facing a 35% to 40% increase in food costs related to supply chain and inflation issues, according to a news release Monday from Boozman's office. The Keep Kids Fed Act will provide a ""temporary increase in reimbursement rates and no-cost flexibilities for the 2022-2023 school year to help return to regular school meal operations,"" the release said.The new funding will allow schools and summer meal providers to continue delivering food to children. Summer meal distribution sites offering meals to go can operate in communities that demonstrate a need and aren't limited to districts with a higher concentration of lower-income students.The funding will also provide flexibility to schools, so institutions can make substitutions for certain types of food without facing fines if they are faced with supply chain issues.The bill was introduced last week by Sens. Boozman and Dennie Stabenow, D-Mich., from the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, as well as Bobby Scott , D-Va., and Virginia Foxx, R-Mich., from the House Committee on Education and Labor.""As I visit with Arkansas school nutrition professionals, it is quite clear they need continued flexibilities to manage ongoing supply chain issues,"" Boozman said in the release. ""We all want to ensure children receive healthy and affordable meals to help them focus on their education. This bill will help schools provide those meals as they return to normal operations.""The measure passed less than a week before rules adopted during the pandemic allowing all public school students to eat school meals for free and allowing summer meal distribution sites to operate were set to expire, June 30.Families will soon apply for their children to receive free or reduced price school meals based on income levels, as it was before the pandemic. Schools in largely lower-income areas will again be able to serve school meals for free as well.Families are already strained by rising food and fuel prices and participation in USDA school meal programs has grown significantly.About 30 million children per day were getting free meals during the most recent school year, compared to 20 million before the pandemic, administrator of the USDA Food and Nutrition Service Cindy Long told The Associated Press.There were 1.3 billion meals and snacks given out at summer meal distributions nationwide in fiscal year 2020, which cost $1.4 billion; an eight-fold increase from the previous year in terms of cost and meals, the USDA said.Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement last week he was pleased Congress has taken action to support the USDA's child nutrition programs.""The deal passed by Congress will ease some of the uncertainty and provide partial relief to our schools, summer sites and child care feeding programs,"" Vilsack said. ""As I have said before, it is important to note that schools across the country will still face ongoing challenges and at USDA, we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to ensure kids get the nutritious meals they need and deserve.""Read the story in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette published on June 28, 2022.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/adg-senators-learn-of-farmers-troubles-during-jonesboro-visit"

Every five years, Congress sets out to write and pass a new farm bill, the cornerstone of our nation’s agriculture policy. It is a daunting undertaking. However, passing farm bills in this manner offers an opportunity to see what policies are working for our agricultural, nutrition and rural communities, and which ones need updates to better serve their needs. The Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, on which I serve as the lead Republican, kicked off this process earlier this year holding a field hearing in Michigan, the home state of the committee’s chair. Then it was Arkansas’s turn to shine.  From the stage at Riceland Hall of the Fowler Center at Arkansas State University in Jonesboro, 11 Arkansans shared the story of agriculture in The Natural State. Witnesses discussed commodity programs, safety nets and risk management. They talked about how to help rural communities and families, how to support wildlife habitat and conserve natural resources, why research at our universities is crucial to advancing agriculture, and ways to help those who struggle with food insecurity. The testimony they shared with the committee, and their candid responses to questions we posed, will help inform our decisions and identify the issues we will consider as we write a new farm bill. We are in an unprecedented time as we begin this undertaking. The pandemic, the war in Europe, historic and widespread inflation, and now serious concerns about a recession—it just feels different. And yet many of the same challenges that come with each farm bill, such as balancing the different needs of each region of the country, remain true this time around. I believe we have an opportunity in this farm bill to put in place the tools necessary to strengthen American agriculture for any situation we face in the future. If we do that, our farmers will continue to do what they have always done: provide the most abundant, lowest cost and safest food supply in the world. I know Arkansas’s farmers and ranchers are ready to meet the challenge.However as much as the farm bill is a safety net for those who supply our food, it’s also a safety net for rural America. For many of these communities, agriculture is all that is left.  Agriculture is Arkansas’s largest industry, adding around $21 billion to our economy every year and accounting for approximately one in every six jobs. Yet, 53 of Arkansas’s 75 counties lost population in the last census, something that is far too common in rural counties throughout the United States.  We all lose when rural America loses. To stem this loss, we must ensure our farm families and rural residents have access to affordable electricity, high speed internet and safe drinking water. Those forms of infrastructure are essential services that, with proper investment, can measurably increase quality of life.It is imperative for rural Arkansas’s future that we address these shortfalls in the next farm bill. Our rural communities depend on agriculture and agriculture depends on this critical infrastructure. If we keep that in mind, while continuing to ensure our producers have programs that offer strong support that meet the needs of all commodities, then we will have a farm bill that provides that safety net for both agriculture and rural America.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/sharing-the-story-of-natural-state-agriculture"

The Keep Kids Fed Act provides a temporary increase in reimbursement rates and no-cost flexibilities for the 2022-2023 school year to help return to regular school meal operations.Arkansas school leaders and nutrition advocates have expressed the need for a continuation of the waivers and applauded Boozman’s efforts.“Senator Boozman has a sensitive ear, and he has listened to our needs. He is truly an advocate for not only the children of Arkansas but the nation’s children as well. Senator Boozman is to be commended for leading the way to a bipartisan agreement with other ranking lawmakers. The decision he and his fellow colleagues have made will protect the future (our children) of this country. The support they are providing will enable us to continue serving healthy meals despite rising food costs and supply chain issues; this is turn will prevent hunger and ensure that they are ready and will remain ready to learn when they return to school. Senator Boozman - We thank you!” said Barbara Cole, Chair of the Public Policy and Legislative Committee of the Arkansas School Nutrition Association.“We applaud Senator Boozman’s efforts to achieve a bipartisan agreement on the summer meals waiver. He continues to demonstrate his commitment to child nutrition and has listened to those on the ground in Arkansas advocating for an extension. His efforts will help Arkansas kids get the nutrition they need,” said Kathy Webb, Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance CEO.“In March, I had the pleasure of meeting and speaking with Senator Boozman. It was great to have his full attention, to have him ask specific questions, and then later reach out to me to provide data to follow through with supporting us in feeding school meals to the students in Arkansas. I’m pleased Arkansans have a voice in creating policies providing children access to school meals,” said Stephanie Walker Hynes, Director of Child Nutrition for the Little Rock School District.

https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/adg-veterans-health-bill-advances-boozman-backed-measure-addresses-toxic-exposure,"JONESBORO -- The top-ranking members of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry heard Friday from Arkansas farmers, advocates and government workers about the challenges facing the industry, from high crop insurance rates and rising farm expenses to lower profits and shrinking acreage of crops like rice.U.S. Sen. and ranking committee member John Boozman and committee Chair Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), listened to agriculture workers' concerns as they gather information in the months leading up to a 2023 reauthorization of the federal Farm Bill.""The answers need to come from the ground up,"" Boozman said.There are 42,000 farmers and ranchers operating on 14 million acres in Arkansas. Food and agriculture production in the state supports nearly 500,000 jobs, Boozman said.""As we are, hopefully, exiting a worldwide pandemic, we have to be very sensible about what happened to our food chain, what we all encountered and worried about when we saw empty shelves in our grocery stores,"" Arkansas Farm Bureau President Rich Hillman said at the hearing.""We learned that our food chain that has served us all well for decades, wasn't as strong as it needed to be. We learned of a few weak links that were pulled apart, thankfully, for just a short time. But because of those issues, and good old American ingenuity, we have an even more efficient, sustainable food chain than before the pandemic.""""The American farmer and rancher were, are, and will be part of that solution,"" Hillman said.Agricultural Council of Arkansas Executive Vice President and Director Andrew Grobmyer said the goal is not to deconstruct the current Farm Bill, but to build upon it.""All of the witnesses on the row crop side expressed that the economics of farming today and in recent years has changed a lot from the economics of the time in which the last Farm Bill was written,"" Grobmyer said. ""And there's a common thread, or pursuit, to make sure this Farm Bill is reflective of the economics of agriculture today.""The Farm Bill, signed into law in late 2018, authorizes federal policies governing food like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), supports agriculture workers and provides community food access. It is supposed to be reauthorized every five years.USA Rice Federation Sustainability Committee Chair and Newport rice farmer Jennifer James testified that there is a ""very real and present crisis in the U.S. rice industry"" and called for help to create economic sustainability for rice farmers.""Currently, rice has been disproportionately affected by steep increases in input costs and we have not seen corresponding increases in the price of rice,"" James said.USA Rice sent letters to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack outlining the financial situation of the rice industry on Feb. 25 and again on May 25, asking for $400 million in direct relief for farmers to ""weather current conditions.""The second letter referenced a Texas A&M University Agricultural and Food Policy Center study in May about the impact of higher farming input costs and commodity price changes on 64 farms. The report said that 10 of the 15 rice farms in the study would sustain losses in 2022.Arkansas rice accounted for 47.5% of total U.S. rice production in 2021 and it is one of the top three crop commodities in cash receipts for the state's farmers, according to the University of Arkansas System's research and extension arm.James said current estimates show U.S. rice acres will decline by 27% this year compared to last year.""The costs for all commodities are going up every day. That's the input costs, so that means the farmers are taking much greater risks on their crops, and rice in particular has not seen the rise in its futures price relative to other commodities,"" Grobmyer said.""So it's a matter of competing for planted acres and right now, rice acres are looking to be down substantially and that's going to cause some issues not just for farmers, but for the whole industry, the rice mills and so forth, that depend on volume for their business. If they don't have sufficient volume, they're not able to cover their costs, maintain their employees and all of that infrastructure.""Fifth-generation farmer Mark Morgan of Peach Pickin' Paradise and Morgan Farms in Clarksville returned to farming after earning a master's degree to continue a family tradition. Morgan said he and other farmers today want to see advancements in risk management options, especially for specialty crop growers.""One of the most important things we've struggled with, me personally and especially crop producers, is crop insurance,"" Morgan testified. ""Our premiums are so high for our losses.""""Last year, April 20, we had a freeze. This year ... Easter Sunday, we had hail. It changes all the time. We don't ask for much, but better risk protection packages through crop insurance is something we'd really like to see.""Food producers, and particularly specialty crop growers, need protection from unforeseen events like severe weather or a bad harvest to continue farming, Morgan said.""The biggest sustainability issue we have in specialty crops is not having the risk management tools when you have two or three bad years in a row, we just want something a little bit more reliable. I love growing peaches, it's what I came back to do and I love my job. I just want for myself and others to keep that going.""Friday's meeting at Arkansas State University marked the second U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee field hearing this year.

https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/jonesboro-sun-negative-impact,"JONESBORO — More flexibility and streamlined regulations are needed in programs provided under the U.S. Department of Agriculture, representatives of several groups said during a Senate field hearing in Jonesboro Friday.It’s the second field hearing since the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry began work on a 2023 farm bill.Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, chairwoman of the committee, hosted the first field haring in April at Michigan State University. Arkansas Sen. John Boozman, the committee’s ranking Republican member hosted the second hearing at the Fowler Center at Arkansas State University.Rich Hillman, president of the Arkansas Farm Bureau, underscored the importance of good farm legislation, noting that agriculture remains the largest industry in the state.“We all do our jobs across the state to feed hungry people with great pride,” Hillman said. “All of us that do that realize that our jobs are the most important known to mankind.”Though hundreds of miles apart, Stabenow said farmers and their communities in Michigan share common issues with Arkansas.“We’re working hard to put bipartisanship and civility at the very center of everything we do,” Stabenow said.Boozman said his committee must evaluate if the programs in the current farm program are meeting the country’s needs.“Are we empowering, encouraging and incentivizing our farmers to be more productive and more efficient?” Boozman asked. “Are we making the right investments in our rural infrastructure?”Nathan Reed of Marianna, president of the American Cotton Producers, said a new farm bill has to make allowances for the surge of input costs, including a stronger crop insurance program to help manage the risks.“An effective safety net for producers must contain two key components,’ Reed said. “First, a commodity policy that provides either price or revenue protection for prolonged periods of low prices in depressed market conditions. Secondly a strong and fully accessible suite of crop insurance products that producers can purchase and tailor to their risk management needs.”He noted that recent disasters have been more extreme than the current programs anticipate.Brad Doyle of Weiner, president of the American Soybean Association, noted soybeans are produced in nearly every state.“It’s important to note that improving, protecting, enhancing, growing and building all require additional resources,” Boyle said. “As you prepare to write the new farm bill, we respectfully request that you seek additional funding resources from the Budget Committee to enable these and the priorities of others to be possible.”Anne Marie Doramus, a member of the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, said her agency and farmers work together on a number of conservation issues and help provide a $9.7 billion outdoor recreation industry for the state.“The farm bill’s conservation programs represent the single largest investment in private land conservation,” Doramus said. “Its most critical function is to support our state’s thriving agricultural communities. However, there are substantial benefits to fish and wildlife habitat.”Mark Morgan, a peach farmer from near Clarksville, said the crop insurance program doesn’t work well for specialty crop producers.“We don’t ask for much but a better risk protection package through crop insurance is something we’d like to see,” Morgan said. Existing programs don’t fit the specific needs for his crops or those of tomato farmers in Arkansas, he said.Jennifer James of Newport, representing USA Rice, said rice has been disproportionately impacted by the cost of production versus prices received. The Price Loss Coverage program is the best protection they have, but under today’s conditions, are no longer adequate, and she predicted rice acreage may drop by 27 percent.She noted competing nations heavily subsidize their crops. She said increasing support for rice producers is a worthy investment.“In the wake of the pandemic and now with global food shortages said to be imminent, Americans are realizing that food security is a national security issue,” James said. “It’s not just a clever slogan. It is a reality. We cannot afford to lose our domestic rice industry.”John McAlpine, owner of a forestry business in Monticello, said the nation’s forests, most of which are privately owned, play a key role in fighting climate change and urged continued support of forestry programs.Outside of crops, the farm bill is expected to play a crucial role in rural communities’ survival.Elizabeth Bowles, CEO of Aristotle Unified Communications, said it’s not practical to focus exclusively on high-speed fiber to the home programs that can cost as much as $14,000 per home to implement in rural areas.“The Bipartisan Infrastructure Jobs Act makes available once in a generation $65 billion for broadband and a lot of that money is going to go into rural America,” Bowles said. “But that program has initiated a fiber first, fiber only strategy, which means that the program will probably run out of money before every rural American is served.”Bowles said the new farm bill should take a different approach.“Fiber is very expensive and it takes a lot longer to deploy than other technologies,” Bowles said. “Rural communities do not have the luxury to wait years for broadband connectivity, and if the purpose of the farm bill broadband program is to assure that every farm and resident has access to broadband, then it’s critical that the broadband programs in the farm bill remain technology neutral.”Buddy Hasten, CEO of the Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp., said cooperatives need access to incentives to invest in clean energy as they seek to replace their current base load capacity. Proposed legislation that would allow the nonprofits to refinance Rural Utility Service loans would free up about $100 million that could allow the co-ops to keep their rates relatively low, he said.Plus, Hasten said the cooperatives are also deeply involved in helping bring broadband services to their members.Hasten stressed the importance of “ensuring that these programs are flexible and streamlined and will allow electric cooperatives to deploy fiber resources as quickly and efficiently as possible,” Hasten said. He said current government programs are geared toward telecommunications companies, to the detriment of the co-ops, who already have much of the infrastructure in place to help provide the service.Rhonda Sanders, CEO of the Arkansas Foodbank, said food insecurity in rural areas is a growing problem because of transportation costs and the dwindling number of grocery stores in rural communities.Read the story in the Jonesboro Sun. Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/jonesboro-sun-negative-impact"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/senate-delivers-help-for-veterans-living-with-the-toxic-wounds-of-war,"I’ve been honored to serve on the Senate and House Veterans’ Affairs Committees to help craft policies fulfilling the promise we made to men and women who served in our nation’s uniform by expanding access to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care, benefits and services. We’ve achieved major enhancements this year. Just weeks ago the president signed into law measures I championed to modernize the VA’s approach to breast cancer screening and treatment as well as increased accountability within the department. I’m pleased to build off this momentum with a comprehensive and bipartisan package the Senate recently passed to support veterans living with illnesses they experience as a result of burn pits and other toxic exposures during their military service.The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022 will deliver toxic-exposed veterans of all generations their earned VA health care and benefits. Exposure to toxic substances like burn pits is known to cause serious illness including rare cancers and respiratory ailments. Those suffering deserve to know they have not been forgotten and their voices have been heard. The legislation honors the promise our nation made to the men and women who served in these dangerous conditions. The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act fulfills that promise and delivers immediate access to health care for toxic-exposed veterans, directs the VA to evaluate diseases for presumption of service connection, and streamlines the process for toxic-exposed veterans seeking disability compensation for their illnesses without overwhelming the VA system.With this measure, we also continue to correct past failures at the VA to provide health care and benefits to previous generations exposed to Agent Orange.These challenges have existed for decades and it’s time we make good on our commitment to Vietnam War-era veterans once and for all.This legislation updates VA policies to provide veterans like Bill Rhodes of Mena, Arkansas –– a Marine who served in Thailand during the Vietnam War-era –– access to the care he deserves.I’ve been working with Mr. Rhodes for a number of years to educate my colleagues about the restrictions that have resulted in his claim being denied.The VA accepts that herbicides were used along the perimeters of military bases in Thailand, but does not recognize the impact of the herbicides inside the perimeter. This current policy makes no sense and is unfair, preventing veterans like Mr. Rhodes from accessing benefits as a result of toxic exposure.Importantly, once the bill becomes law it will eliminate the bureaucratic hurdles that have stood in the way of Mr. Rhodes and other veterans getting the care they earned.In conversations with my office following Senate passage, Mr. Rhodes says he can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel after all the work he has put in to advance this measure. He has truly been a relentless advocate for veterans living with illnesses as a result of toxic exposure. Thanks to the efforts of Mr. Rhodes, Veteran Service Organizations and families, the Senate passed this critical legislation and I am confident the House of Representatives will quickly take up this landmark bill and send it to the president’s desk to be signed into law to deliver the help our veterans deserve.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/senate-delivers-help-for-veterans-living-with-the-toxic-wounds-of-war"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/adg-boozman-wants-national-designation-for-3-000-mile-stagecoach-route-that-went-through-arkansas,"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Senate approved a bill Thursday expanding health care access to veterans exposed to toxins during their service, a piece of legislation that included provisions written by Arkansas Republican John Boozman.The bipartisan legislation cleared the chamber in a 84-14 tally with Boozman of Rogers and U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton of Little Rock both voting in support of the measure.""This is probably the most sweeping veterans bill of the last several decades. It's a major accomplishment,"" Boozman said Thursday. ""So when you have something of that magnitude, it just takes a lot of hard work.""Supporters of the legislation say it would bolster federal research regarding toxic exposure and expand U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs health care eligibility for combat veterans who served after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.The legislation would add 23 conditions related to burn pits and toxic exposure to the department's catalog of service presumptions, in which the department presumes that conditions were the result of a person's military service.There is also a provision offered by Boozman that would expand health care and disability compensation benefits to veterans of the Vietnam War era who served in Thailand, according to the senator's office.The legislation passed by the Senate now must clear the House.The senior senator from Arkansas said he was involved in working on the legislation with Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester of Montana and Republican U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas.Boozman, during a Senate floor speech on Wednesday, said there's a need for improvements to benefits for post-9/11 veterans who were exposed to toxic substances from burn pits.Such exposures are known to cause serious illness, including respiratory ailments and rare cancers, he said.""Those suffering deserve to know they have not been forgotten, and their voices have been heard,"" he said. ""The promise our nation made to the men and women who served in these dangerous conditions must be kept. This bill fulfills that promise.""Boozman also mentioned veteran Bill Rhodes of Mena, who served in Thailand during the Vietnam War era. The senator described Rhodes as a ""relentless advocate of toxic exposure benefits.""On Thursday, Rhodes said he feels like the legislation will eventually be signed into law, but he's waiting for that to officially happen.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement Thursday saying the chamber will ""move swiftly to take up this legislation and send it to President Biden's desk for his signature.""Pelosi, in the statement, called the Senate passage a ""historic victory for America's veterans, their families and caregivers, and for our nation.""Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat who voted for the measure, said there are estimated to be 3.5 million service members who had been exposed to dangerous chemicals during their time in the line of duty over the last 20 years.Cotton, a military veteran, indicated his support for the legislation on Wednesday.""For those Arkansans who were exposed to burn pits, who have illnesses or other conditions relating to those exposures, it'll make sure that they're getting in the line at the VA, that they're getting the benefits and the health care they need,"" he said.Passage of the measure in the Senate comes more than a week after Biden signed into law a bill expanding mammogram eligibility for veterans. The move gave final approval to legislation sponsored by Boozman.Under that legislation, veterans who served in locations with burn pits will be cleared for mammograms through health-care providers of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, regardless of age or family history.A separate bill backed by Boozman and approved by Biden on the same day also orders the department to update in-house breast imaging to three-dimensional breast imaging.Read the story in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/adg-boozman-wants-national-designation-for-3-000-mile-stagecoach-route-that-went-through-arkansas"

Regular export capability is particularly vital to the state’s agriculture industry. As we continue to face skyrocketing inflation, signing this legislation into law is a critical step to helping relieve the supply chain crisis that is exacerbating high prices,” Boozman said.“Recent supply chain issues have shown major weaknesses in our federal regulations for the global shipping industry. This legislation is a step forward in ensuring that the Federal Maritime Commission has the proper tools and resources to prevent delays, lower costs to consumers, and increase competitiveness with nations like China. I have repeatedly supported these much needed measures, and it’s a relief to see Ocean Shipping Reform finally reach the finish line,” said Crawford.“Too many families and small businesses are experiencing the strain of empty shelves and wallets. I’m proud to help deliver real action to combat inflation and supply chain disruptions. With today’s signing, we are supporting a fast flow of goods and Arkansas producers, especially our hardworking farmers and ranchers. Increasing market access and economic opportunity for Natural State and American-made products is essential to easing backlogs and alleviating price burdens on consumers,” Womack said. “The Ocean Shipping Reform Act is a positive step forward for American agriculture.  We export a large amount of our crops and products and depend heavily on ocean shipping to deliver these goods to market.  We applaud the Arkansas Congressional Delegation for getting this done for Arkansas farm families who produce the best food and fiber in the world,” said Rich Hillman, President of Arkansas Farm Bureau. “We are glad ocean cargo services will be held accountable under the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, allowing for fairer treatment of trucks and shippers and, subsequently, increasing overall efficiency in the supply chain. We applaud Senator Boozman and Representatives Crawford and Womack for their support of the bill and look forward to improved freight flow at the ports so we can continue to deliver goods where they are needed most,” said Arkansas Trucking Association President Shannon Newton.“We thank Senator Boozman and Representatives Crawford and Womack for supporting the Ocean Shopping Reform Act,” said Kevin McGilton, Vice President of Government Affairs for Riceland Foods. “The Act will give the FMC more tools to ensure our exports flow efficiently to our customers at fair rates.”The Ocean Shipping Reform Act will: The legislation was introduced by Senators John Thune (R-SD) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). The bill is supported by a number of organizations including the American Association of Port Authorities, the National Industrial Transportation League, the National Retail Federation, the Agriculture Transportation Coalition and the American Trucking Associations. Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/legislation-championed-by-boozman-crawford-and-womack-to-ease-export-shipping-backlogs-boost-u-s-exports-signed-into-law"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/boozman-senate-republican-leaders-introduce-bill-targeting-political-bias-at-big-tech-companies,"WASHINGTON––U.S. Senators John Boozman (R-AR) and John Thune (R-SD), along with Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), led their Republican colleagues today in introducing the Political Bias in Algorithm Sorting (BIAS) Emails Act. The legislation would hold Big Tech platforms accountable for using biased algorithms that take control away from consumers and alter the way users are able to see emails from political campaigns. It would also create more transparency for consumers by revealing the censorship practices Big Tech platforms, including Google, use to filter certain emails.“Americans don’t need or want technology companies to censor political perspectives they might disagree with, so it’s disturbing to see another indication of them doing just that. Our country has always been about competing on a level playing field and accepting results based on fair rules and practices,” said Boozman. “I’m pleased to join Sen. Thune and our colleagues to ensure more accountability and transparency among Big Tech companies through this bill.”“I’ve long believed that Congress should hold Big Tech accountable to the users who rely on its platforms – for everything from email to social media – and empower those consumers to make their own online decisions, free from Big Tech’s heavy hand,” said Thune. “I’m proud to lead this effort that would prohibit large online platforms from censoring emails through filtered algorithms – a process that ultimately discriminates against political campaigns. Consumers should be able to choose what they want to see, not Google. It’s long past time for Big Tech to be held accountable for its blatant bias, and this bill would be an important step in that direction.”“The evidence suggests that some actors in the tech industry display an undeniable pattern of ideological bias against conservatives,” said McConnell. “I applaud Senator Thune for leading legislation to push back against companies that use private-sector political censorship to quietly distort our public discourse. If left-wing elites disagree with citizens’ free speech, they should make their own case in an open marketplace of ideas, not use powerful technology platforms to put a thumb on the scale.”The legislation is also co-sponsored by Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mike Braun (R-IN), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Steve Daines (R-MT), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Josh Hawley (R-MO), James Lankford (R-OK), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Jim Risch (R-ID), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Tim Scott (R-SC), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and Roger Wicker (R-MS).To prevent Big Tech from hindering voters’ access to a candidate’s perspective on certain political issues and other relevant information, the Political BIAS Emails Act would prohibit email platforms, like Google, from using biased filtering algorithms on emails from federal political campaigns, unless a user took a proactive action to apply a certain label to that email. The legislation would also bring much more transparency to the practices large email services use to dictate outcomes by requiring email services to produce quarterly transparency reports.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/boozman-senate-republican-leaders-introduce-bill-targeting-political-bias-at-big-tech-companies"

We’ve heard the struggles of veterans and their families living with toxic exposure-related illnesses. We can end the hurdles they experience and save lives by passing this landmark legislation,” Boozman said in a speech on the Senate floor.The legislation also includes a provision authored by Boozman to expand benefits to Vietnam War-era veterans who served on military bases in Thailand. The VA accepts that herbicides were used along the perimeters of military bases in Thailand, but does not recognize the impact of the herbicides inside the perimeter. The current policy is unfair and has prevented veterans like Bill Rhodes of Mena, Arkansas from accessing benefits as a result of toxic exposure. Boozman called Rhodes a “relentless advocate of toxic exposure benefits.” Boozman also teamed up with Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Jon Tester (D-MT) to better prepare the VA to respond to the anticipated increase in claims following passage of this legislation with the introduction of the VA Workforce Improvement, Support, and Expansion (WISE) Act of 2022 last month. This continues Boozman’s commitment to improving benefits and services for toxic-exposed veterans. Last week, President Biden signed into law the Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas SERVICE Act, legislation authored by the senator requiring the VA to conduct mammograms for all women who served in areas associated with burn pits and other toxic exposures regardless of age, symptoms or family history.

Ron Johnson (R-WI) on legislation to require any convention or agreement resulting from the work of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) intergovernmental negotiating body be deemed a treaty with the advice and consent of a supermajority of the Senate necessary for ratification. The senators’ No WHO Pandemic Preparedness Treaty Without Senate Approval Act comes as the WHO pushes for broad new powers under a new “international treaty for pandemic preparedness and response.”After the Biden administration’s failed COVID-19 response and the WHO’s mismanagement of the pandemic, Americans remain skeptical of further infringements on personal liberties and freedoms. The legislation would provide more transparency in WHO agreements and serve as a constitutional check on the administration.“Americans are right to be concerned about the WHO’s activities given how poorly it handled the COVID-19 pandemic. My colleagues and I are pushing to ensure it does not have the authority to impose mandates on our country without the express approval of the Senate. We will continue staunchly protecting U.S. sovereignty as the Constitution provides,” Boozman said.“The WHO, along with our federal health agencies, failed miserably in its response to COVID-19. It’s failure should not be rewarded with a new international treaty that would increase its power at the expense of American sovereignty. What WHO does need is greater accountability and transparency. This bill makes clear to the Biden administration that any new WHO pandemic agreement must be deemed a treaty and submitted to the Senate for ratification. The sovereignty of the United States is not negotiable,” said Johnson.Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), Mike Braun (R-IN), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), John Hoeven (R-ND), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Mike Lee (R-UT), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Rick Scott (R-FL), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Steve Daines (R-MT) and Thom Tillis (R-NC) joined Boozman and Johnson in support of the bill.The full text of the legislation can be found here.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/boozman-johnson-colleagues-move-to-protect-american-sovereignty-against-world-health-organization"

In a letter signed by a total of 32 senators, they called on the SEC to rescind the overreaching proposal requiring publicly-traded companies to include certain climate-related disclosures in their registration statements and periodic reports and imposing extensive new, complex and burdensome greenhouse gas reporting requirements on all entities within their value chain, including farmers and ranchers who fall outside of the SEC’s Congressionally-provided authority.“We have serious concerns regarding the SEC’s regulatory overreach, as well as the impact that this proposed rule will have on the agricultural industry,” wrote the senators. “This substantial reporting requirement would significantly burden small, family-owned farms with a new, complex and unreasonable compliance requirement, resulting in costly additional compliance expenses, reduced access to new business opportunities, and potential consolidation in the agriculture industry…This proposed rule moves well beyond the SEC’s traditional regulatory authority by mandating climate change reporting requirements that will not only regulate publicly traded companies, but will impact every company in the value chain.” Boozman, Hoeven and Scott were joined in this effort by Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Jim Risch (R-ID), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Steve Daines (R-MT), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Richard Burr (R-NC), Ted Cruz (R-TX), John Barrasso (R-WY), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Rick Scott (R-FL), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), John Kennedy (R-LA), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Mike Braun (R-IN), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Joni Ernst (R-IA), James Lankford (R-OK), John Cornyn (R-TX), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Lindsay Graham (R-SC), John Thune (R-SD), Todd Young (R-IN) and Josh Hawley (R-MO).The full text of the letter can be read here.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/boozman-colleagues-stand-up-for-agriculture-producers-against-overreach"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/boozman-recognizes-service-of-retired-arkansas-national-guard-adjutant-general,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) recognized the service and sacrifice of Major General (retired) Ron Chastain in ‘Salute to Veterans,’ a series recognizing the military service of Arkansans. Chastain was born in Paris, Arkansas on October 18, 1950. He enjoyed his childhood in Branch along with his 11 brothers and sisters, two of whom also served in the military. His father was a contract painter and his mother raised Ron and all his siblings while tending to the home. Growing up, the children all helped out with chores around the house and on the family farm.Chastain attended Arkansas Tech University after high school where he met his future wife, Pam Berry, from Dover. At ATU he was required to join ROTC. During his sophomore year, he received a low draft number and continued participating in the ROTC so he could serve as an officer. Because the Vietnam War was winding down by the time he graduated college, fewer lieutenants were needed so he was given the choice of serving for three months or two years. He opted for the shorter service because he had a job lined up with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).Unfortunately, while he was training at Fort Benning, Georgia, President Richard Nixon issued a federal hiring freeze, so his position with the USDA was no longer an option.Chastain changed his plans and started working toward his master’s degree at the University of Arkansas while also being encouraged by a retired major to join the National Guard, so he became a member of the 142nd Field Artillery Group in Fayetteville. When the federal hiring freeze was lifted, he discontinued pursuing his master’s and took a job with the USDA. It wasn’t long before he joined the 39th Infantry Brigade as a lieutenant in the company in nearby De Queen.After serving as a platoon leader, he was eventually named company commander. “It was kind of interesting that my civilian office was just diagonal across the intersection from the National Guard Armory in Mena and so I’d go over and visit with them during break,” he said.  Over the next few years, Chastain served in a number of leadership positions including as company commander in Prescott, a logistics officer and an intelligence officer, and with units in Malvern, Ozark, Clarksville, Little Rock, North Little Rock and Camp Robinson. After moving to Conway, he was most appreciative of being able to come home after drill and spend the night with his family. “I can tell you living in Central Arkansas makes all the difference for officers in the National Guard.” Chastain assumed leadership of the 25th Rear Area Operations Center and before they had even been through an exercise, he was alerted of their deployment in support of Operation Desert Shield and mobilized at Fort Hood, Texas. It was supposed to be a quick turnaround. “We only had time for weapons qualification, drawing equipment and getting our protective masks tested,” Chastain said. But he and his troops were “stuck” at Fort Hood while planes were flying other troops to the Middle East.Chastain flew on a C-5 military transport, and while in the air to Saudi Arabia, the next phase of the Gulf War - Operation Desert Storm - had started. He and his troops deployed with the 18th Airborne Corps. They were given the mission of setting up a logistics base in Iraq. He remembers the harsh elements like sandstorms, traveling in total blackout, and a close encounter with an Army cobra attack helicopter.After the land war ended and his troops returned to the base in Saudi Arabia, he said there were a lot of challenges. “That’s when my problems really started as the unit commander, because everybody was in a hurry to get home, and everybody was tense.” Chastain’s teams oversaw finding locations for vehicles to be cleaned and stored before being shipped out, taking care of the air bases for personnel, and clearing the Desert Shield area to the expectations of Saudi Arabia. After his team had done everything to the standard of the 18th Airborne Corps, he and his unit were sent home and demobilized at Fort Hood.Chastain continued to demonstrate his incredible leadership as he moved up the ranks. In 1995 he became executive officer at the 39th Infantry Brigade. In this role he was selected for the Army War College, which he says was “the hardest two years I think I’ve ever had in my life.”   Chastain later served as the brigade deputy commander before commanding the brigade. While Chastain was preparing for a Joint Readiness Training rotation, he learned he and the rest of the 39th Infantry Brigade would be deploying to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In Iraq, Chastain’s team suffered several casualties early on. “We knew it was going to be a long year.” He had the largest area of operations of any of the 1st Cavalry Division at Taji Air Base, which came with increased responsibility. “It was dangerous. You could do everything right and still get hurt.” He recalled one incident when a grenade hit directly behind his vehicle and exploded, narrowly missing him. One of the key tasks was to train the Iraqi Army. “If we were going to use them on a mission, we’d typically not tell them what we were going to do until right before the mission, because they were liable to call the folks we were after,” Chastain said. For this deployment, Chastain was away from his civilian job at the USDA for 22 months. “I was fortunate working for the Department of Agriculture,” but it was “pretty traumatic for a lot of other folks,” he said.Chastain remained the 39th Infantry Brigade commander for more than five years as a result of the war. At the end of that extension, he was promoted to Major General and assigned to Wartime Chief of Staff for U.S. Forces – Korea. Former Governor Mike Huckabee appointed him Adjutant General of the Arkansas National Guard in 2006. He later served as Deputy Commander, Reserve Component at Forces Command in Atlanta. During this time, he traveled across the country visiting mobilized guard units. After 38 years of military service commanding units in two different wars, Chastain retired from the Arkansas National Guard. He was recognized for his distinguished service with awards including the Army Distinguished Service Medal, two Legions of Merit and two Bronze Star medals. He was also inducted into the Arkansas Military Veterans’ Hall of Fame in 2014.“It’s not always the highest rank that you make that is the most fulfilling. The most fulfilling assignment I’ve ever had was as commander of the 39th Brigade,” Chastain said of his time in the military.Following his distinguished military career and successful career at USDA, he continued his public service as a member of Senator Boozman’s staff where he served as an agriculture liaison. He also taught elementary students across the state about the history and proper care of the American and Arkansas flags.“Major General Chastain has led a life devoted to his country, state and community. I am thankful for his military service to our nation, and his civil service to Arkansas and his steady guidance during his time on my team. He is an excellent example for all Arkansans and Americans to follow. I am proud of this servant leader and all he has accomplished and am honored to call him a friend,” Boozman said.Boozman will submit Chastain’s entire interview to the Veterans History Project, an initiative of the Library of Congress’s American Folklife Center to collect and retain the oral histories of our nation’s veterans.

https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/celebrating-arkansas-statehood-and-longevity,"The American flag has featured 50 stars since 1959, when Alaska and Hawaii joined the Union. That means over six decades have passed since the United States last expanded, which was well after Arkansas was admitted as the 25th state.In fact, June 15 marks 186 years since The Natural State achieved statehood. Events during the nearly-two centuries since have profoundly shaped and influenced the history, culture and direction of our state. This week, as we celebrate the anniversary of this occasion, we have an opportunity to look back on how Arkansas’s story has unfolded and to renew our hope in the promise of an even brighter future.From the Quapaw tribe of Native Americans who inhabited the land when French and Spanish explorers discovered it – giving rise to the name Arkansas first as a reference to the indigenous residents and then to the territory itself – to the citizens who reside here today, we all understand how majestic this place is and why it’s so special. That also partly helps explain the nicknames Arkansas has acquired over time, including The Wonder State, The Land of Opportunity and now The Natural State.There’s a clear and deep appreciation for the inherently beautiful geographical array it showcases. Over time, that reality has helped draw visitors from across the country and throughout the world to experience and appreciate what the state legislature formally described as the “unsurpassed scenery, clear lakes, free-flowing streams, magnificent rivers, meandering bayous, delta bottomlands, forested mountains and abundant fish and wildlife” readily found here. But it’s not just the land and natural resources that help set it apart. We know the people and communities here are equally integral features within Arkansas’s story.Like most other states, this land was once a frontier that presented promise and risk to settlers looking for a new start. That gave rise to a flourishing society which spread out to every corner of modern-day Arkansas. The demographics and population centers continue to change, but Arkansans stay true to our unique legacy and the wonderful traditions that bring families, friends and neighbors together.Folklore like the Arkansas Traveler and community celebrations like the Pink Tomato Festival in Bradley County or the Gillett Coon Supper demonstrate a shared sense of identity that unites us and invites people to be part of something bigger than themselves.These events, and the towns and cities that host them, are proud of the rich heritage they represent.The state is not the only entity marking a milestone this year. The communities of Lonoke, Judsonia and Brinkley all turn 150, while Joiner and Smackover mark their centennials in 2022.There’s never a shortage of opportunities to celebrate Arkansas and what sets it apart. The 186 years that have elapsed since it became a state are a testament to the resilience of our people and the institutions we have built. No natural disaster or man-made crisis has yet been able to conquer our spirit or bring us so low as to prevent us from getting back up.As we look to the future, I am confident we will continue pursuing pathways that help future generations of Arkansans thrive while uplifting our state on many fronts. We have a track record of doing just that by bridging gaps, finding common ground and putting our motto into action – Regnat Populus, “the people rule.” Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/celebrating-arkansas-statehood-and-longevity"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/boozman-requests-updates-from-hhs-secretary-on-transitioning-out-of-covid-19-public-health-emergency,"WASHINGTON––U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) joined 25 Senate colleagues in urging Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra to provide Congress, patients and providers with additional insight on the department’s plans for transitioning out of the COVID-19 public health emergency. The letter specifically requests information on how changes in temporary, pandemic-related policies will affect Medicare, Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) patients and providers in the coming months.  “As the American people return to normalcy, workers, families, frontline health care providers, and a range of other stakeholders need transparency and certainty regarding the path forward,” the senators wrote. “This unpredictable patchwork of mandates and questionable authorities will continue to erode the public’s confidence in government health agencies. For frontline health care providers and patients, the administration’s erratic approach to transitioning beyond a perpetual state of pandemic emergency could prove particularly problematic.” Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) authored the letter, which in addition to Boozman was also signed by Senators Mike Braun (R-IN), Richard Burr (R-NC), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), John Cornyn (R-TX), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Steve Daines (R-MT), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), James Lankford (R-OK), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Rand Paul (R-KY), Rob Portman (R-OH), Jim Risch (R-ID), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Rick Scott (R-FL), Tim Scott (R-SC), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), John Thune (R-SD) and Todd Young (R-IN). The full text of the letter can be found here and below. Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/boozman-requests-updates-from-hhs-secretary-on-transitioning-out-of-covid-19-public-health-emergency"

https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/stars-and-stripes-two-bills-that-expand-mammogram-access-for-female-veterans-become-law,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Tuesday signed two bills into law that will expand mammogram access for female veterans who served in areas with toxic exposures and improve services for them in rural parts of the country.""It's a sacred obligation because veterans are the backbone, the spine of who we are as a country,"" Biden said during the signing at the White House. ""Less than 1% risks everything to defend our nation and our values and everything we hold dear. The 99% of us who don't, we owe them. We owe them big, and that's what today's all about: It's paying a debt, in my view.""The two bills were among nine bills related to veterans that Biden signed into law Tuesday. One of the other bills awarded the Congressional Gold Medal to veterans of the Army Rangers of World War II.The bill signings came two months after the death of Kate Hendricks Thomas, a Marine veteran who advocated for better health care for veterans exposed to burn pit toxins. The Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas Supporting Expanded Review for Veterans In Combat Environments Act, also known as the Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas SERVICE Act, extends access to mammograms for all female veterans who served in areas with burn pits or other toxic exposures, regardless of their age, symptoms or family history.A May 2021 study by the National Library of Medicine reported female veterans were nearly three times more likely to develop invasive breast cancer than the rest of the population. The study also reported breast cancer cases had tripled in the Department of Veteran Affairs from 1995 to 2012. Additionally, the study said breast cancer is the leading cancer that affects female veterans, with data that implied increases were based on service-related exposures.At age 25 in 2005, Thomas served in Iraq and was near multiple burn pits in Anbar province. In 2018, when she was 38, Thomas went to a routine health care appointment at her local VA, and her doctor encouraged her to get a mammogram. Following the mammogram, she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. Thomas had no family history of the disease and believed her diagnosis was related to her burn pit exposure.Thomas fought for years to prove her cancer resulted from her exposure to toxic burn pits before the VA recognized the link. At the same time, she advocated for the process to change so that other veterans didn't face the same challenges.Thomas died in April at the age of 42.""Kate knew this was the right thing to do, and America — building on her work and influence — has finally done it,"" said Marine veteran Mindy Beyer, a friend of Thomas. ""Today was a huge step forward for veterans' health. We must all keep vigilant and continue to push forward these initiatives to protect those that protect us.""Beyer said she, along with Thomas's other friends and family, were present at the signing. Biden also gave Thomas's son, Matthew, the pen that he used to sign the bill into law.Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., introduced the Kate Hendricks Thomas SERVICE ACT in July. ""I've been pleased to work in a bipartisan way to get these measures across the finish line so we can save lives through modern approaches to breast cancer screening and treatment as well as increased accountability within the department,"" Boozman said this week. ""Our veterans deserve this progress and now we must ensure these laws are implemented in a timely and effective way.""Another bill that Biden signed into law is the Making Advances in Mammography and Medical Options for Veterans Act, introduced by Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. The new law gives the VA one year to start a pilot program for veterans who live in states where the department doesn't offer in-house mammography services. In addition to extending access to mammograms for veterans in rural areas, the new law changes VA mammography. In part, it will upgrade all the VA's in-house mammography services to use 3D imaging, called digital breast tomosynthesis. Moreover, the law will expand veterans' access to clinical trials through partnerships with the National Cancer Institute. ""These new laws will connect veterans and their families with the kind of care they earned and deserve — from strengthening oversight for VA and improving veterans' access to high-quality breast cancer screenings and care,"" Tester said this week. ""I'm proud to have worked hand-in-hand with Sen. Boozman, our Senate colleagues, and veteran stakeholders to deliver these wins for the men and women who served and sacrificed.""Read the story in Stars and Stripes. Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/stars-and-stripes-two-bills-that-expand-mammogram-access-for-female-veterans-become-law"

Elenis – a follow-up to the highly publicized Masterpiece Cakeshop case.A lower court in Colorado decided the government can force Lorie Smith, as a creative website designer and owner of a small business, to design and publish websites promoting messages that violate her beliefs. The senators’ brief argues the First Amendment protects against compelled speech, especially when it violates sincerely held religious beliefs, and calls for the Supreme Court to reaffirm freedom of speech and freedom of religion are core civil liberties protected by the U.S. Constitution. “Religious speech holds a uniquely important and protected place in American history and jurisprudence. Ms. Smith and others like her deserve the strongest possible First Amendment protection,” the senators wrote.Senate co-signers of the amicus brief include Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mike Braun (R-IN), John Cornyn (R-TX), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Mike Lee (UT), Steve Daines (R-MT), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), John Kennedy (R-LA), James Lankford (R-OK), Jim Risch (R-ID), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ben Sasse (R-NE), John Thune (R-SD), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and Roger Wicker (R-MS). The brief also has support from 38 members of the House of Representatives.Read the brief here.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/boozman-senate-colleagues-file-supreme-court-brief-defending-religious-liberty"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/biden-signs-several-bills-aimed-at-veterans-care,"Click here for the following story published in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden signed into law Tuesday a bill expanding mammogram eligibility for veterans, giving final approval to legislation sponsored by Arkansas' U.S. Sen. John Boozman.Under the measure, veterans who served in locations with burn pits will be cleared for mammograms through health-care providers of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, regardless of age or family history.A separate bill backed by Boozman and approved by Biden on Tuesday will establish a veterans tele-mammography pilot program, along with ordering the department to update in-house breast imaging to three-dimensional breast imaging.Boozman, a Republican from Rogers, said there are many female veterans from the Gulf wars who are developing breast cancer at an early age.""These two bills are very important,"" he said. ""They're not solving the problem in Ukraine and things like that, but for the individuals, for those families, this literally is life and death. So making sure that they're diagnosed earlier, that they're treated in the very best way possible.""Both pieces of legislation passed Congress unanimously.The senior senator from Arkansas was on hand at the White House on Tuesday as the president signed a slate of veteran-related legislation.Joy Ilem, national legislative director for the nonprofit Disabled American Veterans, said the group appreciates Boozman's efforts on the mammogram eligibility legislation.Women veterans have served in Iraq, Afghanistan and other places where there are toxic exposures, she said. The legislation is trying to address veterans of the Gulf wars who develop breast cancer at an earlier age, Ilem said. The Disabled American Veterans is an organization that assists and advocates for service-disabled veterans.""When there's additional risks, higher risk for people who have served, it's important to be able to get the mammogram early,"" she said.Tanya Taylor, the former state chaplain for Arkansas Veterans of Foreign Wars, also praised the legislation Tuesday. The Veterans of Foreign Wars is a veterans service organization.Requiring the VA to upgrade to three-dimensional breast imaging is going to have a key impact, she said, adding: ""I am very honored that we have Senator Boozman.""The bill-signing at the White House marked a rare public appearance between the president and Boozman, who often lambastes the Biden administration on inflation and border security.Those themes have been on display in recent months as Boozman ran against challengers in this year's Senate Republican primary, which the incumbent won last month.Boozman continues to be critical of the president, but the senator said Tuesday that veteran issues are neither a Democrat nor Republican topic.""We hear a lot about all the rancor that goes on here. But many issues like this, particularly veterans, this isn't about Democrats and Republicans. This is not a partisan issue. This is trying to take care of the men and women that served overseas,"" he said.Boozman said it was exciting to be a part of the signing ceremony.""To see Democrats and Republicans coalescing around getting good things done for veterans really is encouraging and it's a great feeling,"" he said after the bill-signing Tuesday.Asked how he was able to pass legislation with unanimous support, Boozman said it's about helping members understand a measure's potential impact.The legislation signed Tuesday instructs the VA secretary to carry out a three-year pilot program to provide tele-screening mammography for veterans who live in states where the VA does not offer breast imaging services at a department facility. The program would also be for veterans who live in places where access to that service at a department facility ""is difficult or not feasible.""Another piece of legislation supported by Boozman received Biden's signature on Tuesday.The bill would give the VA's Office of Inspector General the ability to subpoena various individuals, including certain former department employees.The legislation will help with accountability by widening the office's ability to conduct more thorough investigations, Boozman has said.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/biden-signs-several-bills-aimed-at-veterans-care"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/boozman-pressures-garland-demands-answers-from-doj-on-efforts-to-protect-pro-life-groups-from-violence,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR), longtime advocate for the rights of the unborn, along with 15 of his colleagues called on U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate and take action to prevent violence against pro-life organizations. After a draft opinion in the Supreme Court case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was leaked to the media, pro-life and religious organizations have been increasingly facing harassment and attack. “We are deeply concerned that this trend will continue should the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade in the coming weeks unless the Department of Justice, the FBI, and U.S. Attorneys’ Offices take a firm public stance and proactive response against these violent threats,” the senators wrote.“The criminal acts perpetrated against those who oppose legalized abortion are a clear effort to intimidate or coerce individuals who hold pro-life values,” the senators wrote. “We call on the Department of Justice to take these actions seriously and work to prevent violence and, when such acts are perpetrated, investigate and prosecute them as appropriate.” The letter was signed by Senators Steve Daines (R-MT), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Jim Risch (R-ID), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Ted Cruz (R-TX), John Thune (R-SD), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), James Lankford (R-OK) and Mike Braun (R-IN).The senators’ call for action is supported by the National Right to Life Committee, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee, Family Research Council, Catholic Vote, March for Life, Students for Life and Family Policy Alliance. The full letter can be found here and below.Dear Attorney General Garland:We write to request information about how the Department of Justice is addressing the disturbing trend of harassment, intimidation, and violence against religious and other pro-life organizations and individuals in the aftermath of the leaked draft opinion in the Supreme Court case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. While churches and crisis pregnancy centers have been vandalized, pro-life offices in Oregon and Wisconsin have been targeted by arsonists.  We are deeply concerned that this trend will continue should the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade in the coming weeks unless the Department of Justice, the FBI, and U.S. Attorneys’ Offices take a firm public stance and proactive response against these violent threats.Last October, the Department of Justice wasted no time in publicly responding to threats of violence against educators and school administrators related to COVID-19 policies. You issued a memo in which you stated, “While spirited debate about policy matters is protected under our Constitution, that protection does not extend to threats of violence or efforts to intimidate individuals based on their views.”  At the same time, the Department created specialized training and guidance for local school boards and school administrators to help “potential victims understand the type of behavior that constitutes threats, how to report threatening conduct to the appropriate law enforcement agencies, and how to capture and preserve evidence of threatening conduct to aid in the investigation and prosecution of these crimes.”  The Department also took steps to improve coordination between the FBI, the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, and local law enforcement to “open dedicated lines of communication for threat reporting, assessment, and response.”Yet in comparison to the current climate, in which multiple acts—not just threats—of violence have been documented, we have not seen the commensurate public response from the Department of Justice that the moment demands. The criminal acts perpetrated against those who oppose legalized abortion are a clear effort to intimidate or coerce individuals who hold pro-life values. We call on the Department of Justice to take these actions seriously and work to prevent violence and, when such acts are perpetrated, investigate and prosecute them as appropriate. We are dismayed that the open and public urgency with which the Department of Justice undertook efforts in the name of public safety last year is not being replicated currently to protect religious and other pro-life organizations and individuals. We seek answers to the following questions:1. What is the Department of Justice’s strategy to prevent violence and threats of violence against private organizations and individuals who oppose legalized abortion?2. What resources does the Department of Justice need to publicize and implement this strategy successfully?3. What role has the Department of Justice played in investigating and prosecuting individuals committing violence against pro-life organizations and individuals? The Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs is imminent, and thus we ask for a response to these questions by June 10, 2022. Thank you for your service to our country and your attention to this important matter.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/boozman-pressures-garland-demands-answers-from-doj-on-efforts-to-protect-pro-life-groups-from-violence"

https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/la-petite-roche-anniversary-putting-little-rock-on-the-map,"In 1722, when French explorer Jean-Baptiste Bernard de La Harpe and his crew were exploring by way of the Arkansas River, they came upon what they called “La Petite Roche” or “The Little Rock” on the south bank of the river. This “little rock” became a landmark for travelers and gave The Natural State the name for its future capital city. Now, 300 years later, we are celebrating this discovery and the important place Little Rock occupies in our state’s history and culture. As the capital of Arkansas, Little Rock is an important symbol as well as home to numerous businesses and attractions that bring people from all across the state, country and world. I was honored to highlight this unique piece of our past that has linked our state with France for centuries during a recent visit with French Ambassador to the U.S. Philippe Etienne.La Petite Roche’s 300th anniversary is a special time to welcome Ambassador Etienne to Arkansas. In celebration of Little Rock’s long and proud history, the thriving community it is today and its bright future, the La Petite Roche Tricentennial Task Force has organized fitting tributes to mark this milestone. We continue to build on this connection centuries later with investments in Arkansas’s workforce. Several French-owned firms have located in our state including Dassault Falcon and L’Oréal. The ambassador and I visited these companies which serve to demonstrate our strong ties today and opportunities for the future.These businesses, and other French-owned operations, have created 6,300 well-paying jobs in The Natural State. Arkansas is a great example of how our nation’s longtime friendship with France is mutually beneficial. Direct employment in Arkansas is far from the only way our alliance supports job creation in our communities. Many more jobs are maintained through trade between our two nations.Our economic relationship creates close to 1.3 million jobs in France and the U.S. with two-thirds of those located in America.It’s critical that we continue to nurture our bond so we can attract additional investment.While this relationship allows American businesses—both large and small—to compete in today’s global marketplace, maintaining a strong relationship with France provides more than just economic rewards. This partnership reinforces our shared common values, bolstering our resolve and confidence as we stand side-by-side on the global stage and work to mutually keep each other safe. I am pleased to continue promoting our friendship, strengthening our ties and highlighting our unique relationship and history.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/la-petite-roche-anniversary-putting-little-rock-on-the-map"

For more than 45 years, the Hyde Amendment has ensured that taxpayer dollars are not used to fund abortions, saving the lives of nearly 2.5 million preborn children. As you know, the Hyde Amendment is supported by both a substantial majority of the American public and a bipartisan majority of sitting United States Senators, and was most recently signed into law by President Biden in Public Law 117-103,” the senators wrote. “On February 5, 2021, we wrote to you that ‘[w]e are committed to vote against the advancement of any legislation that would eliminate or weaken the Hyde Amendment or any other current-law pro-life protections, or otherwise undermine existing Federal pro-life policy.’ We firmly renew this commitment for FY 2023,” they continued. “We urge you to start where we finished by making a baseline commitment to maintain the same pro-life protections that were included in Public Law 117-103, and to eschew any taxpayer-funded giveaways that benefit the multi-billion-dollar abortion industry,” concluded the lawmakers.Read the full letter here. This letter is supported by Susan B.

https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/honoring-fallen-heroes,"Arkansas native Brady Prewitt was recently laid to rest at his family’s plot in Sharp County. His return to The Natural State was a long time coming. The Navy Seaman 2nd Class was serving on the USS Oklahoma when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.His remains were interred with other unidentified crew members at the National Member Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii until they were exhumed for forensic analysis in 2015. With the help of DNA testing, he was identified in 2019 and has finally been reunited with his loved ones after more than 80 years. Prewitt’s cousin called his homecoming “very special.” Honoring our fallen heroes and continuously working to ensure they return home is part of our nation’s commitment. As we commemorate Memorial Day, we pay tribute to selfless and courageous individuals like him who have made the ultimate sacrifice.This is a humble reminder that our freedom is a privilege fought for and earned by brave men and women protecting the promise of our country and future generations of Americans. They have put others before themselves because they believed in what our country stands for and the beacon of light it represents worldwide.Arkansas can be proud of the heroes from our state called to serve in uniform. My thoughts and prayers are with those from our state who laid down their lives, as well as their families whose support and understanding of the soldier’s call to duty is one reason we enjoy the freedoms we do today. Just as importantly, we must always care for the loved ones these heroes left behind. That’s why we need to modernize benefits for surviving family members. I’m proud to champion the Caring for Survivors Act of 2021 so we can continue to honor the promise we made to servicemembers and their loved ones. This legislation adjusts the earned monthly benefits provided to survivors of servicemembers who die in the line of duty in line with payments to surviving spouses of other federal employees, allowing us to better care for the loved ones of troops who have made the ultimate sacrifice.While I’m committed to improving policies supporting families who have lost a loved one in service to our country and upholding their legacies, I’m pleased to see how these heroes continue to be an inspiration for Arkansans.The Northwest Arkansas veteran-serving nonprofit Bo’s Blessings regularly organizes volunteers to clean headstones at the Fayetteville National Cemetery. This labor of love is a simple yet meaningful way to honor the memories of the men and women who defended our freedoms and way of life. I was proud to participate recently to show my appreciation for those who wore our nation’s uniform and are laid to rest on that hallowed ground.May God Bless every man and woman we’ve lost in battle as they fought in defense of our ideals. Let us honor the willingness of all troops called to serve in our nation’s uniform and always remember the brave individuals who have given everything for us to be the greatest, freest nation in the world.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/honoring-fallen-heroes"

Flexibilities have been provided in the past with success, so at a time like this when we’re facing food security challenges, it’s necessary to use every tool in the toolbox to allow more acres of land to return to food production,” Boozman said. Boozman first urged USDA to take action to expand these flexibilities in March in a letter to USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack. In column earlier this month, he urged the Biden administration to grant this authority for American producers to aid those in need. As the war in Ukraine persists and food supply remains a significant concern, the senator has continued to pressure USDA for an update to its CRP policy.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/following-push-by-boozman-usda-expands-flexibilities-to-empower-american-producers-to-address-global-food-crisis"

I’m honored to serve as a voice for veterans and will continue to craft and advance measures in support of their needs.”Last week, Congress advanced Boozman-led bills that are expected to be signed into law including:Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/icymi-boozman-delivers-legislative-victories-to-improve-veterans-benefits-and-services"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/delivering-improved-benefits-and-services-for-veterans,"As a senior member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I’ve been blessed to play an active role in updating Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) policies including expanding access to health care, improving suicide prevention efforts and eliminating barriers for women veterans to receive VA care and services. I’m continuing that commitment to the men and women who served in uniform. In recent days, the House of Representatives approved a trio of legislative initiatives I championed that are now headed to the president’s desk to be signed into law.  With two of these bills modernizing breast cancer screening policies and providing the delivery of lifesaving care for women veterans, these significant legislative developments signal a major win for women veterans.  Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women. For women veterans and servicemembers, the incidence of breast cancer is estimated to be up to 40 percent higher than the general population. Given the dangerous environments in which military members serve and additional risk factors associated with these locations, it’s long overdue for the VA to update its policies for administering mammograms. We know early detection is crucial to preventing and treating breast cancer, so making sure those who are more vulnerable receive screenings at a younger age is not only reasonable, but critical. Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas was unaware of the increased risk she faced as a result of her deployment to Iraq. That’s why she was surprised to hear her doctor’s recommendation to undergo a mammogram at age 38. That exam subsequently led to her diagnosis of stage 4 breast cancer.  She spent her final years fighting to modernize VA’s policies so other veterans don’t experience the same struggles. Sadly, she passed away before realizing her dream of passage of legislation to accomplish this. We honored her activism with the Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas Supporting Expanded Review for Veterans in Combat Environments (SERVICE) Act. It will broaden veterans’ access to mammograms and also require the VA to compile data regarding the rates of breast cancer among members of the veteran and the civilian populations so we can continue improving procedures to better treat breast cancer patients. We can be proud Congress unanimously advanced this bill. This was just one critical proposal to help advance breast health. Congress is also sending the Making Advances in Mammography and Medical Options (MAMMO) for Veterans Act to the president’s desk to expand access to high-quality breast cancer screenings, improve imaging services in rural areas and allow clinical trials through partnerships with the National Cancer Institute.  The VA is uniquely positioned to be a leader in the prevention and treatment of breast cancer. Taking full advantage of the department’s unique capabilities, resources and outreach will help deliver the lifesaving care veterans deserve.Additionally, Congress expanded the VA watchdog authority strengthening VA oversight by advancing the Strengthening Oversight for Veterans Act of 2021, an initiative to provide the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) the authority to subpoena testimony from former VA employees who have left federal service and others relevant to its inspections, reviews and investigations. Empowering the OIG with this ability will help ensure accountability and transparency.  It is unique for a senator to have several bills sent to the president’s desk to be signed into law in the same week. I’m pleased Congress has prioritized the needs of veterans with broad support of the measures I’ve championed. My colleagues and I will continue working to improve the services our former servicemembers have earned and urge the president to quickly sign these into law.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/delivering-improved-benefits-and-services-for-veterans"

As we find ourselves at the end of another school year, I’m proud of the hard work by students across Arkansas as they take the next steps in their lives and find their place in our rapidly changing world. Throughout this year I enjoyed visiting many schools and colleges, working with high school students on my Congressional Youth Cabinet, meeting with young people eager to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces, and celebrating students as they commit to jobs with great local companies. At each occasion I was inspired by the positive spirit and determination of these young Arkansans.Of course, it is impossible to talk about the students graduating this year, whether high school or college, without acknowledging the tremendous upheaval of the last two years. They have tackled historic challenges demonstrating incredible perseverance while gathering accomplishments and invaluable experience. I am also excited that after two years of altered and delayed celebrations, graduates are once-again enjoying traditions with family and friends to mark this milestone in their lives.I look forward to seeing what this unique generation adds to the story of our nation. And, in the meantime, they have a lot to celebrate so we join them in reveling in this special moment before they begin their next chapters.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/congratulations-to-the-class-of-2022"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/boozman-backed-bill-to-address-baby-formula-shortage-headed-to-president-s-desk,"WASHINGTON—Congress passed bipartisan legislation Thursday to ensure families have access to formula to feed their babies. The Access to Baby Formula Act introduced by U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR), ranking member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, and Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) was unanimously approved in the Senate. Companion legislation overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives. The legislation will now head to the president’s desk to be signed into law. “Moms and dads in the most prosperous country on earth should never have to worry about their ability to obtain something as vital as baby formula. This legislation will benefit every American family by ensuring formula manufacturers and regulators are always prepared to respond to any shortages or supply disruptions and by providing more flexibilities to USDA and states in helping parents meet their children’s nutritional needs,” Boozman said on the Senate floor.The Access to Baby Formula Act gives the USDA the authority to be more flexible during a crisis such as a natural disaster, public health emergency, recall or shortage like our country faces currently. This flexibility would ensure the brand or type of formula families can buy isn’t restricted by nutrition program rules, allowing families to purchase whatever is available in the store. In addition, the legislation would require baby formula manufacturers to have a plan in place to respond to shortages. Boozman also joined nearly two dozen Republican colleagues in demanding answers from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding its inadequate investigation into Abbott Nutrition’s Michigan manufacturing facility and failure to mitigate the nationwide baby formula shortage. The senators are seeking answers regarding the time at which the White House was made aware of the dire situation and the steps available to limit the harmful impact on families and their newborns. “Infant formula supplies at local grocery stores were relatively stable for the first half of 2021. The out-of-stock percentage started to climb steadily in the later half and continued to worsen throughout this year. It’s concerning that FDA and key officials in the Administration did not anticipate this crisis or take action within days following Abbott Nutrition’s voluntary recall considering the company holds 48.1 percent of the U.S. market in infant formula. Families are getting to the brink of pursuing unsafe and potentially dangerous options to feed their infants including homemade infant formula. And physicians are, once again, running defense on misinformation due to a lack of federal action to get the word out on safe alternatives,” the senators wrote.Boozman joined U.S. Senators Roger Marshall (R-KS), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Susan Collins (R-ME), Mike Braun (R-IN), John Barrasso (R-WY), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Tim Scott (R-SC), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), John Thune (R-SD), James Lankford (R-OK), Steve Daines (R-MT), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Roy Blunt (R-MO) and John Kennedy (R-LA) in signing the letter.

When you go to the pump and fill your car up, and it’s over $100 now, that truly is a crisis. And rarely do you have crises where the answer is staring you in the face…We need to drill more, we need the permitting process to be relaxed instead of strengthened – like they’re doing right now. Also, we need to make it such that the pipelines are allowed to operate the way they should. Increased supply is going to decrease costs. That’s just a simple truth.” Boozman on the Biden administration and Congressional Democrats shifting blame: “They want to blame everybody but themselves. The other issue that’s going on right now is that diesel is up $2 a gallon…Everything we use is trucked in or railed in, using diesel. That is dramatically increasing the price of everything. I’m very active in the farm community. Fertilizer costs are up dramatically because of natural gas. All of this is just snow balling, and as a result, what you’re doing is you’re taking away Americans’ disposable income. They don’t have money to buy other things because they’re having to buy the necessities that cost so, so much more than they used to.”

The Physicians for Underserved Areas Act would update the Graduate Medical Education (GME) slot process following a hospital closure by directing federally-funded medical residency slots to areas where doctors are most needed. “In rural states like Arkansas, the shortage of primary care physicians and specialty doctors creates a health care delivery challenge. The Physicians for Underserved Areas Act is part of the solution to bridge this gap and encourage more medical school graduates to practice in rural areas. I’m pleased to continue advancing proposals to ensure all Americans, no matter where they live, get the care they need,” Boozman said.“Nevada currently ranks 48th in the nation when it comes to primary care physicians per capita, and this shortage has had a dire impact on Nevadans’ ability to seek health care,” Rosen said. “This bipartisan legislation will help add to the number of medical residency slots available for Nevada hospitals and encourage more doctors to come practice in our state, including in communities which previously have been underserved.”“The physician shortage continues to be a significant problem across the nation but it’s especially alarming in rural states like Arkansas,” said Cam Patterson, M.D., MBA, chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) and CEO of UAMS Health. “More than two-thirds of the 75 counties in our state include federally designated Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Areas. Primary care physician shortages are expected to increase substantially as our state’s population continues to age and require more medical care, and as more seek primary care services. We are extremely grateful to Sen. Boozman and Sen. Rosen for their introduction of the Physicians for Underserved Areas Act. Sen. Boozman has been a longtime champion of Graduate Medical Education, working closely with UAMS toward our common goal of ensuring that all Arkansans, no matter where they live, have access to health care. The addition of residency positions where they are needed most will improve the chances for physicians to stay in Arkansas after completing residency because data show that physicians are more likely to practice within 50 miles of their final residency training.” The Physicians for Underserved Areas Act would:This legislation continues Boozman’s commitment to addressing the growing shortage of primary and specialty care physicians in Arkansas. In February, Boozman and Rosen teamed up to introduce the Resident Education Deferred Interest (REDI) Act to help ease the financial burden on medical and dental students. Last year, the senator introduced the Physician Shortage Reduction Act of 2021, legislation to significantly increase Medicare-supported doctor training slots. That followed efforts during the 116th Congress to gradually lift the caps on Medicare-supported doctor training slots. Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/boozman-continues-leadership-in-addressing-arkansas-physician-shortage"
https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/boozman-legislation-heading-to-president-s-desk-to-be-signed-into-law,"WASHINGTON - A pair of legislative initiatives championed by U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) to modernize Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) breast cancer screening policies and the delivery of lifesaving care for women veterans unanimously passed the U.S. House of Representatives late Wednesday and are headed to the president’s desk to be signed into law.“We are now one signature away from ensuring veterans have access to lifesaving breast cancer screenings. I urge the president to quickly approve these bills and make them law so we can expand VA tools and resources to deliver the preventative care and treatments these valiant, dedicated former servicemembers have earned,” said Boozman, a senior member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee. The Boozman-authored Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas Supporting Expanded Review for Veterans in Combat Environments (SERVICE) Act will require the VA to conduct mammograms for all women who served in areas associated with burn pits and other toxic exposures regardless of age, symptoms or family history. The legislation is named in honor of Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas, a Marine veteran and public health professional who was unaware of her increased risk for breast cancer as a result of her deployment to Iraq. During a routine medical exam in 2018 she was advised to undergo a mammogram and was subsequently diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer at the age of 38. Dr. Thomas fought for passage of this bill until she sadly passed away last month. The bipartisan bill was introduced by Boozman and Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR).The Making Advances in Mammography and Medical Options (MAMMO) for Veterans Act, which Boozman led, will require the VA to develop a strategic plan to improve breast imaging services, create a telemammography pilot program for veterans in areas where the VA does not offer in-house mammography and expand veterans’ access to clinical trials through partnerships with the National Cancer Institute. The legislation would also require the VA to upgrade all in-house breast imaging to 3D mammography, which is considered the gold standard of imaging technology. Boozman worked with Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Jon Tester (D-MT) to introduce the legislation along with Senators Mazie Hirono (D-HI) and Susan Collins (R-ME).The senator delivered remarks applauding Senate passage of both proposals in March.  These legislative accomplishments come on the heels of House passage of the Strengthening Oversight for Veterans Act of 2021. The Boozman-led bill expanding oversight authority of the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) was approved on Tuesday and is expected to be signed into law.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/boozman-legislation-heading-to-president-s-desk-to-be-signed-into-law"

The legislation now heads to the president’s desk to be signed into law. The Strengthening Oversight for Veterans Act of 2021 will provide the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) with the authority to subpoena testimony from former VA employees who have left federal service, former contractor personnel who performed work for the department, or other potentially relevant individuals during its inspections, reviews and investigations. “Expanding the VA OIG’s authority to conduct more thorough investigations will help ensure accountability,” Boozman said. “Support by Congress for this proposal demonstrates the consensus of providing additional oversight tools to improve transparency. I urge the president to quickly sign this bill into law so we can deliver the high-quality care veterans deserve.”The legislation passed the Senate last month. The bipartisan bill was introduced by Boozman, a senior member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Committee Chairman Jon Tester (D-MT) and Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV). Under current law, the VA OIG does not have testimonial subpoena authority to compel individuals relevant to investigations to answer questions in person and under oath. This can limit both the VA OIG and Congress’ ability to conduct complete and thorough reviews, including of VA health care and benefits programs, management actions and contracts. The legislation will expand the VA OIG’s authority to provide stronger oversight over the department.Last year, the VA OIG issued damning reports tied to the failures at the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks in Fayetteville and the Louis A. Johnson Veterans Medical Center in Clarksburg, West Virginia that resulted in the deaths of veterans in these facilities. The VA OIG has also identified additional investigations since 2017 where expanded subpoena authority would have assisted the independent watchdog in investigating patient safety, procurement and ethical conflicts of interest.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/boozman-backed-legislation-strengthening-va-oversight-heads-to-president-s-desk-to-be-signed-into-law"

The senators are also seeking information regarding the group’s role in developing and using the “Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases” (SC-GHG) to advance the administration’s environmental agenda.In light of increasing energy prices and inflation in the U.S., as well as the energy supply crisis in Europe as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the senators are again asking for certain Working Group documents, additional information on its activities and plans to use the SC-GHG. The administration has relied on an inflated SC-GHG figure to oppose the expansion of natural gas infrastructure and limit areas to be made available for energy production.“Over six months have passed since our letter, and you have neither acknowledged, nor responded, to our oversight request. The lack of responsiveness is at odds with the Administration’s commitment to transparency and its policy ‘to comply with Congressional requests for information to the fullest extent consistent with constitutional and statutory obligations of the Executive Branch’ which Department of Justice recently reaffirmed,” the members wrote.The letter is co-signed by Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Roger Wicker (R-MS), John Barrasso (R-WY), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Richard Burr (R-NC) and Rob Portman (R-OH). The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board noted the following on the social cost of greenhouse gases — “[t]he [Biden] Administration’s estimate captured all of the potential harm from carbon emissions globally over three centuries – yes, centuries. They threw in everything from property damage to health harms and war.”The full letter can be found here. BACKGROUND: In November 2021, Boozman and his Republican colleagues requested the Working Group provide its recommendations about planned use of the SC-GHG in federal decision making. Their letter was unacknowledged and unanswered.Permalink: https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/boozman-gop-committee-leaders-continue-to-call-out-biden-administration-s-lack-of-transparency-on-social-cost-of-greenhouse-gases"
